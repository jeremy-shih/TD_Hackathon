I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I will now turn the conference over to Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations. And I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer.","Thank you for joining us for our first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call and webcast. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","I also want to highlight for you that the quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings for our reportable segment is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website. These schedules have been updated to include the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and have been adjusted to align with recent changes in our segment reporting to align our financial reporting with how management now views the business. Most notably, effective this quarter, we are now allocating stock-based compensation to the segments and have made some changes to the allocation methodology for certain corporate level allocations. Accordingly, prior periods presented have been restated and our segment guidance reflects the impact of these changes.","Before Carlos begins, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current excitations.","Now, let me turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. This morning, we reported our first quarter fiscal 2017 results, with revenue up 7% to $2.9 billion, despite 1 percentage point of combined pressure from foreign currency translation and the impact of the sale of the AdvancedMD business at the end of our fiscal 2016 first quarter. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which was in line with our expectations. And we continue to see the benefits from our recent new business bookings helping to drive growth in the quarter.","In addition to this solid revenue growth, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 26% to $0.86 per share. Overall, our earnings growth exceeded our expectations this quarter and we are very pleased with our results. There were a number of contributing factors to our strong earnings performance. Jan will walk through these shortly.","On the new business bookings front, during the quarter, we were flat compared to the first quarter of 2016, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast 4% to 6% bookings growth for the year.","I want to remind you of the tailwinds we experienced in fiscal 2016 from the sale of additional modules related to the Affordable Care Act. Our anticipated fiscal 2017 performance, if achieved, would lead to a three-year compounded annual growth rate of 9%, which remains in line with our long-term new business bookings guidance of 8% to 10%.","Overall, our revenue growth was solid this quarter. And while we do not expect all of the margin expansion we saw this quarter to continue through the remainder of the year, we are pleased with our overall results.","Before I continue, I wanted to share a little more insight regarding retention. During the quarter, we experienced a decline in retention of 100 basis points, which was due to the loss of a contract pertaining to our CHSA business, which we announced today has been sold to WageWorks. Excluding the impact of this single client loss, retention would have been flat in the quarter.","We continue to see the benefits of our efforts to upgrade clients to the most appropriate strategic cloud-based platforms. These upgrade efforts remain on track and progressed nicely during the quarter.","As I just mentioned, today, we announced that WageWorks was acquiring two non-strategic ADP businesses; namely, our CHSA and COBRA businesses, for $235 million. In selling to a top-tier provider in these markets, we believe this agreement will truly unlock the potential of these businesses, while allowing us to sharpen our focus on ADP's core benefits administration offering.","In conjunction with these dispositions, ADP entered into a partnership with WageWorks that will allow us to continue offering their COBRA and CHSA solutions to ADP clients in an integrated fashion. This is a great example of ADP continuing to build an ecosystem of complementary services that allow clients to extend the value of their core ADP Human Capital Management solutions.","Last quarter, we shared details of our Service Alignment Initiative, which is part of our strategy to simplify the service organization by aligning ADP service operations to our strategic platforms. In addition to improving the client service experience, this initiative is expected to enhance ADP's service capabilities and contribute to operating efficiencies over the long-term.","We are pleased with the progress we are making at our new strategic locations in Maitland, Florida, and Norfolk, Virginia. Efforts to staff and operate from these locations have commenced and are proceeding according to plan. We will soon announce the location of our third new site in the Western part of the U.S., which we anticipate being operational toward the latter part of this fiscal year.","Our results this quarter reflect the strength of our business model and give us momentum as we stay focused on delivering an outstanding client experience through great service and innovative solutions, many of which are receiving a wealth of external recognition. Recently, we shared that ADP was named a Leader in Payroll Business Process Outsourcing by Gartner for the fifth consecutive year. Gartner's study analyzed vendors across all regions, employer sizes and service delivery models, evaluating both their ability to execute and completeness of vision.","In naming ADP a Leader, Gartner recognized us for combining a clear view of the markets' direction and a deep understanding of client needs with the capabilities and expertise to deliver against them. Payroll outsourcing is core to who we are and is part of delivering outstanding HCM solutions. We are extremely proud of the sustained recognition for our leadership in this area.","Today, ADP is delivering HCM solutions to more than 650,000 clients and 39 million employees worldwide. These data points are important for a number of reasons. They clearly demonstrate our unique reach and marketplace success over a sustained period of time. But they also represent a unique differentiator for ADP. The scale and the data that this client base represents allows us to deliver a suite of new capabilities that we believe hold the potential to transform the strategic value of the HR function. Because we pay one in six workers in the U.S., we are in the unique position to deliver advanced analytics capabilities that can help clients address workforce productivity, talent development, and retention.","Leveraging this data, we introduced the ADP DataCloud to allow business leaders and HR professionals to generate actionable insights from the workforce data embedded in their ADP HCM solutions. And today, more than 3,200 clients are using our analytics platform.","About a year ago, we introduced benchmarking to this platform. The benchmarking capability provides users with a unique competitive advantage by delivering insight from actual live data to help clients evaluate their workforce against other companies in their market space.","Our benchmarking capability puts key industry workforce metrics at our clients' fingertips, avoiding the inherent time lag or inaccuracy associated with salary and other types of survey-based data. A few weeks ago, at the HR Technology Conference in Chicago, we received two distinctive recognitions for our DataCloud benchmarking capability. At the show, HR Executive Magazine named this one of its Top Products for 2016 and recognized it as one of the year's Awesome New Technologies for HR.","I should note, this is the second year in a row that we've received these distinguished awards. We received them both last year for the ADP Marketplace, the first and largest HCM app ecosystem in the market.","I've said before that innovation is a job that's never done, but we are proud of the progress to-date and the external recognition we are receiving. We believe that innovations like these and the investments we are making to simplify our portfolio are essential to our long-term success.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for further review of our first quarter results.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we recorded a restructuring charge of about $40 million related to our Service Alignment Initiative. Certain non-GAAP measures in my commentary to follow exclude the impact of this charge as well as certain other one-time items recognized in the prior fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","Before I begin reviewing this quarter's results, I wanted to highlight some additional detail regarding the disposition of our COBRA and CHSA businesses. We currently expect the sale to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 for a pre-tax gain of approximately $200 million, subject to normal and customary closing conditions. The results of operations of these two businesses are currently included in the Employer Services segment and will not be reflected as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, we have factored the operational impacts from these dispositions into our updated fiscal year 2017 outlook.","As Carlos mentioned, ADP revenues grew 7% in the quarter to $2.9 billion, or 8% on a constant dollar basis. On a reported basis, net earnings grew 10% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, grew 21% or 20% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin increased about 230 basis points compared to the 17.6% in the last year's first quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and a slower growth in our selling expenses.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 26% to $0.86 and 26% on a constant dollar basis, and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. Our adjusted effective tax rate was positively impacted following the adoption of a new stock compensation related accounting pronouncement in our first quarter, which helped drive a decrease of our adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 290 basis points to 30.8% or $0.03 on an EPS basis for the quarter.","As you read this morning's press release, new business bookings growth was flat for the quarter, but in line with our own expectations following two years of successive double-digit growth with meaningful contributions from Human Capital Management modules that assist clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act.","Overall, our results in the quarter were very good, yielding solid revenue growth with a better-than-expected margin growth. Although we still have a lot of work ahead of us, I'm also pleased with the progress to-date on our Service Alignment Initiative.","In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 6% for the quarter and 6% on a constant dollar basis. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.7% in the first quarter. Average client fund balances grew 4% compared to a year ago and 4% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions of net new business and increased wage levels compared to the prior year's first quarter.","Outside the U.S., we continue to see solid revenue growth and margin growth, driven largely by the success of our multi-national solutions, which continue to perform well. Employer Services margin increased about 230 basis points in the quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and a slower growth in our selling expenses following on from the difficult selling compare in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.","The PEO continues to perform well, growing revenues by 13% in the quarter with average worksite employees growing 13% to 439,000 employees. A portion of the 13% revenue growth was impacted by slower growth in our benefit pass-through costs resulting from lower healthcare renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation from our worksite employees during the quarter. Along with this revenue growth, the PEO delivered approximately 90 basis points of margin expansion this quarter through increased operating efficiencies.","Both of our segments performed well in the quarter and, as Carlos mentioned, we are off to a good start, but we also see a mix of factors that impact our fiscal year 2017 outlook. And I will now take a moment to walk you through our revised outlook with you.","First, as I mentioned, our new business bookings growth in the quarter was in line with our plans coming off a difficult compare in the prior-year first quarter. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 4% to 6% growth on the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We are reaffirming our ES revenue guidance of 4% to 5% and maintaining our PEO revenue guidance at 14% to 16%. With the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, which were included for the full fiscal year 2016 but expected to be only in our results for about the first half of fiscal year 2017, we have reduced our revenue expectations for the year by almost 1 percentage point.","As a result, we are now forecasting revenue growth of 7% to 8% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 9%, which is not expected to be significantly impacted by foreign currency translation based on our current rates.","As a reminder, during the first half of fiscal 2016, we made certain investments to support our business through the ACA onboarding process, while also continuing to invest in our sales force to leverage the strong tailwinds from the sales of Human Capital Management modules that assist clients in complying with the ACA. And we are seeing the benefits of these investments help drive our margin expansion this quarter.","I want to caution you, though, against assuming that this momentum will carry through the remainder of our fiscal year, as we begin to lap these easier compares while continuing to execute on various strategic initiatives, including our client upgrade efforts, investing in innovation and making selected additional service investments.","On a segment level, we, therefore, continue to anticipate margin expansion in ES of about 50 basis points. And we are now forecasting about 75 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO.","On a consolidated basis, we have revised our adjusted EBIT margin expansion to about 50 basis points from our previous guidance of 25 to 50 basis points. Please also note that this margin expansion continues to include about 20 basis points of pressure from a dual operation pertaining to our Service Alignment Initiative.","We are also now expecting growth in our client fund interest revenue to increase $5 million to $10 million compared with our prior forecasted increase of up to $5 million. The total impact from the client fund extended investment strategy is now expected to be up $5 million compared to the prior forecast of flat growth. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","With the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, we now expect growth in our adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13% compared with the $3.26 in fiscal year 2016, aided by about 1% from the first quarter tax benefit related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, which is offset by about 1 percentage points of earnings impact from the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses. On a constant dollar basis, our adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be 11% to 13%.","Our forecast continues to contemplate the return of excess cash to shareholders, with share repurchases of $1 billion to $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2017. And this includes any repurchases required to offset any dilution related to employee benefit plans. We believe the adjustments we have made to our fiscal year 2017 forecast reflect the impact of our planned investment, particular through the year-end process as we work to grow our strong fiscal year 2016 sales performance and execute against our strategic initiatives.","So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will take our first question from the line of Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. You line is open.","Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just the first one just to confirm the guidance impact on the top-line, confirming that the divestitures of the CHSA and the COBRA businesses is responsible for the change in the revenue outlook, and then also confirming that I heard it was a 1% or so earnings impact from that divestiture as well.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","You're correct. That is the case. If you take it digitally, there's actually a good uptake (19:58) on both ends, the full percentage off (20:01) our guidance clearly just on the top end. So we clearly had a good revenue performance in the first quarter already.","Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And that's the only change to the revenue outlook is from that divestiture correct?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yes, that is true.","Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, just following up on the service delivery changes, I'm just wondering, maybe philosophically or as you guys have evolved your business and added a lot more of your technology in the strategic platforms, how has the value of service changed to you or to your clients? And sort of philosophically, how do you approach service now? Thank you.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think as you heard in my comments about the investments we've made in DataCloud and benchmarking, I think there is an evolution of the definition of service to really providing more expertise and more help in terms of analytics and how to run their businesses better. So some of the things that we traditionally have been strong on in service, I think still are a key part of our value proposition. So as an example, we have a very effective, very value-added tax business that helps clients with compliance, should they get notices from either Federal, state or local agencies regarding tax payments.","And so those are the types of services I think we remain committed to continuing to provide, but also to make better and enhance, but, obviously, with the evolution of technology and the evolution of the markets, I think there are opportunities for us to redefine service. And I think some of the Service Alignment Initiative, I think is intended to go exactly in that direction.","So another example I would give is, given the increased penetration of multiple HCM modules when clients purchase our products particularly in the mid-market or in the up-market, I think the integration of not only our products but of our service experience becomes very important then. So you're heard us talk about creating intact teams in some of these new strategic locations that I think is intended to support this evolution of this new service approach and new service model.","Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. Within the 20 basis points, the full-year margin headwind related to the dual running cost, as you move to your new integrated service delivery centers, how much was in the first quarter and when do you expect the crossover between increased productivity from the new centers to overcome those frictional costs? Is that a second half event or more likely in fiscal year 2018?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, I would say that, given that we're in the process of ramping up, it's safe to say that there was some dual operations cost in the first quarter, but it's likely to be more concentrated later in the year in the second half. So I think you have that right. Probably 40%, I would allocate it just for sake of modeling, to 40%-60%, so 40% maybe first half, 60% second half, but overall, 20 basis points for the year. And again, as Jan pointed out, just because of the way the accounting rules work, that is built into our operating expense versus the restructuring costs that were really more intended for things like severance and facilities closure that were directly related to the restructuring and that are non-GAAP.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then, are you seeing any additional interest in time and attendance offerings, given the Department of Labor's changes to the overtime regulations, which go into place this December?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We are. As we were going through the materials for the earnings call, we get a lot of detail by market segment and also by product. And we have seen better sales and more interest in our Time and Attendance products. I think that the challenge for us is scale. Given the size of our sales number, we sold $1.75 billion last year. We're expecting to grow 4% to 6% this year. It just doesn't have the same scale and magnitude of, as an example, ACA.","So for us to really to achieve our sales results, we have to have across-the-board strength in our sales excluding ACA and excluding our Time and Attendance products. So I guess the long and short of it is yes, it helped, but it wasn't material in the grand scheme of things. And the deadline is approaching so it's likely that we will continue.","Like a lot of these changes in regulations and complexity, no different than ACA, we expect it to continue to help with sales and help drive demand for our products, even after the deadline, which I believe is in December of this year. But it just doesn't feel like it's having the same magnitude and same kind of scale impact that we had with ACA. And part that might be that the ACA rules were really deadline-driven, and there was a form that needed to be filled out and filed.","In this case, these are just changes in rules. And so, it's a slightly different decision for clients and prospects around \u2013 in some cases, if they go six months without the right tools to be able to manage the new environment, there's really no consequences other than the risk of a potential investigation or fine or whatnot, which is obviously a real risk, but it's just different from a deadline-driven event like ACA.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Please go ahead.","David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.","Thank you. Carlos, can ask you just a quick question on mechanics? The bookings comparisons last year are pretty difficult until the fourth quarter. So given that, how should we think of that 4% to 6% bookings target building as this year progresses, given those comparison?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I appreciate that question. And I think you may have answered the question yourself. So we expect the comparisons to get easier in the second half and hence, mathematically, the growth rates should be easier to achieve in getting to our overall 4% to 6% for the year. And I think just by way of comparison, we went back and looked historically, outside, of course, times where we had recessions and other economic challenges, but in Q1 of 2014, we had 1% sales growth, and that was following on Q1 of 2013 15% growth.","And so the scenario this quarter was we had flat growth over last year's first quarter of around 14% sales growth. And so I think that when you look at kind of just the size and the scale of these numbers and you look at the way we laid out our forecast for the year, then I think that you can probably deduce that the second half, we expect, mathematically, to be stronger from a growth rate standpoint than the first half.","I also just want to hasten to add that we have the same kind of issue in the second quarter, where we had sequential increase last year's second quarter, the 15%. So we had, I think it was 13% to 14% growth in the first quarter, and then we had 15% in the second quarter. So we will have another difficult compare, and I think it would be in line with our expectations to have similar sales results from a growth standpoint for the second quarter.","David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.","Okay. And it looks like you were at 13% in the third quarter. So it sounds like it's pretty back-end loaded to the fourth quarter then?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","That would be right, but, again, we have more information internally around what portion of each of those three quarters was ACA-related versus other. And I would say that you're generally correct, but that we would expect the third quarter to have slightly better. Again, we try to stay away from \u2013 I don't want to fall into the trap of giving quarterly guidance. You're generally right.","David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.","Right. And then, maybe I could just ask you a little bit more about you made some brief comments about the migrations in the mid-markets and how that's going in retentions. So given that retention was declining all of last year and you said it was flat when you back out the CVB (28:42) loss of the customer in the quarter, so does that really imply, given that you were losing throughout the year last year that, in fact, that business started stabilizing even before this quarter? And how, just in general, are you thinking about retention in the kind of residual base who still has not converted thus far?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Sure. I appreciate the question. So the businesses that we've had some challenges with last year, which I think we were clear that was concentrated in the mid-market, have shown, I think, improvement for several quarters, including this quarter. But, as you know, like, we have a number of different businesses. We're a global company. We have down-market, mid-market, up-market, multi-nationals. Some of our businesses are also lumpy, particularly our up-market businesses and our BPO businesses.","And so we feel good about the progress we've made where we made the investments to stabilize and the investments we made in service. As you know, we're making some longer-term investments in terms of some of these new locations, but that's a longer term. We did a lot of short-term things to stabilize and improve and we've seen results from that.","But, again, sometimes, retention can be uneven, just because of the lumpiness and just the way the math works, but we feel pretty good about where we are. We believe that we are on a good trajectory here in terms of continuing to do migrations and upgrades, which allows us to stay on track for what our objectives are without putting additional incremental pressure on retention.","This is now probably the second quarter where we've gone back and started our upgrades at a, I would call, normal reasonable pace, and we've been able to continue to make improvements in our mid-market retention rate. So that tells me that part of the issue was related to the upgrades themselves, but it was also related to just service challenges, pressure from ACA just because of volumes of work and a couple of other factors.","So we believe we've done the right things. And we feel like we're on the right track and we're also sticking to our plans around our migrations and our upgrades of our clients. So I think it just strengthens us competitively over the long-term.","David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.","Great. Thanks very much for that color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Following up on the comments on margins you made earlier, I noted the discussion about lower benefit pass-through costs in the current quarter, but the PEO margins were, I think, a record at 13.5%. Could you maybe talk about whether margins in that segment specifically are sustainable and how much that one-time benefit from the lower pass-through cost had a benefit to optical margin improvement in the quarter?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Jim, thank you for your question, and I will answer it directly to your PEO question, but also put the margin question in a little bit bigger picture because there's a lot going on on margin and really we had great margin expansion this first quarter, but we are trying to send a signal that that might not be continuing throughout the year. And the pass-through, actually, played a big role in it.","So to answer your first question directly, the operational scale that we saw in the PEO was solid. And with 90 basis points, clearly, that's ahead of our long-term kind of expectation, so we do see and want to make progress in the efficiencies, but it was probably a very good quarter for them and I would caution you to anticipate that type of level of productivity improvements in the long run. But clearly, all our businesses need to deliver scale when we're sticking with our own long-term expectations of driving the margin in the company of 50 basis points to 75 basis points.","Now, relative to the performance in this quarter, and you will be able to dissect this once you go through the Q a little bit more detail, but the pass-through pressure that we had this year because the PEO was growing actually faster than the overall company, was actually depressing ADP's margin by about 85 basis points. Now, the pass-through pressure is typically actually higher. And if you calculate it, it's between 150 basis points and 200 basis points of pressure, we call this a portfolio effect, a lower margin business of PEO is growing faster than ES. And this quarter, we were helped because that typical, that higher-margin pressure that the pass-throughs give us, abated due to that good renewal.","That renewal, we're expecting to grow out of it by the second half of the year. So that is going to be a big contributor to slower margin expansion for the second half of the year. You will also see that, and we mentioned it on our call, that we had a flat sales growth and it's longstanding tradition that if sales are growing slower, our marketing and sales expense is growing slower, so that contributed a chunk of scale that we anticipate clearly, per Carlos' discussion, just the prior question, to abate as we accelerate our sales in the second half of the year.","And then, the scaling of our ACA business plays an important role. Clearly, you are all aware that the revenue stream started really in the second half of the ACA business, while in the first half of last fiscal year 2016, we made implementation and operational investments to build the business. So we started to see the revenue contribution kick in and the pressure that the building of the ACA business exuded on the business in the first half of last fiscal year has abated. We are reaping the revenue and the business is profitable. And so, the scaling of the ACA business also had a meaningful impact on the margin expansion this quarter. And clearly, we expect that actually to abate also in the second half of the year because the business started to generate revenue in the second half of last fiscal year.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And I think just one other comment on the PEO, I don't remember the last time that our PEO worksite employee growth was the same as our revenue growth. And so that obviously, the very first point that Jan made, I think that helps. Obviously, mathematically, it makes it easier for the PEO to achieve greater margin improvement when they have slower pass-through cost growth. Having been in that business for many years, that slower pass-through growth is related to lower healthcare benefit renewals, which should be a very big positive from a competitive standpoint. So as you're hearing, seeing a lot of headlines about increasing health inflation and the discipline that our business has around selling and renewing clients, I think has, as of this last open enrollment for the PEO, led to very, very competitive renewal rates that are having this impact on the revenue growth, but it's a very, very big positive for that business.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful color. Thank you. And then, maybe just a quick clarification, the client loss in the CHSA business that drove the 100 basis point decline in retention was fairly substantial in terms of overall scale. Can you maybe just give us a little bit of color of whether that's a competitive takeaway and then specifically is that client a customer of ADP in terms of other service offerings? And what's the disposition on those other offerings, if any?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So fortunately, it's easy to talk about it because WageWorks, I think, is the company who won that account. And they won it \u2013 it was one of the factors in our decision to sell the business to them because we got to know each other as a result of them winning that contract, which was a government contract from the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, which is a government entity. As you know, we don't have a lot of public-sector government business. We have some. And we like that business, but we just don't have a lot of it. And we certainly don't have a lot of contracts of that size and that scale, with or without the government.","And so the original genesis of that account was, it came through an acquisition of a company called SHPS that we acquired several years back, where we acquired other benefits administration assets that we were interested in. And this account came with it. And with it, came the risk of, when these contracts get put out to bid, you don't always win. And so, we took a calculated risk when we made that acquisition, not just with this account, but like with all acquisitions, and that was one of the items that came along with that acquisition. I can't remember how many months ago it was, but I believe there was a public release by WageWorks regarding the winning of that account. And I think some people speculated that it had come from us. And we can now confirm that it did come from us.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning. Carlos, you've been talking about the data analytics opportunity and the value in that data you have, I guess really since the Investor Day at the beginning of last year. Can you give us a sense how you've, since then, progressed in terms of figuring out exactly how you will monetize the asset? Are you charging for this separately at the moment? Are you actively trying to sell that as a standalone offering? Or is it really more focused on an add into existing customers to help them see more value in ADP and hopefully improve retention?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","For now, we are selling it as an add-in. I think as I mentioned in my comments, we have 3,200 clients right now. That's obviously a very small number in comparison to the total client base that we have. So we think there's still a lot of opportunity. But we do like to leave our options open in terms of the \"monetization\", because the one thing it clearly does is it's a big differentiator for us. It's a huge way of creating thought leadership for ADP and, most importantly, it's an incredibly important way of driving value for our clients by helping them run their businesses better.","So we think there's a number of ways that we could benefit from this in terms of stronger sales, additional revenues as an add-on module, halo effect in terms of marketing and thought leadership. So I think it's a big winner on a number of fronts, as other analytics and data businesses are for other companies. We're not the only company taking advantage of when you have the scale and you have the data, being able to marshal that to create differentiation and value for clients, I think is a pretty common theme out in the marketplace right now.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, and is there sort of a product roadmap as to other analytics and ways to expand the usefulness of this? And I guess one things that jumps to mind as a potential risk, are there regulatory issues or concerns or hurdles you have to get over in terms of using data about consumers, as either part of the benchmarking or however else it's used in this? Thank you.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","It's a very good question. The answer to the first part of the question is, yes, we do have a roadmap and we have lots of plans and things that we can do to create more benchmarking solutions and more analytics for our clients. And obviously, we're not going to talk about those right now.","In terms of the second part, so we do have permission, if you will, to use the data from our clients. And, most importantly, the data is anonymized. And so this data, there is no personally identifiable information, and it's not necessary in order to create the benchmarkings and the analytics and the information that we deliver back to our clients.","And so I think we're very sensitive, obviously. If there's any company in the world that understands the value of privacy and sensitivity to security, I think it's ADP. And we've been very careful over the last several years to make sure that we have the right kinds of approvals and permissions from our clients, and also that we are anonymizing the information so that none of the information has things like Social Security Numbers or addresses or anything like that. And that's generally not necessary to perform some of the analytics that need to be performed.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then, just a quick follow-up on the accounting adoption of the new accounting for stock-comp taxes, did you expect in the guidance any impact on the rest of the year? And given the variability of that, do you have confidence in that outlook? Or is this something that could be a positive later in the year, but it's just hard for you to predict at this point? Thank you.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you for the question, because it is quite a big impact that we experienced as a tax benefit for this year. And we have taken the stand not to forecast the impact of the tax impact of our equity compensation cost for the future quarters, because it is dependent on our share price development, and it is also dependent on the employee behavior and executing mostly stock options. So our plan is every quarter, to let basically that tax benefit fall through to the bottom line, and we would update our guidance for the total EPS growth one-on-one as the tax benefit or the tax hurt is incurred.","We have done a historic analysis of our performance under these, so to speak, a pro forma backwards. And historically, we have experienced benefit out of those accounting rules, but there's no guarantee that that would continue in the future. And we found it too difficult to forecast. So we take it as falling through and you would get benefit one-on-one in each quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. On the Service Alignment Initiative, can you guys just talk a little bit about how you see the impact of that, both on driving ancillary revenue streams as you I guess move to a teamed selling model, or a teamed service model, long-term margin improvement and then also any potential disruption in the client relationships as you consolidate people back? Just what are the kind of the puts and takes and how do you see those playing out as you implement the new service alignment model?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think you did a very good job of describing some of the puts and takes in terms of some of the potential upsides and some of the risks. As you heard from our comments, we did build in what we're calling dual operations costs to avoid the last part that you mentioned, which is transition challenges, if you will. So we want to make sure that we have people trained and ready before we move work. But there's obviously always, you have to manage through that kind of transition risk as well. To be clear, we're not moving 90% of our associates. We're moving anywhere between 5% and 10% of our associates.","So over time, we expect that to have the kind of positive impacts we're talking about in terms of incremental revenue growth, improved service, et cetera, but this is not a one-time overnight, dramatic move that is intended to create an enormous amount of risk or, frankly, disruption for our associates, because we have a long history of treating our people right. We have highly tenured associates that have been very loyal to the company. And so we're being very, very careful and methodical on how we do this and how we communicate to our associates, so that we can move on with our business plans, but also treat people the right way. But having said all that, the idea, as we've said, I think, previously, is to, most importantly, deliver better integrated service through intact teams of multiple modules of HCM. And so the intention would be that there would be a benefit to retention.","We don't have a scientific way of forecasting that or telling you when that will happen. And it certainly is not expected to happen this year, because we're just in the process of getting these places all ramped up and scaled. And obviously, the effect of having better service, a better reputation and being able to cross-sell more easily, should have some impact on our ability to sell and on our revenue growth as well. But, again, those are hypotheticals that are very hard to forecast and we're certainly not building anything into our forecast for this year. But we're not doing it just to take risk. We're doing it because we see benefits in terms of operational efficiencies, potential retention and potential growth down the line.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I might add for our associates, also it offers, of course, a better ability to work in centers that have defined career pathing. They are located in areas of the U.S. that we believe give us great access to all associates. And so, it will create really also for us as an employer of choice, a great opportunity to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, as Jan was saying, associate engagement is an incredibly important part of our success and of any service business' success. And I think having large centers with anywhere between 2,000 and 3,000 associates that are able to progress in terms of their careers, move across business units, across different parts of HCM, I think should be a very big positive for us. But, again, that's a longer-term benefit for the company.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. And then, just as a quick follow up, can you give us an idea of \u2013 one thing you don't comment on very frequently is what the retention dynamics are within the PEO. On one hand, I know that the average client size there is smaller, so you're more likely to lose, just from companies going out of business. But on the other hand, I don't know why, once you join the PEO, why you ever leave.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","The PEO average client size is now slightly below 50, actually, so around 40, I believe. I'm looking at Christian, so about 40 employees, so it has ticked up a little bit. And I think this has been partially driven, of course, by the dynamic of the last few years where we added slightly larger clients to the PEO because it offers a great answer on compliance and probably partially a little bit aided by the dynamics of the Affordable Care Act. And I'm happy to report that the PEO exhibits great retention rates. And they have been actually improving over time. I'm looking at Christian. If (48:42) I say they did have record retention this quarter, so they're doing well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi, guys. Just noticed, Carlos, in your comments, you were talking about the strategic cloud platforms having a positive impact on your business. So I guess I was just curious of what percent you are complete migrating clients to these cloud platforms now?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Again, we do look at it by segment because you do have to be careful about units versus revenue, right, and two things are important. So if you at it based on units, we're almost 90% migrated, but that's mainly because we've moved all of our clients onto our RUN platform in the down markets. So from a revenue standpoint, we're a little bit less than half, I think, of the revenues for the company. So if you look at it by segment, we're done in the down market. I think we should be done by the end of this fiscal year. I think that's consistent with what we said in the past, that we're on track. And we're saying it now, that we're on track to have our mid-market clients on our WFN current version platform by the end of this fiscal year or within a month or two after that.","And then, when you move up into the up-market, we have migrated some clients over to Vantage. And we have plans underway to continue those migrations, but those are literally one at a time. Whereas, in the down-market and in RUN, there were just large groups of clients that we would migrate every week. In the up-market it's one at a time, talking to each client individually, creating a schedule and creating a path, but we have done migrations. And we will continue to do migrations in the up-market, but that will take considerably longer than what we did in our down-market business, which took us probably over the course of two years to three years to migrate all of those clients.","So we're very happy with the progress. We believe that when we migrate our clients, we create a more defensible, bigger moat against competition. We believe that it creates an opportunity for us to sell additional products and services. And we believe it strengthens our relationships with our clients. And most importantly, we think it's the right thing for our clients. So we're still on track and we're continuing to move ahead.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. No, I appreciate the update. And then, just as a follow-up, retention was down, I think, 1 point last year, in fiscal year 2016. If you ex out the divested acquisitions, does it make any difference to that retention number?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Too small to have an impact. The divestiture really has no impact one way or the other.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So it was kind of an unusual one-time client loss that caused this?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","This is a one large client loss. We typically don't have clients of this size. And we point it out because it is a non-strategic asset in the public space, so this is a very unique situation for us.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Again, this is disclosed in our 10-K and in our once-a-year. I don't believe we have another client that represents that size revenue for us.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks so much. Just a couple of quick questions, I noticed your cash flow from operations was fairly sizable, a nice increase on a year-over-year basis. Were there some timing issues going on either this year or last year? And how should we expect the quarters to kind of play out for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I am excited that we get a cash flow question. We rarely do get one. So your hint, you're already also giving the right answer. If you dig a little deeper into our operational cash flows, you'll see a cautious (52:32) swing in our accounts receivables on our balance sheet. And this is driven mostly due to accounts receivable change in the PEO business and that has rectified itself already. If you adjust for a number of one-time items in this, cash flows are expected to really grow in line with our operating results, so it could be these timing issues on accounts receivable here and there, but, in the long run, cash flows develop really very nicely in line with our operating performance.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. That's helpful. And I know some of the other business services and staffing-related companies have been talking about some client uncertainty in terms of making decisions. And I'm just curious if you've been seeing any of that.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I'm not sure how you measure that, so I think we know that, for example, in fiscal year 2011, when we had government shutdowns and so forth, like because this is \u2013 we hesitate to answer the question because we don't have any way of really measuring that. But intuitively, we know that large events do sometimes impact, particularly up-market decision-making. And so, is the election having some kind of impact? You'll have to stay tuned for our next quarter call, that we will be able to tell you, with the benefit of hindsight, whether or not we experienced some of that. So very hard to measure, but we have to acknowledge that large events and large uncertainties do sometimes create uncertainties in the market.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, I guess what they have been saying is that they've been seeing some delays in terms of new business sign-up and I thought maybe you'd seen some of that impact on your bookings, not necessarily just the tough comparisons versus last year.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Through the first quarter, the answer would be if you exclude \u2013 and again, this is also not scientifically easy to do, because we sold so much additional modules, not just ACA, but related to ACA, so Benefits Administration, et cetera. But if you look at our sales results and take a general swag, if you could somehow back out the ACA sales from last year, we had, I would say, good sales results for the quarter.","So I would say that through the first quarter, the answer would be we didn't see a lot of that, but I think you should not under-hear in my comments any level of confidence that there isn't that happening because large events like we saw with the 2011 and 2013, (55:10) there were couple of budget battles and a couple of issues around government shutdown and so forth, that it did seem that there were some kind of delays in terms of decision-making in the marketplace. But back then and today, we have no way of measuring that, other than anecdotal stories.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. I know it's a tough question to ask. So I appreciate you taking a stab at it. Thanks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just with regards to majors, how many more clients do you still have to transition and how would you characterize those clients as they're coming up along the tail-end? Are they more likely to go through a smooth transition or are they more inclined to be kind of the types that would take a look at other alternatives?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","It's a great question. And I think, as usual, the answer is I think it's mixed, in terms of we have a lot more experience, obviously, now in migrating clients and, particularly, the experience we developed last year when our volumes of upgrades almost doubled as we were trying to move clients over to the new platform in order to be able to give them the ACA product. That really created an enormous amount of learning opportunity for us in terms of how to do it better and how to do it at scale and what not to do around these upgrades, because they're intended to be a positive and to create a better experience and deliver a better product to the client. And so, I think on one side of the scale, you would say we have an enormous amount of body of knowledge now on how to do this better.","On the other side of the scale, human nature is such that \u2013 and no one consciously does this but \u2013 then when you go through these types of events, you realize, oh, it looks like we have some of the toughest ones waiting towards the end, because there may be clients, for example, that we approach and ask them to upgrade and they say, well, I don't want to do it now, call me in a quarter. And then, we are getting to the point now where we're going to have to migrate them or upgrade them. And so we probably have some of that as well. So I don't think there's an enormous amount of that.","It's not like we only have the hard ones left and the ones who didn't want to go, but just being realistic in the sense that \u2013 and also deferent to our associates who have still a lot of hard work ahead of them over the next three quarters or so, because it's not going to be easy getting across the finish line. But our volumes now are at a more manageable level, where I think we're doing a much higher quality job. So we feel good about our ability to do it, but your questions are, I think, fair. And I think the answer is the scales are balanced.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. I appreciate the answer. And then, with regards to Vantage, how well positioned is that now for like once you get through this and you're going through the next stage of transitions, do you feel good about that solution as it currently stands? I know you're always innovating, always optimizing. Is it matters of degree in terms of getting it to exactly where you want?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I mean, to put it in perspective, we have about double the number of clients. I think it's up to 270 or 280, somewhere in the range, at the end of this quarter versus the same period last year. So I think that tells you something.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, that's great.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We would like it to be higher. And we would have liked it to have been higher by now, but I think we're still growing well. We had good growth in the quarter in terms of Vantage. So I mean, I think that in terms of the product itself, we're pretty happy with the progress we've made, particularly over the last two or three releases. Again, we get a lot of metrics and a lot of data around stability and other factors, defects, et cetera, and we've made a lot of progress. So it feels like the trajectory is in a positive direction for Vantage, not just growth-wise, but I think in terms of the underlying metrics that we measure around quality and stability.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We thank you all for joining our call today. As you can tell, we got off to a really good start, on top of the great results. We're incredibly happy about the positive recognition we're getting in the marketplace, as you heard from some of my comments. It really helps us in terms of our thought leadership in the market.","I think the investments we're making in our innovation efforts and also our simplification of our portfolio and aligning them to our service model, I think are going to yield great results for us. And I think we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute against those plans.","The last thing I want to do is just acknowledge associates. We had a very tough year last year. I know I said it last quarter, but we had a challenging year. And we really appreciate all the efforts to continue to deliver great service to our clients. The commitment that our service associates have to our clients is unmatched, and it's one of the great strengths of ADP. So I just want to acknowledge them and give them my appreciation.

My name is Kevin, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Webcast. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I'll now turn the call over to Sara Grilliot, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sara Grilliot","Thank you. Good morning. This is Sara Grilliot, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations, and I am here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call and Webcast.","Before we begin, please note that ADP is planning to host a Financial Analyst Conference in New York City in the spring of 2015. We will provide further details in the coming weeks.","Carlos will open today's call with an overview of our first quarter accomplishments and financial performance, and Jan will take you through our detailed financial results and our fiscal 2015 forecast.","I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such, involve some risks. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. We had a good start to fiscal '15 as we intensified our commitment to delivering innovative solutions to help our clients manage and optimize their workforce to meet their business needs.","During the quarter, we continued to execute well against existing initiatives, including mobile adoption and cloud migration. We deployed new solutions to further differentiate ADP in the marketplace. And by successfully completing the spin-off for our Dealer Services business, we are now truly all-in on Human Capital Management or HCM.","Going forward, our energy in investment is squarely focused on serving our clients across the full HCM spectrum, from recruitment to retirement. And while many companies are focused on technology alone, ADP is focused on the end-user and delivering value-added services powered by leading-edge technology. We are helping employers manage their most important asset, their people, by backing up our workforce management technology with comprehensive service and compliance expertise.","Before I get to the quarter's performance, I would like to spend a few minutes talking about our commitment to HCM, which is supported by investments in innovation that drive our future growth.","Our nearest Innovation Lab located in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City opened earlier this year and has become a catalyst for accelerated product development. The engineers in the lab, together with thousands of world-class ADP engineers across the globe, have driven a number of our recent product introductions.","At the end of the quarter, we started to roll out our reimagined user experience, which we view as the ultimate convergence of innovation and intense client focus. The new user experience offers an intuitive and responsive platform, allowing employees to integrate critical HR processes into their daily work streams and creating a unique experience for employees. We plan to roll out this new user experience to 22 million payroll solutions users in North America by the end of calendar 2014 and across many other solutions in our portfolio throughout calendar 2015.","Adding to our client-centric offerings, we recently introduced the ADP Marketplace, which opens up our platform and grant clients, partner companies and third-party developers access to our application programming interfaces, commonly known as APIs. This helps our clients more seamlessly integrate critical applications with our system of record, further optimizing the entire HCM process with our cloud platforms.","And to help businesses manage one of the most critical challenges they face today, ADP recently expanded its suite of Affordable Care Act or ACA compliance tools. We believe ADP Health Compliance is the most comprehensive solution on the market and the only one able to manage all of the labor-intensive regulatory interactions between employers, their employees, government agencies and public exchanges.","Featuring the new user experience, ADP Health Compliance is a perfect example of our innovative cloud-based technology backed by ADP's team of dedicated ACA and regulatory compliance experts. With many companies in the U.S. currently unprepared to manage ACA compliance, we believe we are hitting the market at just the right time with this solution.","And we are proud to see that ADP solutions are being recognized. Forrester Research recently named ADP a SaaS HR management systems leader, citing our innovation, user-friendly platforms and expanding big data solutions as key drivers of improved workforce engagement.","This endorsement from an independent adviser, whose key role is to help companies make savvy technology decisions, sends a clear message to potential clients: Our solutions will help you make decisions that will drive business success.","So now for ADP's performance in the quarter. I'm pleased with the good performance we had to the start of the fiscal year. ADP reported revenue growth of 9%. Worldwide new business bookings growth was a solid 11%, and we continue to successfully drive client migrations to the cloud while improving profitability.","During our fourth quarter call, I described our refined 3-pillar strategy focusing on the HCM market. I think the best way to discuss our first quarter growth in new business bookings is in terms of how it aligns to each of our strategic pillars.","First, in the U.S., we saw growth across all of our strategic platforms, RUN, Workforce Now and Vantage, with solid attach rates, particularly for our benefits and talent modules. Performance in the upmarket was strong, with sales of Vantage contributing to our overall growth in the quarter.","Second, our business process outsourcing solutions, which we offer across all segments of the market, from small to large businesses, had strong results during the quarter. The PEO continues to perform well with small businesses, and we also saw increased demand for our comprehensive services in comprehensive outsourcing products in the mid- and upmarket.","Finally, we continue to leverage our global presence to offer clients HCM solutions where they do business. Our multinational solutions performed well in the quarter, with growth coming from small to very large multinational corporations.","During the quarter, we continued to migrate clients to our newer cloud-based solutions. At the end of the quarter, more than 460,000 businesses were supported by our cloud services.","We also continue to deepen ADP's engagement with clients and end-users through our success with mobile. We now have more than 3 million users on our mobile app, an increase of more than 18% in the last quarter alone.","Our first quarter achievements are a reflection of an effective strategy, combined with the commitment of 52,000 ADP associates who are pushing everyday to deliver on behalf of our clients.","And with that, Jan will now walk you through the first quarter results.","Jan Siegmund","Thank you very much, Carlos. As you just heard, we had a solid first quarter. Before I get into the detailed results, I would like to call your attention, though, to our cash and marketable securities balance of $4.4 billion at September 30, 2014. This includes $2 billion of assets related to outstanding commercial paper in support of our extended investment strategy for the client funds portfolio and is footnoted in our condensed balance sheet. This borrowing was repaid on October 1.","In addition, with the completion of the spin-off of Dealer Services to CDK on September 30, the results of operations of the Dealer Services business and spin-related costs associated with this transaction are now reported within discontinued operations. My comments will therefore be in reference to continuing operations.","Now for the quarter's results. As Carlos mentioned, ADP delivered solid revenue growth of 9% for the quarter, nearly all organic. We achieved a pretax earnings growth of 12% and earnings per share growth of 13% on lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago.","In connection with the spin-off of Dealer Services, ADP sold a portfolio of notes receivables to a third-party, which contributed approximately $0.02 to our diluted earnings per share.","Our combined worldwide new business bookings growth was a solid 11% over last year's first quarter. Employer Services revenue grew 7% from additions of net new recurring revenues to our global HCM solutions and our BPO offerings. Each of our businesses contributed to this quarter's growth.","We remain focused on providing a world-class client experience, and we are pleased that our client revenue retention increased 70 basis points over last year's first quarter, though retention is lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and the first quarter generally has the smallest volume of losses.","Same-store pays per control in the U.S. was strong with an increase of 3.1%. In Europe, same-store pays per control continues to flatten out, but still declined 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter. However, we are pleased with the overall revenue growth in our International business where we are seeing positive momentum in Asia Pacific and Latin America, as well as continued success with our multinational offerings.","Growth in the average client fund balances was 7%, driven by our net new business growth, especially in the small and upmarket, as well as pays per control growth.","Pretax margin expansion in Employer Services was 120 basis points in the quarter. Our businesses performed well, driving solid revenue growth with controlled increases in our operating costs. We continue to invest in our new products and in our sales force, and we anticipate year-over-year earnings pressure in the second fiscal quarter from these investments, which will result in about $30 million of additional expenses in the second quarter compared with a year ago.","The PEO continues to perform very well, with revenue growth of 18% in the quarter. Average worksite employees grew 15% to 345,000. The increasingly complex HR regulatory environment and the compliance needs of small- to mid-sized business, combined with solid execution of our distribution model and the strength of ADP's offering, are key drivers of this growth.","In addition to the solid revenue growth, pretax margin in the PEO improved 90 basis points in the quarter. The quarter's margin expansion was a result of increased operating and sales efficiencies.","We're quite pleased with the results of our business segments for the first quarter. We're also pleased that overall ADP pretax margin improved by 50 basis points over last year's first quarter. Although our high-margin client fund interest revenues were slightly positive in the quarter, for the first time since 2008, the impact on ADP's pretax margin was still a drag of about 30 basis points, as these highly profitable revenues grew at a slower rate than overall revenues. We expect to see this drag lessen as the year progresses.","So let me make -- let me take you through our outlook for fiscal year 2015, which was updated on September 29 to exclude the Dealer Services business. For total ADP, we anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 8% compared to fiscal year 2014 to revenues of $10.3 billion. Pretax margin for total ADP is anticipated to improve by 75 to 100 basis points from 18.4% in fiscal year 2014. Although we benefited from a lower effective tax rate in the first quarter compared with last year, we still expect a rate of 34.6% compared with 33.9% in fiscal year 2014.","Diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 12% to 14% compared with $2.58 in fiscal year 2014. This forecast of 12% to 14% includes a $0.02 benefit resulting from share repurchases funded by the $825 million in dividend proceeds ADP received as a result of the spin-off of CDK. However, the forecast does not contemplate further share buybacks beyond anticipated dilution related to equity comp plans and the dividend proceeds from CDK.","And although our share repurchases in the quarter were lower than in prior quarters, ADP remains committed to its shareholder-friendly actions, and it is clearly our intent to return excess cash to our shareholders, depending obviously on market conditions.","The high end of our revenue and earnings forecast ranges anticipate renewal of certain high-margin WOTC tax credits in the second half of the fiscal year. And although foreign currency fluctuation had a minimal impact on our first quarter results, a stronger U.S. dollar continuing throughout the balance of the year could put pressure on the full year revenue forecast.","And finally, as I mentioned earlier, we anticipate having about $30 million of additional expense in the second fiscal quarter, which will moderate our earnings growth in that quarter.","So now for the business segments. There's no change to our forecasted growth of new business bookings. We are still anticipating about 8% growth over $1.4 billion sold in fiscal year 2014.","There's no change to our previous forecast for Employer Services. We still anticipate 6% to 7% revenue growth and 100 basis points of pretax margin expansion. Pays per control in the U.S. is still anticipated to increase 2% to 3%.","For the PEO, we are still maintaining our revenue growth guidance of 13% to 15%, as we continue to assess opportunities related to the increasing complexity of the HR regulatory environment during the remainder of the year. And we are still anticipating up to 50 basis points of pretax margin expansion for the PEO.","There is no change to our previous forecast related to the client funds investment strategy. The detail is available both in the press release and in the supplemental slides on our website.","Now I will return it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of David Togut with Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Are there any significant changes we should expect, Carlos, in the way you manage ADP post the CDK spin?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think the only -- I think we've communicated that -- I think we -- part of the reason for the spin-off is for us to just have more focus in terms of our time, our dollars, our energy on our HCM market and also to allow CDK to do the same thing in their industry and their business. So I can't -- I don't think there's really any radical news to really provide you other than that. We really believe that it's not a -- it wasn't a financial engineering transaction per se, it was really a strategic decision that we expect you to see improvement in our performance over time, because I think that increased focus and energy in investment in HCM. We did it obviously because we think it's going to pay off and have better results for our shareholders, but it's not a 1 quarter or 2 quarter decision. We can't point to anything that's happening in the first quarter or the second quarter specifically as a result of the spin-off. We just have confidence and faith, and I think our Board had confidence and faith that this will create greater value over the long term by having the 2 businesses separated.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Understood. And just as a quick follow-up, you highlighted your progress in the ongoing migration to the cloud and mobile. Can you just remind us of the benefits from this migration, whether it be improved customer retention or upsell opportunity?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I'm not sure we have enough time today for -- to talk about all the benefits. But I'll talk about a couple, and maybe Jan can jump in because there really are many that we've now actually experienced and seen because it was all theory a couple of years ago, and now I think we're seeing some of the benefits. So starting with the fact that, if you think about in the old legacy products, the process of upgrading clients and rolling out new products was cumbersome, difficult and expensive. And I think our new kind of cloud-based version of those products are just much easier to roll out, much easier to upgrade. So there's huge benefits in terms of just frictional ongoing costs. The word cloud and SaaS, I think, can mean a lot of things to a lot of different people. But I think to us, it also means not just the technology, but also the consumer-grade experience, which means that they're easier to use, result in hopefully better serviceability and less need for support because they're more intuitive. So that I think also is something that we're beginning to see some benefits of. I think the most important reason for us to migrate these clients is because we believe these new platforms that we have are very successful commercially in the market from a sales standpoint in terms of new business. And if there's that much demand and they're so great for new clients, they must also be great for existing clients. So we just want to have all of our clients on our best products, is really the main driver for the migration strategy. I don't know if Jan has any other items to add.","Jan Siegmund","I may want to add a little bit about the mechanics of where we are. So we did migrate another 20,000 RUN clients this quarter and really coming to the homestretch now to finalize that migration right along the plans that we had. So that we may not be 100% completed in this quarter but we'll be very close to execute, as we have talked now for many years. And we have seen an addition to a great client experience, of course, also a slight decrease in the complexity of business, which helps in the margin expansion from the down market. That's for sure. The migration of our mid-market product, PCPW, on to Workforce Now also continues at a good clip. We migrated about 1,500 clients there. And just as a reminder, we do see actually, when we migrate these clients, improvement in our retention rates and we -- about 30% of the clients actually utilize right at the migration upsell opportunities to buy broader product portfolios. And I think those factors you see really reflected in our overall results and certainly contributed to a smaller degree, but to some degree, in our good retention performance, as well as our good sales performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from S.K. Prasad Borra with Goldman Sachs.","Siva Krishna Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple, if I may. Firstly, on the new bookings, you had a strong first quarter, but you made no changes to the full year guidance. Is it just being conservative or is there a seasonality aspect we need to account for? And second one, can you provide some color on the attach rates associated with these new products? What is the difference between selling a standalone payroll offering and attaching things like benefits and talents to the payroll offering?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So I'll let Jan talk about the attach rates. In terms of the seasonality of the results, there is some seasonality. So our first quarter is our smallest quarter, not by a dramatic amount, but it is smaller than the other 3 quarters in terms of the total dollar amount of sales that we get from the first quarter versus the full year. So there is a bit of a seasonality impact. We also had a, what I would call a relatively easy compare because we had, as all of you know, a difficult first quarter last year. And so we feel like our forecast is still quite good, but also I think in the right range. So we're feeling good about our momentum in our results, but I don't think it's appropriate to extrapolate an 11% first quarter growth rate in new business bookings to anything higher than what we've provided in terms of guidance in the range. We don't have anything to lead us to believe now that, that should change because we obviously know other factors in our sales force like, for example, how much headcount we've added. And although we have had some positive surprises in the past around productivity, there tends to be a natural governor on sales results depending on what your headcount numbers are. So I think we have some metrics that tell us that I think our guidance is the right guidance.","Jan Siegmund","On the attach rates, we really attach HR products at all segments to our products. And it's, of course, a very different experience if the product is completely seamlessly integrated in the workflow of the user. So it is not even a different product, there's just a different feature functionality that we open up in it. And we see in the upmarket, where we had a good quarter also for Vantage sales, stability in the attach rates, so ranging between 50% and 80%, depending on the product component. And in the mid-market, we saw actually slight increase in the attach rates for really all the core product components, benefits and time and attendance and talent namely for it. So the strategy of having a platform and to upsell or to have an easy ability for the client to expand their relationship with ADP has really proven to be successful for us, an important component of the sales growth that we observed this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Financial.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Just looking at the PEO business, I assume the strong 1Q at least -- or the strong growth in the first quarter versus the guide for the year at least partially reflects the increasing difficulty of the comparisons. So I guess, one, is that in fact the case? And can you also update us on what you view as the underlying drivers of that business, and again, the sustainability of those drivers as we get through this year and into next year?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes. I think the -- I think you're right, the compares do matter. I think there are a couple of other factors that are helping that we seem to be cautious about. One of them is that there is a premium tax that has been added to the health care offerings, this is by the carriers who then pass those costs through to the PEO. And as you know, the pass-through costs are relatively important in that business. Having said that, the worksite employee growth is still quite strong in the PEO, so it's not coming alone from inflation in our pass-through cost, but the inflation in the pass-through cost is a factor. So I would tell you that a better way to look at this business over the long term is to look at worksite employee unit growth, which is really the driver of growth in this particular business as a good proxy for what to expect in terms of the range. And I think when you look at it that way, and you look at the difficult compare that we have in the third quarter versus the previous third quarter, because we had a very good net new business result last year in this business, because of a variety of reasons around tax restarts, et cetera, tends to have a relatively large influx of new business and also we have a reasonable amount of loss that would take place on January 1. So you take all those things combined, kind of where we are trend-wise in terms of worksite employee growth, the fact that our pass-throughs are a little elevated right now and the difficult compare that we have on January 1 in terms of net new business, I think we think that the guidance that we're providing, I think, is appropriate.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And then how about the sustainability going into next year? So we've got perhaps some distortions this year, but as you look into next year, do you see any changes in the landscape that would dramatically change the trajectory of this business?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So let me just go back in terms of -- I think I know what you mean by distortions, but just to reiterate one more time, the business is clearly performing -- is really firing on all cylinders in terms of absolute growth in units, margin improvement, new business bookings results. It's -- so they're really performing well. So I was really only addressing the issue of the specific growth of the first quarter in comparison to the full year results. So we expect this business to continue in the same positive momentum that we have guided to. So my comment was really more around whether the guidance was appropriate versus whether we're excited or positive about the business, because we are. And we don't expect or see any decelerations or issues in the near term in that business over the next several quarters or even into next year. But obviously, this is, I guess, why we talk about forward-looking statements. It's a long way away to start talking about next year. We obviously don't give guidance about next year, about the PEO or any other business. But we don't have any reason to believe that we can't continue the positive momentum. The backdrop for this business with health care reform has helped for sure in terms of activity of people looking for solutions and options around health care, just the regulatory compliance complexity that has grown not just the result of ACA, but just government regulation overall just continues to drive small businesses to look for solutions that can help them, allow them to focus on their business. And the PEO is about as good as it gets in terms of being able to really have someone else focus on those issues for you.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And if I could just ask just one quick follow-up. And I think you got it. Jan answered part of this question previously. But now that we're pretty well into the deployment of some of the new HCM platforms, can you help us better understand how much of the ES growth comes from unit growth versus revenue per unit in contrast to kind of prior years, if you will?","Jan Siegmund","Yes. So I -- we didn't get the question in our year-end call, and I can answer it now. Of course, last year, we had approximately -- unit growth of approximately 5% year-over-year, so a very solid client expansion, driven largely by our success in the downmarket, of course, where the most of the units came from. But we had really growth actually across all segments. And the answer is very hard to do because in the upmarket, we have higher market share and the proportion of upsell to clients is higher versus in the downmarket, it's virtually all new unit growth driven in the revenue growth. So like a curve, it balances out. And so it's a mix of it, and the mix hasn't really changed, as you see, because the unit growth has continued now for the third year in a row at these levels or slightly accelerated, if you want. And so it's not -- 50-50 is not the right way to do, but it's a balance of growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Mihalos with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I understand the easier comparisons in the first quarter related to new sales and also to retention. But I'm just curious, did the business perform above plan relative to your internal expectations in the first quarter, given the -- more of the second half difficulties around the comps?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Let me just -- let me start off by saying, again, in terms of clarifying my language when I -- and I think it's a financial term of hard to say easier compare, which is not well understood by field leaders because they certainly would not interpret the results as easy. So the -- as you can imagine, this -- to deliver the sales results regardless of what your sales results were last year, which is a financial question, is hard because you have to execute. Same thing with retention and client losses. Having said all that, since you're asking a direct question and we feel compelled to give you a direct answer, the direct answer would be that, yes, both the sales and retention results exceeded our internal plans, but I want to qualify that by saying that they exceeded them by an amount that is not significant enough for us to rethink and change our guidance. It's the nature of our business model that -- this recurring revenue model is so positive in so many ways, but it's also very, very difficult to change the trajectory in the numbers in one quarter, and that is exactly what happened this quarter. So we're very pleased when we exceeded our internal plans and budgets, but I don't know how many times I've had to be on this call and mention that retention in one particular quarter was down by 10 basis points because of a large loss or because they're lumpy. So what's good for the goose is good for the gander, it goes both ways. We happen to have had a good quarter and it's no reason to start moving, I think, expectations. At least from our perspective, that's where we stand today.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, I think we can appreciate that. And just as a follow-up, a question for Jan. Any reason why in the future you would not be open to adding leverage on the balance sheet, solely for the purpose of accelerating returns to shareholders, buybacks and the like?","Jan Siegmund","Yes, what you mentioned is correct. In principle, we, of course, changed as part of the spinout of Dealer Services to CDK, our credit rating, and we have now a AA credit rating, which allows us more financial flexibility. And we are aware in evaluating the benefits that it has for us, offers a certainly greater financial flexibility either for returning cash to shareholders or pursuing strategic acquisitions. So we're aware and we're evaluating it, and we have a constructive dialogue about the opportunities. And when we feel we can generate shareholder value with it, we certainly think about these elements.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think Jan and I both, I think consistently for several years now, talked about how we view the world in terms of total shareholder return or TSR, which obviously, dividends and share buybacks are an important component over long periods of time of driving our TSR to what our objective is, which is to be top quartile. So we appreciate the question because we're very sensitive to those topics and certainly are looking at all of our options to help, in addition to our revenue and margin improvements, to find other ways to really drive our TSR to that top quartile performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smitti Srethapramote with Morgan Stanley.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Your pay per control growth was quite strong at 3.1%. Can you just comment on what drove that growth rate this past quarter?","Jan Siegmund","Well, it was strong and is, I think, a strength in line with the strengthening of the overall economy. ADP's clients tend to outgrow the U.S. economy over long run, so we are blessed with a very healthy set of clients. And the improvement was kind of -- we attribute more to the overall continued improvement in the U.S. labor market, and it happens to be a very good number.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And again, just to add context, the -- when you look at it over the last 2 or 3 years and quarter-by-quarter, it's higher than it has been for sure, but only by 30 to 40 basis points. It's kind of hovering in the mid-2s, and so we had a 3.1%. Again, I would just caution everyone that based on a lot of experience that we have, do not take 1 quarter and extrapolate. And if you feel compelled to extrapolate, you should know that the impact of 1 percentage point growth in pays per control is about $20 million annually, so a 30 to 40 basis point improvement if it were to remain for the rest of the year, which is hard to predict right now, would really not have a material impact on our result either on the top line or the bottom line for the year.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And maybe just a follow-up question. Can you talk at a high level about the growth of the ASO or the BPO business? Does it look similar to what you're seeing in the PEO segment? And could these businesses drive an acceleration growth in the Employer Services segment?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think as I mentioned in my opening comments, given that that's one of our strategic pillars, we, I think, specifically mentioned that besides the PEO, our other BPO offerings are actually growing quite nicely as well. And we have those BPO offerings in the low end of the market, the mid-market and the upper end of the market. In addition to the PEOs, the PEO is a separate segment and a different business, it obviously has tremendous synergies with the rest of ADP. But we actually have BPO offerings that are available also in the small market without core employment. We have them in the mid-market and we have them in the upper end of the market. And I -- again, Jan may add color. But all 3 of them are performing quite well and they're -- all 3 are growing, I think, at better than ADP line rates.","Jan Siegmund","Yes. And I think relative to employees served growth, which is maybe then the common denominator about it, they're very similar rates. So it's a very success story -- it's a big success story for us.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And well into the market. If you combine our PEO worksite employees with our ASO paid employees, we don't call them worksite employees, paid employees, I think on a combined basis, I think you would find that over the last 5 to 7 years, it was a marathon, but I would say that we're probably comfortably right now, probably the leader in terms of offering BPO services in the low end of the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I wanted to come back to the PEO segment for a second. Obviously, the growth is strong there. Do you guys think that you're taking share in that market? Any evidence to support that? Or do you feel that it's more the rising tide lifting all boats, just given the ACA and compliance burdens?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that if you look at it over 5 to 10 years, I think we have taken share in that business. I think if you look at the last year or 2, it would appear -- again, there's not a lot of great data because most of the PEOs are private -- privately held companies. But if you look at the publics, I think that the growth rate has improved. Some of that is -- it's hard to discern how much of it is acquisition-related versus organic. But we still feel pretty good that we're gaining share in that specific segment of our business. But we have to acknowledge that there appears to be also a rising tide, not quite to a level -- or execution, which is I think better than average or better than market average. But the market is healthy and appears to be growing at a reasonably good clip, which is not necessarily true over the last 10 years.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And just switching gears a little bit to pricing. I know that Paychex mentioned on their earnings call about a month ago that they were seeing slightly better pricing dynamics in their business. Have you seen something similar at the smaller end of your client base?","Jan Siegmund","We stay consistent with our overall strategic pricing approach. And just for reminder, that is -- approximately 1% of our revenue growth is driven by our annual price increases across all segments. And anticipating your question in the down market, we actually did review our pricing statistics and behavior, and discounting behavior, and net pricing, and price increases for the business, and it is completely in line with our historic behavior in the marketplace, but no changes in our pricing strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So RBC is a customer of your FSA product. I recently tried to log in to it through the ADP website, was unsuccessful, called the 800 number, and after several minutes trying to figure it out, it turns out we're actually a customer of the SHPS product that you acquired 2.5 years ago. I guess two-part question on that. First of all, is that sort of unique for some reason to the FSA that that's not been fully integrated into the legacy ADP offering? And secondly, are there any implications from that in terms of the ability to migrate people to the new integrated platforms and\/or upsell other products or anything else?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It's a great question, it allows me to make a couple of comments. First of all, after the call, I'll give you my cell phone. If you ever have a problem, you can call me and I'll make sure that I get you through. I actually tried to log on to the FSA site Sunday night and had a challenge myself because they were doing maintenance. So I did call someone and they told me that they were doing maintenance, but I have the right phone numbers if you ever need help. So the SHPS acquisition is an interesting question because we actually acquired SHPS, in large part, to get that platform. So we are actually in the process of moving our legacy FSA clients on to the SHPS platform, which is really our platform, it's the ADP platform. Now -- so again, that was an example of where we decided to use our capital for acquisition rather than internal development because, as you know, we are doing a lot. I mean, our R&D spend has grown quite substantially over the last 3 years, but there are many things that we need to address in terms of legacy platforms, and our spending accounts was one of them. So one of the things that came with SHPS was an HSA solution, which is very important to have in today's market because of high-deductible health plans.","So FSAs, as you may or may not know, have now been restricted in terms of the dollar limits are a little bit lower. They're still popular. I still have an FSA, but I think you have to have an HSA platform. And we tried to get -- to create a -- to get an HSA platform through acquisition, through the SHPS's acquisition. So that's really not a platform that we're actually trying to get off of. We're actually trying to get off of our old platform. And so we're kind of agnostic in terms of where it comes from, whether it's our platform or an acquired platform. We're just trying to get on to common platforms. And so this would be an example rightly so, where we are still not where we want to be in terms of having everyone on one common spending accounts platform and having it integrated into all of our other products. So I think it's the work in progress. And it allows me also to address the question that we got, I think it was the first question, around migrations, which is we still have a lot of work to do. So to be very clear because we're talking about all the progress we've made, you just kind of hit actually ironically on a chord because I asked the same question 2 years ago when we were looking at a demo of one of our products. My question was, \"Well, how does FSA integrate into this?\" So we still have a lot of work to do, and we've actually accelerated our migration spend this year and we've also accelerated our R&D spend, which that one is much more clear because you see it in the 10-Q and you see it in our disclosures. But we are nowhere near yet where we want to be, particularly when you get into the upper end of the market. I think we've made that clear over the last 2 or 3 quarters. But I just wanted to reiterate that in our upper-end payroll HR benefit spending accounts, like there is still quite a lot of work to do, but we are doing that work. And we have, I would say, significantly increased our spend in the upmarket migrations area, and spending accounts would be one of those.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then that leads into the follow-up, which is just I think one of the bull cased [ph] arguments on ADP some investors have had is that at some point, you actually see cost decline quite a bit from turning off legacy systems and slowing the migration spend. From that last comment, I guess, would a reasonable assumption be that, that's still more than 12 months away? Or I know you probably don't want to give us a number. But it's still quite a ways off before you would have that benefit happen if it does at all.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","That is correct. And I think that what's going to be good this year is that by the end of the year, we'll be able to tell you that we shut down completely the EasyPay platform and that it resulted in the benefits of X, Y and Z. So we will be able to at least begin to better quantify some of the benefits and positives of shutdowns of platforms. And then besides EasyPay, which is a major platform in our low end of the market, we have 3 platforms in the mid-market that we are planning on shutting down and a couple in the upper market as well. This will be the first time -- as much as we've been talking about this, it's really been about migrations and not shutdowns. We're actually this year going to start shutting things down. And I think we'll at least be able to give you, I think, a little bit more color on what potential benefits might come. But right now, for the next 12 months and probably sometime beyond that, our strategy is to reinvest everything that we are getting as a result of improvements into accelerating that type of activity, the migrations and the shutdowns.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Just one more on the PEO. The growth of worksite employees decelerated a little bit this quarter to 15% from 18.9% even though it's sort of the summer period. Could you talk about that a little bit?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes. I think it's one of those peculiarities, I believe, of how our sales force behaves, which I talked about a little bit over the last year and probably a little too much. But our fiscal year ends on June 30, and the PEO had, what I would call, a spectacular year-end from a fiscal year-end standpoint. And I think it's as simple as that. That was what's driving it. Because I think if you look at it trend-wise prior quarters to that fourth quarter, I think it would be more in line with where we are today. So I think if you look at it on a moving average basis over 4-quarter moving average, I think that business is accelerating in terms of its worksite employee growth.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay, great. And now that you're focused totally on HCM, can you talk about your acquisition philosophy? Would you be willing to add new areas, make bigger acquisitions? Just kind of what you're thinking is there.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think, again Jan will probably add color. But our position hasn't changed at all as a result of our spinoff of Dealer or our change in our credit rating other than we clearly have much more financial flexibility now. So I think we had always communicated to all of you and to The Street that we would be willing for the right acquisition to change our capital structure. I think what happened was we have the benefit now of our capital structure...","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Okay. If we're back on, we apologize for the interruption. And we wanted to continue with answering your questions. I think, Jim, if you're still connected, I think your question was around acquisitions and if our view has changed as a result of the spinoff. And I think my answer was that I think we're still kind of consistent with our prior philosophy, which is we want to use our capital both for organic growth and product development. But we also are open to -- and that's really our primary focus, but we're also very open to the right types of opportunities to use our capital for acquisitions. And I think we just talked a few minutes ago about how we believe that we accelerated our progress in terms of FSA and spending accounts through the acquisition of those SHPS platforms a couple of years ago. And we will continue to look at those types of opportunities in the future. So one of the benefits that we have, and I think Jan talked about it earlier, is that the spinoff of Dealer really did kind of ease the path for us, if you will, in the sense that there really wouldn't be -- there's likely to not be a change in credit rating as a result of our need to access the capital markets either for returning cash to shareholders or for an acquisition, unless that acquisition were to be obviously much larger than the average typical acquisition that we like to do. So Jim, I hope that answered your question. I hope you're still connected.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with Sanford Bernstein.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","It's Lisa. I have a question about competitive dynamics. Are you seeing higher win rates in the lower end of the market. Do you perceive that you're gaining share there? And then in the upper end of the market, you've mentioned that Vantage had a fairly strong quarter. To what extent in the upper end of the market do you go to market independently? Or to what extent do the competitive dynamics among the software vendors, like SAP, Oracle, Workday, et cetera, impact you in and around your partnerships, your go-to-market partnerships with them?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, it's a great question on the -- and again Jan can add maybe his view. But I think on the upper end of the market, we really have a situation of coopetition with many of our -- of all the companies you mentioned. So we compete head-on in many respects for the entire HCM bundle, but we have a variety of solutions, for example, wage garnishments, standalone tax and other solutions, that we would provide in partnership with some of our -- what some of you might consider to be our competitors in the upper end of the market. We believe we have very good relationships and very good integration arrangements with really all of the competitors that you mentioned and a few others. And I think we believe that, that's the right posture for us to have in the marketplace because we want to be in on deals and we want to have our foot in the door so that we have an opportunity, having the broadest solutions of any provider out there. I think us having a logo or a relationship with the client is very important and very advantageous for us down the road to be able to attach and add on additional products. So we do cooperate as well as compete with all of those players in the upper end of the market. And I think your other question was in the low end of the market around market share. I think consistent with our prior comments over the last probably year to 2 years, we believe that we're growing faster than the market. And how much of that is shifts from software, pure software, to cloud-based software or to cloud-based software with support and service, which is what we provide in regulatory compliance, it's hard to know how much of our growth coming from shifts in the market versus direct market share takeaways from a specific competitor. So we don't have that level of information, that level of detail, but we do know that we're growing faster than the Small Business market is growing overall.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Terrific. And then just a quick follow-up on the PEO. Can you give us a flavor for what the customer retention is like in the PEO business? Like does it differ materially from the Employer Services business? And how many -- what's the mix of PEO clients that actually come out of Employer Services versus their sort of new greenfield wins?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So obviously, we don't disclose retention segment specifics, so this would probably be a bad time to start. To give you a scent of kind of where it is, it is -- if you look at the low end of our business, the average-sized client in our PEO is about 30 worksite employees. And so it falls squarely in what we call the Small Business market, the SBS market. The retention rates of those businesses, just because of natural dynamics that occur in that business or in that segment of the business, is lower than our average. So I think we right now are at around 91% annual retention, so our large national accounts would have a higher than 91% retention and our Small Business clients would have lower than 91% retention. So the PEO, because of the size client that they address, would be in that category of between 80% and 90% retention, below the average. But we'd rather not get into specifics. But we're quite pleased and quite happy with the retention rates and the trends of those retention rates. And from the few that we see that we have visibility to in the outside market, we feel ours compares favorably. And I think there was another question.","Jan Siegmund","A question regarding the sources of our business. And this has to be answered like in a very clear way. Our broad field sales force in SBS and in major account has an incentive to generate leads that are suitable for the PEO. And such, the sales forces provide lead flow and opportunity into our core PEO sales force. And that's an important component of how we generate business. But those sales forces in SBS and major accounts are both to existing clients and new clients. And, of course, in the SBS downmarket, the larger component of this is really clients that are really newly identified as potential targets to the PEO. So the conversions of RUN clients onto the PEO is of lesser importance in this business. So this is really good, new unit growth that we're getting in the PEO.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was hoping to get a little bit more color around the 11% growth in new business bookings. It sounded like it was strong across the board. Did you see much improvement with large clients? Last quarter, you had talked about new business transfer clients with more than 10,000 employees being down. And I'm wondering if you saw a change in that trend.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","This is a great opportunity for me to provide some comments in the sense that I believe that some of my focus, and I take accountability for this last year after the first quarter, on individual portions of our sales results, individual business units, I think it was counterproductive both competitively and also internally in terms of a distraction to our own organization. So that's why we worded our opening comments the way we did, which is we're trying to tie our new business bookings results and explanations to kind of our broad strategic pillars rather than kind of specific segments because it was counterproductive to have done so. Having said that, because we spent so much time on it, I think it's appropriate this quarter, but we will try to avoid doing this, as much as we've done it in the past, in the future. I think it's okay to be a little more specific so that you have comfort because of some of the noise that we've had over the last 3 or 4 quarters, we had strong, very strong sales results across the board both in our traditional under 10,000 market as well as with large clients, with multinational clients in benefits, in RPO really across the entire national accounts segment. And the results were as strong in this quarter as they were weak last year in the first quarter. And that is really all I can say other than when you look at the numbers, it's quite impressive because of the gap. But that doesn't necessarily mean that in absolute dollars, if anything, other than what we want and need in order to grow the business. It's just that we had such a bad first quarter last year that the difference is quite stark. And back in -- I guess, the best way to summarize it is we're happy we're back where we want to be in terms of our performance in our upmarket. And our intention is in future quarters to try to not be as specific.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then 2 follow-up questions. The first is, with Vantage, as you're going out to existing clients and asking them to convert, can you talk to us about how those conversations are going, if you're providing any incentives for them to convert and how the sales force will balance migrations versus new sales? And then second, separately, last quarter, when you had given guidance, you talked about $30 million of investment in both the first quarter, and then also the second quarter. Did you make that $30 million in the first quarter? I'm wondering if the margin expansion incorporated that $30 million.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I'll let Jan answer the question about the investments and the margins. In terms of the question about existing clients moving over to Vantage, so we had -- at the beginning as we rolled out Vantage, I think in the first 50 sales that we had, I don't think any of them -- maybe 1 was a migration. I think in the next 50, we had maybe a couple more. I think now we are really including in the Q some existing clients that we want to move over. But it's still a relatively limited number. Like most of our Vantage sales are new logo, new share type of deals with very high attach rates for all the HCM modules. But there are obviously circumstances where it makes sense both because we think it's the right thing for the client and some of it is driven by just demand from clients wanting to migrate. So for example, in our HR Tech Conference or our Meeting of the Minds conference, we show these products, we talk about them, so it's kind of -- and we're very excited about them, and they're great solutions. So it is difficult to talk them up, and then tell people, \"Sorry, but they're not available.\" So we are now beginning to move some clients, a limited number of clients, on to Vantage, and we are -- we're working hard to build capacity to do that because we have to do both the new share and new logo business as well as the migration. So it's a matter of just creating and adding capacity from an implementation standpoint. In terms of incentives, the good news about Vantage and also about Workforce Now is that these new platforms really make it natural to purchase more than just the traditional payroll solution that ADP was known for, hence, our focus on HCM. So the attach rates of time and attendance and benefits administration and talent and some of the other modules are -- in some cases, they're up to 80%. So there is a natural incentive as a result of additional revenues to the company, which our sales force gets credit for and get commissions for. So I don't think it's an incentive issue. I think that it's really a capacity and execution management issue.","Jan Siegmund","And if I went to your question of the incremental cost that we guided to at the end of our last -- of our year-end call a quarter ago, we talked about incremental expense pressure driven by our investments into IT and some acceleration of our investment in our sales force for the first 2 quarters, $30 million in each quarter. And yes, we did incur incremental cost in this quarter slightly better than the $30 million, so we didn't quite spend as much money as we thought to. But a large component of this materialized and is in our results. And I think I would expect the same split for the second quarter, about half on sales force expense and half on IT acceleration. If you kind of want to place it on your P&L, that's what will occur.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And another thing I would add is that we also had a couple of -- which we disclosed, a couple of things that helped us in the first quarter that are not occurring in the second quarter. And so it will be easier to see the difficulty of the additional investments in the second quarter compared to the first quarter because we did get some help in the first quarter that we hadn't anticipated. Otherwise, we would have included it in the guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just want to ask about the increased use in mobile. Does that bring in -- does mobile bring any additional revenue opportunity? And then I guess, on the flip side, on the cost side, is it just an additional cost? Or can that lower the cost to serve ADP clients?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We do believe that it has an impact on the cost side because a number of actions that people would take, both practitioners and employees, the things that they might be able to do themselves on their mobile devices are really issues that we would avoid either calls or avoid emails or chats or texts or whatever method people choose to communicate with us to ask a question or to get service. So I think there is some benefit in terms of lower cost for ADP as a result of some of our mobile solutions being out there. But I think there's a couple of other very positive impacts. I don't think that we can attribute directly revenue, so we can't tell you that we're advertising, for example, on to our mobile platforms and generating advertising revenue. But I can tell you that the connections and the relationships we're building with the employees of our clients in addition to the traditional relationships we have with our clients are very, very helpful in terms of our sales and our client retention. So as an example, if you go to the App Store, like the ADP app, believe it or not, is one of more popular business apps out there for the simple reason that people can check their -- it's not just about checking your pay and whether you got paid and how much went into your direct deposit, but you can check also your -- you can clock in, clock out if you are an employee that has a time and attendance system with ADP. You can actually do your open enrollment and choose your benefits. You can check for a doctor. I mean, there's just an endless number of things that you can do on the mobile devices and that just creates stickiness and a stronger relationship and a deeper relationship with our clients, not only at the practitioner level but at the employee level as well. So we believe that it's helping us in many ways in terms of the growth of our new business bookings. It's probably helping us with our retention. But we really can't point to specific metrics to tell you that it had X impact on either of those. We just know that it's helping. And down the road in the future, there may be other monetization opportunities. But at this point, that really hasn't been our focus.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just as a follow-up, curious to know now what percentage of revenue now comes international. And then with that, just particularly interested in Europe and what you're seeing out of Europe since a lot of concern about the European economy still.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So I think Jan will give you kind of the percentage and the details. I think that we're -- we have to say that we're pleased with -- given the backdrop in Europe, we're pleased with the new business bookings results in the first quarter and with the revenue growth, which as you can imagine, are both lower than the line averages that we're reporting both from new business bookings overall for ADP and revenue growth for ADP overall. So our international business obviously includes more than just Europe, it includes our multinational solutions, it includes Latin America and it includes Asia-Pac. And when you add all those together, those are actually quite close to our -- despite the drag from Europe, are quite close to the line average of ADP. But I think in view of the backdrop, I would have to say that we're quite proud of the performance of our business in Europe. And I think Jan may have a little more color around pays per control, retention and those kinds of things.","Jan Siegmund","Yes. I think, Carlos, you captured the vast majority on the revenue side, international revenues roughly in line with our overall ADP revenue. Europe is a slight drag but really doing well. And that is paired with a good bottom line performance in Europe, where they kind of saw the overall results of the performance in Europe are really quite good in this quarter. And you have been -- I have been dancing around the pays per control numbers now for quite a few quarters in Europe with seeing silver linings coming closer. And we did have 1 month where we were actually slightly positive in the quarter, so too early to call it a sunrise there, given also the kind of more historic economic reports that we receive out of Europe. But gradually, it has been improving, and we're now basically flat as I talked about a 20 basis points decline. So flat on the pays per control side paired with the performance that Carlos described, Europe has had a good quarter.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Jan, what is the percentage of international revenues now as a total?","Jan Siegmund","Yes, that's it, I apologize. Approximately 20% for ADP.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","20%. And then just lastly on that, so is Europe improving? Or is it actually getting worse just when you're looking at the trend line?","Jan Siegmund","If you want a trend line, ever so slightly improving.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Carlos, you talked about the ACA [ph] compliance tools that you have now. Do you find those tools as a retention of clients tool? Or will you be able to price? And is there a revenue opportunity with those tools?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It is clearly a revenue opportunity. So we have -- I mean, I'm sorry, but clearly to us, maybe not to anyone else. But the level of complexity that is involved in compliance with ACA is quite high. And I think in our view, the model that we have is again as usual for us, it's not only technology, it's also expertise. And so that really will be our differentiator. So where others might just kind of add an additional report, which makes it sometimes harder to monetize, we are really building capabilities to help people make decisions, so decision support tools as well as expertise from people. And right now, we actually have sold a number of clients, these are incremental sales dollars with additional annual recurring revenues with our ACA compliance solutions. And I think we've only had it out in the market 3 or 4 weeks or a couple of months, a couple of months. And so I think we're very positive or very bullish on what the take rate is going to be and the attach rate is going to be. We have had a few Vantage sales that had ACA attached to them, and it was pleasing to see the attach rates of ACA in addition to kind of the traditional time and attendance benefits administration, et cetera. So again the caution here again would be on $10 billion in revenue and $1.5 billion in sales, if you want to -- our sales plans for ACA for this year would not be something that would register on your radar screen. But call it, 12, 24, 36 months out, it could be an important element of our sales growth, which we will -- if it gets to that point, we will obviously let you know.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just as a follow-up, you talked about the improving client retention. I think you've talked about 2 things that have helped are maybe the cloud-based system and a little bit easier comps. Is there anything else that's changed that's helping you improve retention in terms of maybe comp or how you're going about interacting with clients?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think that one factor that I probably should have mentioned earlier, and I'll say it now, is one of the ways that I've described it to some of our associates internally as to why and one of the reasons we wanted to move aggressively on these migrations is I described our situation a few years ago as our competitors are really fishing in an ocean when they were competing against us in our legacy platforms. Then it was kind of started to reduce that ocean to a lake in terms of taking clients that were, in my opinion, vulnerable. As a result though, they're still getting good service and still getting solutions that help them with whatever needs they had, but it didn't have kind of the consumer-grade experience and the ease of use that I think some of our new platforms have and didn't have the integration. And so we went from an ocean for people to fish in, our competitors to fish in, and I would say these are competitors in both the low end and the mid-market, and in some cases, in the high end but mostly in the mid-market and the low end. And we took that from an ocean to a lake. And I think we're getting close to the point where we're going to reduce their fishing area to a pond. And I think that is part of what you're seeing in terms of the retention rates that I think we are in a better position -- we're in a much better position offensively in terms of our product set, but we're in a much better position also defensively in terms of being able to protect our client base.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up a little bit on that in terms of taking the ocean down to a pond. Can you talk about the migration that you would anticipate on the upper end in terms of moving to Vantage, how long you think that would take? And how do you -- how are you -- the commentary that you made about the ocean to the pond, does that apply to the upper end? And then...","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Not yet.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So when would that -- when would we start seeing that apply? And then secondly, you've gotten a lot of new logos on Vantage. Who are you taking them from?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So I think that we -- again we hate to be boring, but we have a lot of detail around where we get our clients from in the upper market because they're obviously specific clients. They're big enough that we know them specifically where they come from, what they were using before. We also have the same information for clients that we lose. So we have our wins and we have our losses, where they go. And unfortunately, there really isn't -- I think I said this numerous times and it hasn't changed that there really isn't one specific competitor or category even. So we take our fair share of kind of on-premise software, but we also take our fair share from other cloud-based outsourcers like us. And so there's really -- I wish I could tell you that there's a specific pattern, but there isn't, which is a good -- in my opinion, is a good thing, because we don't see any one competitor that is creating an enormous problem for us. And we also don't see any one competitor where it's kind of easy pickings for us. So I think it's fairly balanced across the board. On your comment about Vantage and the upper end of the market, I do think that we still have work to do there to improve both our -- I mean, our offensive position, I think, is much better than it was. But we are working very, very hard and investing significant amounts of dollars in making sure that we have the same kind of situation competitively in the upper end of our market that we have in the mid-market and the lower end of the market. And at the risk of sounding too bold because I think, as you repeated it, it may have sounded a little arrogant and bold to say that we've created a pond now. That may have been a better term to use internally than it would have been externally because there's really no way for ADP to ever be a pond for people to fish in because we are the biggest and we have the largest market share without any question. So the question is not whether we will be viewed as a pond or an ocean, we will always be viewed as an ocean. The question is what will be the success of the fishermen in our ocean. And I think we have gradually reduced the success rate and we intend to continue to do that. But we will always be a very large target because we are very large. And by the way, we're pretty proud of that because I think that indicates we've been doing something right for the last 65 years.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I fully appreciate that, Carlos, and I fully understood what you meant by the pond. I was just wondering in terms of that migration, how -- is this -- would this be a 2-year, 3-year, 4-year kind of process? How should we think about that on...","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We've taken some actions to supplement our resources, our migration resources with, for the first time, with external resources. And we're not going to get into a lot of details about who or how. But it's a meaningful commitment with a third party to help us with acceleration of our migrations. And we will let you know as that progresses, how it's going because it hasn't started yet. And so we're optimistic that, that will help accelerate our progress. But frankly, we don't have anything to report now. We'll let you know as that moves ahead.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then one last one just on Vantage in terms of the new sales. Would you expect the new sales performance on the upper end to be as strong as it would be in the mid and the small for this year?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","In the mid and the low end of national accounts or in...","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","No, in national accounts, would you expect it to be a strong as it will be in mid and the small in terms of your plans?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Of overall ADP, yes, we do. In case it wasn't clear, in the first quarter, our national account of Vantage sales were a multiple in terms of growth rates of our mid and low end of market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'll be quick. Just on -- just wanted to ask about some takeaways that we got from the HR Technology Conference, which is that it seems like a lot of the SaaS and tech-oriented HR providers were starting to invest more on the servicing side with specialists, et cetera. And I'm curious if you're starting to see a little bit of convergence, like with ADP obviously missing greatly and technology doing a nice job there. But also on the flip side, the SaaS players are going to invest more in outsourcing elements. I'm curious if you're seeing that in the marketplace.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We haven't felt it or seen it because we don't -- I think that's something that maybe all of you would have a greater sense of, but we're happy to see that other people are seeing the value in our business model and coming to our way of doing business.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. No, I just wanted to check, figured you'd be a good person to check on that. And just for Jan, just on the FX side, obviously I know that you've mentioned FX could have some impact on revenue. But how about the sensitivity to earnings on FX? Can you walk us through what the sensitivity is there?","Jan Siegmund","Yes. Thank you for the question. The good part about ADP is that our expenses and revenues on the international sides are well aligned, so the translation risk that we have on the FX is moderated, of course, by having the 2 components of the P&L being parallel. So I said now FX rates can be volatile, so we don't really forecast them, and we take them as they come. But my comments were leading to we had minimal impact of FX in the first quarter. But at current rates, there could be some, I think maybe 1 percentage point or so if the rates were to stay where they are on the revenue side. But I don't think we would impact our bottom line forecast for overall ADP based on the FX impact. It's not as meaningful on the bottom line. So it was really a comment just made for revenue growth that there could be an impact, but it should not impact to the same degree or to a much smaller degree really on the bottom line for us.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So thank you for joining us today. As you can see, we're very focused on delivering against our HCM strategy. We're going to continue to combine our expertise and our technology strength. And I think hopefully it's obvious that we're in a great position to help our clients successfully manage their most important asset, their people. I also want to make one other comment, which is next week, I actually reach my 3-year anniversary as CEO. And I want to thank my leadership team and the 52,000 ADP associates for all that they do every day and all that they've done over the years because the one thing I've learned over the last 3 years is it's a lot easier to sit around and prepare for conference calls and report results than it is to deliver the great results that we've had. So I want to thank all of them and specifically also my leadership team. And I want to thank you for joining us today, and we'll see you at the next -- and we hope that you will join us for the next conference call.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Sara Grilliot, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sara Grilliot - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Sara Grilliot, ADP's Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call and Webcast.","During our call today we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","Before Carlos begins with a discussion of the quarter's results, I'd like to remind everybody that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","So now let me turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call and for your continued interest in ADP. This morning we reported results for our third quarter of fiscal 2016 which included revenue growth of 7%, or 9%, excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation. In addition to this solid revenue growth, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions which is evidenced by our new business bookings growth of 13%.","While sales of additional Human Capital Management modules that assist with the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, compliance continue to boost our performance, we are especially pleased to see balanced growth contribution across our HCM portfolio. From further penetration of new applications into our base, to growth in the number of clients choosing our higher touch HR outsourcing models, we are seeing continued traction for our technology solutions and our robust service offerings.","During the quarter, ADP continued to focus on implementation of solutions that support ACA reporting requirements in the U.S. At the end of March, employers with 50 or more employees were required to send form 1095-C to each of their employees describing the health insurance available to them. This is the most significant employee tax filing form introduced by the U.S. government since the W-2 more than 70 years ago and it is significantly more complex for the employer to deliver. More than 25,000 clients ranging in size from 50 to 50,000 employees trusted ADP to assist them with ACA. As of March 31, ADP delivered nearly 10 million Form 1095-Cs to these client employees.","This endeavor was no small task. To put it in perspective, ADP processed nearly 60 million W-2 forms for the 2015 tax year, a form we have been producing for decades. The W-2 requires one system of record, the payroll system, and is therefore significantly easier to produce than the 1095-C which can require data from multiple sources. So as you may imagine, producing 10 million form 1095-Cs in the first reporting year of these new regulations was demanding for us and required a strong partnership with our clients. This is another example of the breadth of our capabilities in the complex world of workforce compliance, and I am very proud of the work our teams have done and will continue to do to help these clients navigate the uncharted waters of ACA reporting.","ADP's global capabilities also continue to be a differentiator for us. ADP first began offering global payroll services more than a decade ago, and we have continuously expanded our offering across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and the Americas. Last month we announced the expansion of our capabilities to seven additional locations including Angola, Tanzania and Zambia. Now in 111 countries around the globe, ADP is bringing our global clients the benefits of integrated payroll solutions from a provider they trust. This ability to support the payroll compliance needs of global firms managing businesses in locales with constant changes in the legal and regulatory landscape is incredibly powerful and unrivaled in our industry.","Now I'd like to give you an update on client retention. In the third quarter, ADP experienced a decline in retention of 30 basis points. We do believe the sequential improvement is a result of actions we have taken to strengthen our service capabilities. The talented professionals we have added to our service teams are now supporting our clients, and although we have an easier year-over-year comparison, we expect the client experience to continue to improve as these associates gain more experience.","Aside from our clients' interactions with ADP through service and implementation, a key component of the client experience is our technology. We believe that our strategic platforms deliver best-in-class HCM capabilities in each of the markets they serve, and clients on these platforms generally have higher retention rates than those on our mature technology. So we are continuing to focus on upgrading clients to our modern cloud solutions.","As we have previously discussed, we intentionally slowed the pace of migrations in recent months so we could best assist our clients with ACA compliance. With additional talent in place and the effort of ACA reporting beginning to slow, we intend to return to a migration pace that will enable us to complete our mid-market upgrades to the latest version of Workforce Now by the end of fiscal year 2017, which is in line with our previous expectations. Upgrading clients from mature technology is an important element for our strategy and the right thing for our clients.","Positive external recognition further bolsters our confidence in our product and service offering. Earlier this quarter we announced that Everest Group has once again named us a Leader and Star Performer in its annual Everest Group PEAK Matrix for Multi-Process HR Outsourcing Providers. The report cites the number of new deals, expanded global service delivery, success of our mobile solutions and the introduction of our analytics and big data solution called ADP DataCloud as evidence of ADP's continued commitment to providing an enriched scope of solutions to our global clients. It's flattering when influencers recognize our strategic progress, but it's even more rewarding when clients do.","I recently had the opportunity to spend time with many clients at our annual ADP Meeting of the Minds conference which we just held in Washington D.C. Each year we use this opportunity to update our clients on our developments and share where we are headed while listening and learning more about their challenges. What's clear is that these are challenging times for payroll and HCM professionals. ACA, globalization, regulatory complexity, the fight for top talent and changing workforce dynamics are all having a profound impact on how HR is practiced.","We have built our business to help clients through these challenges and many others. We are unique in our ability to deliver capabilities across the HCM spectrum from recruitment through retirement, for businesses of all sizes around the entire globe. This was on display at Meeting of the Minds, and the client response to our progress was gratifying.","And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our third quarter results.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, ADP revenues grew 7% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was driven by net new additions to our recurring revenue stream, including the impact of ACA-related revenue, which began contributing to our growth in the third quarter.","Earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, grew 9% or 10% on a constant dollar basis. This growth, while stronger than the first half of the fiscal year, continues to reflect additional costs related to selling expenses and incremental operational resources in support of new business sold.","EBIT margin increased about 40 basis points compared to 24.4% in last year's third quarter. Diluted earnings per share grew 14% to $1.17, and reflected a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago.","In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid more than $700 million in dividends and returned more than $1 billion through share repurchases in the first three quarters of this fiscal year.","In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 5% for the quarter or 7% on a constant dollar basis. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 30 basis points in the third quarter, and we remain focused on actions that will improve this metric. Our same stores pays per control in the U.S. grew 2.5% and average client fund balances grew 2% compared to a year ago or 3% on a constant dollar basis.","On a year-to-date basis we have seen a relative slowing in our pays per control metric compared with the 3% growth last year, which we believe is consistent with the U.S. economy reaching high employment levels. As a result of improving employment, we continue to see declines in state unemployment insurance collections, which have had a drag on client fund balances but at a lesser rate than last year. This, in combination with a weaker bonus season and the impact from client losses experienced in the first half, has put added pressure on the growth of our client fund balances for the quarter.","Our business outside the U.S. continues to perform well driven by the strength of our multinational solutions, which serve businesses of all size from small and mid-market clients to very large global corporations.","Employer Services segment margin declined about 40 basis points for the third quarter. This decline resulted from the impact of planned investments made in operational resources to implement the strong volume of new business sold over the last few quarters.","ADP's PEO posted another quarter of strong performance, with third quarter revenue growth of 16% and growth in the average work site employees of 14%. The PEO also delivered solid margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points in the third quarter, driven primarily by operating and selling efficiencies as we continue to see good execution and increased productivity.","I'm pleased with the progress we have made, and will now give you an update on our expectations for fiscal year 2016.","For the fiscal year, ADP still expects revenue growth of about 7% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. As a reminder, this forecast includes almost 1 percentage point of expected pressure from the sale of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred towards the end of the first fiscal quarter. For the Employer Services segment, consistent with our prior forecast, revenue growth is anticipated to be 4% to 5% or 7% on a constant dollar basis.","For the PEO, ADP is now anticipating revenue growth of about 17% compared with our prior forecast range of 16% to 18%. Our forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points is unchanged. We're now expecting Employer Services margin expansion up about 50 basis points compared with our prior forecasted margin expansion of about 75 basis points. Margin in the PEO is now expected to expand up to 75 basis points compared with our prior forecast of about 50 basis points.","We have narrowed our forecast for average client fund balances and are now expecting 3% growth or 4% on a constant dollar basis. We also now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to be about flat to last year compared with our prior forecasted increase of up to $5 million. This is the result of the lower interest rate environment from the softening of the global economy. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is still expected to be about flat compared to the $419 million in fiscal year 2015. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share are now expected to grow about 12% from the $2.89 in fiscal year 2015 compared with our prior forecasted growth range of 11% to 13%. On a constant dollar basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow about 13% compared with our prior forecasted growth range of 12% to 14%.","And with that, I now will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Our first question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the improved client retention methods \u2013 rates that you saw in the quarter. Can you maybe talk about how much the rate of implementation slowed versus the prior quarter? You talked about the slowing there. And maybe give us an update on in the mid-market I think you talked about 75,000 total clients and 45,000 on Work Force Now. Maybe an update on that 45,000 number, please?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Sure. I'll let Jan maybe put in a couple of stats also. But the \u2013 when \u2013 the slowdown in implementations was really around migrations, just to be clear. And I think after the first quarter, I think we mentioned that we had begun already to slow down some of our migrations. Now there continued to be some scheduled migrations that spilled over into the second quarter, so it was really toward the end of the second quarter, our fiscal second quarter, that we began to truly try to focus more on stabilizing our service organization and also our ACA implementations. And hence, this third leg that was putting pressure on us, and the third leg of the stool which is an important part of our strategy, but we felt like we could in the short-term slowdown in order to take pressure off of ourselves is what we did around the slowdown in the migration. And that's exactly what happened.","To put it in perspective, in the first quarter of the year our migrations were more than double at the same rate of the previous year's first quarter. We still did some migrations here in the third quarter, but I would say it was very, very low rates. And we got the desired impact, which is it allowed us to focus on the other things that we had from a volume standpoint on ACA, and also trying to redirect some of those resources to stabilizing our service environment. So I think that was \u2013 we did exactly what we had planned to do, and I think what we communicated, and I think we got the desired result.","As I mentioned in the first and second quarter, there's no scientific way to know how much each of those three things was putting pressure individually on our retention and our client service experience, but we basically had one that we had very \u2013 a lot of control over which is migrations, and we decided to slow it.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Maybe I'll add on the migration pace, Jim, for you. I think we migrated in March; we resumed the migrations, and I think it's in the thousand range. So the number of clients on the latest version for Workforce Now has not changed materially really compared to our last update. But we are still expecting to really complete the overall migrations in our mid-market onto Workforce Now to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2017, as we had always planned for.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful color. Thanks. And then maybe as a quick follow up. Can you give us an update on the migrations you're seeing in the up-market? Any rough metrics in terms of percentage of clients completed on that side?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think in the up-market, it's probably more a discussion around number of clients rather than percentages because I think it's just the nature of the business. And I think there we are, I think, moving ahead with plans in terms of a similar strategy to what we've had in the down-market and in the mid-market which is to get our clients onto our strategic platforms over time. But I think as we've said over the last couple of quarters, I think it's probably not helpful. And given that these are very identifiable clients, everyone knows who their names are, and most of our competitors know what platforms they're on, we don't believe that it's going to be fruitful and useful to get into a lot of detail around our schedules and which platforms and which clients we're migrating.","But you should take from the message that Jan and I just delivered on the previous question that you asked that we still believe this is the right thing to do, and the slowdown in the mid-market was really just related to all of the other moving parts that we had, not because we believe it's the wrong thing to do. So we're still on the same strategy. It's I think consistent with prior quarters. We believe that the migrations and the upgrades in the up-market are going to take longer than they have taken in the down-market and in the mid-market, but we're comfortable with that because that's just a different nature of the business in the up-market.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning. It's great to see the retention trend improving. Do you have any concern that it could get worse again as you ramp back up the migrations that have been slowed?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Obviously, like, one of the \u2013 as you know, new business bookings and retention are the two numbers that are not \"recurring revenue.\" So our business model is actually very stable, very predictable. And those two numbers are also relatively stable and relatively predictable, but they have more variability than the rest of our numbers. So we never try to forecast quarter to quarter or future quarters on either new business bookings or client retention for that reason. So it's clearly a possibility, but it's not our plan.","And so you can tell by our desire or actually our actions to reignite our migrations that we don't believe that that will be the case, and we believe that medium and longer term it's the right thing to do, which I think would lead you to the conclusion that the other factors like the high volumes of ACA and some of the service challenges we had around \u2013 which were related to ACA implementations and high volumes, the issues around inadequate service capabilities, I think, were also factors that contributed to our retention issues. And we don't think that it was only because of the client migrations, otherwise we obviously wouldn't be \u2013 we would be probably following a different path.","So I think we're confident that it's still the right thing to do. As you know, we had had been doing migrations for several years and had not had the same kinds of issues that we experienced over the past couple of quarters with regards to retention. So I think, again, no scientific evidence, but I think we have a lot of ways of triangulating to the point where we think it's fundamentally the right thing to do. We end up having more \u2013 higher attach rates for our HCM modules. Our retention rates right now are higher on our strategic platforms than our legacy platforms. There's a lot of reasons that point to the need and I think the advantages of continuing with the migration strategy.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then turning to margins, the ES guidance on margins suggests a pretty significant ramp year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Is that just the leverage on hires that you have already made? And are you now fully staffed up to higher migration in new sales, or should we expect to see that come up more?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, I think you're pointing out to one element as now the revenue stream of the incremental revenues gets really a full quarter. So you could see that. See that implicit revenue acceleration in the fourth quarter when you dissect our full-year guidance that we confirmed. That will help. And secondly, the most important factor is in the fourth quarter, we are anticipating -we have a high investments of selling expense in the last year's fourth quarter and an easier grow-over. So with the confirmation of our new business bookings growth of 12%, you can also see that we're not anticipating mathematically a blowout fourth quarter just because of that difficult grow-over, and that will help on the margins.","Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. I'm wondering if we could just talk a little bit about just the character of the business and how it's evolving. So given that the client base is mixing the bundled solutions, specifically ACA and PEO, since they're presumably growing at faster rates, should we be thinking any differently about how those clients scale differently than the traditional payroll business has over time?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Sorry. How those clients scale \u2013 in terms of...? Can you be a bit more ...?","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Well, I was thinking that since the ...","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","(23:26)","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'm sorry?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Is this directed towards margin?","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Well, I was thinking more in terms of revenue growth, but you could include margin as well. But I was just thinking that because they're buying more that is, say, for example their pays for control increase, that this business may scale a little bit differently than the traditional payroll business had grown.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think we have been, I think, communicating, I think, for several quarters and I think it's still true that the products that we have that have the richest bundles, and it's not just PEO, but it's also our mid-market what we call ASO and basically our BPO HR outsourcing solutions, they're all growing faster than our core business, and they all have now, I think, very positive dynamics in terms of their margin. Not that you were asking specifically about margin, but they're also I think now at a size, all of them individually and collectively, where we're getting good contribution I think to our margin, certainly from a dollar standpoint and in many cases also from a margin percent standpoint.","So I think that's why we like our position in terms of where we are around starting with our richest bundles, where it's really all-inclusive in terms of a full HCM bundle. The PEO is unique in the sense that it also has co-employment and provides healthcare and workers' comp. But some of our other very rich bundles also are very, very comprehensive and growing very robustly and scaling very well, and we've been able to handle those volumes and have gotten good leverage on the margin side.","And then as you come down to our more traditional products, as we have also communicated there, whether it's in Vantage or Workforce Now or even in the down-market, the attach rates continue to be better on new business than the penetration of our products in the base. So I think that also bodes very well for us from a revenue growth standpoint, and also from a margin leverage standpoint. So we're \u2013 I think we're happy directionally with where we're going and where frankly the market is leading us, which is demand for these solutions is clearly high versus kind of the traditional simple standalone payroll solution. We do sell simple standalone payroll solutions, but I think the market is leading us in the direction of more comprehensive solutions.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that. And then just going back, I think there was a question earlier about the up-market market. And recognizing sales cycles are long, it's still early, but could you talk a little bit more about your experience thus far, and just help us understand better what the competitive dynamic is there, and where you're seeing success versus where there are some challenges as you approach that market?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Well, I think the competitive dynamic in the up-market is not terribly different than the competitive dynamic in the mid-market and in the down-market, which is that it's competitive, and there is a lot of competition. But we're pretty happy with the progress of our Vantage platform there in terms of new sales. And we mentioned that obviously we're going to be methodical and careful in terms of our upgrade cycle in the up-market, which I think fits naturally with the nature of that business anyway. So, I mean, as you know, we have been investing heavily in all of our products, including in the up-market. But that also goes for Workforce Now in the mid-market, and we have made some significant investments over the years in RUN which is our down-market platform.","So it's hard to \u2013 I know it's a very specific question about the up-market, but it's hard for me to really single it out as having a different approach or a different strategy from the rest of our company because I don't think it is. I think it's we're on the same types of things.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And maybe if I add from which will substantiate this with the color on our new business bookings, we really tried to say that we had a balanced growth in the quarter and have experienced that actually for the last few quarters, and so the up-market is participating in the sales acceleration that we have seen for this year.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go head.","Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. This is actually Jay Hanna on the line for Gary today. I was wondering if you could shed any light on why we haven't seen more revenue acceleration just given the strong bookings growth over the previous several quarters, in particular this quarter as retention declined and we started the new calendar year. Thank you.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, I think, as usual, we have \u2013 you can probably mathematically as Jan probably has the math on the tip of his tongue, but I would tell you that just from an overall big picture standpoint, mathematically you can tell that the fourth quarter we have a decent amount of visibility given the nature of our business as to what is happening quarter to quarter, and I think the fourth quarter again when you exclude \u2013 which I think is the right way to do the comparison, you exclude the AdvancedMD comparable from the previous year, we don't have a lot of \u2013 I think in fact our current forecast is to not have much, if any, foreign currency effect in the fourth quarter. I think you normalize for all those things, and we're actually pretty happy with what our fourth quarter revenue growth implies.","And then the third quarter I don't think we were \u2013 it's not fair to say we were disappointed, because we are pretty happy. Whenever ADP's revenue growth incrementally moves up 1\/2 percentage point to 1 percentage point, which is when you \u2013 again you normalize for AdvancedMD and you normalize for currency, that's what happened. That makes us very happy. Because in a recurring revenue model, in order to accomplish that, you have to, as you just pointed out, you have to have strong new business starts, not just bookings, and you have to have either stable or improving retention. And that's exactly what we got. There may have been a little bit of calendar noise and a couple of other things in the third quarter that we don't see in the fourth quarter happening, and so we were actually pretty satisfied with kind of where we are, assuming that all of these things kind of hold that we have just communicated.","Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And if I can get one more in. I'm just wondering given the strong bookings growth related to the ACA offering. When that begins to slow, should we expect an overhang from that as that service offering kind of begins to fall off (30:23) begins to drop?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think that that was something that I communicated in last quarter's call, which is again based on our kind of sense of the business, our experience and our knowledge, it's safe to assume that if we have sold call it approximately half of the addressable market on ACA, we believe there is still a lot of opportunity in our client base. But obviously now it's half the opportunity that we had had in the previous year.","What we don't know yet is how people will react in terms of demand, because right now everybody is focused on getting the June deadline past them, in terms of the employer portion of the reporting which is the 1094. So it's really a little early for us to know exactly how much ACA demand we will or we will not have. And we've been very very transparent and very clear that it has provided tailwind. However, we have also been very clear that we would be satisfied and happy to communicate our sales results both for the quarter and the year to date excluding ACA. And that communication would lead you to believe that excluding ACA we'd be in the neighborhood of our long-term guidance around new business bookings. And so we believe this has been incremental. We hope we will get more of it next year.","But clearly the mathematics are such that it's going to create \u2013 I wouldn't call it a hangover or an overhang, but I would call it a very difficult compare that we as we get further along in the next couple quarters will be able to hopefully communicate a little bit more clearly in terms of what that exactly means when we provide guidance for the next fiscal year.","Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. The question is just going back to margins. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about sort of the longer term margin drivers with you altering the outlook for the two segments here on the margin side. Has anything changed longer term and more fundamentally? Do you see fewer opportunities in the Employer Services and more in the PEO on the margin front specifically? Thank you.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","No, we don't. I think that again when we have the kind of new business bookings growth that we have, because of the way our P&L works around implementation expense and commissions and selling expense, it puts a lot of pressure. So honestly I would probably say that I'm incredibly proud of the organization's ability to despite a very big ramp-up of expenses, some of which was related obviously to ACA both around new business bookings cost as well as implementation expense, I'm actually quite proud of the organization's ability to deliver based on our forecast for the fourth quarter what will be some margin improvement that is still kind of in the neighborhood of our long-term guidance.","So I think that leads me to believe that even though we still have a lot of investment we want to make in the business, I want to be very, very clear that we are managing all of the variables in our business, including the need to continue to invest in our technology, in our associates, and in a number of things.","But if in fact, as Jan said, if the fourth quarter our new business bookings growth because of the grow-over the previous year is smaller, that takes pressure off of us from a margin standpoint. The same would apply to next year if \u2013 we're not providing guidance in terms of our new business bookings growth for the next year, but mathematically, if we get back into the long-term range of our new business bookings, that will also provide tailwind and help take pressure off of our margin.","So again, without getting \u2013 I mean, I could go on for a long time in terms of how our business model works. But we feel pretty good in fact this year I think would give us a high degree of encouragement. It was hard, and people worked very, very hard on controlling all controllable expenses in order to still deliver the kind of margin improvement we are in the face of the increased costs we had. But it just shows the power of the business model, and I think the ability of the company to leverage its revenue growth.","Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Then just following up, just on the staffing up you did in this past quarter, just curious if you are fully staffed or completely right-staffed for the migrations and the efforts, or if there is still more incremental hiring to do? Thank you.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think one of the comments I made in my opening statement was around the \u2013 what we're looking forward to is we have added a lot of additional resources that are in the process of ramping up. In other words, going through training and frankly it's not just about training because that's a relatively short process, but it's just the way it works probably in most companies that obviously as a person becomes more tenured they become more effective and more productive. And so we do expect to have continued help from the resources that we have added. But in terms of head count, in terms of FP head count, we believe we are fully staffed and that we are where we wanted to be at this point.","Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Danyal Hussain with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, Carlos and Jan. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just talk about how the improvement in retention came in versus your expectations when you first set out and took action to address it? And at this point, do you still have a backlog for ACA implementation or are you fully caught up?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, so first a disclaimer. As retention fluctuates over the quarter and has seasonality in it and changes, so we generally think about it as a longer term type of trend. And I would say that the third quarter was right in line with our expected improvements for our full year expectations. So we just made the progress that we expected, and within the forecasting uncertainty that there is, we came kind of right out in that range. So we're pretty happy about that.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","You had a second part of your question? Do you mind repeating it?","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. It was just on the backlog that you had in the implementation.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We're still implementing ACA solutions. We have sold some ACA solutions for the next year. So \u2013 and we're working on completing the delivery of the product, which centers around the employee-employer part of the portion of ACA. So they're still in high gear. They're reaching out to clients. They're connecting, making sure that everything is going well. So that activity it has stabilized obviously, and the big push of the March deadline is behind us. But this is just going to be now part of our regular business.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then a second question is just on PEO. The spread between revenue growth and the average work site employee growth, it narrowed a bit in the quarter. So just wondering if there was deceleration of medical inflation or other pass-through taxes? Or is there...","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","(37:47) mathematically, that's actually an astute observation. The answer is actually related to my comment that we had in the balance growth comments of my portion. Unemployment Insurance rates have declined, and so as a consequence of that, the pass-through of that 38:07) rate has diminished the total revenue growth versus the processing revenue growth. So that's the biggest factor. A number of ins and outs. But nothing other structurally changing.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think without getting into the weeds, the state employment that Jan is referring to, which affects our balances, and also affects the PEO, is a tax that gets capped fairly early, depending on obviously your wage, but it tends to be a first quarter phenomenon. So, again, we don't provide quarter to quarter guidance, but if you were to see that narrowing that you observed would be more pronounced in the first quarter than...","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","In the first calendar quarter...","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","... first calendar quarter, sorry, than it would be going forward, just to help a little bit there.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks so much. I don't think anybody has asked about the pricing environment yet so let me be the first to ask that question. How has it changed if at all over the past quarter or so?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, we were expecting the question, and we have really no news to report. It is really unchanged. We are continuing with price increases of less than 1% in our revenue growth so we're executing against our long-term vision of price increases, also discounting environment is similar. It varies by segment a little bit over quarters and how we manage our sales force. But no structural change in the pricing environment.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think that's probably a good place also to mention because this is a question that we've gotten a couple times in the last couple quarters, given the client retention questions that, again, Jan and I spend a lot of time particularly when we have a full quarter to look at and then at the year to date numbers around wins and losses and competitors and so forth. And I think I was very, very clear that we have a lot of competition in every segment of our market, but we really don't have anything to report in terms of any major changes around individual competitors or, as Jan alluded to, people changing their approach based on pricing or other factors. So it's all kind of normal course and speed if you will, but with a lot of competition, obviously, which we've had for a number of years.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. And on to an obscure question on taxes. We noticed that you lowered your guidance for tax rates. I know it came in a little bit lower than expected for the quarter you just reported. Can you just give us a little color what's going on there, and should that be the new tax rate we use longer term? Thanks so much.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","No, you should not. These were one-time items that were actually in this case related to our prior bigger transactions on divestitures and the spin, so we just identified a little bit more opportunity that came in and that we hadn't forecasted.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Sure. This is Ramsey El-Assal standing in for Jason. When we look at the new business bookings, the healthy growth in new business bookings, how much of this is new business to payroll PEO versus competitive takeaways or versus cross-sell?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So the mix of our new business bookings is relatively stable, and it \u2013 for the total new business bookings picture is 50-50 approximately. So 50% of our new business bookings is generated by capturing new clients, and about 50% is generated by selling more product to our existing clients.","Secondly, I think in detail, we don't disclose the sales volume, our new business bookings volume to our PEO, but we have also in prior calls disclosed that about half of our business to the PEO is new clients and about half of the business comes from existing ADP clients that fuel the overall growth of the PEO. So we have kind these rules of 50-50 and they apply consistently and move actually very little quarter over quarter.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then in your Employer Services revenue, what percentage is now non-U.S.? Has that split between Canada, Europe, and other geographies changed? And I'm just trying to get an idea sort of as well in terms of whether there's been any shift in terms of the currencies you're exposed to, granted you're expanding pretty dramatically across the globe.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Since Carlos hasn't, let me answer that sub-question. Carlos mentioned it, but we don't currently at current rates, we don't expect FX pressure for the fourth quarter. A little less than 20% of our revenues are international revenues. That has been fairly stable over the last many years actually. And our largest exposure is the euro and the Canadian dollar. Those are the majority that you would want to watch.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.","Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Davis with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Stephanie J. Davis - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I know we have addressed this a bit for the mid-market, but can you talk to the mix of cloud versus legacy clients on a total company basis?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think on a client percentage basis, I think we were always \u2013 been careful to make sure that we communicate very clearly on this. Because we've moved all of our down-market clients onto our cloud solution, and that's close to 450,000 clients. So in terms of number of clients, we have about 500,000 clients that are on our cloud products, which are our strategic platforms. So percentage-wise, it's a very high percentage of our clients. But clearly from a revenue standpoint, that would be different because our small client's average revenue per client is much lower than our mid-market or our up-market. So I think, down-market a hundred percent of our clients, around 450,000, are on cloud.","In the mid-market, we have probably over 60% or so of our clients on our strategic cloud solution. And then in the up-market, I don't have that percentage offhand, and again that's one where you really look at it on a client by client basis. But I think that gives you a little bit of a flavor of kind of where we are. Our plan obviously is to continue the upgrades in order to continue to drive those percentages higher, but that gives you maybe a little bit of color.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yes, I think that's about it.","Stephanie J. Davis - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thank you for the color. Just one follow up on the retention side. With some macro employment improvements and the migration push, are you seeing any structural shifts in voluntary versus involuntary attrition mix?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We do monitor the factors that are cause for our retention, and if you take a multi-year look, which I think if you want to look at the economic factors that impact our retention, SPS is most affected by these economic factors new business foundation and other business are impacting our ability to sell and impacting our retention rate in SPS, and we had excellent retention rates in the down-market, partially aided by this improvement of the business environment overall.","That has been fairly stable for the last three quarters, and so we have not seen a big change in it. Our comments regarding high employment and the economy were more geared as a general notion to the expectations that we've had a very long positive economic cycle, and we see overall for the business potentially a slight slowing from a still growing trend basically. So it's a very nuanced comment that we wanted to make it's so ever so slightly we're coming closer to what some people would describe as a full employment in the economy.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And the comments were really more around pays per control growth rather than client retention. Even though I think as Jan was alluding to, obviously as the economic cycle matures, at some point there might be an impact on client retention. But for today, I think our comments were really directed at our pays per control growth, because I think the math is very clear there.","So what we have seen in past economic cycles is you could possibly go for a few years with a kind of full-ish employment type of situation which then impacts pays per control, but doesn't necessarily impact client retention. But clearly if the economic cycle turns, you know, we have been very clear and very transparent around how our business model works, particularly in a down-market, a negative economic cycle has negative impact on our client retention.","Stephanie J. Davis - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today's Q&A portion of the call. I'm pleased to hand the program back over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I want to thank you for participating today. I just want to reiterate how proud I am of the organization's ability to get our solutions implemented on ACA compliance. Other than back to Y2K during my tenure here at ADP, this has been probably the most challenging time in terms of need to ramp up resources in terms of implementation and service and be able to absorb the new business bookings that we have had over the last several years.","That was a lot of hard work and a lot of dedication on the part of a lot of associates, and I want to thank them specifically for everything that they did for our clients.","It's \u2013 I don't know if it was clear in the call today, but when you look at our strong new business bookings, which now when you look at the compounded growth rate over the last five or six years in double digits coupled with the improving trend on retention, what we've been able to do in terms of these ACA implementations, and despite all that deliver decent margin improvement, it's really a lot to be proud of. So I want to thank all the associates across all of ADP for their hard work and contribution to the success that we had this quarter.","And I want to thank all of you for joining us today, and I want to thank you for your interest in ADP.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

My name is Ben and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Webcast. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Sara Grilliot, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sara Grilliot","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Sara Grilliot, ADP\u2019s Vice President, Investor Relations, and I am here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Jan Siegmund, ADP\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","Thank you for joining us for our first quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call and webcast. Before we begin, you may have noticed in this morning\u2019s earnings release that we are now including a condensed statement of cash flows to assist you in updating your models ahead of our quarterly 10-Q filing. We will also discuss certain growth measures on a constant dollar basis, which adjusts for the impact of foreign currency. You will see similar comparisons in this morning\u2019s earnings release and in our SEC filings. In addition with the introduction of long-term debt to our capital structure during the quarter, we are moving away from a discussion of pre-tax earnings and pre-tax margin and will instead discuss earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT and EBIT margins. We believe this change best reflects the operating performance of our business.","For ADP, EBIT includes interest income and expense associated with our client funds extended investment strategy, but excludes all other interest income and expense incurred such as interest income earned on corporate funds outside of the client fund strategy and interest expense incurred on long-term debt. Since the client funds extended investment strategy is a fundamental operating component of our business, we believe this approach best measures our operating performance.","During our call today, we will reference these and certain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. To begin our call today, Carlos will start with some opening remarks and then you Jan will take you through the quarter\u2019s results and an update on what to expect for fiscal 2016.","I would like to remind everyone that today\u2019s call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","With that, I will turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos Rodriguez","Thank you, Sara and good morning everyone. This morning, we reported our fiscal quarter \u2013 first fiscal quarter 2016 results with revenue up 6% or 9%, excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation. In addition to the solid revenue growth, we also continued to report very strong new business bookings performance, which grew 13% in the quarter. We are off to a good start. And as a result, we now anticipate full year new business bookings growth to be up at least 10% compared with our prior forecasted range of 8% to 10% growth. We have solid momentum as we delivered client-driven innovation that leverages our scale and deep HCM expertise to win in a competitive industry. Our ability to meet a wide range of client needs with leading solutions is unique in the industry and gets stronger everyday. I would like to give you a few examples.","Last quarter, we told you about our introduction of ADP DataCloud, which leverages ADP\u2019s unparalleled data to deliver workforce analytics that help boost productivity, develop talent, increase retention and identify potential flight risk. More than 1,200 ADP clients are already taking advantage of these analytical capabilities. Earlier this month, we reduced benchmarking capability to the DataCloud analytics platform. This new benchmarking solution provides users with unique insight from real and optimized up-to-date data. With many companies experiencing a word for talent, this new tool will provide HR teams with key industry workforce metrics for quickly identifying changing market trends. We believe that access to the right information at the right time will help companies create successful, engaging work environments.","You have heard us talk about the breadth of our portfolio in terms of serving clients and their employees from hire to retire. On the front end of that continuum, I am proud to share that Forrester Research recently named ADP a leader among talent acquisition vendors that help clients proactively search for, find and nurture job candidates. And for those new employees hired by our clients, we just introduced a new on-boarding solution that harnesses human resource data to personalize the on-boarding process. We are really excited about this new product as on-boarding is often characterized by mountains of paperwork and a lack of understanding about an employee\u2019s new role, team and culture. This new on-boarding solution, a product of our Innovation Labs, delivers a simple, enjoyable on-boarding experience that helps get new hires positioned for success before their first day on the job and it\u2019s another example of how ADP is innovating across the HCM spectrum.","Let me turn now to the Affordable Care Act. ADP has decades of experience in helping clients of all sizes, meet the challenge of new compliance requirements. Since the ACA was enacted in 2010, our approach has been no different. Our Health Compliance solutions have been particularly well received in the market and their adoption has outpaced our internal expectations. But while we are excited about the business opportunities, ACA has created for ADP let me be clear this is not easy work. We have added significantly to our implementation organization to address the demand and we have teams working around-the-clock to get our clients live on our ACA solutions. We are pleased with the progress we have made and proud of the many associates who are showing extraordinary dedication to help clients navigate these uncharted waters.","The high demands on our implementation and service organizations will continue and I am confident that ADP is able to deliver on our client commitments. To deliver on these commitments, we told you that we will continue to invest in our business to convert these new sales to recurring revenues. We are confident these investments will reward us with profitable revenue growth and even deeper client relationships over the long-term.","Another way we are helping clients manage the cost of compliance of healthcare reform is through our new ADP private exchange offering, which we introduced in August. ADP\u2019s flexible private exchange enables employers to build and implement a healthcare insurance exchange strategy that can help control cost and engage their employees. The solution delivers an end-to-end exchange experience for the employer, including an engaging retail-oriented shopping experience, defined contribution plan administration, public exchange enrollment, ACA compliance, and spending accounts. All of this is integrated with and powered by our broader set of HCM solutions. Once again, we have brought our technology and expertise together in a way that\u2019s meeting an acute client need at a time when businesses are raising to adapt to changing regulation.","Separately, I am proud to share that our ADP Marketplace won two prestigious designations from Human Resource Executive Magazine including Top HR Product of the Year and Awesome New Technology. We were excited to have received these recognitions at HR Tech in Las Vegas last week as they provide some nice validation for our client-centric view of enhancing HCM capabilities. We are excited about the potential for this platform to make it easy for clients to extend the value of their investments in ADP\u2019s HCM solutions while helping us strengthen client relationships. Innovation is a job that\u2019s never done and we are proud of our progress.","Before I turn it over to Jan for a discussion about the quarter\u2019s results, there are a couple of things that I would like to mention. First, during the quarter, we executed on our strategy to enhance our capital structure through the issuance of $2 billion in senior notes, which are intended to fund incremental purchases of shares over the next 12 to 24-month time period. This action is consistent with our communication at our March Investor Conference when we acknowledged our leverage capacity available within our AA credit ratings category and our intention to be thoughtful in our approach to changing our capital structure. These actions, the debt issuance and the share repurchases, are intended to enhance total shareholder return over the long-term.","Second, I would like to take a minute to talk about client retention. Our client retention has been at ever increasing historical highs for the last several years, leveling out at 91.4% over the last two fiscal years. This is a very solid performance that we have been very proud of, so we are naturally disappointed to see a decline of 160 basis points in the first quarter. We take client retention very seriously and are highly focused on this key metric. Some client losses were anticipated of course, given the anticipated churn that comes with moving clients from legacy platforms to our new cloud based solutions. However, we were disappointed to see an elevated level of losses from clients on mature technology.","In addition, there is a lot of activity in the marketplace right now as clients choose providers to help them comply with ACA. Clearly, we have experienced benefits from that activity through higher new business bookings, but the increased level of implementation activity of ACA solutions combined with the movements of clients to new platforms, has put higher demands on our service organization. We know we have opportunities to enhance the client experience to ensure our customers recognize the value of great software and services that ADP delivers. And my team is squarely focused on these opportunities. And I have full confidence, given our track record and our team\u2019s ability to execute.","We are off to a good start, but we have a lot of work ahead of us in fiscal 2016. The challenges of ACA compliance have impacted our clients and are causing some disruption both in the market and within ADP as we sell and implement these new solutions and also prepare to answer the many calls and increase we expect to receive from our clients in the coming months. We have increased our forecast for new business bookings and along with that comes increased cost not only in the form of selling expenses but also in operational resources to install and support this new business. As a result, we are now expecting to be at the bottom end of our forecasted range of 12% to 14% for earnings per share growth. So as I said, we have a lot of work in front of us and likely some challenges ahead, which may require some further investments. But I firmly believe that as we successfully execute against our strategy, we will continue to drive long-term results for our clients, our associates and our shareholders.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Jan for a further review of the first quarter results.","Jan Siegmund","Thank you very much, Carlos and good morning everyone. Before I begin, during the quarter, we sold our AdvancedMD business and realized a gain of $29 million. The results of this business, which historically were reported in the Employer Services segment are not reported as discontinued operation and have been moved to the other segment for comparative purposes both in the current period and all prior periods presented. The restated segment amounts can be found in the supplemental schedules on our Investor Relations website. My comments on the quarter\u2019s results and our fiscal year 2016 outlook exclude the impact of the $29 million gain on the sale of this business.","ADP revenues grew 6% in the quarter or 9% on a constant dollar basis. Earnings before tax \u2013 interest and taxes or EBIT grew 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This growth is inclusive of investments we have made during the quarter to increase operational resources in support of product implementations. EBIT margin increased about 10 basis points compared to 17.5% in last year\u2019s first quarter. Diluted earnings per share grew 10% to $0.68 or 11% on a constant dollar basis and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. And as Carlos mentioned, our new business bookings started strong for the quarter with 13% growth. Overall, our results in the quarter were good, yielding solid revenue growth despite continued headwind from foreign currency translation. And as anticipated, earnings growth was slower in the quarter due to expected investments in the resources to implement HCM solutions that will add to our future recurring revenue growth.","In our employer segment \u2013 in our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 3% in the quarter or 7% on a constant dollar basis. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 160 basis points for the quarter from elevated losses in legacy client platforms. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.3% in the first quarter. This is slower growth than we have seen in the past several quarters. However, we still expect to see 2% to 3% growth in this metric for this year. Remember that one point of growth in pays per control contributes about $20 million in total revenue to ADP. Average client fund balances grew 3% compared to a year ago or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions of net new business and increased wage levels compared to the prior year\u2019s first quarter.","Outside U.S., we continue to see solid revenue growth and margin growth driven largely by the success of our multinational solutions, which continued to perform well. Employer Services margin declined about 50 basis points in the quarter. The decline is largely in line with our expectation and reflects increased selling expenses and investment and implementation resources to install and support ADP Health Compliance solutions. The PEO continues its track record on solid performance, posting 18% revenue growth in the quarter. Average worksite employees grew 13% to 389,000. A portion of the 18% revenue growth was driven by increased benefit costs and higher benefit plan participation from our worksite employees during the quarter. We believe this gap has \u2013 between revenue growth and worksite employer growth, which have consistently ranged between two and three points per quarter will return to normalized levels for the balance of the year.","Along with this revenue growth, the PEO delivered margin expansion through lower selling expenses and operating efficiencies, expanding margins by approximately 130 basis points in the quarter. Both of our segments performed well in the quarter and as Carlos mentioned, we are off to a good start, but we also have some opportunities and challenges ahead. As a result, we have revised certain aspects of our full year fiscal year 2016 outlook. First, as Carlos mentioned to reflect the strong start we had in new business bookings, we now expect bookings growth of at least 10% compared with our prior forecast of 8% to 10%.","With the divestiture of the AdvancedMD business, which was included for the full year in fiscal year 2015, but only two months of fiscal year 2016, we have reduced our revenue expectations for the year almost one percentage point. As a result, we are now forecasting revenue growth of 7% to 8% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 9%. And just as a reminder, because of continued negative pressure expected from foreign currency translation as well as timing of recurring revenue starts from new business bookings sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, revenue growth is expected to be below the guidance range in the second quarter and above the guidance range for the third and fourth quarter.","On a constant dollar basis, our total revenue growth is anticipated to be 8% to 9%. Our revenue growth forecast for the Employer Services and PEO remains unchanged. However, I would like to remind you that we anticipate two points of negative impact to Employer Services revenue growth in the second quarter from foreign currency translation and about two percentage points for the full fiscal year. Consistent with our new approach of discussing EBIT margin expansion compared with our prior practice of discussing pretax margin expansion, we will now be providing a forecast for EBIT margin expansion.","For fiscal year 2016, consistent with our prior forecast of 50 basis points of pretax margin expansion, we anticipate adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points from 18.8% in fiscal year 2015. Our segment margin expansion forecasts for the year are unchanged. For the client funds extended investment strategy, we have lowered our forecast due to revised market expectations, which now assume a delayed increase in the Fed funds rate as well as lower fixed income new purchase rates compared with our prior forecast. We are now anticipating that client funds interest revenue will increase up to $5 million compared with our prior forecast of an increase of $5 million to $15 million. The total contribution from the client fund extended investment strategy is now expected to be about flat to last year compared to our prior forecast of an increase of up to $10 million. The details of this forecast are available in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","For the fiscal year, while we still expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 12% to 14% compared to the $2.89 in fiscal year 2015, we now expect this growth to be at the lower end of the range. On a constant dollar basis, our adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be 13% to 15%. This forecast includes $43 million of additional net interest expense anticipated from the $2 billion in senior notes issued during September as well as the expected impact of share repurchases in fiscal year 2016, which I assumed to be completed ratably over the next 24 months. Together, these items are not anticipated to have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share for the year. The forecast does not contemplate further share buybacks beyond anticipated future dilution related to employee benefit plans, although it is our intention to return excess cash to shareholders depending on market conditions.","And as Carlos mentioned, we have a lot of work in front of us, particularly in the second quarter as we install new solutions and prepare to support our clients in their efforts to comply with ACA. We have on-boarded more than 500 associates in the first quarter and engaged third-parties to assist with our implementation efforts, but the majority of this expense will ramp in the second quarter. This investment combined with lower anticipated revenue growth continuing into the second quarter from the effects of foreign currency is expected to result in EBIT that is flat compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. We believe the adjustments we have made to our fiscal year 2016 forecast reflect the challenges and opportunities that we have in front of us, but we also acknowledge that changing factors such as higher than anticipated new business bookings or higher client call volumes related to ACA could put a short-term strain on our earnings growth. There are many factors at play in the market and with our clients, which could cause risk in achieving our full year earnings forecast. However, we believe that delivering on commitments to our clients and focusing on our strategy will yield the best long-term results for ADP.","So, with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Anthony Cyganovich","Hi, this is Anthony Cyganovich on for David. How do you think about balancing the above trend growth in global new business bookings with the expense associated with implementation?","Jan Siegmund","I am sorry, the question is related to global \u2013 you mean to bookings outside of the U.S.?","Anthony Cyganovich","No, overall bookings.","Jan Siegmund","Yes, I mean, I think we have, I think for decades we have always taken the position that we will take as much business as we can get from a bookings standpoint. So, when you look at the lifetime value and the discounted \u2013 the present value of discounted cash flows of our clients given our retention rates, especially in the mid-market and the up-market, we basically have to take all the business we can. So, we have always been willing to sacrifice short-term profitability in the form of additional implementation and service expense in order to add additional \u2013 and implement new additional bookings and raise our revenue growth. And that\u2019s really what has been happening over the last three or four years, so that we clearly have had greater tailwinds in the last few quarters than we have seen for a while. But just want to remind everyone, we have had double-digit sales growth on a compounded basis here now for four years and that\u2019s what\u2019s really helped create this \u2013 in our world, accelerating revenue growth, which is in 0.5 point to 1 point increments at a time per year. So, our revenue growth is kind of slowly inched up and when you look at it on a constant dollar basis, 9% growth through the quarter. And we believe that in the second half of the year we might be higher than that, because our guidance is very clear that we expect to be above the guidance range. Those are pretty strong revenue growth numbers for ADP and it\u2019s driven by new business bookings that we have been able to generate over all these years and now we are in a situation where we have even stronger new business bookings and we are going to continue to do the same thing, which is we are going to take it all and we are going to implement it all.","Anthony Cyganovich","Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. Just a follow-up, can you talk about the pipeline of new products you intend to introduce in Employer Services and PEO over the next 1 to 3 years?","Carlos Rodriguez","This probably is not the best forum to do that. From a competitive standpoint, I think we have \u2013 the things that I talked about in my introductory statements, I think probably give you a sense of kind of some of the direction that we are headed in which is really providing a lot more insight through data analytics for our clients in order to help them run their businesses better, hire the right people, retain the people, pay them the right amounts and there is all very, very powerful insights that can be gleaned from the data that ADP has. And I think we have known that this is a competitive advantage for us and a differentiator. And we spent the last two or three years really building, I think the products and I think DataCloud and some of the analytics that we are building on that platform, I think are going to provide those types of tools for our clients. So, we are working on a few other things that we are really not ready to talk about just yet, but we \u2013 if you look at our balance sheet and you look at our P&L and you look at our statements, I think you will be able to glean from them that we are investing a lot in R&D and in product development.","Anthony Cyganovich","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of S.K. Prasad Borra of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","S.K. Prasad Borra","Thanks for taking my question. Carlos, could you provide some color on the specific products and services which are driving this new bookings growth? And is it largely driven by ACA or would you say that some of your new platforms whether it\u2019s the advantage or RUN they are also seeing some increased traction?","Carlos Rodriguez","I think it\u2019s a combination of both. I think that we are selling some standalone ACA solutions in our up-market space, but most of our ACA new bookings and sales are associated with either existing clients or new clients that have our broader HCM solutions. So, it\u2019s probably safe to say that the ACA sales are being told by our HCM solutions and some of our HCM solution sales are being pulled by ACA. So, it\u2019s probably a combination of the two. So, we had \u2013 I think just to reiterate, we said in the fourth quarter and for the year, we have really across the board strong new business bookings in all of our segments, in all of our strategic platforms without ACA included. I think in the first quarter, we came off of a very, very strong fourth quarter sales and I think we have \u2013 again, for several years, have been talking about how the way our incentives work from a sales standpoint, but it\u2019s somewhat difficult to maintain the momentum into the first quarter when you have such a strong finish, yet we were able to do that. And I think it\u2019s safe to say given the way Jan described it in his comments that ACA helped with that. Under normal circumstances, you probably would have expected in the first quarter and we would have expected kind of just by historical standards mid to low single-digit new bookings growth without kind of the extraordinary tailwinds that we got from ACA. And I think that\u2019s probably a general \u2013 it gives you a general gist of our comments, but we are actually \u2013 in the context of what we know about how ADP behaves and how our sales force behaves and the incentives drive things, we are very pleased with our first quarter new bookings growth, excluding ACA and including ACA.","S.K. Prasad Borra","Okay. And just a follow-up, how should one think about the profitability of this increased sales related to ACA? Is it a combination of the PEO business or the low margin PEO business primarily or would you say that some of the more profitable segments like time and attendance and other solutions are also benefiting from this?","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes. The \u2013 keep in mind we are selling these ACA solutions as a bundle and so assigning profitability is always a little bit tricky, but our business cases and our plan is to have the margins of the ACA modules to be right in line with our other good functioning products like that you mentioned. So, I would not see any meaningful impact on our overall margin characteristics from them. Other than they are right now growing and have to carry of course implementation and sales cost. But, the ongoing, if you would like the contributing margin of these products is right inline with what we have in our portfolio.","S.K. Prasad Borra","That\u2019s great. Thanks Carlos. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Frank [indiscernible] calling in for Sara. Follow up on the strong new bookings, is there any way you can breakout how much was driven by the ACA compliance versus non-ACA solid work?","Jan Siegmund","We don\u2019t really breakout in detail, the product components that we have. It was a contributor to the 14%, but as Carlos said, on a typical quarter our internal plans for calling, we would expect after a strong fourth quarter kind of mid to high single digit sales growth in first quarter and we really accelerated across the board. So that\u2019s kind of what we say. So it was not the majority of our sales growth quite the opposite actually our core strategic platforms sold well and had nice growth rates in the quarter, multinationals had a great success stories this quarter. So, it was a broad-based acceleration of \u2013 of new business bookings. And ACA had a trigger event to that, so it\u2019s hard to separate it also analytically because, people that buy ACA also buy HCM solutions in order to make it all work. So it is kind of combination and not, I think that\u2019s kind of honestly of what we can \u2013 really mostly analytically give you.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow up, did your guidance contemplate retention improving significantly through the rest of the year?","Jan Siegmund","While the retention is, is as a quarterly measure fluctuates and I mean Carlos gave detailed comments on the retention development. So, the \u2013 we also, I\u2019d like to mention in the first quarter prior year we had a large improvement, significant improvement in the quarter. So there was probably some catch-up in this quarter and a difficult compare and overall I think, we don\u2019t guide to retention, but I think there would be a mistake to think retention would continue at these levels.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Gary Bisbee","Hi. Just following up on that question retention, so Carlos, it sounded like in your commentary there were some, staffing issues or execution issues from the client service perspective. And I guess I just wanted to understand on the margin commentary for the company overall. Is that \u2013 is that basically just the on-boarding cost and sales commissions from the stronger bookings or is there also a component of, we need to fix something here to get this retention back on track. And specifically what type of cost would those be? Thanks.","Carlos Rodriguez","So, as various stood observation and I would say that we are \u2013 we did feel some pressure in certain areas of our business, but frankly we have other parts of our business where retention improved and margins were up and all is good. It\u2019s as usual it\u2019s a portfolio and we have different situations in different parts of the \u2013 of the business in the company. But the one thing that is absolutely clear again decades and decades of experiences that, despite our desire to migrate or to upgrade and migrate our clients to our newest and best platforms. This retention figure is very, very important to us. We are very fortunate that we have very, very strong new business bookings, which is offsetting some of the retention weakness that we have. But generally speaking that puts pressure on us, because obviously those, even if we achieve the same revenue growth we\u2019ve been accelerating our revenue growth, it comes with pressure on margin, because you have implantation cost and sales cost. And so, we\u2019ve been very, very clear about desire to accelerate migrations and we did that, and we may be did it a little too effectively. And so, I think we\u2019ve created some pressure in the system as a result of a significant increase in migrations year-over-year. At the same time when we were experiencing frankly, I would describe it as a not to overstated, but we were surprised by the volume of sales that we\u2019ve gotten as a result in some part, as a result of ACA compliance solution demand.","So, we have this combination of all those volumes that\u2019s coming in, while at the same time we were creating pressure in our implementation and service organization around migrations. And I think we\u2019ve, I think we took a pause and recognize that this is the right time to make sure that we are still pushing, we are not backing up for migrations, we have a lot of data that we\u2019ve looked out very, very carefully over the last two or three weeks that shows that the retention on our new strategic platforms is very, very high and is remaining in very high levels, because we have the ability to compare retention by platform, but also over time.","And we\u2019re very, very confident that our long-term strategy of moving these clients is the right strategy and it will end up creating the same outcome that we now have in our SPS business. But, you see the impact of what happened in the quarter, when you push a little too hard and you have other moving parts and other variables like ACA and overall strong bookings across the board. So, I think your observations are correct, they are stood, and we are doing whatever we can to stabilize here and make sure that we deliver on these commitments that we\u2019ve made to our clients on these new business bookings regarding ACA and at the same time, delivering our commitments to our existing clients who deserve to have the right level of service from our \u2013 from our service organization.","And so I think what you\u2019re seeing from a margin, I think the last part of your question was really around margin. We have added, I would say somewhere between 500 and 1000 people just as during the probably beginning before the first quarter and that\u2019s on effective basis we have this cost already in our quarter. And I think Jan was clear about that, that. As of today based on what we know today and the bookings growth that we have experienced so far, we believe that we have the proper expense in the plan to handle, the stabilization of our new starts for ACA as well as the needs to stabilize our service organization to handle the combination of the new volume as well as the migrations.","Obviously if were to experience additional incremental above what we\u2019ve guided, new starts we would have to come back and revisit. But, as of today, we\u2019re very very comfortable that we have addressed the issue and you can see that, we still have pretty good margin results despite what is frankly a quite a large investment that we\u2019ve put back into the business. I think that speaks to some of the underlying improvement and good execution that we\u2019ve had for several years around margin and expense control that allows us to ramp up, expenses to this level and still deliver what I believe are very respectable results that are still something to be proud of.","Gary Bisbee","Thank you. I appreciate the commentary.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David Grossman","Hi, great. Thank you. Sorry, just to follow-up on that last question and so if you look at the business than looking at the retention rate, it sounds like if you see all that the \u2013 the core issue is really one implantation complexity versus competitive losses that come with the churning if you will exposure that comes with the platform upgrade?","Carlos Rodriguez","I think I said it\u2019s both and we clearly, because we can see our retention rates by platform. We know where we have exposure and we have weakness and of course we have known that for years, which is why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing, because that is really I think ADP\u2019s vulnerability, I think to some of the comp which there is plenty of \u2013 there is plenty of competition out there. And I think that has been a vulnerability that we over the last three or fours have opted to try to close and I think I have used the analogy of kind of making sure that people are fishing in a smaller and smaller pond, when we create activity around migrations, particularly in the mid market and up market. A lot of fisherman comes even to a smaller pond and so, I think we\u2019ve experienced that some of that over the \u2013 over the quarter. But I also want to be clear that, I \u2013 in my previous answer that the, in addition to that the overall increase in activity and volume as put strain on our implementation and service organization. And they have done an incredible job over the last two or three months to get, a lot of this business that is \u2013 that has been sold in the fourth quarter started. And they are doing that, and they are doing a tremendous job, but they are working very, very hard under tremendous strain which is why we\u2019ve added additional resources to help them.","David Grossman","Okay. And just, follow up on Jan\u2019s comment about, the not to assume that retention would stay at these levels, is that contemplating that the increased capacity that you put in would help kind of alleviate some of the stress on the system that you are experiencing with current quarter?","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes. And I think what you see is the incremental resources are already doing their thing. So we see already these improvements coming through. So we obviously work very hard to retain every client that we can. And I gave you the typical compare, so the other factors in it we do not give guidance to revenue retention, but it would certainly be not our expectation to stay at this level.","David Grossman","Alright, very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, Carlos and Jan. This is Daniel Hussein [ph] calling in for Smitti. Just want to pry in a little bit more into retention. So I appreciate that you gave a good amount of color already, but could you just provide a little bit more detail about which channel saw the most I guess attrition. And I know you guys look closely at where your customers are going, so did any competitor or type of competitors stand out or was it just the usual suspect?","Carlos Rodriguez","It really as usual, I wish we had more exciting news to tell you because it would be easier for us to have one competitor. Theoretically it would be easier, but it is really not that kind of story like we really \u2013 by the way it fluctuates also from quarter-to-quarter. So we unfortunately don\u2019t have any news to report on that front. We don\u2019t have any specific competitor that is doing a lot better or a lot worse than last year and likewise, the same in the other direction. We usually have a very, very broad group of competitors. And remember, we compete against some competitors in the up-market, which are different from the ones that we compete in the mid-market, which are different from the ones we compete in the low end of the market. But again just to add, we have to be careful in terms of \u2013 we are not trying to help our competitors here on these calls. But I think we have given you a lot of information already. So when we say that we experienced a great deal of pressure in turnover as a result of migrations and we told you last quarter that we are done with our run migrations in the low end of the business, you could probably jump to the conclusion that we didn\u2019t have a retention problem in SBS or that maybe it even improved. But we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you that because we don\u2019t provide guidance by business unit. I think Jan also mentioned that once you get into the up-market, in the mid-market the comparisons do matter and we have a difficult compare versus last year\u2019s first quarter. But we are also trying to be transparent and share with you the information that we are seeing, which is this churn in our legacy base combined with what was enormous pressure on our service and implementation organization as a result of a large surge in business that I think with the benefit of hindsight, needed to have had additional resources to handle and we have those resources now in place.","Jan Siegmund","Maybe one last comment is, as you saw, we really left our revenue guidance intact and left it intact for Employer Services and just down ticked it for the divestiture of our AdvancedMD business, which tells you also that we are confident about achieving the revenue number in the framework that we are guiding to, which contemplates of course, client retention in the revenue model.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks. And then maybe just a quick question on the debt issue. At this point, would you characterize $2 billion as testing the waters or is this sort of at this point what you think your capital structure should look like?","Jan Siegmund","Yes. So we affirmed at our Investor Day and also during our debt IPO that we committed to our AA rating and solidly in it, as you know we have requirements that in our money movement and client fund operation that make a strong exceptionally strong credit rating very helpful. And so you should think of this as a one and a deal of $2 billion debt on our balance sheet.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good morning guys. Can you give an idea of \u2013 given the dates associated with the ACA regulation, how long \u2013 like, what you are anticipating the elevated bookings outlook to look like, how this will play out over the next four, six, eight quarters?","Carlos Rodriguez","I wish \u2013 this is all going to be somewhat speculative because we have never been through an ACA. As you know, this is a new law and its complex, and its been phased in over time and now there are some real pieces, if you will and real penalties and real requirements with forms and so forth that kick in on January 1. But we have never seen this before. And so it\u2019s hard to imagine, but some of the things that we are looking at as an example is what percentage of our client base has purchased or has taken the ACA solutions that we are \u2013 that we are selling. And the answer is it\u2019s less than half, significantly less than half. And so there probably is some additional upside. And I think there is two scenarios. One is on January 1, everyone stops working \u2013 worrying about ACA and our new bookings return to kind of our normal levels of 8% to 10% or somewhere in that range. The other scenario is that come January 1 or January 30 or the end of February, people worry more about ACA because all of a sudden, the reality has hit. And that continues to drive demand for our solutions but also the solutions of some of our competitors and other people out there. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle, it\u2019s hard to believe that there will be no additional interest or demand for ACA compliance or HCM solutions that help with ACA compliance post-January 1. But we really would literally be speculating if and guessing as to what those levels would be. And you just saw what happened over the last six months which is that we kind of underestimated and under guessed the level of activity and demand for these products. And in theory, we should have known better and now we are going to be a little \u2013 probably a little bit more vigilant and make sure that we are prepared if we would have to continued demand at the levels that we are seeing today.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. And then on that to follow-up, can you give us a little bit of a temperature check on the PEO business, which continues to churn along very strongly, is primarily what you are seeing there are still Greenfield sales or are you sort of benefiting from some of the struggles with some of your competitors in that area?","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes. Traditionally, ADP\u2019s PEO has grown from two sources of leads from our own client base and Greenfield clients. And the mix of that has been balanced and it continues to be very balanced. And the execution in the PEO is extremely solid and is a very competitive product. So I think we are seeing just a continuation of a trend, nothing specifically to report relative to the competitive environment. We have been the market leader with a superior product for very long time and execution and I think we are benefiting from that strength and continued to do so.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ryan Cary","Good morning. This is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick question on pays per control, I know you reiterated the full year expectation to 2% to 3%. It seems like the 2%, 2.5% in the quarter is a little bit lower than we have see in sometime, anything to reenter there or is just it bouncing around quarter-to-quarter?","Carlos Rodriguez","I think what we are seeing is a little bit of a maturing in the growth in labor market. In our case, I think we were kind of right in the middle of what we expected. So it has to do with the hiring situation of some of our clients. I think manufacturing energy slowed a little bit. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. I think this is more a general comment about what is your assessment about the overall economic growth in the labor market to be done and I think we had for many, many years strong, strong labor market. And it seems to be now a little bit maturing, still at a very good clip. So I am not too worried about it. I think it\u2019s kind of right in line of where we thought it would be.","Ryan Cary","Okay, great. And I just wanted to touch on pricing with my second question. First, could you talk about some of the trends you have seen in the quarter and then we are looking at the continued strong new business bookings we have seen over the several quarters, do you see pricing is the driver for any of these deal wins? ","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes. So in pricing, I think we have to analytically always separate what\u2019s happening in pricing in our base and what is happening in pricing on our new deals. And so I think with your question, you are targeting a little bit what is the pricing environment for new deals. And we monitor that very carefully and measure it as kind of at a relative discounting levels that we have in the business. And they do fluctuate as we also excise different sales strategies in different markets, but the overall mix and discounting levels stays the same. So, we do see a stable competitive environment relative to pricing. Relative to our base, we continue to execute a strategy that targets less than 8% of price increase in our base, which is consistent of what we communicated with you in our Investor Day earlier in spring and we are executing exactly along our plans.","Ryan Cary","Great, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jim MacDonald","Yes, good morning guys. I wanted to follow-up on Carlos\u2019 point about migrations being done for small business, could you talk about how many migrations are left in the other businesses that could impact retention?","Carlos Rodriguez","I think the guidance we have given in the past or I wouldn\u2019t call it formal guidance, but we have been talking about trying to complete our migrations in our mid-market by the end of fiscal year \u201817 and we are still on track to do that and that will have all of our clients on our current version of Workforce Now. We have made really tremendous progress over the last year. And I think we talked about in the last call that we had put in incremental resources to accelerate migrations and we did that very effectively, which as I mentioned also happened to put some pressure on us execution wise. But we have really made great progress. There was a platform in the mid-market called PCPW, which we are now down to, I think, it\u2019s 100 clients or less. So, it\u2019s a very big accomplishment, because that was a fairly large base in our mid-market space. And so we are just kind of methodically going through the same process that we went through in our small business division. I think someone reminded me just a few days ago the process in SBS of first stopping sales on the older platforms and then beginning the process of migration took a total of 5 to 6 years. And so these are not overnight. This is a recurring revenue model. We value client retention and we value our clients. And we do have to get off of these platforms, but we will not do it on anybody\u2019s timeline other than our own timeline when it\u2019s the right time under the right circumstances.","And I think we have a good plan that we have been executing in our mid-market and we are I think on track on that plan. In the up-market, we have said multiple times that it\u2019s a bigger challenge given the size of the clients and the complexity and frankly, the number of platforms we have. But I think there too, we have taken steps and built into this year\u2019s plan a good number of migrations over to our Vantage platform that we are starting to execute on some of that, whereas a couple of years ago, we had literally no migrations on Vantage, so then maybe we had a couple of year we have \u2013 I am not going to disclose exactly the number, but we have some number of migrations. By the way, these are all pool migrations for now, where the clients are lining up and want to be upgraded to Vantage. So, this is not a push or a forced migration at this point. And so I think it\u2019s safe to say we are on track in terms of our plans in up-market as well.","Jim MacDonald","Right. And as a follow-up, I hear you settle your spat with the benefits, but did that have any impact in the quarter or distraction?","Carlos Rodriguez","We had a lot of distraction, no impact.","Jim MacDonald","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Great. Thanks as always for all the details. Just one question for me. Just also on price, but I will ask it in a different way, just in terms of playing defense I get that you are more disciplined on pricing in general, but did you have potential to pull the pricing lever to protect your book from leaving as part of some of these migrations and you chose not to. Just curious what your tactic there was to try and actually protect that book as they transitioned?","Carlos Rodriguez","I think it\u2019s a fair question. I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think the truth is that this was not a pricing issue.","Tien-Tsin Huang","So, I guess this sounds means you don\u2019t want to elaborate on that?","Carlos Rodriguez","Well, I am sorry, what was the rest of the question?","Tien-Tsin Huang","Yes, I guess if it\u2019s not pricing, was it just sort of the change in desire to move to different platform or do you use a new service provider, I am just trying to better understand that?","Carlos Rodriguez","Well, I tend to choke on my words when I confess that we had execution channels, so if you could just let me off the hook.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Okay, fair enough. I am good. It makes sense. Thanks guys.","Sara Grilliot","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Rick Eskelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Rick Eskelsen","Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in here. Carlos, I wondered if you can go back and talk about analytics, you talked about that in your upfront commentary. Just wondering how you guys are pricing it and viewing it for clients? And how much is built in versus being sold separately to clients? Is it something that helps you win a deal or is it something that you are looking to actively sort of monetize here?","Carlos Rodriguez","I will answer on the pricing side. We have a number of modules that are incremental to our core HCM product. So, as you buy payroll, obviously and time and attendance benefits and others we have employee per month charges and incremental products like analytics is charged on an incremental basis also and comes in different flavors depending on how comprehensive you want to subscribe to the benefit \u2013 to the benchmarking and deep analytic services. So, yes, a short answer is it is an incremental per employee per month charge and we are planning to monetize it for the vast amount of our business.","Jan Siegmund","And everything we do is to help us win more business. So, I think that last part of your question clearly we do think that it helps differentiate us and helps us win deals.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you. Then just a quick follow-up. With your switch now to EBIT margins, are you going to be talking about the segments more in EBIT or still on sort of a pre-tax basis? Thank you.","Jan Siegmund","It\u2019s kind of the same really. There is no difference. We call it now segment margins, but those obviously do not include ES and PEO don\u2019t include any interest charges on the long-term debt. So, they are really unchanged.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.","Carlos Rodriguez","Thank you all for joining us today. As you could probably tell from our tone, we are really excited about the strong start that we had to the year and we are really happy with our momentum, especially in our new business bookings. You also probably heard our tone that we definitely feel like we have some challenges in front of us in terms of implementing all this new business, so that we really deliver on our commitments to our clients to help them comply with the new and complex healthcare regulations, but I think I also want to take this time to really thank all of our associates from sales, implementation and service for all the hard work they have done. It\u2019s been a very challenging 6 months and particularly, a challenging quarter in terms of workloads. And we appreciate everything they are doing and they are going to continue to do to build upon ADP\u2019s past successes. Thank you, again for joining us and thank you for your interest in ADP.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Gary Butler for his 37 years with ADP and especially for his tenure as ADP's President and CEO. With his guidance and direction, ADP successfully navigated the worst recession since the Great Depression. I'm also personally grateful for Gary's guidance and counsel over the years. ","As you know, I've been in this role for just over 2 months now, and I'm pleased to be here speaking with you this morning on my first ADP earnings call. I'll begin today's call with some opening remarks about our second quarter results. Then I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Chris Reidy, who'll take you through the detailed results, after which I'll return to provide you with an updated fiscal year 2012 forecast. And before we take your questions, I'll provide some concluding remarks. ","Now let's turn to Slide 4. As you read in this morning's press release, ADP reported solid results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, despite the mixed economy. Total revenues grew nicely at 7% for the quarter. Additionally, we experienced continued strength in our key business metrics. ","Starting with Employer Services. New business sales, the number of employees on our clients' payrolls and client balances all increased during the quarter. Client revenue retention did tick down in the second quarter due to a large client loss that we anticipated, although we were not certain of the timing. Although client retention is down slightly year-to-date, it remains at excellent levels. And, as you know, our third fiscal quarter is a particularly important period for retention, and we'll certainly update you further on the next -- on next quarter's earnings call. ","I'm particularly pleased with our new business sales results in Employer Services and PEO Services. New business sales grew 14% year-over-year, assisted slightly by recent acquisitions. And although we did not provide sales dollars on a -- and although we do not provide sales dollars on a quarterly basis, I think it's important to let you know that the dollar value of the sales in the second quarter reached an all-time high. ","We've been focusing on product innovation, both in internal development and through acquisitions that complement our existing solution set. This focus is clearly paying off with strong growth in new business sales, which are anticipated to increase our future organic revenue growth. We have also invested in the distribution -- in distribution and in client service, all of which are also having a positive impact on new business sales. ","It's also noteworthy that sales productivity is also improving. You may recall that productivity was significantly down over the last couple of years as a result of the recession, especially at the high end of the market. Our continued investment in our sales force, as well as in our solution set, meant that our market conditions -- as market conditions improve, we were well poised to benefit. And I believe this is well evidenced by the sales results across all of our markets. Small Business Services, National Accounts, DVS and GlobalView all achieved double-digit sales growth. ","ES International best-of-breed sales growth was also double digit. Our results there were mixed by country as the economic pressures continued, especially in Western Europe. Sales in Canada, Australia and Brazil were also strong. ","I'm pleased that sales in National Accounts grew double digit during the second quarter, driven by domestic GlobalView sales. I want to point out that the sales cycles are still very long at the high end of the market. And as you know, GlobalView sales can be lumpy due to their size. ","Moving on to Dealer Services. The automotive landscape in North America continued to stabilize as calendar year vehicle sales finished strong. I'm pleased that new business sales in Dealer Services were ahead of expectations in the quarter. Dealer Services worldwide revenue retention increased for the quarter, and Dealer Services revenue growth was 7% on both a total and organic basis, as Cobalt is now fully in the organic results as we lap the acquisition date in the first quarter. ","Before I turn the call over to Chris, I want to spend a moment on acquisitions. We're pleased to have closed 3 transactions since our last update. ADP acquired a provider of revenue cycle management services targeting small physician practices. We will provide AdvancedMD entry into the growing segment of physician-billing BPO solutions, making it a natural extension of AdvancedMD's growth strategy. ADP also acquired a provider of payroll and other compliance services in India. This acquisition supports our broader strategy to expand our global footprint across large and developing markets. And finally, in Dealer Services, ADP acquired a key supplier of digital services for our Cobalt and Dealix businesses. We believe this transaction will help enhance our new and used car lead generation. I'm confident that these acquisitions are the right investments, as we expect they will contribute to ADP's future growth opportunities. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Chris to provide the financial highlights and the updated full year forecast for our client fund investment strategy","Christopher R. Reidy","Thanks, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Let's now turn to Slide 5. Total revenues grew 7% to $2.6 billion, 6% organically in the quarter. Unlike the first quarter, where revenue growth included 2 percentage points from foreign exchange rates, rates were neutral in the second quarter. We continue to see a positive impact on revenues from strong new business sales growth and from acquisition activity that complements our solution set. ","Employer Services grew total revenue 7%, 5% organic, with good revenue growth across several products, including RUN in our Small Business Services marketplace, Time & Labor Management, HR Services and Major Accounts and ASO, which is our BPO for small to midsize companies. Pays per control in Employer Services in the U.S. continue to be strong, with an increase of 2.8%. Growth in average client fund balances increased 6% for the quarter, driven by new client growth, especially in Small Business Services, both in standalone Tax Filing, increased pays per control and increased state unemployment insurance taxes. ","PEO's strong revenue growth continued with 16% growth during the quarter, all organic. Average work site employees grew 13% during the quarter to over 251,000. ","As Carlos mentioned, Dealer Services revenue grew 7%, all organic, as we have anniversaried last year's Cobalt acquisition. Dealer Services is benefiting from strength in the North American automotive market. Transaction activity increased. Our win rates are solid, and retention improved year-over-year. Continental Europe is still a weaker environment, but we are seeing continued strength in the luxury brand market in Asia. ","Now let's turn to Slide 6 and continue with the highlights for the quarter. As you read in this morning's release, during the second quarter, we sold assets related to a third-party expense management platform that resulted in a pretax gain of $66 million, $41 million after tax and $0.08 of earnings per share. We now have a referral arrangement for new business with this third party versus the former reseller arrangement. We are treating this gain as a onetime item for comparative purposes. Although we have shown on this slide the year-over-year results, both including and excluding this gain, I'm only going to take you through the results excluding the gain. ","On that basis, pretax earnings increased 6% and net earnings increased 8%, with net earnings benefiting from the expected lower effective tax rate in the quarter. Diluted earnings per share increased 10% and benefited from fewer shares outstanding compared to last year's second quarter. ","ADP's pretax margin declined 25 basis points, but I want to take you through what negatively impacted the margin. Excluding a 30 basis point drag from acquisitions, ADP's pretax margin was slightly positive. Then if you exclude the 80 basis point drag from the decline in high-margin client fund interest revenues from lower yields, it was very positive margin expansion. ","It's important for you to understand that even though the year-over-year negative impact to margin is declining, as anticipated for last year's acquisitions, we do anticipate a larger negative impact to our third quarter margin for the acquisitions announced since our last forecast in October. I point this out because 1 of the 3 recent acquisitions that Carlos mentioned earlier occurred in our third quarter. There was no impact in the second quarter, and I want to be sure you include the impact in the third quarter. I believe that all of these transactions are great complements to our existing solution sets and should increase our organic revenue growth in the future but will negatively impact margins due also to the fact that they are small and need to gain scale to achieve overall ADP-like margins. ","I also want to take a moment to discuss the 120 basis point decline in Employer Services pretax margin in the quarter. Excluding an 80 basis point drag from acquisitions, Employer Services pretax margin was down 40 basis points. As you read in this morning's earnings release, the decline was also due to the year-over-year impact of higher selling and implementation expenses, investment in services and increased R&D spend. Our forecast of up to 30 basis points improvement Employer Services pretax margin for the full year is driven by a particularly strong fourth quarter, as we expect to fully lap last year's investments. ","Moving on, we repurchased 6.3 million ADP shares, fiscal year-to-date, for a total cost of about $305 million. Our cash and marketable securities position was strong at $1.5 billion at the end of the quarter. ","Let's turn to Slide 7.  And I'll take you through the updated forecast on the client fund investment strategy in support of the overall ADP forecast that Carlos will take you through in a few moments. Before I get into the details of the forecast, I'll point out that the objectives of our investment strategy remain safety, liquidity and diversification. ","At December 31, over 85% of our fixed income portfolio is invested in AAA-, AA-rated securities, consistent with the past 7 quarters. The duration of the portfolio remained 3.1 years at the end of the second quarter. We continue to base the interest assumptions in our forecast on Fed Funds future contracts and the forward yield curves for the 3.5-  and 5-year U.S. government agencies, as we do not believe it is possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the yield curve or the new bond issuance behavior of corporations. I also remind you that 15% to 20% of the investments are subject to reinvestment risk each year. ","Focusing now on the slide, you see a summary of the anticipated pretax earnings impact of the extended investment strategy, the client funds investment portfolio for fiscal 2012. We anticipate average client fund balances for fiscal 2012 in the range of $17.9 billion to $18.1 billion, which represents 6% to 7% growth. This is slightly lower than our previous forecast of 7% to 8% growth as our current forecast calls for less wage and bonus growth than previously anticipated. ","We have also factored in, through the end of the fiscal year '12, the continuation of the 2% Social Security or FICA tax holiday that was set to expire December 31 and has been extended. It's also important to keep in mind that while average client balances have grown 8% year-to-date, growth was very strong in last year's third and fourth quarters, in large part due to the January 1, 2011, increases in state unemployment tax rates, which we do not expect to recur to the same extent this year. Therefore, we anticipate tougher balance growth comparison for remainder of the fiscal year. ","We continue to anticipate a yield on the client funds portfolio of 2.7% to 2.8%, down 40 to 50 basis points from fiscal year 2011. However, due to the lower balance growth forecast, we anticipate a slightly larger year-to-year decline in client fund interest, $45 million to $55 million. As you can see at the lower right of the chart, in terms of the total pretax impact of the extended investment strategy, we anticipate a decline of $50 million to $60 million for fiscal 2012, about $5 million more of a decline due to the lower balance forecast versus last quarter. We continue to anticipate the overall yields from the net impact of this strategy to decline about 50 basis points from fiscal 2011's overall yield of 3.6%. ","Now I'll turn it back to Carlos to take you through the remainder of the forecast for fiscal 2012.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Chris. We're now on Slide 8. The performance has been solid. We do expect continued pressure on earnings and margins in the second half for the fiscal year from a continued low interest rate environment. We've been very active in executing against our M&A strategy, which will also put pressure on margins near term, but we believe will enhance ADP's future organic revenue growth. ","Now to the forecasts. Our forecasts exclude the gain realized in the second quarter on the sale of assets. We continue to anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 9%. I also want to remind you that we continue to anticipate that the impact from foreign exchange rates will become unfavorable during the second half of the year and will be about neutral for the full year. I'll remind you the euro today is hovering around $1.30, which is close to where it was a year ago, and an increase to over $1.40 toward the end of last fiscal year. Therefore, at current FX rates, we anticipate a negative impact to revenue growth of about 1 and 2 percentage points in the third and fourth quarter, respectively. As you know, a move in an FX rate is not as impactful on pretax earnings. ","We've adjusted the range of our diluted earnings per share growth forecast to exclude the $0.02 per share loss for the remainder of the year on the sale of assets in the second quarter. As a result, we now anticipate 8% to 9% growth compared to $2.52 in fiscal year 2011 compared to our prior forecast of 8% to 10% growth. As is our normal practice, no further share buybacks are contemplated in the forecast beyond anticipated dilution related to employee benefit plans, though it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders, obviously depending on market conditions. ","As Chris mentioned a moment ago, expected growth in average client balances is lower than our last forecast, and we anticipate a decline of $50 million to $60 million in pretax earnings related to the client funds investment strategy, as Chris just took you through. This translates to a drag of about 90 to 100 basis points on ADP's total pretax margin. Pretax earnings related to the client fund strategy are down less than $20 million year-to-date, so another $30 million to $40 million plus of expected decline is to occur over the next 2 quarters and will be a significant drag on total pretax margin. ","And before we move on to the segment forecast, I want to provide some additional directional comments regarding our third and fourth quarters. We stepped up investments during the second half of last fiscal year, most of which started in the -- at the end of our third quarter. These investments were in distribution, primarily for sales over-hires and also in service. As a result, we anticipate a $15 million to $20 million grow-over in expenses for these investments in the third quarter compared to last year's third quarter. ","I also want to point out that in last year's third quarter, there were some favorable pretax items that are onetime in nature that we don't anticipate recurring in this year's third quarter. These items in last year's third quarter totaled nearly $10 million and include a realized gain on the sale of securities among other things. So the takeaway here is that we expect a difficult year-over-year comparison for our third quarter, and the negative grow-over impact goes away in the fourth quarter, other than the drag from float. ","Now let's turn to Slide 9 for the segment update. For Employer Services, we continue to anticipate revenue growth of about 7%. We're currently forecasting pretax margin expansion of up to 30 basis points compared with our prior forecast of about 50 basis points expansion, due to slightly lower than anticipated growth in average client fund balances, lost earnings for the remainder of the year from the sale of assets in the second quarter and the impact of acquisitions closed since our last update. We anticipate an increase in our pays per control metric in the U.S. of about 2.5% compared with our prior estimate of 2% increase. ","We continue to anticipate about 17% revenue growth for our -- for PEO Services and, in PEO, anticipate a slight margin expansion compared with our prior forecast for a float margin -- for a flat margin in fiscal year 2011. We anticipate about 12% growth in the annual dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new business sales from the nearly $1.1 billion sold in fiscal year 2011. This is up from our prior forecast of 8% to 10% growth due to the strong sales execution and was aided slightly by recent acquisitions. ","And for Dealer Services, we anticipate 9% to 10% revenue growth, up from our prior forecast of 8% to 9% growth, due to additional revenues from the acquisition closed at the end of our second quarter. We anticipate pretax margin expansion of at least 50 basis points, up compared to our prior forecast of about 50 basis points. ","Turning to Slide 10. I'd like to leave you with some closing remarks before we open it up for questions. You can tell from our comments that we are very pleased with ADP's second quarter results. I think you'll agree that by most accounts, the economy is still somewhat mixed. And with that in mind, I am particularly pleased with our strong execution in sales. ","A priority of mine is to give the best innovative products to our excellent sales force. I believe our revenues are growing nicely, not only from the good sales execution, but from the investments we have made in our solutions for both internal R&D and acquisitions. ADP is a strong franchise with strong and consistent cash flows, which enable us to make these investments. ADP's cash position is strong, and we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. ","I'm pleased that ADP continues to be rated AAA by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's, with S&P reaffirming this past September and Moody's reaffirming just last month. ADP's AAA credit rating reflects the strength of our business model and of our balance sheet. I believe there's an opportunity for ADP to expand its market-leading position, both domestically and internationally, and I look forward to what the future holds for ADP. ","And now, I'd like to turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of David Togut from Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Carlos, can you give us some more granular insight on growth rates, both at Small Business, Majors and Nationals? You've got new products in each areas. Can you give us some insights on more on growth rate and more on competitive win rates versus, let's say, Paychex at the low end and the suite of competitors at the high end?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, on the -- obviously, the thing that we look for from a growth rate standpoint, in terms of as a leading indicator of sales, so I'll focus on that. I'm not sure if you meant revenue or sales growth. But on the sales front, new business sales were strong really across all of our segments in both Small Business, Major Accounts and National Accounts. Some of that is a reflection of the product enhancements that we've made over the last several years, and the investments that Gary has been referring to. In National Accounts, it does reflect a bit of a bounce-back, but again, sales in National Accounts tend to be very lumpy, and we still feel like they're -- that the sales cycles are still quite long in the high end of the market. We're quite pleased with the sales growth in all of the markets, and all 3 of them were in the double-digit range. From a competitive standpoint, in terms of win-loss ratios, we feel like we're in a very good competitive position in Small Business. In Major Accounts, we have seen a return to what I would consider to be good strong growth from a sales standpoint, I think reflecting also the improvements in the product of Workforce Now. And also in National Accounts, with our new Vantage product, we're expecting good strong sales growth in the future from Vantage.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Give us a little more insight into client reaction to Vantage, which launched a few months ago.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So the reaction has been very positive from a client standpoint and from an industry analyst standpoint, and we've obviously demo-ed the product in several conferences. I was at one of them called the HR Tech Conference, where there was a very positive reception by the -- what we call the industry analyst community. And we have, I think, a growing pipeline, but it's very early. We launched the product in October of last year. It is -- just as a reminder, Vantage, unlike GlobalView, is not intended to be a product to address a new market segment. It's a -- really a replacement or upgrade of our current platforms, which will take time to execute on from a replacement standpoint. But from a new business sales standpoint, it's intended to sell into the National Accounts space where we were selling other platforms before. So even though we expect it to help our National Accounts sales over time, do not expect it to be an incremental new market segment or product as it is in GlobalView.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I see. And, Chris, just a question on the outlook for flow. Do you have a preliminary view for a fiscal '13 in terms of possible earnings pressure from the reinvestment in some of your longer-dated maturities?","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes. What I would point you to, David, is that -- what I went through back at the May Analyst Meeting. And in that meeting, you'll recall that I gave how much of the portfolio matures over the next couple of years. And you'll see the same amount basically matures in next year, and you can see what the embedded base is. And so if rates stay the same, that gives you a pretty good clue. So I think I've given you all the puzzle pieces. I hesitate giving fiscal year '13 guidance yet, but I will be updating that as we go throughout the year. But I think you'll -- you can get what you need out of that meeting. The interesting thing is, since May, when rates were low, rates have actually ticked down a little bit. And if you remember, I gave you a way to think about balance growth, et cetera. So it's all there, and I'll be doing that more towards the end of this year to give insight into next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Chris, just some questions for you just in terms of the puts and takes for the acquisitions and the dispositions for the rest of fiscal '12. Is there a way for us to just to sort of understand what the contribution in the numbers is from the acquisitions and, then ultimately, the asset disposition, just to get a better sense of what the underlying organic would look like for the back half of fiscal '12 here?","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes. I think from an NOI standpoint, it's not particularly material. But from a margin standpoint, it continues to be a drag. Drag gets  a little bit better, as we said in our earlier remarks, from the acquisitions we did last year, though they're still negative. But then as you look into the third and fourth quarter, you've got some of the more recent acquisitions that have the full year -- full impact in the third and fourth quarter. So they're a bit of a drag as well.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And what about from a revenue contribution perspective for the acquisitions?","Christopher R. Reidy","No. The most recent ones that we did since the last time we updated guidance aren't all that material. We had the RightThing in -- and last time, right? So that was a little bit bigger. The Dealer acquisition we did recently is kind of mid-teen-ish kind of revenue for the rest of the period.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","The only one that's meaningful is the sale of the assets that we mentioned which are on a -- $0.02 for the rest of the year. So you can do the math on the full year. It's $0.04 per year, more or less, drag from a NOI standpoint. I think revenues are somewhere around $60 million to $70 million on an annualized basis.","Christopher R. Reidy","Right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So yes, I just wanted to inquire about the selling insurance fees. And we're well into the new year now, and I know this is selling insurance season. Can you just give us an update on how things look so far with sales and churn?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Sales in -- I'm sorry, sales in where? Were you -- what were you saying, churn?","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Sales and client churn, this the key.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Client churn, okay. Retention, okay. Well, in terms of new business sales, again, we're through 6 months of our year and we're 11% growth year-to-date and our sales results, 14% for the quarter. So we're feeling pretty good about that. In terms of our churn, our retention, if you exclude the one large loss, which is a little unusual, it was a client that we brought on as a result of an acquisition a couple of years ago, and it was a product and service that was really 10 years old. It was a legacy product. We, at the time of the due diligence, anticipated that, at some point, we would have that client leave. We just didn't know what the timing was, and in fact, timing kept getting pushed forward. But unfortunately, we did end up losing the client in the quarter. I think if you exclude that client, that large client loss, our retention was about flat for the quarter. So it's still slightly ahead year-to-date, and we are still forecasting to be ahead for the full year. So as you can tell, based on the 6 months and what we have -- what we feel and see so far in January, we're feeling pretty good about client churn and about retention for the full year forecast. On the sales front, again, January is -- as with retention, January is an important sales month in a couple of our business units where we record our largest sales results in January. And again, our early feelings and our early read gives us confidence to increase our sales forecast as we did to about 12% from the previous range that we had. We're feeling pretty good about both.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, that's great. So thanks for the update on what's happened in January. Can you give us any specificity -- I mean, I guess you're seeing an encouraging sign in January on the bookings front. Is that because of better sales execution?  Or is there something happening in the market that you think is giving you better lift in January bookings than you might have been expecting before?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I wasn't trying to make a comment specifically on January. We did meet with our sales leader yesterday just to get an update on the view of the full year. And although we are feeling pretty good about January, my comment was really more about the full year forecast and also the year-to-date. So the overall picture, I think is feeling pretty strong. But I'm not sure that we want to get into the specifics about the results in the month of January. But there was nothing -- we haven't really closed the results. So our -- but our -- we do have weekly results, and we have some sense of where we will be. And we're feeling good. And again, I think our feelings are similar to what they were for the first 6 months. No big change. I mean, we have, other than in our Small Business segment, some visibility as a result of pipelines and other metrics about where things are headed from a sales standpoint. In Small Business sales and in TotalSource,  those are 2 places where you actually have to wait for the actual results because we count the sales at the time that they are started. And again, January in both of those businesses are fairly large months. And through today and January, we're feeling good about what we're seeing so far.","Christopher R. Reidy","And to your question about execution versus something else going on, I think, as we've been saying, if we put really good innovative products into the hands of our sales people, it helps with execution. So it's a combination of both. It's hard to tell which, but it's a winning combination.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And one thing that's worth mentioning is the execution is beyond just the products and the sales force. These kinds of lumpiness in sales, particularly in January as a result of these large starts, require a very well-trained and dedicated service and implementation organization, who's also performing quite well in being able to handle what is obviously more than what we expected from a volume standpoint.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So just to clarify. I mean, it seems like part of the reason you're increasing your bookings guidance is that you have some data on January. So that was my understanding. But if you had to pinpoint the main thing that's helping you on the sales front of the guidance, would you say it's just having better product for sales this year and you've got some momentum as a result of the new product rollout stuff? Is that the main factor?","Christopher R. Reidy","Well, it was also -- it wasn't just January. It was the whole second quarter. So we're 11% year-to-date. We see the momentum. The momentum is strong across the business, so it's not just one unit. It's -- we're seeing the strength everywhere. We mentioned specifically double digits in SBS and National Accounts and ABS and best-of-breed and International. But then even if you peel back on TotalSource, they had very high single-digit growth against a very difficult compare. Majors is very strong, high single digits. So it's across the board, and the momentum feels good. So it's all of those things. It's everything that we're seeing, and that's why we increased what we expect to see for the year.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","But there's no question that we feel strongly that the product enhancements over the last couple of years have helped our sales force. Our sales force has always been successful in selling in any kind of an environment and in -- not necessarily with any kind of products, but they certainly do better when they have help from good strong products from a competitive standpoint.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask a little bit about the circumstances around some of the higher sales and implementation expense. Obviously, new sales themselves have been running ahead of plan, and it was nice to see the guidance raised there. So is the higher sales and implementation expense purely a byproduct of you guys are selling more than you had originally forecast?  Or are any of the implementations proving to be more complex or lengthy and, therefore, more costly than you might have originally anticipated?","Christopher R. Reidy","Well, it is that, but it also includes the fact that sales growth was strong last year. And so that creates a little bit of higher grow-over on implementation expense this year.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think it's more of the former than -- I think there's clearly some additional, I think, complexity in terms of some of our higher-end parts. But I think the main increase in our -- we've, I think, been talking about this for several quarters that we've invested in our sales organization and our distribution last year. And I think we're just now lapping some of those investments. And I think what we're the most pleased with is the productivity improvements that are starting to show up from those investments. So even though in sales dollars we are still feeling pressure, as you're alluding to, we're really getting the return that we expected in the form of a productivity improvement. So our -- in terms of the -- in terms of the details behind that, we've had only about half of the sales headcount, sales force headcount growth as we have in sales results. And that's a big turn for us in the last couple of years, where we've been adding to the sales force and waiting for the productivity, which is a normal course for us.  As we begin to add distribution, as we come out of a downturn like we did, as our confidence grows in the future of the economy, we begin -- and this is, again, a cycle that's been repeated for many decades at ADP, we start to add back sales resources. Those folks take time to get trained, and they get -- they take time to get productive. We appear to be getting close to that inflection point now, where we're going to lap those investments, first of all, in terms of dollars, and the productivity enhancements are starting to show up in the sales results. And they did show up in the second quarter.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Absolutely. And just to follow up on that, when you think about the raise of the sales growth guidance for the year, I guess at the midpoint of your prior range versus current, you're up about 3 points. Sounded like there's a little bit in there from the recent acquisitions. I'm guessing probably not more than a point, but correct me if I'm wrong. And so just the balance of the 2 or so points, is that because you've had more success in converting some of those GlobalView opportunities that are a bit chunkier? Or is it broader- based than that really across all the customer segments in terms of driving your increased outlook for new sales?","Christopher R. Reidy","So just to be clear, the GlobalView chunky sales that you referred to did help us on the domestic side in our National Account results in the second quarter. But our sales strength and results are strong across all of the segments. So we're very pleased with the entire across-the-board sales results. And to your question about the acquisitions, I think you the -- what mentioned in terms of how much help we would get from the acquisitions is about right. It's not material, and it's not significant to the guidance increase.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right. You clearly would've still increased the guidance, not the acquisitions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","In your guys' comments today, you guys reference a mixed economic environment. And since ADP really has a great view on the economy, I was just hoping you guys could define some of the positives and negatives that you're seeing.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think there are really 2 things that I would point to. One is despite the strong results in National Accounts this quarter that were aided by some of the domestic GlobalView sales, we are still seeing long sales cycles and difficult to get people to make decisions. And in fact, we are very actively, many people, trying to help and close deals that are kind of close to the goal line. So I think that's one place where if we had to define the environment -- and we wouldn't define it as perfect, because we do have strength in other parts of our business from a selling standpoint. We have strength in retention. We have strength in pays per control. So most of our metrics are looking actually quite good and strong, but we still have some uncertainty in the upper end of the market. And in GlobalView, again, those sales are lumpy, and so we're just not ready to declare that the upper end of the market is back in complete open-buying mode. The second item that I would mention from a mix standpoint is Europe. We do have about a little less than 20% of our -- around 20% of our revenues from outside of the U.S., a lot of that from Europe. And as you know, the European markets are somewhat unsettled. We have a relatively small pretax contribution from our International operations, so we're not all that concerned about it from a bottom line standpoint. But it's still a place where, from a new business sales standpoint, we're concerned. They had good results in the second quarter, and some of that may be the comparison to the prior year. But as everyone knows, that's a -- certainly an unsettled situation. And if things were to get much worse there, we would probably, as usual, see an impact on our new business sales results, not as much short term on our revenue and our pretax, but certainly our new business sales, and that's why we're being cautious about the economy.","Christopher R. Reidy","I think the only other thing would be the interest rate environment hasn't gotten any better either. And so -- you put all those things together. So when we say mixed, bear in mind that some of the key indicators we look at, to your point, are things like pays per control to the employment levels. And we're seeing good growth there and across-the-board sales growth, particularly in the -- other than the National Account, as Carlos mentioned, everywhere else it's strong and has been strong. So there's positive signs, and yet, there's still a bit of that cloud. And I think that's probably indicative of what most people feel about where the economy is right now. It's not going great guns. It's just sort of chugging along. So that's kind of what we meant by that.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up, I just wanted to ask Carlos now in the CEO role, do you have any thoughts on any changes to the strategic direction or anything that you might be bringing to the table that could be different than the Gary Butler regime?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, as you know, everyone -- people are different in terms of their styles and also their approaches. But I have been in ADP for quite a while. I've been actually a part of building the strategies that we've been pursuing over the last 5 or 6 years with Gary. So Gary and I saw eye to eye on most things. And again, we're different people. We're going to have different styles. And I would say that what you'll see is more of a change in emphasis on things. Gary and I talked a lot about, over the last 2 years, how pleased I was and how supportive I was of our investments, particularly in product and innovation and technology. And so that's something that Gary was very supportive of and he made investment commitments to. I intend to continue that. If there's any place where I would expect to put more focus and attention is in that area. But to the great business model that we have, I value -- I have been in ADP for a long time. I understand very well the value of our direct sales force and how they're able to execute. I plan and expect to continue to invest in our sales force and support our sales force. And I also understand that our service organization is a key differentiator for us versus some of our other competitors. That's also a place where I intend to continue to invest. So I think that Gary shared that same perspective, and I think where they may be differences is in degrees of emphasis on those 3 categories. But those 3 categories are what made ADP great, and I intend to continue to follow through on those same 3 categories.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess the first question, can you give any more color on the deceleration in the organic revenue growth in the Employer business? Was that adjusted for this asset sale, or is that part of it? And any other contributing factors. And I'm talking versus last quarter.","Christopher R. Reidy","Sure, yes, no.  Sequentially, just taking it from the ADP level -- although you focused on ES, I'll start with ADP. We were down sequentially. On an internal basis, let me point you to that because it takes some of the noise out from the acquisitions, where we were 9.7% growth from an internal basis in Q1 and down to 5.9% in Q2. Two whole percentage points of that was related to FX, which we talked about in our remarks that we didn't get in the second quarter.  So that kind of makes the compare 7.7% to 5.9%. If you break that down now to the ES piece, it was really 7.3% in ES going to about 5%. And there were 2 things that impacted that. One is just the fact that there is one less calendar day in Q2 than there was in Q1. And so it's kind of a -- an anomaly of the calendar. But one whole day makes a big difference. And so that was part of it. The other is, if you recall us talking in the past about our Tax Credit Services business and the HIRE Act that was in place through last year, the last bit of that came through in the first quarter, which was kind of a retention credit if the people that you hired were still around. And that came through in the first quarter, and that all went away in the second quarter. So that was the -- those are the 2 reasons for that deceleration in the sequential. Dealer, on the other hand, actually ticked up slightly from 5.6% to 6.7% and primarily because Cobalt is now internal for the entire quarter versus being halfway in the first quarter. So when you put all that together, that accounts for the difference.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think it's fair to say that if you look at the trends over the last several quarters, even going back a couple of years, I think if you exclude some of this noise around FX, calendar, the HIRE Act, other things, I think the message should be -- I think that you should hear is that all of our underlying metrics with the only \"clouds\" that we've mentioned, all the underlying metrics are still pointing in the right direction. They're still either strong or improving, and it's really the sales in the high end of National Accounts.  Concerns about the Eurozone and also a continued low interest rate environment are really the only things that you should be focused on as potential, I guess, things to really worry about or focus on, because as -- again, as the new person looking at some of these trends and going back and studying all the numbers, the numbers are quite consistently improving and still heading in the right direction from a strength standpoint, whether it's pays per control, new business sales, all of the underlying metrics that drive the true underlying core growth of the business.","Christopher R. Reidy","And I would also add that the items that I talked about driving the sequential change, all things we anticipated in our plan and -- when we gave guidance initially and when we upped that guidance in October. So nothing unexpected.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So is that 5% number a reasonable ballpark for the second half of the fiscal year?","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes, it probably is. I'd have to check. And I'll come back to that. But that's probably about right.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Again, if you look at our internal growth rate for the 6 months of this year versus the 6 months of last year, it accelerated slightly, 10 basis points. So again, that, to me, is evidence that you're not going to have a 2 to 3 percentage point movement up or down in that internal growth rate. It is still quite strong and either holding steady or improving slightly.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up. Can you give us a sense on the revenue contribution and margin contribution to ADP from a customer who would upgrade to the Vantage product versus the legacy system? And also, I'm curious at the mid-level and on the low end, with RUN versus just the legacy payroll platform, are you doing better or worse than revenue? Are you doing better or worse on margin?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think one of the key strategies for us on the RUN platform is to be able to attach additional products and services that we were not able to or didn't have available in our old EasyPay platform. So one of the things that we're finding some success with on the RUN platform is adding, for example, some HR products. And again, these are Small Business tools, so these are not large-ticket items. But they do move up the average revenue slightly versus EasyPay on the RUN side. But our strategy in rolling out that product, not unlike our strategy with Vantage, was not necessarily to change the pricing in the marketplace, either up or down. Really, it was an upgrade in the replacement of an old platform. So I think on the RUN side, we're seeing, I would say, overall consistent slightly up revenues versus EasyPay on a per-unit basis, if you will. But long term, our strategy, because of the technology and its ability to integrate other products, we -- or our hope is to actually move the average revenue per unit on the RUN side. From the Vantage side, it's a similar -- I think a similar approach where we did not expect a major -- from a planning standpoint, we didn't expect a major increase or decrease on a per-unit basis but Vantage just -- does. Because of its nature being a single database integrated product with multiple services, I think our assumption is that the -- or not our assumption, but our hope is that there will be a higher take rate with additional products and services in addition to our core payroll in HR. So for example, time and attendance systems, Benefit Services, we expect the attach rates in Vantage to be higher than they have been in the past in the upfront selling of those products.","Christopher R. Reidy","And Gary just looked at a schedule that gave us a little bit more info on the internal growth in ES in the third and fourth quarter, and it'll tick up slightly from the 5% that you see in the run rate in second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Carlos, it's been a while since the current product renovation, starting with RUN a couple of years ago. And I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of what the ongoing product development strategy is going to be, including the product cycles going forward, and then what impact that could have in terms of how you're thinking about the financial profile of the company since the acquisition seemed to be an element of that strategy. And obviously, they have had an impact last year, and they're having an impact this year on margins as well.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that -- is that a 2-part question regarding product development and also acquisitions, or did I...","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I think it's a 2-part question. One being, what are the product cycle timing going to be going forward given that it had been a while before the current renovation? And then secondly, what impact, if any, will your kind of focus on technology and product development have going forward on the margin structure of the company? And since acquisitions are a part of this, introducing new products, what impact would that have financially as well on an ongoing basis?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","My team's -- my and my team's assumption on a going-in basis is that we have opportunity in the existing portfolio and the existing spending to fund higher spending from an innovation and product development standpoint. So as an example, we do have -- you talked about our product development cycles having potentially gotten shorter, which is true. So that is one of my expectations. And part of my vision is to focus more on the age of the products and bring products out sooner, which is something that maybe 10 or 20 years ago wasn't as important to ADP and our business model. But I think based on what's happening in the world from a technology standpoint, we do believe that our product cycles need to be shortened. So we are focused on that. The -- if you could call it a positive, we have some platforms. I'll take the example of EasyPay since we were just talking about RUN, where as we move off of that EasyPay platform, that EasyPay platform was very difficult to make changes on. It was very expensive to maintain. And so as we move off of that platform, which is not an overnight process, but it is a, call it, 2- to 3-year process, that will create funds and resources for us to be able to reinvest back into product development. And the example of RUN and EasyPay is repeated in Major Accounts and in National Accounts. And I think our team, whether it's our R&D and product development organization or our service and operations folks, understand that we need to find ways to fund our future product development goals, which are to shorten product cycles by finding the resources that we have in some of these old platforms that we were -- we hopefully will be able to migrate off of. In terms of regards to acquisitions, we have -- our acquisitions have been -- many of them have been really additional products that we are adding into the portfolio. So to the extent that any of the acquisitions are platforms that are in our core space, either in benefits administration or in payroll, our view would be that we want to be, as much as possible, on as few platforms as possible. So if we were to do an acquisition that was in our core space, we would move as quickly as possible to move those clients onto one of our new go-forward platforms.","Christopher R. Reidy","I think the only other color I would add is some of the development that we've seen in the new product innovations, it's less of a once and done, and it's kind of a continuous process. So though we mentioned RUN for a couple of years now, it's continuing to evolve. The most recent would have been the introduction of the mobile app for employees of small businesses, which I think was back in October or November. We've done some things with RUN around the wholesale market. So it's a kind of a continuous evolvement, probably more so going forward than it had been in the past.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes. And I think it's important to add again to the color, as Chris is saying, that the implication of what do my views imply for margins would not be consistent with my original comments which were that -- Gary I think was on this path already, along with the rest of the team, of investing more in product and technology. So again, I think it's back to the comment of degrees of emphasis and attention rather than a wholesale change in strategy that's going to impact the financials of ADP.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Co.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just wanted to ask if you could extrapolate a little bit on the pricing environment. Is it consistent with the last few quarters? Or have you seen it get any better or worse, I guess maybe differentiating between National or -- and Small customers?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think if you look at in our small -- in the small business space, I would say in 2009, the latter half of 2008 and in 2009, there was a lot of noise and a lot of discussion about pricing that, from our perspective, was, because I was running that business at that time, we didn't see quite as clearly as other people saw that there was a big change in pricing in the marketplace. But whatever noise there was abated. And we're not saying that we don't compete. We do compete. So we have many competitors, both national and regional, but we are able to achieve our sales results consistent with the pricing that we've had over the last year or 2. So I haven't seen any change in the pricing environment.","Christopher R. Reidy","And as you know, we typically put in our price increases at the beginning of the year, from a slightly different pricing perspective. And I think, as I said on the last call, we had just about 1% increase, which is consistent with what we've done for the last 2 years. And so that certainly is a conscious decision on our part to be at the 1%. We've gotten 1% to 2% in the past. But given the economy, we moved to the low end of that range and because it certainly has an impact on retention if you try to go too high. But we've -- even in the economy that we've had over the last 2 or 3 years, have been able to get a 1%, on average, across the company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up would just be the sale, the right to resell that expense management system. Can you give a quick comment, I guess, on why you made that decision? Was there something about your ability to resell it? Or was it just a good value you could get for transitioning that relationship?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think it's fair to say that the decision was mutual. So when you ask why did you make that decision, again, these types of things require 2 parties. And again, without getting into the specifics about who prompted the decision or who didn't prompt the decision, the decision was mutual, and it was not a core product to us. And I think there was some desire to have a different arrangement on a go-forward basis, and it wasn't necessarily all our decision.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Kissane with Credit Suisse.","James F. Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Carlos or Chris, do you have an update on GlobalView achieving profitability? I think the last one was 2013. But as you bring on stronger new sales domestically, are you still on track for 2013?","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes, nothing's changed in that regard.","James F. Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And, Chris, did you give pays per control in Europe? I didn't catch it. I thought you said it was solid, but I'm not sure if you gave a particular number.","Christopher R. Reidy","We did, and it was down just a tick. But it was pretty mixed by country, and so it was all over the map by country. But it's down a tick. But when we look at that, sales grew nicely at the high end of the market, and so it wasn't a meaningful change overall.","James F. Kissane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just to -- I know that's a third question. But there was a $6 million impairment, I guess, in the investment portfolio, Chris. What does that relate to?","Christopher R. Reidy","Well, that was related to a fund that we held. It was the Norwegian Export Finance, and that was actually downgraded, I think, 7 notches by either Moody's or S&P, I don't recall. Both of them went down significantly. And so we intend to sell that. And so that's actually ticked up a little bit in terms of pricing in January, but it was the decision to sell that and get out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wanted to ask about ES margins, and I know you gave a lot great details there, Chris. I just wanted to better understand what's going to drive you to achieve the -- I think the 30 bps of expansion for the year. I think you're down, what, 90 bps or so year-to-date. And, Carlos, you mentioned a tougher comp in the third quarter. So what gets you to the 30 for the full year?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think one of the -- I'll let Chris get into the details, but really, some of it does relate back to my comments about sales productivity, because we do, as I mentioned, I think lap some of our sales investments completely in the fourth quarter. So if you look at our sales forecast and you compare it to our sales cost, it's an improving picture over the second half, and it was already positive in the second quarter. So I think some of it comes from a turn, if you will, on the impact of our investments in selling expense from the first half of the year. And also, by the way, from last year, we've finally now becoming actually mutual rather than a drag on our margin in ES. So that's a fairly significant part of it is improvement in sales productivity and how it relates to the margin impact on revenue.  And Chris, I don't know if you have anything.","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes. And I think, other than what we said this morning, Tien-Tsin, the real turnaround really is the grow-over lapping. And most of what we had invested in was towards the end of the third quarter into the fourth quarter. And so we bore the brunt of that on a grow-over basis in the first 3 quarters, and that turns around in a big way in the fourth quarter, which kind of points to some of the lumpiness we were talking to around the third and fourth quarter going forward.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes, and I think it's fair to say that we -- none of what we're saying was a surprise to us. So I think that we, all along, I think, from a plan standpoint, had a view of the fourth quarter and of the third quarter that are in line with what we're describing today. So we're just trying to help provide more color to be more clear in terms of how numbers stacked up versus last year and then where we expect things to come out for the third and fourth quarter.","Christopher R. Reidy","And if you look at our guidance for the ES margins, it's ticked down a little bit from about 50 to the -- up to 30, and that was taking into consideration a few things, which I think we outlined even in the press release. But it took everything from higher sales expense to the lost earnings that we have from the sale of the assets that we referred to and the lower balance growth. So all of those things, putting them together, ticked down slightly what our expectation was for the margins for the year.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","But excluding those items, the core business is performing as we expected and as we planned.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. No, that's very clear. I just want to make sure that it was principally the tougher comp. I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss that given the rate of change.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","No, I think you didn't miss that. That's, I think, correct.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Carlos, just last one for me, just the float portfolio. Any change in the duration or the risk profile in general there versus last quarter?","Christopher R. Reidy","No, very consistent. Duration is right on where it was. So not much to speak of there.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","But not to reiterate the negative, but we do have more pressure on us as a result of the interest rate environment. And I think we highlighted that in our script. And again, we would prefer for that to be going in a different direction. It's certainly not helpful.","Christopher R. Reidy","I think if you went back to our original guidance and looked at what balance growths looked like and what interest rates look like, in the first quarter, it ticked down because interest rates were lower than what we had originally used for guidance at the beginning of the year. And then in this quarter, as we said, it's mostly the slightly lower balance growth. Put all that together and it's down $20 million since the original guidance that we gave. So it's unusual because you don't think you can get any lower, but it did get a little bit lower.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Now I have that slide posted up on my desk, so I'll update for that. I appreciate all the details. It's helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess my first question here is, Carlos, how do you see -- I'm just trying to get your longer-term views on the balance between the technology and services portion of your sell, and maybe how you think that's going to play out over time and what impact it would have on the business as we look at it.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So I think I'll describe it the way I describe it to our leaders and also to our associates, which is, my view has been that we have a great sales force. We have a great service organization, and we have good products. And what -- I think the term we use is that good is not good enough anymore. So because of the pace of change -- today, you saw Apple's earnings results and the fact that everyone has an iPhone, everyone has an iPad. So the usability and the experience that our clients and their employees have with our products has become more important over the last 5 years, and is going to become very important over the next 5 years. So I think it's natural that we have to have more focus and attention on product, both in terms of usability, feature functionality and quality, but also in terms of age of products. So I think these are all natural outgrowths of a changing world and a changing market, but it doesn't really imply, and I believe that we have the ability, to still maintain great sales, great service and just elevate product to the same level. So that's really the plan. The plan is not to make trade-offs or to take from one and give to the other. I think the plan is to elevate product. And we believe, our CIO believes, I believe and I think the team believes that we have the ability within the existing resources and structure that we have to be able to accomplish that.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And just kind of building off of that. Do you think that, that has any impact longer term on the pricing structure of the business in general or the product itself? And then maybe you could just talk about what your impressions are about that's impact on your competitive environment, in other words, why you win and lose relationships.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think that Business 101 would tell you that differentiation is very important. You don't want to ever be commoditized on a commodity market, which we are not. So the product development focus is intended to maintain differentiation that ADP has historically had, which helps us from a pricing standpoint. Again, service and our ability to use a direct sales force to sell our value are also incredibly important to the business model. But our product focus is really all about differentiation. And differentiation helps with price. If you look at the example of RUN, I think it's helped us maintain or be consistent from a pricing standpoint in the market. So I think that there are 2 schools of thought. One is doing these types of things and creating this differentiation will help you increase your price, and another school of thought is that it will help you maintain your price. Both objectives are good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Macdonald with First Analysis.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Carlos, most of my questions have been answered. But could you maybe give us an update on how the acquisition of the RightThing is going and how that's fitting in and how you maybe expect that to move down market, if at all?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It's actually quite early to make any pronouncements, but -- so no surprises. No negative surprises so far. Positive surprises in terms of the culture fit, if you will, in the sense that the leadership team of the RightThing has been incredibly positive and supportive. As you know, the leader of that business is remaining the leader of that business with ADP in what we think is a category that helps us grow into more of a human capital management provider by providing some recruitment process outsourcing. So I think it's really an extension for us in terms of our product set. And again, with the benefit of only a few months or several months, it's hard to make any kind of conclusions other than to say that there really have been no negative surprises, and I think we're very happy with the management team, with their level of enthusiasm and with the way that they're integrating themselves into our National Account organization and the National Account sales force, because, ultimately, one of the big synergy points that we think we're going to have is distribution in that business. But management team is seasoned. They're quite knowledgeable about their business, and we're excited to have them on board.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill with CLSA.","Matthew O'Neill - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","This is Matt on the line for Craig Maurer. Just was hoping to get an update, sort of taking a step back on the small business environment and what you guys are seeing there. And maybe if you could just talk to software-as-a-service and how that might be impacting the competitive landscape going forward, would be appreciated.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think that from a small business market standpoint, I think we see the same -- we have, obviously, retention figures, and we have pays per control figures, and we have lots of data. But we also see the same things that you all see, which is NFIB surveys and other surveys of confidence in small businesses which impacts business formation, which has an impact on us, and also impacts, to some extent, the level of bankruptcies, which also affects our retention rates. I think the environment, to us, feels consistently better than it did in '08 and '09, as reflected in our retention rates, which are impacted also by better service delivery. But clearly, in that space, in small business, also are impacted by the number of bankruptcies and out of business. So we are seeing no negative trends, if you will, in the small business market in the numbers that we're seeing. So we feel good about the environment in general. And I think you had a second -- what was the second part of your question? I'm sorry.","Matthew O'Neill - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Yes. Just regarding software-as-a-service and how that sort of is playing to the competitive landscape on the small business [ph] side.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Right, so software -- so RUN is a software-as-a-service. And again, I like to think that software-as-a-service has the word service, but many of the software-as-a-service providers really distribute software over the Internet, which is not really providing service. And so ironically, we think that we are the actual software-as-a-service provider, because we are providing software over the Web. It is resident on our servers and not on the clients'. So I think it's the same business model as what you all hear about software-as-a-service. But we really put the service in SaaS, because we do solve problems for clients and we do take issues and resolve them on the tax side or on the payroll side. And I think that's where our differentiation comes in. But we are a SaaS provider in the small business market.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Carlos, you provided a lot of good data of -- on the sales front. I guess my question really is about the conversion of business sales to revenues. When you -- once you sign the contract, are you seeing any change in sort of the historical pattern? Are clients sort of changing the pace of implementation in any of the geographies?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think I'll make a general comment because I'm not sure that I have specifics by business unit. But generally speaking, what we call our starts, which is versus our sales, our sales dollars, our starts are clients who actually started their first processing. The growth in our starts year-over-year is consistent or better than our sales growth. So I think that would be an indication that, overall, for all of Employer Services, we're not having an issue with a client's or us slowing down implementations. Having said that, I do want to, again, thank and congratulate our service and implementation organization because this is a very difficult time of the year for them. And to accomplish that and to accomplish the level of starts that they've had is no small feat. So we, I think, are pleased with, I think, the efforts that we've made, and we don't see clients delaying in the SBS and Major Accounts space. We don't see any issues around delays either on our part or the client's part. In GlobalView and in National Accounts, in '08 and '09, we experienced some deterioration in our starts as a result of client cancellations or delays, and that has been abating, but there is still some of it, particularly in our GlobalView space.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. No, that's useful. And the margin ticked down on a lower rate of margin growth in ES because of the sales investment, but we don't have a corresponding increase in revenue. I guess is that because of the divestiture or the changed sales arrangement partially and we'll see the revenue impact in fiscal '13 I guess?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think some of it is just timing. It's really not -- the acquisition -- the divestiture certainly doesn't help. But I -- it's really not meaningful in the quarter. I think it's really just a timing issue, because, again, the sales results -- we are a recurring revenue business, so sales are the annual value of our sale. And we recognize those revenues monthly, quarterly as time goes on. So I think this is a natural part of our business model that there is, I think, a lag from when you see the revenue show up when sales turn up.","Christopher R. Reidy","Exactly.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And if I may squeak in a third quick question. Your buyback ticked down sharply in 2Q. Is there any particular reason? Or let me just leave it there, so you can comment on that.","Christopher R. Reidy","No particular reason other than we flex that with acquisitions. So we obviously did a number of acquisitions in 2Q. If you look at the year-to-date share buybacks, they're still fairly substantial at over $300 million. So it can be a little bit lumpy there, too, depending on acquisitions that we're about to do or the ones that are in the pipeline, et cetera. So it was more of that. But at $300 million year-to-date, that's pretty consistent with what we've seen in the past, if not a little bit higher. And as we say, we're committed to being at least what we see in dilution, and we're probably double in terms of number of shares purchased versus the amount that was dilutive from option exercises. So the $300 million is pretty healthy, I think, and that's about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm wondering with the -- from a longer-term perspective, with the increased emphasis on innovation and improving the products and shorter product cycles, is there going to be any departure or should we anticipate a departure relative to the 5-year plan that was outlined in March and reiterated in London recently?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So again, I think if you see a departure, it would be more around communication and emphasis, because I was part of putting together that 5-year -- that 5-point plan. I was part of that management team. So I think any adjustments you see would be, again, around emphasis and not around wholesale shifts in strategy or business model. So again, that's really, I think, all that's appropriate for me to say, because this is my second month in the job. And if -- when and if we have adjustments, I think, or revisions to our strategy, we would obviously communicate those openly with everyone.","Christopher R. Reidy","And I think, Mark, the takeaway you should have is we've had some real good success in seeing the fruits of the investments in technology with RUN and Workforce Now. It works. You see it. It's not like this is a change in emphasis, but it's a continuation and maybe a little bit more emphasis. So I don't think it's a dramatic change from where we've been. And it's clear when you have really good products like what we've seen with RUN and Workforce Now, it's -- put that with a good sales and distribution group and a great service group and it's a real winning combination, and we just intend to keep that going.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Absolutely. I was just wondering whether or not, from a very specific perspective, if there were any implications for the longer-term plan in terms of 50 basis points in margin expansion on the ES side or if there's a little bit of a trade-off in terms of potentially innovating the products, maybe getting faster revenue growth but maybe slower margin improvement.","Christopher R. Reidy","Not right now. There's no update that we have to that guidance.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the -- as a follow-up. Is there an anticipation that there could be any other large clients that could end up leaving? And how should we think about the reported client retention over the next 3 quarters? Is that one large client going to basically be a headwind that we're going to have to adjust for in terms of our expectations?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, again, it's somewhat -- sometimes you have to wonder whether you should bring -- even bring up some of these things. This is a very unusual -- we typically would not mention this or focus on it. But it was so unusual, both because of its size and because of the product that it was and where it came from, from an acquisition and a legacy platform of the acquisition, we thought it was worth mentioning. So our intention in mentioning it was to emphasize that it was onetime in nature. So no, we don't have any other large client losses of the same magnitude that we're aware of today. As you know, things can change and things can happen. But I think we were trying to really send a message that we're comfortable and confident with our current forecast or the updated forecast on our retention and trying to just give some color around what happened in the quarter. Because of the way we calculate losses, it had an outsize impact in the quarter, and we just wanted to help provide some clarity on that.","Christopher R. Reidy","It was not something that was unanticipated, and it was actually in our plan that it would be a loss this year. We just didn't know if it was going to be in the first quarter, second quarter or third quarter, fourth quarter. Actually, as Carlos said, as you calculate that impact, it's over the second quarter. So you look at that comparison, it has more of an impact when it happens earlier in the year, and so it's not as much of a drag for the full year. But some of these things do happen, and we don't have a 100% retention. And this was one that we felt we'd call out, but really no change to how we think about retention for the year.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I fully appreciate that for the last couple of years, retention metrics have been improving nicely, partially because of the economy improving, partially because of the service improvements that you've put in place, and so this was an outlier. I just wasn't sure in terms of what the implications were when you report the same metric coming up in the next 2 quarters, whether it's just something we should take into account. So that if we're down in terms of the way that you report the retention in the third and fourth quarters, we should all just recognize it's all due to this one single element, which is an outlier.","Christopher R. Reidy","No. I mean, we're not giving anything -- we've told you. And if you think back to what we've said in the past, we are at historical highs. We're thrilled with that, but we expect that to be able to get a little bit better each year, and we're still looking at the same for this year. This is the quarter.  It really isn't the second quarter and what happened that is that meaningful. It's this quarter that's more meaningful from a retention standpoint.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","As in the third quarter, you mean.","Christopher R. Reidy","Third quarter, right.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line from Nathan Rozof with Morgan Stanley.","Nathan A. Rozof - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The question I have for you is, ADP has been referencing reluctance to commit at the high end of the market for, I guess, a few quarters now, and yet you saw some really pretty healthy improvement in terms of sales this quarter. So the question I have for you is, is do you think that, that reluctance was, in some way, driven by the calendar year budgeting season of your clients?  And will we see that reluctance start to fade as 2012 budgets get firmed up? And related to that, what is the takeaway or what are you seeing from your clients' spending expectations for calendar year '12?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, what I would say is that as much as it seems obvious, one quarter is not a trend in the high end of the market. Some improvement in our GlobalView sales, I think, is also not something to be interpreted as a trend. Some of these sales that we've closed have been in process literally for multiple years, and they happened to close in a particular quarter. So I think our sense comes from talking to our sales force, talking to our sales leaders, and we can't help but be influenced also by what we see around us. So when you look at other large companies who are selling into the enterprise space, I think that we're consistent. Our view and our feeling on the high end of the market is not inconsistent with what we're seeing and hearing in some other companies. Obviously, that varies by industry. Generally speaking, I think large companies are still cautious in their spending. You can look at it, and we have surveys around from the BRT that show CEO willingness to invest in capital expenditures. Our solutions aren't necessarily capital expenditures and buildings, but they are large investments and large commitments that typically require CEO or CFO sign-off. I think it's just -- it's safe to say that with the clouds in Europe and some of the other kind of uncertainty, whether it's political or otherwise, I think is causing some reluctance in the high end of the market.","Nathan A. Rozof - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the -- my one follow-up question, to switch gears briefly to the margin questions that have been going throughout this call. I wanted to ask, in terms of the selling and implementation cost, particularly the implementation costs that relate to your newer products like RUN and Vantage, should we expect that on a per-client basis that implementation costs would go down as the mix shifts towards those new products?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, at the risk of getting into the weeds, only because I had this conversation last week with someone, the cost of implementation for RUN on a per-unit basis is lower. So we're happy about that. But that's now 2 years plus after the rollout of the product. I think on Vantage, it's safe to say that the cost of implementation on a per-unit basis will actually be higher in the short term. But of course, our expectation is that we'll be lower over the long term. But it's going to take a while.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could update us as to how some of the newer products are doing with respect to penetrating the in-house market. Maybe that's best given in terms of whether or not you're seeing a shift in mix in terms of your new sales as it relates to competitive takeaways from other outsourced partners versus moving into the in-source market.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We tend to look more at our competition against other outsourcers, because, what we've looked at over the last decade or so, the data is fairly consistent that people tend to switch within their category So for example, someone who's outsourcing tends to switch from one outsourcer to another. People that are in-house tend to stay in-house. Having said that, clearly, one of our biggest market opportunities is penetrating the in-house. I don't think that we have, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, any news to report on any major shift in terms of our win rate against the in-house market. I think products like Vantage and RUN, Workforce Now are intended to help because they look and feel more like an in-house and give more control to the client and to the marketplace. But we still tend to be the most successful against -- with a client or with a prospect who is comfortable switching within their own category.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So at this point, it doesn't appear as though some of those cloud technologies are really making a meaningful penetration in the in-house but stay tuned.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I would stay tuned, and I'm not ready to say it's not making a meaningful impact. I'm just not ready to get into -- to provide, I guess, more detail.","Christopher R. Reidy","The market's so large. It's going to -- it takes a long time for those kinds of shifts to happen in a meaningful way. And so early -- too early to call that one.","Operator","I'll turn the call back to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","All right. I appreciate it very much.

And all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Christian Greyenbuhl","Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP\u2019s Vice President, Investor Relations, and I\u2019m here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call and webcast.","During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","Before Carlos begins, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such, involve some risks. We encourage you to review our findings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","Now let me turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos Rodriguez","Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. This morning, we reported our second quarter fiscal 2018 results with reported revenue up 8% to $3.2 billion, 7% organic. This revenue growth was slightly above our expectations, and we are pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made so far in the first half of fiscal 2018.","Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14% to $0.99 per share and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. We continue to work diligently this quarter to overcome the difficult grow-over from our strong fiscal 2017 second quarter performance. And we are pleased with our overall results, which Jan will take you through in more detail shortly, including some additional information on the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","Before I continue further with our operational highlights, I\u2019d like to focus on the execution of our strategy and our innovation efforts. Innovating to help our clients meet the dynamic needs of a rapidly evolving workforce has always been in our DNA and continues to be at the very core of our strategy. More and more, we see workers demanding a greater, ease of access to and functionality of the digital world. Whether it is the convenience offered by our ADP mobile solutions app, the insights delivered by our data cloud offerings or, increasingly, the optionality of flexible payment solutions, it is clear that the worker is at the center of the HCM strategy of tomorrow.","While we continue to innovate around our core strengths, such as with our recently announced next-gen payroll and tax platforms, you will also recall that in October, we announced our acquisition of Global Cash Card, which further strengthened our payroll offering with the expansion of digital accounts and flexible payment offerings. This was an exciting acquisition that allows us to further support the evolving needs of our clients, and we are very pleased with the level of client interest in their digital payment services. With this acquisition, ADP became the only HCM provider with a proprietary digital payments processing platform, thus, enabling the opportunity for greater operational efficiency and a seamless client experience.","Furthermore, we expect Global Cash Card will allow us to broaden our engagement with our clients' workforce through compelling options to service their flexible pay needs and improve their financial lives, be they traditional or freelance. With the world of work changing, so are our clients' needs.","We are proud to be the leading global provider of innovative technology-based HCM solutions across the entire workforce. And with the composition of work increasingly moving toward the freelance worker or gig worker, we have actively pursued going beyond the status quo in order to maintain and expand our industry-leading position. The gig economy is large and continues to grow, with some third-party studies suggesting that between 20% and 30% of today\u2019s labor force is on demand. With over 90% of our mid and upmarket clients already using gig workers and the majority expected to increase their use for the next 3 years, we believe we are uniquely positioned to service this growing market, and it is specifically with this evolution in mind that we believe in having the worker at the center of our strategy and our next-gen solutions.","Along these lines, we have continued to differentiate our offerings with the recently announced acquisition of WorkMarket, a leading cloud-based freelance management solution serving both multinationals and small- to medium-sized businesses, allowing them to build and manage their integrative workforce, while aiding them with their important compliance obligations. WorkMarket solutions include comprehensive talent management and compliance solutions to help source and vet freelance workers, manage their engagements and evaluate their performance.","In addition, WorkMarket solutions already permit freelance workers on the platform to receive their payments using a Global Cash Card pay card. Our acquisition of WorkMarket establishes ADP as the first HCM provider with robust freelance worker management and payment functionality, with reporting insight and compliance monitoring across the entire labor pool.","Acquisitions with strategic fit like Global Cash Card, WorkMarket and last year\u2019s acquisition of TMBC in the talent management space are just one way ADP is helping clients keep pace with change and manage the increasing demand for flexibility in the way people work and how organizations manage their talent.","I am proud of our progress to date in our innovation-focused investment strategy to develop open and flexible solutions that can be adopted to meet the needs of any client. We believe that pursuing a healthy mix of acquisitions that align with our strategic priorities, in combination with investments and organically-driven innovation, is the right approach for us to deliver market-leading capabilities to clients that will foster sustainable growth.","Now I\u2019d like to cover some operational highlights, starting with new business bookings and retention, both of which continue to show progress and stability against our expectations. As a reminder, we view new business bookings as a metric that demonstrates our ability to drive organic growth, and which represents annualized recurring revenues anticipated from sales to new and existing clients.","New business bookings grew 6% for the quarter. We are pleased with the progress from our investments in headcount and product, which are helping reaccelerate our growth, in line with our expectations. And as a consequence, we are maintaining our new business bookings forecast of 5% to 7% growth for fiscal 2018. We are pleased with the progress we are making on our service investments and with the continued improvements in our net promoter scores. We are now substantially complete with our mid-market upgrades and have less than 1% of our mid-market clients left to migrate.","We continue to see an improving trend in our Employer Services client loss metrics. And while this quarter\u2019s retention declined slightly by 20 basis points, given the quarterly volatility in this metric, we remain pleased with our year-to-date retention improvement of 70 basis points.","We remain on course with our plans to consolidate our real estate footprint and with our associate onboarding across our new strategic locations. As we streamline our service infrastructure and scale our new service centers, we are continuing to see the benefits to both our clients and our associates. Cross-functional teams we have formed in these new sites are leveraging best-in-class service tools and processes to deliver exceptional service to clients across the HCM spectrum in a cost-efficient manner.","At the same time, this allows us to better transfer knowledge among these service teams and offer robust career opportunities within the service organization. I\u2019m proud of these efforts and of the speed of execution despite the pressure that comes from our client calendar year-end service deliverables.","Now I\u2019d like to take a moment to recognize the PEO business, which as of December 31 surpassed the 500,000 worksite employee mark. In fact, if ADP TotalSource were an independent employer, it would currently rank second among private sector employers in the United States. We are pleased with this business' continued success and with its healthy pace of growth, which demonstrates the value in the market of our broad-based, compliance-oriented HR outsourcing solutions.","We have made a lot of progress in executing against our strategy in the first half of 2018, and we remain focused on continuing to accelerate our pace of change through the remainder of the year and beyond.","Before I turn the call over to Jan for a detailed financial review, I want to note how proud I am of the unwavering commitment of our associates, and how especially proud I was to see Fortune magazine name us to their Most Admired Companies list for the 12th time. I am particularly proud of this because it is a testament to the confidence our stakeholders place in us and to the continued dedication of our associates who work tirelessly to provide our clients the best solutions for today and tomorrow.","And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jan for further review of our second quarter results.","Jan Siegmund","Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. In my commentary to follow, I will be referencing non-GAAP measures that excludes the impact of certain items in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 as well as the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. A description of these items and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning\u2019s press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","As Carlos mentioned, ADP revenues grew 8% in the quarter to $3.2 billion, and includes approximately 1 percentage points of benefit from foreign currency. On a reported basis, net earnings declined 8% or 9% on a constant-dollar basis, largely due to the prior year second quarter pretax gain of $205 million related to the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, offset by a onetime fiscal year 2018 second quarter net tax benefit related to the U.S. corporate tax reform of approximately $46 million.","Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, increased 2% on a reported basis. And it included approximately 1 point of pressure from the impact of acquisitions, the second quarter fiscal year 2017 disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses as well as FX.","Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 120 basis points compared to 19.8% in last year\u2019s second quarter. This decrease was slightly better than our expectations, though we continue to see increased pressure from stronger-than-anticipated growth in pass-throughs and from acquisitions.","During the quarter, we have maintained our investments into innovation, service and distribution, and we continue to believe in the benefits of these investments helping us deliver against our long-term financial \u2013 long-term strategic financial objective.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14% to $0.99. 13% on a constant-dollar basis, and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago.","The enactment in December 2017 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, including a federal corporate tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% and, among other provisions, a repeal of the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction as well as new limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter of 25.6% was positively impacted by a lower blended statutory rate of 28.1%, which became effective at the beginning of our fiscal year. This benefit was partially offset by adjustments to access tax benefits on stock-based compensation and foreign tax credits.","As a reminder, our adjusted results exclude a net tax benefit of approximately $46 million for onetime items, which encompass the benefit of the reevaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and transition tax on accumulated overseas earnings and a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits.","Overall, we have continued to make good progress this quarter. Let me now take you through our segment results before moving on to our updated fiscal year 2018 outlook. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 6% for the quarter, 4% organic. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.6% in the second quarter. Average client fund balances grew 7% compared to a year ago. This growth was driven by higher payroll volumes in December, resulting from higher bonus activity.","Outside the U.S., we continue to see solid performance from our international operations with double-digit revenue growth in our multinational businesses. Employer Services margin decreased about 50 basis points in the quarter and included approximately 70 basis points of pressure from the impact of acquisitions and FX.","PEO revenues grew 15% in the quarter, with average worksite employees growing 10% to 498,000. This revenue growth was driven by growth in worksite average \u2013 growth in average worksite employees and from a continued acceleration in the growth of pass-through revenues from the higher health care premiums and higher-than-expected payrolls in the second quarter. This acceleration in pass-throughs was the primary driver for the 30 basis points of decline in the PEO\u2019s reported margins this quarter. I\u2019m pleased with the performance of both of our segments this quarter, while, as Carlos mentioned, we continued to work to accelerate our pace of change for the remainder of the year.","Before I disclose our \u2013 discuss our fiscal year 2018 outlook, I wanted to highlight some additional detail regarding the acquisition of WorkMarket. The results of operations of this business will be included in the Employer Services segment and are not expected to materially impact our updated revenue guidance.","While we anticipate future synergies from this acquisition and our second quarter acquisition of Global Cash Card, we also anticipate some slight pressure to margins this year, largely driven by acquisition-related costs. Accordingly, we have factored these operational impacts into our updated fiscal year 2018 outlook. With these items in mind, I will now take a moment to walk through our revised outlook with you.","First, as Carlos mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our full year new business bookings guidance of 5% to 7% growth on the $1.65 billion sold in fiscal year 2017. With the higher-than-anticipated growth in our pass-through revenues during the first half of fiscal year 2018, we have updated both our consolidated revenue forecast growth to 7% to 8% compared to our prior forecast of 6% to 8%, and our PEO revenue forecast to 12% to 13% from 11% to 13%. Our Employer Services revenue guidance of 4% to 5% remains unchanged.","We are also now expecting growth in client fund interest revenues to increase $55 million to $65 million compared with our prior forecasted increase of $45 million to $55 million. The total impact from the client fund extended investment strategy is now expected to be up $45 million to $55 million compared to the prior forecast increase of $35 million to $45 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","As a result of the growth in pass-through revenues, we have also updated our margin forecast, and now anticipate our consolidated adjusted EBIT margin to contract approximately 50 basis points compared to our previously forecasted contraction of 25 to 50 basis points from 19.8% in fiscal year 2017.","Overall, as our investments begin to make an impact, and we lap the easier compares from fiscal year 2017, we continue to anticipate a stronger finish as the year progresses. At a segment level, due to the pass-through pressure, we now anticipate PEO margins to be flat to down 25 basis points compared to our previous forecast of up 25 to 50 basis points. And we continue to anticipate margin contraction in Employer Services of 50 to 75 basis points, which includes approximately 60 basis points of pressure from acquisitions, costs and FX.","Adjusting to the anticipated benefits of U.S. corporate tax reform, we now expect our forecasted adjusted effective tax rate of fiscal year 2018 to be 26.9% compared to the 31.7%. This benefit is primarily attributable to the lower blended federal corporate statutory rate of 28.1% for fiscal year 2018.","Accordingly, we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 12% to 13% compared to our prior forecast of 5% to 7%. This forecast does not contemplate any further share buybacks beyond anticipated dilution related to equity compensation plans. However, it remains our intent to continue to return excess cash to shareholders, subject to market conditions.","Before moving to Q&A, I would like to touch briefly on our long-standing cash allocation strategy, which involves reinvesting in the business, pursuing acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in that order. As I said earlier, we currently participate \u2013 anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.9% for fiscal year 2018. And while new IRS guidance or interpretations may change things, we currently anticipate a future effective tax rate excluding any possible onetime items of 25% to 26% beyond fiscal year 2018.","Clearly, we are one of the beneficiaries of U.S. corporate tax reform. And while this offers us additional financial flexibility going forward, our priorities, which have delivered strong total shareholder return performance to our shareholders, remain unchanged.","So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks guys, good morning. I just wanted to start with a question on the margin outlook, obviously, understandable with the pass-throughs on the PEO side growing faster than expected. But you are still \u2013 it looks like you\u2019re going to move from year-over-year declines in the first half of 2018 to some modest year-over-year increases in margins in the second half. I wanted to see if you can also comment on the trend in underlying margins. I mean, if we exclude the PEO pass-throughs and the floating comment, you\u2019ve talked a little bit about this in the past as far as this being perhaps a more accurate measure of underlying profitability, what are the trends you\u2019re seeing there?","Carlos Rodriguez","I\u2019ll make a couple of comments, then maybe Jan can add some \u2013 maybe more specifics. But I think in general, I think the answer is positive trends. Because the other factor that I think you didn\u2019t mention, which you do have to kind of factor in to understand what\u2019s really happening underneath the covers. So besides the PEO pass-throughs, we do have a couple of acquisitions now that are putting a little bit of pressure. And as you can see, the underlying trend must be pretty positive if we are holding to our full-year forecast for EPS and margins and so forth.","So I think the fact that we\u2019re able to absorb the pressure, and I think it was mentioned previously that I think it was somewhere along the order of 70 basis points between acquisitions and FX, most of which was acquisitions in the Employer Services segment, I think gives you some sense that I think the underlying trends are positive. And I think it is important to note that as we\u2019ve said before that some of this is related to comparisons and grow-overs. Just as a reminder, last year\u2019s second quarter, we had, I believe, it was somewhere around 20% growth in EBIT and EPS.","And I think that gives you some sense of a company our size, and because of the recurring revenue nature of our business that those results last year were the result of the issues around ACA, which gave us tailwind on the revenues before we have lapped the expenses. So we\u2019ve been talking about this now for eight quarters. And I think the \u2013 it starts to get a little bit easier going forward for it to be a little bit more clear what is happening. So maybe I\u2019ll let Jan add a couple of comments.","Jan Siegmund","Yes. So if you \u2013 Jason, if you think about our full-year guidance of 50% pressure, ADP-wide, like 30 to 40 bps comes from pressure from acquisitions that we haven\u2019t anticipated, were clearly at the beginning of the year. And the pass-through pressure, if you calculate it out like we did historically, amounts to kind of a very strong 100, 130 bps pressure. So the rest is operational scale. And some of our initiatives that we launched in a year-plus ago are now leaped.","And we\u2019re going to see the benefit, increased benefit of that result. So there\u2019s operational scale that we anticipate last year. And that goes really across the entire business system. There\u2019s really not a specific function I can point out because I think the trend is, across the operations, fairly consistent.","Carlos Rodriguez","And I think one last thing that I would add is I think what\u2019s easier probably for, which we all should do going forward, is to really focus on ES and focus on PEO separately. There\u2019s really \u2013 there\u2019s only two. It\u2019s fairly straightforward to understand. So if you take the information we\u2019re giving about ES, which we are very transparent about, and we\u2019re also giving you additional color here around the pressure from acquisitions and FX and so forth, you can really figure out that ES is performing well and ahead of our expectations and probably ahead of your expectations.","And if you look at the PEO separately, the only issue in the PEO, which is not a negative issue, is that the pass-throughs grew faster than everyone anticipated. And that creates a margin issue. But to be clear, excluding pass-throughs, the PEO, what we call processing revenues, grew at a very healthy pace. And the profitability grew faster than the revenues of the PEO, excluding pass-throughs. And so both segments, I think, are performing well. And the mix that you get is mathematical and shouldn\u2019t necessarily get in the way of us understanding the underlying strength of the business.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, that\u2019s all helpful. Just a quick follow-up on bookings. Obviously, good to see some recovery there in the fiscal second quarter. So you need to deliver, I guess, somewhere in the high single-digit range in the second half to achieve the full-year forecast. Obviously, the comps get easier. We\u2019re now more or less past the key selling season. So I wanted to see if you can just characterize the visibility on the affirmed 5% to 7% target compared to what that visibility looked like a quarter ago, including any sense that you might be able to provide on how January bookings might have trended at least directionally? Thanks.","Carlos Rodriguez","As you know, we wouldn\u2019t really comment on our bookings going forward, where \u2013 the call is really to talk about what happened last quarter. And you have our, I guess, maintaining of our 5% to 7%. So I think that would give you some sense that we have confidence that we\u2019ll be able to deliver. But obviously, there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 as always, there\u2019s an unknown. And bookings numbers are always the most unknown number, and this \u2013 and the rest of the business is recurring revenue. Bookings are one week at a time, one day at a time, one month at a time.","So you just have to wait and see for the results. But we\u2019re \u2013 as we mentioned in our comments, the headcount growth that we\u2019ve had, the additions to product, like those things will give us some confidence. And I think 6% growth was ahead of our expectations. It was strong. So it feels \u2013 that feels good. And I\u2019ll also just point out that it just so happens that the second quarter new business bookings number is the highest we\u2019ve ever had.","So it\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s, I think, a testament to our ability of our sales force to really turn things around. But there\u2019s still a lot of work to do. It\u2019s still a very competitive market. So I think we have a lot of sales still in front of us. We had really good results in our downmarket, as we\u2019ve had for the last several quarters. We had really good results also in our multinational business. And our PEO, I think, also did quite well, just to give you a little bit of additional color. But there\u2019s still a lot of wood to chop, for sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hi, good morning. good bookings here. Just, I guess, you guys mentioned pace of change a couple of times. I\u2019m curious if you can maybe elaborate on what you mean there and what you might do differently in terms of exceeding your strategy, et cetera.","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes. Well, it\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s, unfortunately, probably beyond the scope of a brief answer because we have a lot of things going on. But we\u2019ve always had a lot of things going on. So we have quite a number of initiatives that I think some have been \u2013 we\u2019ve been discussing with all of you, some of which we\u2019re not probably ready to start talking about yet. You heard in our comments about our strategic alignment initiatives. You\u2019ve heard about our next-gen platforms, which we hadn\u2019t really discussed up until the fall of last year.","So I think that gives you some sense of how much we had going on. And we have other things going as well, including a couple of acquisitions that we\u2019ve mentioned, I think, on the call are pretty significant in the sense that they, despite slight pressure on our margins in the short-term, we\u2019re very, very excited about in terms of what they do, in terms of opening up our \u2013 the possibility of a wider market for us to go after with our existing distribution and sales force. And so we just have a number of initiatives. I wish I could kind of go down the list, but I think it might take longer than we have for the call. But we\u2019re trying to move and to complete our upgrades, which we\u2019re almost done with in the mid-market.","We are accelerating \u2013 trying to accelerate the pace of our go-to-market of our next-gen platforms. We want to do that at the right pace, but we\u2019re also trying to do it as quickly as possible because we recognize and we anticipate that it\u2019s going to create a competitive advantage for us. And this is our next-gen payroll platform as well as some of the back-office stuff, tax, including also our local platform, which we discussed as we went on the road to talk to investors back in the fall. So just a lot of great things happening, and we\u2019re excited about trying to accelerate on a number of fronts.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great. Just maybe just my quick follow-up for Jan, just the impact on the \u2013 on sort of balance growth from the tax reform. I was a little surprised to see plus 7% for the year if you have 3% prior. Can you \u2013 just a big picture question on that.","Jan Siegmund","Yes. We haven\u2019t gotten a balance question for a long time, Tien-tsin, so I appreciate that. The balance growth accelerated for the quarter to about a little bit more than 7%, and there was a percent of FX in it. So excluding FX, the balance growth was 6.6% actually. And the guidance that we give is 4% to 5%. So you see, for the remainder of the year, we anticipate a little bit slower balance growth. And you point out that taxes, which represent about 3\/4 of our total client fund balances, are impacted by a lower effective tax rate. And so the estimates \u2013 before I talk about the outlook, in December, we did see higher bonus payment activity, which we attribute maybe to corporate behavior that is related to the corporate tax reform.","So was also the growth maybe slightly inflated for the quarter relative to the run rate, but we also had good payroll performance basically in the balances. So for the year, we anticipate 2 to \u2013 1% to 2% kind of potential impact on growth that the corporate tax \u2013 that tax reform in general and the retail rates could have. There\u2019s a little bit of uncertainty. I don\u2019t think nobody really knows exactly how big the impact is going to be on the personal rates, but that\u2019s anticipated. So hence, the 4% to 5% is still better than we had, but it is \u2013 includes this 1% to 2% rough estimate on the lower tax balances basically.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jim Schneider","Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the broader business environment in the different segments and what you\u2019re seeing in terms of client feedback, either on the overall economy, generally speaking, and\/or in terms of the impact of tax reform on their business. How does that translate into bookings, if at all? And generally speaking, is the client tone kind of optimistic? And is it different across the different sizes of the clients?","Carlos Rodriguez","So again, we have \u2013 I guess, we can give you some anecdotal information. But I think we like \u2013 because of the size of our company and also the size of our sales force and the geographic disbursement of our folks and our clients, I think it\u2019s best to focus kind of on macro trends. And so we do look at a lot of the macro trends. And we have a lot of information, obviously, around our national employment report and wage inflation. And so far, that gives us some insight. But rather than getting into kind of anecdotal stories, because the anecdotal stories are pretty very positive. Everyone seems to be very positive and very happy.","But the \u2013 I think all the numbers that we\u2019re looking at that everyone else looks at, which are important for us to understand in terms of the potential drivers to our business, when you look at Small Business optimism, consumer confidence, like all of these indicators, I think, are all very \u2013 pointing in very positive directions. We look at things also, particularly in our downmarket, around bankruptcies and new business formations. So just a number of economic indicators that are pointing to strong underlying growth.","One of the things that\u2019s been a positive surprise to us, I think we had our National Employment Report issued today. And I think this is the second quarter where I think Jan and I would both say that we are pleased, but slightly surprised, by the strength, the underlying strength of growth in employment still. So we\u2019re still kind of bullish and positive that our sales force will be able to take advantage of what\u2019s a very, very strong underlying economy.","Our downmarket business and our PEO should hopefully especially be beneficiaries \u2013 other things notwithstanding, should be beneficiaries of this kind of strong ongoing tailwind around Small Business optimism and new business formation. So I think it\u2019s all positive. I think the other factor that obviously will help us as well, and to the extent that it doesn\u2019t then turn into a negative down the road, is to the extent that wage inflation picks up and maybe interest rates begin to tick up, which they are, that obviously helps us in our fluid income business, which we happen to believe is part of our core business.","The SEC also agrees with us. As you know, it\u2019s just part of our operating results. And we spent many years having to fight the headwinds. And again \u2013 and if you looked at our margins over the last six or seven years, we absorbed several hundred million dollars in headwind and still managed to either maintain or improve margin slightly in the face of \u2013 if you look at the business that way in terms of the overall ADP margin. So now, we\u2019re looking forward to hopefully getting a little bit of help. And just to put it in perspective, in Q2 of 2008, the average yield on our balances was around 4.5%, and the balances were around $14 billion.","Today, our balances are around $22 billion, and our average yield is 1.9. So it just gives you a sense of \u2013 and our margins are higher, obviously, today than they were back then. And we had $116 million or so in float income then and about $104 million or so \u2013 it was $107 million this quarter. So that\u2019s another kind of economic factor that we are looking forward to benefiting from here on a go-forward basis. We have \u2013 I would caution you that we\u2019ve spent the last two or three years expecting that to happen, and it didn\u2019t quite happen. But it does look like, finally, we\u2019re in an environment where not only our balances will hopefully growth at a healthier rate because of wage inflation, but that will bring with it some improvements in interest rates \u2013 at least improvement from our perspective, which is higher interest rates.","Jim Schneider","Thanks. And then maybe as a follow-up, can you maybe be a little bit more explicit about how you intend to use the benefits of the corporate tax reform? I know you reiterated the overall capital allocation policy, but some of your competitors have called for reinvesting a substantial portion of that savings in one way or another. So can you maybe clarify what you would intend to do more reinvestment? Or would you CT most of that back to shareholders?","Carlos Rodriguez","At the risk of contradicting Jan, who\u2019s our CFO, I would say that I think what Jan stated is actually quite accurate. We are not a capital-constrained business. We never \u2013 we haven\u2019t been for a long time for several decades. So I guess, other companies are in maybe different situations. But we\u2019ve been investing in our business, and we\u2019ve communicated that. And it\u2019s created a little bit of pressure in fiscal year 2018, and it created some pressure five or six years ago. So we\u2019ve \u2013 ADP has always been in growing markets that have a lot of opportunity. And hence, we\u2019ve been in investment mode for a long time.","And tax rates and tax policy in our specific situation, if you are perhaps a manufacturer with multinational operations, differences in tax rates might lead to different capital allocation strategies. But we welcome tax reform because we think it\u2019s good for the economy, it\u2019s good for U.S. competitiveness, and that\u2019s good for ADP as well. But our company specifically is not capital- constrained. And so we would anticipate that the majority of the benefits of tax reform will flow to the bottom line.","And subject to the board\u2019s approval, things like share buybacks and dividends should flow from that. Having said that, we are looking at some modest increases in our charitable contributions, and perhaps increasing some of the wages of some of our folks who are at 15 \u2013 below $15 an hour. And also, we anticipate having a higher merit-based pool for our merit increases in the next fiscal year. So we are doing some things to, I think, make some investments in our business. But I think the message you should hear is the one that Jan delivered, which is the majority of the benefits of tax reform to ADP\u2019s bottom line should flow through, I think, to shareholders.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.","David Grossman","Thank you. Carlos, if you just go back to that last question about the macro or in the relatively strong labor markets. And maybe this isn\u2019t kind of the right metric to look at, but your pays per control has stayed relatively stable over the last three years. Could you perhaps at least make the connection between what we\u2019re seeing in the underlying labor markets in that particular metric?","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes. I think it\u2019s \u2013 honestly, I think it\u2019s consistent because what happens is the unemployment rate doesn\u2019t always reflect everything that\u2019s happening because, as you know, the underemployment rate has also been coming down. So as people get pulled back into the labor market, that can create underlying growth in labor that might not be reflected in the government\u2019s reported unemployment rate.","Our NER number, obviously, doesn\u2019t take into account \u2013 it\u2019s just a pure number of how many people are getting hired each month. And I think the trends there have been strong and consistent, as you said, for several quarters. So I think our pays per control metric, or NER, in my opinion, are better proxies for measuring underlying labor growth, unless you\u2019re willing to go one level deeper in the government\u2019s data and not focus just on the unemployment rate. So I don\u2019t know, Jan probably has a couple of comments.","Jan Siegmund","David, I think the delta between the national growth employment, which hovers around 2%, I believe, and our 2.5% pays per control is fairly consistent. So our client base historically has outgrown the economy a tiny bit, and that has to do with company mix and the type of clients we attract. So the trends are strong. And I think what Carlos was indicating in his earlier comments is really a question of how long is the U.S. labor market providing that type of pool for those types of growth rates. And I think you see this in the beginnings of the wage levels increasing and the tighter labor market. So at some point, that could happen. But so far, our trends are very consistent and consistent with the reports of the overall economy.","David Grossman","Right. And just \u2013 one point of clarification. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve just forgotten how this was accounted for. But when you divested the consumer-directed benefits business last year, are those numbers still in the historical base? And if so, is that about 100 basis points of headwind to your growth rate this year? Or is that eliminated from the base?","Carlos Rodriguez","That is correct. It is \u2013 there\u2019s no more \u2013 not no more, but discontinued ops treatment changed a while back. And so that is one of the things that we have to help you with, both from an acquisition and disposition standpoint of making sure that you guys understand all the ins and outs. And so we just finished lapping that disposition. And it will not be in our numbers on a go-forward basis, but it has put about one point of pressure for the last four quarters on our growth rates.","Jan Siegmund","That\u2019s right. And part of the acceleration that you\u2019ll see is driven by that thing growing out, but we also then have acceleration of our organic revenue growth driven by the two incremental acquisitions that we did. So both the impact in the quarter from M&A activity was slightly below 1%. And so all netted out in the quarter.","David Grossman","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Eskelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Rick Eskelsen","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Carlos, I just wanted to circle back on your comments earlier about acquisitions. I know for a while you\u2019d really stressed simplifying the business. And now that you\u2019ve made these acquisitions, I\u2019m just wondering if you could sort of tie it into your prior comments about simplification. Did you get the business to a point where it made sense to bolt these things on? Did you see things in the internal environment? Just sort of if you can help us tie it together to your prior strategy.","Carlos Rodriguez","It\u2019s a great question because, again, people can convince themselves of anything. So I think we believe that this is not a departure from our strategy around simplification because, frankly, we still have a lot of work to do on that front. So these acquisitions are \u2013 in the case of the Global Cash Card, we did have a card business, but we have a very clear plan that is fairly quick around migrating onto the Global Cash Card platform.","So we bought that acquisition, not to keep it as a separate business, to just have another thing hanging off on the side that we go out and sell and have no integration, which is what got us maybe into some challenges over the years. There\u2019s a very clear plan here with a very clear time line and with a very clear benefit. So we feel like we gained a lot in terms of efficiency, innovation and distribution with Global Cash Card. And our plan is to use that platform on a go-forward basis. And I think we mentioned that shortly after the acquisition.","So that would be very different from maybe historically some things that we acquired that just basically added another product into the lineup and, in many cases, added another product in a business that we were already in. So as an example, we accumulated several benefits, administration platforms and several payroll platforms over the years, and these acquisitions are really entering new markets that are fast-growing with big upside rather than just accumulating, I guess, additional assets in existing businesses.","The WorkMarket acquisition is opening up a whole new category for us, which is independent contractors or freelance workers. So again, like anything in life, we acknowledge that we could look back 2 or 3 years from now and say that was all a rationalization, and it just added more complexity. But we think that the risk\/reward here was definitely on the right \u2013 came out on the right side to make these investments. And we\u2019re incredibly excited about what they could do to our top line growth and our new business bookings going forward.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you. Very helpful. Just my follow- up is on the balance sheet, Jan, you saw \u2013 put to a net debt position. Unusual for you guys. I know some of that\u2019s probably due to timing and some acquisition payments. But just sort of talk about your comfort with the balance sheet and staying potentially in a net debt position. Thank you.","Jan Siegmund","Yes. I think there\u2019s just really, on the balance sheet, nothing fundamental happen. We had a few short-term movements on the accounts receivable that resolved themselves. We had the acquisition payment. The balance sheet movement is nothing that would concern us. The business generates free cash flow in line with our operating earnings growth. And so I\u2019m not seeing anything. What you see and what you will observe is, due to the rising rate environment, the gains in our client fund portfolio have shifted to a loss, which means, basically, the embedded rate in our client fund portfolio are now lower than the market rates. But since we hold all these securities to maturity, there will be no impact on our operations. So this is to be expected for the portion of the client fund assets that we have on our balance sheet. That should be just mathematical basically.","Carlos Rodriguez","And I think \u2013 I would just comment that I think we still have one of the most conservative balance sheets around. And I think that the debt offering that we did, which is now that we\u2019ve returned several billion dollars back in the form of share buybacks over the last few years, as you see our cash balance going down, that\u2019s exactly what we wanted to do.","We\u2019re trying to optimize our capital structure. So I would argue we still have a little bit of debt capacity. And I think we\u2019re very happy with our balance sheet, as are the credit rating agencies. And we have all the financial flexibility in the world that we need. So I see it, frankly, as a positive that we\u2019ve worked down our balances through both acquisitions, share buybacks and dividends or cash balances.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from James Berkley of Barclays. Your line is now open.","James Berkley","Just on the recent WorkMarket and Global Cash deals, could you speak to the opportunity on the cost and revenue synergy side, particularly as it pertains to helping ADP continue its push towards cloud-based solutions and expand into new markets? Just what percent of your business in terms of revenue is this deal touching \u2013 the deal\u2019s touching? And what size TAM do you see that opening up for you? I know you spoke to new opportunities there as well.","Carlos Rodriguez","Listen, it\u2019s a great question. Again, it\u2019s probably beyond the scope of the call, but I\u2019ll try to give you a little bit of color. As with a lot of things that ADP does, I hate to keep saying it, but because of our size, the short- term impact on revenues in the bottom line are not going to be immediately obvious. So then a little bit of pressure on our margin as a result of some dilution.","But that\u2019s only really short- term. On the Global Cash Card side, I think we\u2019ve given a ballpark, it\u2019s probably around a $100 million business in terms of revenues. That gives you some sense. We expect that, when it\u2019s combined with our pay card business, to grow faster than the line average of the business.","We\u2019ve, I think, mentioned previously in our comments about impact of acquisitions that our acquisition had about a 1% impact on our revenue growth. So I think it gives you a little bit of sizing, if you will. WorkMarket was small, but the technology in the platform \u2013 first of all, it is a cloud-based platform modern technology stack. We anticipate that, that could touch and is an opportunity for our entire client base in the United States in the domestic market.","Almost every company from small to large companies use independent contractors or freelance workers. And so, obviously, it\u2019s going to take us some time to make sure that we have the right value proposition of the combination of Global Cash Card with WorkMarket, with our traditional compliance and HCM solutions. But as we work through that, we think that, that opens up an enormous market before us in the kind of the rest of the way people work, which are around freelance work.","So I think having the ability to cover both W2, traditional W2 employees as well as freelance workers, I think this opens up a huge opportunity for ADP. The freelance market is growing faster than the W2 way of employing people. And so I think that also allows us to capture that segment of the market, which is clearly growing faster than the traditional part of the economy, which is the traditional W2 employer \u2013 employee.","Jan Siegmund","Yes. Just with the market sizing, we have approximately, I think, 170 million W2 workers and about 50 million to 60 million 1099 workers in U.S. according to our market research. So \u2013 and about 90% of our major accounts, the national account clients have meaningful contingent worker employments. So that makes the acquisition that is clearly very early stage, very small today kind of strategically so interesting to us.","And so it will do 2 things. I think it will enhance the competitiveness of our core offerings because, over time, this will take a little bit of a while to integrate, but it will become part of our \u2013 deeply integrated into our core HCM platforms. And then we\u2019ll offer, obviously, incremental revenue opportunities to service those gig workers. So for the immediate impact during \u2013 given the small size this business is today, next 18 months, probably not as much, but over time I think a meaningful differentiation going forward.","James Berkley","Okay thank you. Yes. I would think, over time, there\u2019d be some ample opportunity there on the margin side, just given the shift to the cloud, and the fact they can touch your entire U.S. ES segment, it looks like. But just as a quick follow-up, just on the \u2013 in terms of you guys are nearing the end of your mid-market migrations, should we see a meaningful benefit to margins from shutting down the old platform at all? Or any color you can give on the progress and timing or expectations for the upmarket as well would be helpful.","Carlos Rodriguez","I think the best way to look at it is to see the experience we had in Small Business in our downmarket, which is the shutdown of the platform, of legacy platforms when they occur are \u2013 they have an impact on our margins and our cost. But typically, the largest cost, the largest improvement comes as a result of simplification and focus and ability to really focus on process improvement in a single platform.","And that usually evolves over time. So what you\u2019ve seen in the downmarket, I think as we\u2019ve given you color every quarter and every year for the last 3 or 4 years, the day that we shut down the legacy Small Business platform, the next day, we didn\u2019t have this massive margin improvement and an incredible reduction in cost. But over the ensuing 2 or 3 years, we did. And so that business has increased its volume in a significant way in the last 3 or 4 years, and the headcount has remained relatively flat.","And we attribute a lot of that to, first, developing the right technology; second, migrating all the clients onto one platform; and third, driving process improvement to take out non-value-added activities and really create value for the clients. And so we anticipate the same thing happening in the mid-markets. So the good news is, if you look at that historical experience in Small Business is that we\u2019re close to the end on phase one. We have the technology. We have the upgrades almost complete. And now, over the next several quarters and years, we anticipate real benefits to accrue to us from the simplification and the focus.","Jan Siegmund","And as a reminder, improvement in retention is probably economically the most important factor in this, but we still have a few clients to migrate as we saw in the mid-market in the third quarter. And as we have indicated in the past, we take a very, very careful approach, so that we don\u2019t lose clients in the process unnecessarily. But you never know when you come to the end. But \u2013 so the stabilization of retention rates that we have seen and the improvement, quite frankly, in the mid-market, hopefully, will continue. And that will drive really then incremental profit opportunity by just keeping more clients longer.","Carlos Rodriguez","That\u2019s a fair point. It\u2019s great that Jan brought that up because if we go back to Small Business, a main reason why we\u2019ve seen these margin improvements, efficiency improvements and client experience improvements is because of all things I mentioned about one platform simplification. But clearly, we have much higher retention rates in the downmarket than we did 4 or 5 years ago. And that obviously leads to incredible improvement in the economics of these businesses.","Operator","Our next question is David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Togut","Thank you. Good morning. Historically, Carlos, ADP\u2019s seen a nice pickup in demand whenever there\u2019s major changes in the tax code. And I think, historically, those changes have created more complexity, which drives the increased demand. Could you talk about U.S. corporate tax reform in terms of whether you think it creates more complexity or more simplicity and how the impacted tax reform longer term might impact demand for ADP services, both in ES and in PEO.","Jan Siegmund","Yes. David, if I jump ahead of Carlos here, I would rate the impact on our tax filing business as relatively neutral at this point in time. So the changes were relatively easy to implement, and I don\u2019t think that has fundamentally changed the complexity of the payroll business. Going forward, I think there\u2019s a high degree of uncertainty as states evaluate their reactions and their consequent steps to the overall changes of the compact of the overall tax bundle that was created.","And in theory, it could make it complex. If states is going to change their attitude of how they want to tax their constituencies, it could. But I think that\u2019s very speculative today. So my answer would be fairly neutral at this point. We\u2019re implementing and implemented those tax rate changes fairly quickly. And that itself was not a big trigger point. I think the increased liquidity and the increased cash inflow from overseas and all that stuff should be a stimulus in the U.S. economy. And I think we\u2019re seeing certainly immediate results from that from all the reactions that you also read in the newspaper. So that should help the overall economy, and that will be positive for us. That\u2019s kind of my overall assessment.","David Togut","Got it. And just as a quick follow-up. You called out strength in bookings in the quarter, both in downmarket and multinational accounts. Could you give us an update on demand trends in the mid-market and also in U.S. national accounts?","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes. I mean, I\u2019d say that, again, this quarter, because, again, it\u2019s \u2013 the bookings number, like the retention number, can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. But I\u2019d say we held our own. I mean, obviously, if I didn\u2019t mention them when I talked about our strength. And they weren\u2019t on a relative basis as strong, but I can tell you that compared \u2013 it\u2019s all about relativity. So the relative performance of our mid-market and upmarket are much better this quarter than last year\u2019s second quarter.","But the growth itself was strongest and driven by the businesses that I mentioned previously. But it is important to note that from a \u2013 trend-wise that we are very happy with the direction that our mid-market and upmarket businesses have taken. We had a nice increase in the quarter, for example, in new business bookings on our Workforce Now platform in the upmarket, above 1,000, which I think we\u2019ve kind of reinvigorated that offering in that product to really compete in a segment of the upmarket where it competes very, very well for particular types of clients. So we had a nice growth versus the prior year in terms of the total number of units in the upmarket on our Workforce Now platform. And then on Vantage, we \u2013 I would say we held our own versus the previous year in terms of new client count sales.","So I\u2019d say we\u2019re pleased and still working through a grow-over issue that the second quarter of last year was the last quarter where we saw meaningful ACA sales in our business. And so that gives you some sense of why I can\u2019t be as positive because it\u2019s just mathematically difficult. It was mathematically difficult.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you. Carlos, a question on PEO services. You\u2019ve commented, obviously, in the past about the continued strength in worksite employee growth. It was a pretty solid 10% this quarter. Given what\u2019s happening with both ACA funding and the low unemployment rate, do you think PEO growth might taper off in the next couple of years as we get into late cycle? And any thoughts on sort of the multiyear view on that?","Carlos Rodriguez","I think it\u2019s a great question, and I wish I had a crystal ball. We\u2019re not planning on it. So our headcount plans and our investments, I think, are not planning for a deceleration. We\u2019re going to try to continue the growth because the opportunity is still there. The value proposition is very strong. But I think you\u2019re absolutely asking a fair question, which is we have to be \u2013 and this is a place for us to be cautious in terms of we happen to have very strong pass-through growth, which gives us healthy top line growth. But that obviously has a margin impact, and it makes things hard to read.","But the worksite employee count growth is really the right place to focus on, and I think that double-digit growth is still quite strong and, I think, quite satisfying to us. But I think it\u2019s something that we have to keep an eye on. We have a lot of tailwinds in our business as a result of ACA. I have said during it, not just afterwards, that it felt like we were getting some tailwinds. And obviously, those tailwinds have abated. So I think it\u2019s just become harder in the PEO business.","Jan Siegmund","I think my one thought that might be also helpful is if you see health care inflation, that means our clients' experience, higher benefit renewals, basically, and that causes, obviously, more thinking in the clients. And so you have to be very thoughtful that you remain committed in your benefit offerings. But overall, faster inflation, I think, will create just focus on the value proposition, which is exactly why we have to pay attention to it and be thoughtful.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Understood, thank you for that. And then the follow-up question\u2019s on the WorkMarket activation. It seems like a good one, the gig economy in general. Will gig economy workers be included in your pays per control metric as they flow in and out? I mean, how should one treat them vis-a-vis a permanent employee? And I think you addressed this, but this is more of a technology play. So I assume you don\u2019t have to go make many similar acquisitions to build scale.","Carlos Rodriguez","That is correct. It\u2019s a technology acquisition. And I think that as we\u2019ve always talked about pays per control, our pays per control is a subsegment of our total pays in ADP because we want to use one platform in order to be able to isolate same-store sales growth.","And so, for example, our pays per control metric that we report doesn\u2019t include every platform that ADP has to begin with. And hence we would not anticipate including WorkMarket in that. And as WorkMarket becomes bigger, this is probably a few years down the road, we\u2019ll find a way to give you that metric separately, right, because I think it\u2019s important. Because my sense is that\u2019s going to grow very rapidly, and it might be of interest to the external market. But I think, for now, it\u2019s business as usual.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Silber of BMO. Your line is open.","Henry Chien","Hi, thanks. It\u2019s Henry Chien for Jeff. I just wanted to follow up on the pass-through revenues just to make sure I\u2019m understanding this correctly. Is the uptick there, is that more a function of product mix and, say, just increases in premiums? I\u2019m just trying to understand if there\u2019s any change in the underlying growth rate for either PEO or Employer Services and any changes there, I think.","Carlos Rodriguez","I think it\u2019s probably \u2013 I think Jan has some details, but I would say that \u2013 it\u2019s safe to say that the Affordable Care Act, as a result of either the law itself, because I don\u2019t want to make a political statement here, but I think health care inflation is higher, let\u2019s just say, in general, than it was 2 or 3 years ago.","And we serve 500,000 worksite employees, most of which have health care, and it\u2019s part of the value proposition that our clients come to us for. And hence, we would not be immune from that, and our clients would not be immune from that, especially given that we treat this as, \"a pass-through.\" And so I think it\u2019s that simple. There\u2019s really not \u2013 there\u2019s not a big mix issue here, and it\u2019s higher health care inflation.","And by the way, we\u2019ve had that \u2013 we\u2019ve owned this PEO for a long time, and we\u2019ve been through other periods of accelerating health care inflations. So this is not unusual in the historical context.","Jan Siegmund","Yes. The pass-throughs are growing faster than our worksite employee count. For that reason, the pass-throughs are harder to forecast because there\u2019s a number of factors that drive this. It starts with the actual renewal that we get on our policies. And then, obviously, with the lineup that our clients, the employers choose and the plan mix that they offer to their employees, and then what plans employees are actually choosing in enrollment period.","And we have seen higher renewals, which is the health care inflation that Carlos mentioned, and that\u2019s a large chunk of the faster growth above our worksite employee growth. But we have also seen \u2013 now comes the 201 inside that employee is choosing slightly richer plans, and then they have a slight mixed shift away from the lowest offering to a little bit of richer plan and mix. So that\u2019s \u2013 what we have seen throughout enrollment season.","And so the vast majority is health care inflation, but there\u2019s some little mixed shift in the pass- through growth as well.","Henry Chien","Okay. Great it had actually helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you, And we have time for one more question, which comes from the line of Mark Marcon of R. W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon","Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Carlos, you\u2019ve got a long history on the PEO side, and I was wondering if you could share your perspective on 2 fronts. One would be like where do you think we are in terms of the maturation of the PEO concept? And specifically across the country, when we take a look, obviously, Florida, Texas, well penetrated, more mature.","But when we think about the country broadly speaking outside of those markets or maybe a couple of other states, where do you think we are in terms of the evolution? And then secondly, could you comment a little bit about the balkanization that we\u2019re seeing with regards to regulations? When we take a look at states like California, New York, et cetera, we\u2019re starting to see all sorts of different regs that are popping up. That must make it difficult to be in compliance.","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes. I think on the first point, I just \u2013 I think my reaction about the question about the PEO, first and foremost, is to say, my immediate reaction is pride, right? So what\u2019s happened to that business in the last 18 or 19 years as ADP has owned it, if we could do a few of those, would certainly make a difference for the company.","And I think that what drove the success, besides a lot of hard work from a lot of people, and a lot of good execution was the fundamental strength, the value proposition and the underlying trends. And I think those still are intact. So despite the comments you made about penetration in some states improving over the years, it\u2019s still really a relatively small part of the market that\u2019s served by PEOs.","So \u2013 and it\u2019s tied to the second part of your question, which is, unless you believe that all of a sudden it\u2019s going to get easier to be an employer \u2013 and I think Jan touched on this a little bit around tax and the fact that states might have different views on how to deal with tax reform from their perspective. And then tying that to the second part of your question, one of the good things for ADP is that since ADP has existed and since this country has existed, there\u2019s been a non-ending trend towards more complexity around being an employer or even being a corporation.","And we clearly now have a focus on deregulation from the current administration. But you have to take that in context. A lot of that is around energy and other sectors of the economy, in some cases, appropriately so probably. But again, without making political statements, it\u2019s safe to say that the task of being an employer at either the federal level or the state and local level because it matters. It\u2019s not just about headlines around what the federal government is doing, it\u2019s also around what you\u2019re talking about, is if you\u2019re an employer in multiple states, you have a very difficult task keeping up with all of the various regulations that are intended to push forward public policy at the state level, if not at the federal level.","And so that is all kind of a dream situation, if you will, for ADP because companies should be focused on their core business and on executing on their companies not on trying to deal with all of these changes in the regulation. And the majority of companies want to be in compliance with these regulations.","So I think it affects not just the PEO, but it affects the overall ADP business. And I think we remain as optimistic today as we ever have. That\u2019s probably why the industry in general, the HCMs in general is growing faster than GDP. And ADP, with its strong compliance orientation, probably has an even greater benefit because of the DNA that we have around helping clients deal with the complexity that you\u2019re describing.","So I think answer number one is, I think the PEO\u2019s not done in terms of the opportunity that\u2019s out there just because of simple mathematics. That doesn\u2019t mean or guarantee that the execution will be there because we have to still execute, and the rest of the industry has to execute. But I think the opportunity is still definitely there.","And then secondly, you touched on a very important point that I think Jan kind of also touched on, which is we don\u2019t see any abatement in the complexity and the difficulty of being an employer in the United States.","Mark Marcon","Great. That\u2019s precisely where I was getting at. And then, I mean, just to boil it down on the long runway. I mean, if you were putting it in baseball terms, would you say PEO is maybe in the third or fourth inning in terms of penetration? Or how would you characterize it?","Carlos Rodriguez","I\u2019m going to let Jan answer that question because he\u2019s an expert in baseball. Jan, do you know how many innings there are in baseball? I can answer that question. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s \u2013 it probably shouldn\u2019t be in the business we\u2019re trying to forecast. I think the \u2013 I would focus really, like I always do, on the math, right? The number of \u2013 the total \u2013 I think the industry says that there are about 2 million \u2013 you probably know better than I do, Mark, but I think the PEO industry says that there\u2019s about 2 million people under PEO arrangements, maybe 2.5 million.","And Jan said there\u2019s 170 million private sector employees. We know that, obviously, this is a downmarket and mid- market type of value proposition. There\u2019s 26 million people on our own payroll systems, as we report every \u2013 to you on a regular basis. And we have 500,000. So I think anyway you look at it, it looks like there\u2019s plenty of opportunity. But I think it\u2019s dangerous for me to use a baseball analogy because you\u2019ll probably remind me of it for the next 5 or 10 years.","Mark Marcon","I won\u2019t do that. Okay, congratulation.","Carlos Rodriguez","Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude our question-and-answer session portion for today. I\u2019m pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks.","Carlos Rodriguez","Thanks. I think as you can see, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made on our strategic initiatives during the first half of the year. And we also want to just reiterate our welcome to our colleagues from WorkMarket to ADP, and we look forward to the success we\u2019re going to have together. It\u2019s acquisitions like these, along with the investments we\u2019ve made in the next-gen solutions that I think demonstrate our commitment to progress and our commitment to our transformative strategy.","As you can probably tell from the call, we also are anything but status quo here at ADP. We intend to move forward with pace and with conviction. We\u2019ve talked to our leadership about moving with urgency, but also with care because our client experience and our retention rates are also incredibly important.","And lastly, I\u2019ll say that we carefully listened and learned from all of our shareholder engagements during the proxy contest. And I think they decided the things we learned. It also strengthened our resolve to accelerate the execution of the strategy that I think was \u2013 I think on the right path to begin with. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little bit of acceleration.","Our markets are changing. The nature of work is changing. I think that creates opportunity. And it creates, as we said, in some cases, complexity for employers. And I think that\u2019s good for ADP. So I thank you for joining the call today. We look forward to continuing to share the details of our journey with you down the road, and we appreciate your interest in ADP.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter FY \u201816 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions].","I will now turn the conference over to Miss Sara Grilliot, Vice President of Investor or Relations. Please go ahead.","Sara Grilliot","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Sara Grilliot, ADP's Vice President Investor Relations and I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter FY '16 earnings call and webcast. Before we begin, you may have noticed in the slide presentation posted on our website that we included the detail of our client funds available for sale portfolios as of June 30th, 2016 which shows the embedded book yields of the portfolio by year of maturity. This is chart is in the appendix of the presentation and is provided for your information.","During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental sides on our Investor Relations website.","Before Carlos begins, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filing with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","Now let me turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos Rodriguez","Thank you, Sara and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call and for your continued interest in ADP. This morning we reported solid results for the fourth quarter and full FY '16, with revenue up 8% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, FY '16 revenue grew 8%. Please keep in mind that our 8% growth in FY '16 was negatively impacted by about 1% from the sale of our AdvancedMD business which occurred at the end of the first fiscal quarter. In addition to the solid FY '16 revenue growth, I'm very pleased with the robust new business bookings results we experienced during FY '16, posting 12% growth for the year. This represents $1.75 billion in new recurring revenue generated by our sales force during the fiscal year.","Strong sales of human capital management modules that assist clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act contributed meaningfully to the out performance we've seen in new business bookings for the past two fiscal years. This important regulatory change impacted the ATM industry in material ways. ADP responded well and sold our ACA compliance solutions to about half of our addressable base in a relatively short period of time. Because of this very strong recent performance and the resulting difficult compare, we expect FY '17 new business bookings to grow 4% to 6% from the $1.75 billion sold in FY '16. If achieved this will result in a three year compounded annual growth rate of 9% which is within our long-term expected range of 8% to 10%.","FY '16 was an exciting year that showcased ADP's agility as we continued to adapt to the dynamic needs of our clients. When we look back at our progress, it's clear that the long-term trends we see with respect to the changing nature of how work is done, the increasing complexity of regulatory compliance, the trend toward harnessing the power of big data and HR and the need to work seamlessly across geographic boarders are all having positive impacts on our success.","We've responded to these trends in many ways during the year. For example, across the portfolio, we've dramatically improved the user experience of our clients' employees. In doing so, we've made our products easier to use and more consistent with how employees engage with consumer technology and social media. If your company is an ADP client, I invite you to join the more than eight million users of ADP's mobile app to experience this for yourself.","We've leveraged our unique data set of 26 billion payroll records to introduce significant new data analytics capabilities. Since introducing ADP DataCloud just over one year ago, we now have more than 2500 clients using this solution to generate actionable insights that help address work force productivity, contribute to talent development and assist with employee retention.","We've expanded our capabilities geographically and can now meet the payroll processing and compliance needs of companies with operations in more than 110 countries and territories which is a key differentiator in our industry. And we've met the challenges presented by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. With strong demand for our ACA solutions, we made investments in operational resources and successfully helped more than 25,000 clients process more than 10 million form 1095-Cs, the most significant new employee tax form introduced by the IRS since the W-2.","As we've discussed, we believe our investments to innovate and simplify our portfolio are essential for our long-term success. We believe our strategic platforms now deliver best-in-class HCM capabilities in each of the markets they serve and we've seen solid retention rates from clients on our strategic platforms. Therefore, continuing to upgrade clients to our modern cloud solutions remains a critical area of focus for us and is the right thing to do for our clients. Today, all of our small business clients are on the RUN platform and during the fourth quarter we increased the pace of our client migrations in the mid-market and now have about 49,000 clients on the latest versions of Workforce Now.","With 2\/3 of this base now upgraded, we expect the balance of our Workforce Now clients to be transitioned to the current platform by the end of FY '17. As we continue to move clients onto our strategic platforms and have more clients engaging ADP for multiple services across the HCM spectrum, we're embarking on a path to simplify our service model for our associates and our clients. Over the past several years, our technology platforms have evolved to meet the dynamic needs of our clients, who are choosing to engage in a more comprehensive way with their HCM providers. As a result of this shift, a new approach to service is essential to support the HCM Company that we've become and extend our leadership in this growing market and I'm therefore excited to tell you about a service initiative we're kicking off in FY '17.","This new initiative is designed to better align our service organization to work across traditional lines, leverage best-in-class service tools and processes and establish teams with expertise across the HCM spectrum. We believe this will enhance the client experience and at the same time allow us to better transfer knowledge among these service teams and offer robust career opportunities within the service organization, all of which benefits our clients and our associates.","As we begin to build out this new service model, we believe there's a benefit to be gained by collocating certain U.S. service capabilities at existing and new ADP locations in the U.S. that have the scale to support the strategy. We have had positive experiences creating centers like these at sites such as El Paso, Texas; Augusta, Georgia; among other places.","We've recently selected Norfolk, Virginia and Maitland, Florida, near Orlando, as our next two locations and have started building cross-functional service teams at both sites. We will announce a third new site in the western part of the U.S. later this year. As part of this initiative, we will focus on building service capabilities within these and our existing other locations while streamlining our geographic footprint.","In connection with these efforts, ADP will be making certain investments in FY '17 which are expected to put some pressure on our margin expansion goals for the year. Jan will provide more detail when he reviews FY '17 outlook. However, we do expect our margin expansion in FY '17 to be lower than our long-term goal of 50 to 75 basis points as we make these important investments.","Now let's spend a few moments on retention. During the fourth quarter, we experienced a retention decline of 80 basis points and for the full fiscal year, retention declined about 1 point to 90.5%. Similar to previous quarters, we continue to see a concentration of losses from clients who are still on legacy technology and while we have seen some of the benefits from investments we've made in service during the early part of FY '16, we continue to experience variability in our retention metric.","In closing, FY '16 was an exciting and challenging year for ADP. We achieved strong revenue growth driven by sales of additional HCM modules to support clients with the new ACA requirements. We invested in implementation and operational resources to support this revenue growth while still delivering solid margin expansion and we did this while remaining consistent with our commitment to shareholder-friendly actions.","During FY '16, we returned about $2.1 billion in cash through dividends and share repurchases and increased our dividend for the 41st consecutive year. I am confident that as we successfully execute against our strategy, we will continue to drive results for our clients, our associates and our shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan who will review our FY '16 financials and share our FY '17 outlook.","Jan Siegmund","Thank you very much, Carlos and good morning everyone. During the fourth quarter, we took a severance charge of $48 million that was related to a broad-based workforce optimization effort. Certain non-GAAP measures and my commentary to follow exclude the impact of this charge, as well as certain other one-time items recognized earlier in the fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental charts of our Investor Relations website.","As Carlos mentioned, FY '16 was a successful year for ADP. New business bookings grew 12% to $1.75 billion sold. Revenues grew 7% to $11.7 billion. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues grew 8% for the year. On a reported basis, net earnings grew 8% and diluted earnings per share grew 12%.","Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT, grew 10% or 11% on a constant dollar basis. For the year, adjusted EBIT margin expanded 60 basis points from the 18.8% in FY '15. I'm pleased with this solid margin expansion which includes the impact of investments and operational resources that were made during the fiscal year as we supported our clients through the first year of the ACA related reporting requirements.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $3.26, reflecting a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid more than $900 million in dividends and returned about $1.2 billion through share repurchases for FY '16. During the fourth quarter, ADP returned $100 million to shareholders through share repurchases which was at a reduced pace compared with prior quarters. Market conditions were not a factor and our longstanding commitment to return cash to our shareholders remains unchanged.","So now, for a discussion of our segment results. In our employee services segment, revenues grew 5% for the year or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions to new recurring revenues during the fiscal year from strong new business bookings sold. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 80 basis points in the fourth quarter and for the year revenue retention declined about 1 point to 90.5%. Our same-store pace for control in the U.S. grew 2.5% for the fiscal year. Average client fund balances grew 3% for year or 4% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was slower than in prior years, primarily related to the declines of state unemployment insurance collections as the result of an improving labor market in the U.S.","This, in combination with the impact from client losses experienced end of the year, has put added pressure on the client funds balance growth. Our business outside of North America continues to perform well despite an uncertain global environment. This performance is driven by continued strong demand for our multinational solutions which serve businesses of all sizes and are now the largest contributor to our sales outside of North America.","Employee services segment margin increased about 60 basis points for the fiscal year. This increase was driven by reduced selling expenses in the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter, partially offset by the negative impact of planned investments made throughout the year to support our clients with the first year of ACA compliance.","The PEO had a successful year, posting revenue growth of 16% and average worksite employee growth of 13%. Let me make a few comments about fourth quarter revenue growth in the PEO which trended lower at 13% growth compared with the previous three quarters in FY '16. This revenue growth deceleration was based on two factors. First, regarding our gross revenues which include pass-throughs, our clients experienced a favorable impact from lower healthcare renewal premiums during our fourth quarter which contributed to a lower relative gross in our pass-through revenues.","Second, in the fourth quarter we noticed some variability in the timing of payrolls run by our clients. This type of timing variability has occurred in the past and should not be viewed as an indicator of any underlining change in the fundamentals of the business. We remain pleased with the performance of our PEO which had strong worksite employee growth of 13% and we're happy to see that the PEO also delivered strong margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points for FY '16 which was primarily driven by operating and selling efficiencies from increased productivity.","This is solid overall performance for FY '16, with strong new business bookings yielding healthy revenue growth and solid margin expansion despite the initial investments we made during the year. I'm pleased with our results and will now take you through our expectations for FY '17. As Carlos mentioned, for FY '17, we're expecting new business bookings growth of 4% to 6%, from $1.75 billion sold in FY '16. We anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the year which is not expected to be significantly impacted by foreign currency translation based on current rates.","This forecast assumes 4% to 5% revenue growth in the employer services segment and growth in pays-per-control of 2.5%. Revenue growth for the PEO is expected to be 14% to 16%. ADP's adjusted EBIT margin is expected to it expand 25 to 50 basis points from the 19.5% in FY '16 which is below our goal of 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion over the longer run. We're still committed to this margin improvement goal over the longer term, but as Carlos mentioned, we're making investments in FY '17 to align our service model in support of our technology strategy. We expect these operational investments will put about 20 basis points of pressure on our FY '17 margins and as a result of these build-out of the new facilities, total expenditures\/capital expenditures for FY '17, I expect it to be about $250 million.","In addition to these investments, we also anticipate certain one-time charges of $100 million to $125 million throughout FY '18. Of this, $45 million is expected to be incurred during the first quarter of FY '17 and $45 million in the latter part of the year, with the remainder expected in FY '18. These charges are excluded from our FY '17 forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion and from our adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast. A reconciliation of these metrics can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","On a segment level, we anticipate pretext margin expansion of about 50 basis points for employer services and 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO. On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 6% to 8% compared with the $3.25 FY '15. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 10% to 12% from the adjusted $3.26 in FY '16 and contemplates an adjusted effective tax rate of 33.3%, consistent with the 33.3% in FY '16. In accordance to our continued shareholder-friendly actions and our intention to return excess cash to shareholders, our earnings per share forecast assumes that excess cash of $1 billion to $1.4 billion will be returned via share repurchases during FY '17.","This forecasted range includes anticipated share repurchases required to offset employee benefit plan issuance and the timing of these share repurchases is dependent upon market conditions. So with that, I will take you through our forecast for the client fund extended investment strategy. First, a reminder that the objectives of our investment strategy remain the safety, liquidity and diversification of our assets. As of the end of the fiscal year, approximately 80% of our fixed income portfolio was invested in AAA and AA-rated securities.","In a typical year, our strategy results in about 15% to 20% of our fixed income investments maturing and this year we expect the percentage of maturities will be closer to the lower end of this range. We continue to base the interest rate assumptions in our forecast on the Fed funds future contracts for the clients' short and corporate cash portfolios. And the forward year curves of the three-and-a-half and five-year U.S. government agency forward year curves for the client and corporate extended and the client long portfolios, respectively. And as we do not believe it is possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the year curve and the new bond issuance behavior are corporate and other issuers.","For FY '17, we anticipate growth in the average client funds balances of 2% to 4% from the $22.4 billion in FY '16. We anticipate that the yield of the client fund portfolio will remain about flat at 1.7%, compared with FY '16. These factors are expected to result in an increase of up to $5 million to client fund interest revenue. The total contribution from the client funds extended investment strategy is expected to be about flat to FY '17. The detail of this forecast is available in the supplemental slides on our website.","And before we take your questions, I wanted to let you know that Sara will be taking a new role within ADP finance as a CFO of one of our business units. I want to thank Sara for her contributions leading our investor relations program and welcome our new Head of Investor Relations, Christian Greyenbuhl, who was recently -- who has recently led ADP's global accounting team.","So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from the line of James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider","I was wondering if you could maybe give us an update on the migrations in the mid-market segment. I think you said 45,000 had already migrated. It sounds like maybe that's under 40,000 clients to go.","Can you maybe talk about any changes you're seeing in terms of, as you make those migrations, whether you're seeing any kind of additional client losses and maybe you can just talk about the pace of migrations over the course of FY '17, whether that's going to be back or front-half loaded or just ratable over the course of the year?","Carlos Rodriguez","Sure. I think the number was really 49,000 that have been migrated and I think we have about 25,000 to go. In terms of the other questions, you know, we did have some time to kind of reset how we were doing migrations and the pace also based on, you know, I mentioned that there were three factors that I think impacted our retention back over the last three quarters and we think one of them was the pace of migrations and also the execution around migrations. So a lot of work was done during what we call our year-end blackout because we really prefer not to do migrations anyway in the call it November to January, February time frame, because there are so many things going on at the calendar year-end in a typical HCM payroll company.","And so that gave us a little bit of time for those folks to focus on kind of stabilizing that organization and rethinking what the proper pace is and to put it in perspective, we migrated approximately 4000 clients during the quarter. And when we experienced challenges with some of the migrations, we were up as high as 7000 in a quarter. This is back in the beginning of this fiscal year. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color and I think the overall comment is clearly I think our competitors are fishing in those waters, because we see it in the numbers in terms of our losses being concentrated in our legacy platforms.","And we're trying to reduce the size of the fishing pond, so there's still some variability there in the retention. But I think we've gotten better at how we're doing the migrations and I think our pace is more manageable and I think easier for us to control at this point.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Christin Chen","This is Christin Chen for Jason. Thank you for taking my question. We were under the impression in FY '16, your bookings growth in excess of the traditional 8% to 10% range was mostly due to ACA. Just looking at the 4% to 6% for FY '17, it would imply a slowdown of, you know, kind of more than just what the tough comps from ACA would imply. Can you just talk about the things you're seeing or the underlying drivers behind that deceleration for this metric? Thanks.","Carlos Rodriguez","Sure, I will let maybe Jan talk a little about the math, but I think the math does kind of work in within maybe 0.5 point to 1 point, one way or the other depending on your perspective. Because we don't provide exact numbers. But we want to reiterate that we had strong growth in new business bookings this year excluding, ACA.","And then mathematically, what that creates is a grow-over for next year. I think I've previously said and we will say today that we don't expect the same level of new business bookings from ACA. Since we've already sold half of our addressable market, even if we assume that we sell half of the remaining half next year, that creates a mathematical grow-over issue for us. I'll let maybe Jan comment on the math. But I think the message you should hear from us is that we believe over the course of three years, as you can imagine, we look very carefully about, is the sales strength coming from core operations, is it coming from additional business, is it coming from ACA and we feel pretty good on a three-year compounded basis about where our new business bookings growth is right now.","Jan Siegmund","Yes, thank you Carlos. And there are two different methods you can look at this, you could exclude the ACA impact on all three years and look at the underlining growth of the rest of our new business bookings. We would be delivering exactly what we have said are in-line with our long-term goals expectations of 8% to 10% over those three years.","And you can also look at is the decline driven by a slowing of ACA sales in FY '17 and that is yes, because we have at rest already half of our business opportunity in the first year and we don't expect to close, cover 100% of the sales opportunity in FY '17. So we had to make assumptions about that and so both are in line within a percentage point plus, minus. So this is for government work, an estimate that keeps it intact.","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes, I think more government work, again, these are not the right numbers, but mathematically if you take 4% out of the 12% it gives you 8%. And if you add 4% to the 4% to 6%, you get back to 8% to 9% and you're still within the 8% to 10% range. So I hate to be so simplistic, but I think that's really the way the math works.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Sara Gubins","The EF guidance for 4% to 5% revenue growth just slower growth in constant currency than what we've been seeing recently, in spite of the ACA bookings that you got this past year. Is that because of retention and could you give us any color on what kind of revenue you did get from ACA last year and what you're expecting for this coming year?","Carlos Rodriguez","I think that the ES revenue growth has been accelerating for the last five years. And I think some of that obviously is driven by the economy, in terms of as the economy rebounded, I think we had some help in pace per control and a number of other factors and just the strong new business bookings growth has created a bigger gap between our starts, what we call our starts and our losses and I think that has contributed to this accelerating growth in employer services. I think you're right that the losses that we experienced this year obviously have an effect this year and they have an effect on the following year as well. But again, back to kind of simplistic math for government work, I think we're probably plus or minus 0.5 point in terms of ES revenue growth. So maybe some of that is rounding, but we don't feel any weakness, I guess, to be clear. And the ACA revenues, Jan probably has the exact number, that clearly provided lift in our new business bookings and does provide lift to revenues that then also presents somewhat of a grow-over. It's not as pronounced a grow-over, because it's a revenue number versus a new business bookings number, but it does have the same impact. But we feel where we're right now, employer services, feels like a pretty good place in terms of trend and, in terms of trajectory as well.","Jan Siegmund","And we don't provide, really, the precise revenue numbers, but it's kind of a little bit above, in the $100 million plus range of ACA impact to ADP.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ashish Sabadra","This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. Just a follow up question on retention. So last quarter, you had mentioned you had taken steps around improving the service capability which gave you some more confidence around retention, but we still saw the retention grow -- or decline.","Now my question was when you think about the mid-market customer base you still have 25,000 customers remaining which are going to be migrated over the next four quarters and normally you don't do the migration in November, December which should imply around north of 6,000 customers being migrated every quarter, versus 4,000 that you saw in the last quarter. So with this elevated level of migration, how should we think about retention going forward? Could we see retention get worse before it starts to get better? Any clarity that you can provide on the retention front, that will be helpful. Thanks.","Carlos Rodriguez","Sure, it's a good question, it's a fair question. I think your math is actually very close, the only thing I would add to that math is that, you know, you do have to apply a retention -- or a loss factor to that 25,000 itself over the course of 12 months. We naturally, even if we weren't migrating, would lose call it 10% of those clients. It might be a little bit higher than that, just because they're legacy type clients. The absolute number you're starting with that you have to divide over four quarters is a little bit smaller. But you're in the right ballpark. It's probably around 5000 or so clients that need to be migrated per quarter.","We feel pretty comfortable with that pace, given the infrastructure that we've created and the new process we have for migrations. In terms of additional color, as you're pointing out, the results didn't cooperate with our desires and with our intentions and in part, that's because our retention is a reflection of the overall Company's results and there's variability across a lot of other businesses.","I wouldn't read in to it, even though we still have a concentration of our retentions issues in the mid-market and they have been for this fiscal year. There is another $8 billion to $9 billion of revenue in ADP that also experiences variability in retention. But having said that to give you specifics around, you know, why our confidence level was high that things would get better and why it still remains high, we have a number of, in specifically the mid-market, issues that we were experiencing with rewards to retention. We have a lot of metrics, as you can imagine, that we look at that are leading indicators versus retention which is a lagging indicator.","For example, the speed to answer phone calls, number of cases that are unresolved in a backlog, we have a number of escalations in terms of people escalating client service issues and the metrics are -- most of the metrics in the mid-market regarding service experience for our clients are either back to where they were prior to our retention issues or in some cases better.","So we feel confident that even if there's some kind of lag in the sense that some clients may have already been in process due to a poor service experience of looking at alternatives and the fact that there are other parts of ADP that have variability and retention as well, I think not withstanding all those things, I think my confidence in the improvements in service, stability and service experience in the mid-market remain quite high actually.","Jan Siegmund","And if I add a more technical comment, relative to our losses that we see over the fiscal year, we have cyclicality in our loss volumes and so year-end -- calendar year-end on the third quarter for us, fiscal year -- are traditionally higher loss months and the fourth quarter month is a lower loss months. So hence, there can be variability in the quarterly shifts of the retention numbers and this case it impacted a relatively low loss volume that we typically experience in the fourth quarter.","So my general council would be to observe those retention changes that we report, but not to get overly analytical and mathematical quarter-by-quarter. It is a better indicator to think about basically our retention number of 100 basis points decline. So in the fiscal year, in closing, we're aiming to be better. We don't guide to retention, but as you might imagine as a Company, we clearly have aspirations to improve.","Operator","Our next question from the line of David Grossman from Stifel Financial. Your line is open.","David Grossman","I wonder if I could ask a question about the margin guidance. I think you gave us some good color on what the headwinds were going to be into FY '17, but if I understood you right, but if I understood you right there's about 20 basis points of incremental headwinds over and above what you're isolating as nonrecurring. Perhaps you could give us more insight in to, you know, what those incremental charges are and when you bundle everything together, you know, as you come out of FY '17, how should we look at how the model has changed and how the leverage in the model changes beyond FY '17?","Jan Siegmund","So as we described, our initiative is really to create more concentrated centers of excellence and strategic locations and we indicate basically five big cities that we're doing. So as a consequence, approximately 5% of our employee population is going to be transferring or moving or the work will be moving and impacting about 5% of our associate population in this fiscal year. And there are costs that are related to this which are which we're non-GAAPing which are related in essence to employee costs to facilitate the transfer of the work that is basically included in the 20 basis points of our guidance.","We clearly hope that the outcome of this service alignment initiative is multi-folded. I believe strongly it will enhance our service valuable proposition, because we're going to have larger centers with bigger capabilities, leveraging ADP's strength and compliance in service and offering a better value proposition to our clients which is the most exciting part for this service alignment initiative. Hopefully resulting in better competitiveness and higher retention rates and also as you can see, these centers are located in geographies of the U.S. that offer certain advantages, relative to the cost where they operate, so that we should be in the longer run also contribution to our margins.","We're a little bit hesitant to specify this for 2018 because the initiative will actually bleed over in to FY '18, we mentioned in particular the center and investors West is going to come later in 2017 and will bleed over 2018. So 2018 will still have some impact, but we're clearly hoping that it will guarantee basically that we can fulfill our commitment to the 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the long run, so this is an important supporting initiative for that.","Carlos Rodriguez","And David, I think you're right, the 20 basis points is above what we've put in quote, unquote the non-GAAP numbers. And I think, you know, that's just a frictional cost. They are identified. We know what those costs are and they are costed. It's not appropriate to bucket into the non-GAAP charges, I guess is the best way to put it.","I'm not, obviously, the accountant, but I think your math is or your comment was spot on. So that's the, when we provided that color to give you more information to be able to come up with what you might think might be the longer term potential performance of the Company which as Jan said, we're optimistic about.","And I think we're doing these things, you know, really there's two things that we're always focused on, service experience, the client experience from our service organization and implementation and just the operations of the organizational role and our competitiveness and our efficiency. I would call this a large initiative and a complex initiative that hopefully is coming across with the significance that it should and it's multi-year.","David Grossman","And can I ask just one follow up on just the CapEx comment at well. So it sounds like CapEx is over $2 million related to this, so is there anything we should think differently about the year-over-year growth and pre-cash flow in FY '17?","Carlos Rodriguez","I'll let, maybe Jan can comment a little more on the CapEx. We weren't implying that the entire CapEx was because of this initiative. We have normal ongoing normal CapEx. It's just trending higher than it has historically. So wanted to make sure that we put that out there. But I do want to comment, besides Jan giving you the specifics on the numbers, that we're investing in this Company.","So this Company has an industry that has positive global dynamics in terms of growth. We just saw it with ACA in the U.S. We're going to see it with FLSA and the EEOC equity pay rules and we're seeing the same thing in other countries. And so this Company has opportunity. And we intend to invest in order to seize those opportunities.","And so I think what you're seeing is our investment in CapEx and frankly also our investment in capitalized software which we disclosed but is not something that we necessarily always focus on, are all trending higher. And we take the deployment of capital very, very seriously as you know. But people should not mistake what our actions are for anything other than optimism about the future and the potential for these investments to have incremental returns for our shareholders over the long-term.","Jan Siegmund","I have really only two comments to add is, so there's a temporarily higher capital expenditure rate and the increase is to the very largest amount driven by investments into our real estate project to get these facilities up and going. And related investments for this initiative.","And secondly, I'd like also to remind you that ADP has pursued over the last couple of years a growth strategy that is more focused on our organic growth capabilities, focusing on investments into our own product set and focusing in this initiative on enhancing and developing additional market-leading service capabilities. So I think it's right in line with how the strategy has worked for ADP and it's really quite an exciting moment for ADP.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Eccleston from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Rick Eccleston","I wonder if we could go back on the new service initiative. Just kind of see if you could tie it in to the investments that you've made earlier in the delivery side, what informed this and how related or not was it to the service delivery issues and investments that you had earlier and just tie those two together. Thank you.","Carlos Rodriguez","So I'll make a comment and then Jan I think can add. I really appreciate the question because they are, actually, quite separate topics. As though the service delivery issues that we experienced were concentrated in a particular part of our business in the mid-market and they were execution related. And I think what we're talking about in terms of our new service alignment initiative is a broad strategic objective across the entire Company. It's partly driven by the fact that the industry has evolved and I think the clients need to have evolved and the products have evolved.","So as an example,10 years ago, having three or four different products that were serviced differently and different databases was not an issue. Our platforms now are single-database integrated solutions that provide an HCM solution if a client wants to buy it that way, in a comprehensive and seamless way. The service model had not moved in the same direction. And I think that this initiative is really intended to have our service and implementation really align with the way the market is going, the way buyers are buying and the way clients want to be serviced.","So we've done similar things in our sales organization where that also requires that our sales force be trained and equipped to be able to sell in the new environment. So our belief is that now we will have our products, our service and our distribution all aligned.","Jan Siegmund","And I think it is probably the best way to connect our focus on creating competitive technology platforms that are cloud-based and integrated as a prerequisite to create the integrated service model, so we have made really A, great progress with these strategic platforms, but B, also migrated now large numbers of clients on to these platforms. So it really does make good sense at this point in time to launch the service alignment initiative. And as you might imagine, we did have, we have tested these service models and components of our organization at smaller scale. And we have seen great results out of those pilots.","Rick Eccleston","And then if I could just quickly follow up, Jan, on the comment you made earlier about how you've been making more organic investments. Has anything changed just in general in terms of your portfolio shaping, any sort of divestitures, small ones to come and how are you approaching M&A currently? Thank you.","Jan Siegmund","The, no I think our principal stand on M&A has not changed. We have a very solid balanced sheet, we have the capital to investment in the industry and we continue to evaluate opportunities, but we evaluate M&A opportunities in light of our strategic priorities which is -- which are focused at this point in time on reduction of complexity and aligning and focus on our client needs. So any acquisitions that support that drive, what we will actively and aggressively pursue. But it has played out over the last three years to a more organic growth pattern that has seen great results.","And so I think that stand stays the same. I would not expect any dramatic shift in our attitude towards M&A, from what you have seen in the last three years. And relative to divestitures and adjusting the portfolio, I think the large portfolio alignment initiatives have happened, with the spinoff of CDK and I think our larger, last larger divestiture was advanced. There will be here and there smaller type of things as we continually to evaluate the performance of our product portfolio and if we see opportunities to enhance shareholder value, we will pursue it as we have done so in the past. But it's really, in essence, I would anticipate FY '17 to run under the same guide polls as in the last three years.","Carlos Rodriguez","I think Jan's absolutely right on all those points. I would just add that back to the discussion about capital and the seriousness with which we take capital deployment, we do have a strong balance sheet so we have capital we can deploy. But as Jan said, you know, consumptionally if something really fit into our technology roadmap and accelerated our progress, we'd use our capital. But we're not going to use our capital to have something that, for lack of a better term, sits next to everything else that we have. So it has to be able to be integrated rapidly and seamlessly into what we already are pursuing in terms of our product strategy. That's a little bit of a departure from, call it six, seven years ago when it was really more about leveraging our distribution and adding capabilities and products without as much, necessarily, regard to how they fit tightly into the technology road map.","And that's really not so much a change in strategy. It's a change in the market and the way people want to buy and the way products behave which makes it very, very important to have tight alignment and seamlessness in your products. And then the last just factual comment I'll make to Jan's point, is we -- because we have capital, if something accelerated our progress, we would do it no different than we're doing some of these internal organic things that we're investing in to accelerate our progress. So if there's an external opportunity to use our capital, we would.","But the fact is that over the last couple years, when you look at the balance of capital deployment, Jan and I have this discussion all the time, we haven't consciously avoided doing acquisitions. It's just been harder to find ones that make sense and fit in what we're doing in terms of our strategy. But net-net when you get down to it, we're spending, call it $300 million to $400 million less on acquisitions and we're spending more on things like internally developed products, capital expenditures and the investments that we 're talking about for FY '17. So it wasn't necessarily planned that way, but it just so happens that, you know, we 're not necessarily deploying any more capital, but we 're just deploying it in a slightly different way. But we do retain the right to deploy capital towards acquisitions as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon","Just wondering if you could just add a little more color in terms of the service realignment, in terms of, you know, how clients may end up being serviced? Is it -- you know, is there going to be a transition to like a dedicated service rap for the mid-market? What did you see out of the pilot studies and what's the -- what's the reaction internally, you know, with some of the service providers in terms of potentially geographically relocating?","Carlos Rodriguez","It's a great question. We'll give you a little bit of color and then maybe Jan can add in terms of what he's hearing out in the field. It's interesting the term dedicated reps, because we do have parts of our business, obviously in the up-market and national accounts, we have very specific people that service specific clients. And then when you get in the small business market, we tend to have a model where, you know, the execution and the delivery is very important, but the person that you reach is not as important.","We believe that's the right model. We believe our retention rates and our growth in the small business market prove that our model works as long as you execute well and we would also argue that in today's world, having a dedicated rep who works eight hours a day might not be the best service model for a small company or any other company. So we prefer to focus on how -- what's the best way to deliver the best service to the client in the way they want it delivered. And it varies from small business up to the up-market in terms of whether you need a dedicated person or not, but I would encourage you to kind of visualize this service realignment as being more around teams rather than dedicated people, so having alignment around teams.","So as an example, given the attach rates that we've discussed over multiple quarters that we're experiencing now in the mid-market and in the up-market, around additional HCM modules -- in other words, clients are rarely buying just payroll by itself or just benefits administration by itself. So this service model really is intended to be able to provide a group of people or a team of people who work together, who are collocated and can deliver service across the entire HCM spectrum. That obviously requires some cross-training, but also some ability for people who have special skills to be available and close to people who need to support our clients on a multiple number of issues.","So we have a reasonable amount of experience in experimenting with what we call intact teams or with collocated teams and we feel good about the results when it comes to retention, when to comes to client satisfaction and by the way in our business, when you have those two things, margin follows. So this is primarily led by quality and experience for the client and also by the way, opportunity for our associates. So what we have found also is in some of our subscale locations, there's very, very limited mobility and opportunity for associates to progress from a career standpoint. ","And we now have a number of opportunities across our business for people to learn new things and to move into different areas, whether it's time and attendance and pay roll, benefits administration, talent management, we really run the whole gamut on HCM and we needs across the entire business and when we have people scattered across the entire country in small subscale locations, it just doesn't I think make sense from a talent management standpoint for ourselves, internally either. And so on all those fronts, we think that this service alignment strategy makes sense.","Jan Siegmund","Carlos mentioned most of the factors. I would add, too, we have seen a rise in our associate engagement scores as a consequence for those who work in those intact teams. And it reflects probably better of how in a modern team environment our associates want to work. So that's really exciting for our associates as well.","And one additional component that a strategic move on locations allows you to plan for is also a coordinated effort between our market segments, small, medium and large. So I think we mentioned it in the call. So now we have collocation between those market segments and there can be natural growth and exchange of best practices between the different platforms. And for some of the platforms, the back end is fairly similar. If you think about sender-self excellence for our tax filing operation and so forth, so it allows us also to create buckets of scale that are very hard to create in smaller locations.","So it really, I believe, will transform of how associates be perceiving A, the value of the job they're in and the job opportunities then that can reach in the future and allows us to deliver additional service capabilities to our clients which is the strategic benefit that we're reaping out of it.","Mark Marcon","Certainly seems to make a lot of sense. I applaud you for taking this long-term step. Can you talk also with regards to the expectation for new bookings growth, where you would expect to see the strongest growth in terms of which areas?","Jan Siegmund","Yes, I'll take this right on -- if you look at FY '16, we had actually fairly balanced growth across the business. We had great performance really along all segments and continued strength in multinational, great performance really across all segments. Maybe the only spot that has been a little bit harder was Europe as you might imagine and our best of breed solutions, but that was really more than balanced by good demand from multinational solutions.","So when we look at the plan, other than specific grow-over challenges that we had because ACA cells were concentrated in the mid-market and in the up-market. If you take that out it's really each of the business units continues with very good performance and just as a reminder, it was $1.75 billion of recurring revenue that sales force generated for ADP and even if the growth is a few percentage points slower, this kind of still a very significant number.","Operator","Our last question for today will be coming from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","I wanted to go back to an earlier question, just around the concept of revenue acceleration. So you've had two years of above-trend bookings, you've got pace for control continuing to click along at a similar pace, you had a drag this year from selling a business that will no longer be a drag in 2017 and you know, retention was a drag, I guess you're not saying specifically, but maybe still a drag, but it sounds like a lesser one potentially in 2017. So why don't -- you've always said the current-year bookings don't do a lot to revenue. Why wouldn't we see some acceleration? Is it as simple as PEO? You're calling for that to be slower? It just feels like there should be a bit better revenue growth from, you know, thinking through all these moving parts. Thank you.","Jan Siegmund","Yes, the math is how the math is going to work out between the starts that we have sold and the retention and there's really no change in how we have built our business models over time. We did have a little bit of unusual revenue skewing that created the more revenue acceleration, I guess, in this year than for next year which contributes a little bit to the thing. But if you -- if you take that into account, there's really nothing that unusual in next year's revenue growth.","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes and I think that all the things you mentioned it's important to acknowledge what you said. We do, again even though we don't give specific guidance, we do expect less of a drag for example from retentions, because we expect things to get better. We have some metrics and some things underlying, I think, data that give us hope at least, right? Because we don't know for sure that will improve your math, the comments you made about new the business bookings, all those things are correct.","I think I would just encourage you to maybe spend some time offline with us in terms of kind of the math and how the revenue works. One of the interesting things about this business, this is an incredibly stable and predictable business model. It's also very, very hard to move the numbers dramatically one way or the other over the course of one year. So over the course of four or five years, we've had double digit new business bookings and this year we had a blip with retention. But retention's also been fairly stable. That's allowed us to accelerate our revenue growth about 1\/2 to 1 percentage point from, call it five years ago, in employer services.","The PEO, as you said, also happens to be a factor because it's growing faster and it's becoming a larger portion of the overall results. So if it slows slightly that has an impact, too. So we'll spend the time to make sure we do the math, but what I can tell you is that you're right, that this year, if you exclude the impact of the divestiture or if you don't factor the divestiture in, we were close to 9% revenue growth. We're really proud of that. And next year we're slightly below that because there's one day less, because this year was a leap year or whatever the issues are and we have a drag still from, even though retention's getting better, it's still not as good as it used to be.","We're still going to be pretty damn happy and pretty damn proud, because we're going to be in I think still, in the high end of our guidance from a revenue standpoint. And in this business, when you get into that range, given who we're, in terms of because we understand, we have very keen insight into who we're, like as a company in terms of where we want to be, in terms of our growth rates and our margin improvement and the balance of those things, I think we're, I think satisfied with that outcome. It obviously makes it easier as you pick up additional revenue growth because of the nice leverageability of our operating model.","But, you know, that's part of why we're also doing some of the things we 're doing around service alignment, because we know that we're really not, I think satisfied with just the results that we have today. On the other hand, we're not going to sit here and tell you that we're trying to aim for 10%, 12%, 15% revenue growth because that's really not who we're. So 7% to 9% is our long-term guidance for revenue growth, with some margin improvement, with a healthy dividend, with share buybacks, that's our model, that's what we're executing against. And I'm proud of the Organization and the results they delivered this year. And I think if we deliver the results that we've put out there for next year, we're going to be just as proud of that as well.","Gary Bisbee","Okay, great. And then if I could add just one quick follow up. On the ACA product, how much of the revenue would be charged for sending out like the 1095 forms and what not versus -- I assume there's some ongoing revenue related to the analytics and compliance tool--","Jan Siegmund","Yes, this allows me to make another pitch for our fantastic and very differentiated ACA product. It is actually far more than just sending out 1095 and 1094 forms. It is really a compliance service that we offer, that ongoing offers -- ongoing monitoring and assessment services for eligibility and affordability.","And also which is really very differentiated in this market, offers what we call notice management services at the back-end to react to agency and exchange notices and keep the company in compliance with those, that's where a bulk of the fines can actually incur. So we build our clients on a per-employee per month basis. So the revenue stream is actually not concentrated on a specific form delivery, it's an annualized recurring revenue. And so you should think about the revenues exactly the same way you think about the rest of ADP.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.","Carlos Rodriguez","Thanks. This is our 67th year and where we've combined world class operations with innovative products and services that meet the dynamic needs of our clients. This was never more evident than in 2016 and I'm proud of the success of our business in getting the solutions to market to meet those needs of the clients and if I can get on my soap box for a second, I mentioned previously that ADP -- this is ADP's 41st consecutive year of paying and increasing our dividend. And as a dividend aristocrat, ADP is one of just over 50 companies in the S&P 500 who have paid an increase of dividend for more than 25 years.","Now with some of the things we're talking about for FY '17, ADP leaders and associates are making the investments to lay the foundation for ADP to join the dividend royals in nine years. And that's a list of just 17 companies who have paid and increased their dividend for more than 50 years. Any student of business knows that only the most durable and enduring icons of business make either list. This success is entirely attributable to the hard work and dedication of our associates, who commit themselves every day to ensuring our clients' success.","So to them and to all before them, I say thank you. And I thank you all for joining the call today and for your interest in ADP.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation.

My name is Brian and I will be your conference operator. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the conference over to Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Christian Greyenbuhl","Thank you, Bryan, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 earnings call and webcast. [Technical Difficult] Earlier this morning we released our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. These earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the quarterly investor presentation that accompanies today's call, as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings by report of the segment.","During our call today we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that excludes the impact of certain items in the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2019, as well as the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2018. A description of these items and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. ","Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectation. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos Rodriguez","Thank you, Christian, and thank everyone for joining our call. Before we get started with the earnings discussion I'd first like to welcome Kathleen to the call, into her new role as ADP's Chief Financial Officer.","Kathleen comes to us with a strong operating background and we look forward to her contributions in partnership as we execute on our transformation initiatives. I also know that she is looking forward to the opportunity to meet with you over the coming months. ","Let's now move to a brief review of the quarter. Jan will then take us through the quarter results in more detail, after which Kathleen will take us through an update to our fiscal 2019 outlook. ","This morning we reported our third quarter fiscal 2019 results with revenue of $3.8 billion up 4% on a reported basis, 5% organic constant currency. This revenue growth was in line with our expectations and continued to be aided in part by the strength of our Employer Services down market offerings and multinational solutions. ","Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $1.77 per share and benefited from continued strength in our margin performance, lower adjusted effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. We are pleased with the overall results this quarter and we believe our performance continues to highlight the underlying strength of our business model. ","I\u2019d now like to turn to our sales and marketing initiatives, starting with our solid 10% growth in Employer Services, new business bookings for the quarter and then discuss some of our recent sales and marketing investments. ","First, we are pleased with our Employer Services, new business bookings performance this quarter which benefited from broad-based growth. With three quarters behind us, we feel good about our overall progress this year. ","At the same time we continuously work to identify new opportunities and investments and learn to leverage our world class sales force to help drive sustainable growth and build on our position as a leader in the growing global HCM market. With this in mind, at the end of March we completed an agreement with a mid-sized regional payroll services provider to convert their clients to workforce Now or RUN, depending on business needs and complexity. ","From time to time we leverage our scale to engage in transactions like these where we acquire a client list from a third party for the right to sell and convert those clients onto our platforms. While historically not significant enough to call out, this transaction was larger than usual. ","The timing of this agreement means that while it did not impact our third quarter new business bookings performance, we do anticipate incremental benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 from this investment together with some added expense pressure. ","We are confident that our sales force and implementation teams are well equipped to capture this new opportunity, however the timing of the impact from our conversion efforts will depend on the needs of these clients. ","With that said, as we work to execute on our plans to capture this new opportunity, we are raising our ES New Business Bookings guidance to 8% and 9% growth for fiscal 2019 from our prior guidance of 6% to 8% growth. This deal was not contemplated in our second quarter guidance and we believe that even without this new opportunity we would have achieved at least the low end of our previous guidance range. ","Moving on to our recent brand initiatives. At ADP we have always taken great pride in delivering solutions that help simplify complexities for our clients and their workers. Part of our transformation effort has been to execute towards that goal and we\u2019ve continued to make great progress on that front. ","With this progress in mind, earlier this year we felt it was an opportune time to launch a new brand platform to better reflect the changes we've been making. This initiative represents an important step in our journey to enhance the employee experience with innovative HCM Solutions and insights designed with the worker as the central focus. ","We carried those thoughts through our brand campaign which asks, what are you working for? In partnership with our clients we asked them and others to share stories about the world of work through the eyes of their people, bringing to light a range of motivations and passions. ","The key insight from these discussions is that work is about more than what you do. It's about achieving something greater for oneself and others. Our goal in this campaign is to elevate the discussion around the evolution of work and promote a dialogue about what motivates people in the workforce and how we at ADP, in addressing these evolving needs, are always designing for people. ","This new brand platform and tagline is an expression of what ADP stands for and reinforces our relentless determination to rethink a better, more personalized world that works so everyone can achieve their full potential. ","Continuing on the theme of work, a few weeks ago I had the opportunity to attend our 26 ANNUAL ADP Meeting of the Minds Client Conference. This event affords us the opportunity to engage in a deeper and broader matter with our larger enterprise clients on their challenges, while also sharing with them our perspectives on the latest trends in HCM, including what we're doing to help employers and their workers tackle these issues. ","As the world of work changes, the challenges that employers face are becoming increasingly broad and complex. What was clear from the conference is that employers seek a strategic HCM partner, not just a software vendor. We are in need of expertise, someone they can trust and someone who will also help them rise to the new challenges in the face of an increasingly complex and fast paced world of work, one where the war for talent remains intense.","With a record number of attendees at the conference this year, the feedback was very positive throughout the event. Clients and prospects were able to spend time learning about new products and functionality, not only from our experts but also from nearly 40 of our strategic partners, including a record number from our ADP marketplace. ","As a leading global technology company providing HCM solutions, we are uniquely positioned to help employers and their workers, whether it's through solutions that can help them with recruitment to retirement or through our unmatched big data capabilities, I was proud of the reception we received for our continued efforts to deliver innovative solutions with excellent service.","The focus that we are putting on our products and services are only part of our strategy to deliver stronger solutions to our clients. We also believe in a more integrated product strategy and a more open ecosystem. We see shifts not only in how our clients want to connect with us, but also in how workers connect with each other, notably through collaboration platforms. These platforms are reshaping how people communicate and access information within a company. ","With products like ADPs Virtual Assistant Bot, employees and HR Leaders now have the convenience of a tool that can help them remove friction in the employee experience by allowing them within the collaboration platforms to view their pay summary and deductions, make time off requests and more, all while also reducing the time spent by HR and payroll practitioners on low value added tax. This allows them to be more strategic and focused on driving business success. ","Innovations like these that enhance the employer and employee experience are continuing to help drive improvements in our client satisfaction and net promoter scores, an important element in our ability to reaffirm our expectations of 25 to 50 basis points of improvement in ES Revenue Retention for fiscal 2019. ","Receiving positive recognition for our efforts from both our clients and third parties bolsters our confidence in our investments. Earlier this quarter we were especially please when we were recognized for our vision and strategy by Everest Group who named ADP a leader in the Peak Matrix Multi Country Payroll Outsourcing and Multi Country Payroll Platform Report, and once again named ADP a leader and star performer in its Annual Peak Matrix for Multi Process Human Resources Outsourcing Providers. ","We are also proud to note that we were the only provider selected as both the leader and star performer among the vendors evaluated, underscoring the strength of our position, as well as the improvements we continue to make. ","In April we also announced that Nelson Hall once again recognized ADP as the overall leader for next generation payroll services, highlighting ADPs ability to meet future client requirements and deliver immediate benefits to payroll services clients. It's rewarding when influencers and clients alike recognize us for our progress. ","Now for one final thought before I hand the call over to Jan, at ADP we are proud of our efforts to foster a culture of learning and development in order to better attract, train and retain top talent. This is why I was especially pleased with this quarter to see that we were once again included among LinkedIn\u2019s top companies for 2019. This award highlights the Top 50 companies that were most in demand by job seekers and I'm pleased to say that we moved up 21 places the number 20 on this list. ","Overall, our investments in the business are showing positive momentum and we are pleased with the progress we are making against our objective of driving sustainable, long term growth. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for his commentary on our third quarter results. ","Jan Siegmund ","Thank you, Carlos, and good morning everyone. Our consolidated revenue this quarter was $3.8 billion, up 4% on a reported basis, 5% organic constant currency, and as Carlos said, this was in line with our expectations. With that said, we have been seeing more pressure for the impact of FX which drove approximately 1 percentage points of pressure this quarter. ","We continue to see strong momentum throughout our down market HCM offerings. In addition, excluding the impact of FX, we are pleased to see continued underlying strength across our international offerings, in particular from our multinational solutions. ","I would also like to remind you of the PEO, SUI revenue timing impact last quarter, which also impacted our third quarter consolidated revenue growth by approximately 1% and PEO revenue growth by approximately 2%. There was no impact on our full year revenue estimates from this event. ","Our earnings before income taxes increased 12% and adjusted EBIT increased 10%. Adjusted EBIT margin was up about 140 basis points compared to last year's third quarter and included 20 basis points of pressure from acquisitions. ","This margin improvement was slightly ahead of our expectations and benefited from a few key drivers. In addition to benefiting from our early, voluntary early retirement program, we also continue to see incremental efficiencies within our IT infrastructure helping to drive improvements in our overall cost base. ","Also we continue to execute on a number of tactical and incremental transformation initiatives, which while none are individually significant enough to call out collectively are helping to drive net productivity improvements across the business. ","The benefits from these initiatives together with the impact from our underlying operating approach were partially offset by incremental investments in the third quarter related to the launch of our new brand platform and growth and selling expenses. ","Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5% and benefited from the impact of corporate tax reform, certain tax credit adjustments and the release of reserves for certain tax positions \u2013 for uncertain tax positions, and a small amount of unplanned stock compensation tax benefit. This rate compares to our 24% adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter of last year.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $1.77 and in addition to benefiting from our margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate was also aided by fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. ","Now for our segment results. For Employment Services, revenues grew 3% for the quarter, 4% organic constant currency and we are in line with expectations. As a reminder, we had anticipated a deceleration from the first half as we have now lapped the acquisitions of global Cash Card and Work Market, and our revenue continues to be impacted by pressure from FX. ","Interest income on client funds grew 24% and benefited from a 30 basis points improvement in the average yield earned on our client fund investments and growth and average client funds balances of 4% compared to a year ago. This growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control, offset by lower SUI kind of collections. ","Also as we mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect lower SUI rates and the impact of FX to put added pressure on to our balance growth for the reminder of the year. Our same store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 3.1% for the quarter. ","Moving on to Employer Services margin, we saw an increase of about 230 basis points in the quarter, which includes approximately 30 basis points of pressure from the impact of acquisitions. This continued strength as a result of the same factors I mentioned earlier regarding our consolidated results which are continuing to help to improve our underlying efficiencies. ","Our PEO services grew 6% in the quarter and as I mentioned earlier, this revenue growth experienced approximately 2 percentage points of pressure in the third quarter due to the PEO SUI revenue timing impact we experienced last quarter. ","This pressure was also the primary driver for lower PEO revenues excluding zero-margin benefit pass-throughs which grew 2% for the quarter. This timing issue does not impact the full year revenue guidance that Kathleen will shortly discuss. Average worksite employees increased 8% to 554,000 for the quarter. ","Overall we continue to see some positive signs of normalization in the retention compared to the pressure we had seen last year among our larger PEO clients, and we\u2019re also starting to see some positive signs from the changes to our sales incentives that we made last year. We therefore maintained cautiously optimistic as we head into our fourth quarter regarding the continued gradual reacceleration of the growth in the average worksite employee, in particular given the volatility we may experience during our fiscal year Fourth Quarter Annual Health Care Renewals. ","The PEO segments margins decreased 10 basis points for the quarter due to grow over pressure from incremental selling expenses and adjustments to our loss reserve estimates related to ADP Indemnity, offset by operating leverage within the business and benefits from our voluntary early retirement program. This margin performance was ahead of our own expectations as we continue to see sequential reductions in our ADP indemnity loss reserve estimates, as well as lower than expected growth in the zero-margin pass-through revenues. ","We continue to benefit from the underlying strength of our business model. We remain committed to reinvesting into the business and to leveraging the strength of our organization to drive change. Our results this quarter reflect our success in driving these initiatives and we are pleased with our progress this year. ","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Kathleen for our fiscal year 2019 outlook. ","Kathleen Winters ","Thank you, Jan, and thank you Carlos for the warm welcome to ADP, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm looking forward to meeting many of you over the coming weeks and months. ","I'll start now with the outlook for Employer Services. We now expect revenue growth for fiscal 2019 to be at the lower end of our previous guidance range of 5% to 6% growth. We narrowed our guidance this quarter since we expect slightly elevated pressure from the impact of FX and as I will discuss shortly, we have also narrowed down our guidance for interest income from client funds as a result of changes to the forward yield curve this quarter. ","We continue to anticipate growth of 2.5% in our pays per control metric. We are raising our fiscal 2019 ES New Business Bookings Guidance to 8% to 9%. Regarding the agreement that we completed in March, I'd like to highlight that this was not an acquisition of a business. We will however be recognizing an intangible asset for the acquired client list.","We are not disclosing the purchase price for this asset, but you will see some activity related to this investment in additions to intangibles on our cash flow statement. And starting in the fourth quarter we will begin to amortize this intangible asset in accordance with our policies for similar transactions. ","While we anticipate incremental expense from our brand efforts and the increase in our sales guidance, as well as incremental amortization related to intangible assets, we are raising our ES margin outlook and now anticipate full year ES margins to expand about 225 basis points from our prior forecast of 175 to 200 basis points. Our outlook also continues to contemplate 50 basis points of acquisition drag for the year. ","Moving on to the PEO, we continue to expect 9% to 10% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2019 and 8% to 9% growth in average worksite employees. We also continue to anticipate 8% to 9% growth in PEO revenues excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs. With the better than expected performance in our PEO margin this quarter, we now expect margins to be up 25 to 50 basis points as compared to our prior forecast of at least flat. ","With the continued reduction in our loss reserves related to ADP Indemnity we've adjusted our estimate to 25 basis points of grow over pressure on a full year basis from our prior estimate of 50 basis points. ","I\u2019ll now go to the consolidated outlook. With the adjustments to our ES revenue outlook we now anticipate total revenue growth at the lower end of our 6% to 7% range for fiscal 2019. We continue to expect the growth in average client funds balances to be about 4%. We are adjusting slightly our expected growth in client funds interest revenue to about $90 million from our prior estimate of $90 million to $100 million, and for the total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy to grow about $70 million from a prior estimate of $70 million to $80 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our investor relations website. ","We now anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to expand at least 150 basis points compared to our prior forecast of 125 to 150 basis points. This outlook continues to include approximately 30 basis points of pressure from acquisitions. ","With the benefit for this quarter to our effective tax rate, we are lowering our adjusted effective tax rate expectation to 23.8% for fiscal 2019 compared to our prior estimate of 24.4%. And with these adjustments to our outlook, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 19% to 20% from our prior forecast of 17% to 19%. We continue to be pleased with our overall execution. ","And with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of Mark Marcon of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","","Mark Marcon","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Well Carlos, Jan and Kathleen nice to meet you. Wondering if you can talk a little bit about the new type of deal in terms of taking over for you know existing payroll providers. Just how does that compare to when you win a new client just from an economic perspective and how big is that opportunity as we look out over the next few years. ","Carlos Rodriguez","Well in terms of helping you size it, I think that based on the comments you made about our new business bookings. I think you can back into it. It\u2019s about a 2 to 3 percentage point impact for the year on new business bookings gross. So that gives you a sense of from a bookings standpoint what the size of the opportunity is. ","And just in terms of elaborating a little bit more on it, we actually do these types of deals on a much smaller basis on a fairly regular basis and have been doing them for 20 to 30 years where small providers that are either retiring or selling out, want to sell their book of business, we are not really interested in buying additional platforms or frankly taking infrastructure or offices and so forth. ","So we structure it really as an agreement where we buy the right to convert the clients and we get some help, and some assistance from the seller. But in essence it looks a lot like a typical new business and the economics would look a lot like a typical new business with the exception of course that we have to pay some acquisition costs if you will to the seller. ","But the way we organize the effort is very similar to a typical sales effort in a sense that we send out either through our inside sales force or our field sales force, people to get the client to sign a contract with ADP, because we are not buying contracts and we're not buying the business. So they become an ADP client on our pricing terms and we in essence implement them with our resources onto our platform. So it looks a lot like a business as usual. ","The reason we had to call it out is obviously the size. These typically are frankly really small, a couple of thousand, even in the hundreds of clients CPA Firm or an owner of a small payroll company may be retiring. This is a much larger transaction that has a material, somewhat material impact on our results and our guidance and we thought it was important to point out. ","We are being a little bit coy about you know the details because obviously for competitive reasons we are literally right in the middle of converting all these clients. So our sales force has already been out for several weeks \u201cselling and converting\u201d these clients and we've begun the implementation process. But most of our competitors are aware of this transaction that was going on. So they are going after those clients as well. So we just rather not talk about it more than we have to, just to make sure we give you the proper context and the proper guidance. ","Mark Marcon","I just meant from a strategic perspective, longer term do you see more of these types of opportunities coming up as you and some of the other large national players have invested more behind technology and smaller regional players just can't keep up. ","Carlos Rodriguez","Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t call this a small regional player. So this is probably as you get more information about it, I think it will become obvious. This is kind of the last of its kind as far as I'm aware and just for historical purposes, I was personally involved. In 2007 was the first time that I met with this organization about trying to create an opportunity for us to acquire this business or in this case the right to convert these clients and there were people before me who had already been having those discussions. So this has been going on for quite a long time. So I would say this is in the category of relatively unique and in terms of size and also type of payroll provider that it is. ","Mark Marcon","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. ","Jason Kupferberg","Hey thanks, good morning guys. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on that point with this new agreement. Is there anything baked into the revenue guidance for the year and can you give us a rough sense of how many clients this involves and then just was there any promotional pricing or any extra promotional pricing in Q3 to help fuel the bookings rebound that we saw, the 10%?","Carlos Rodriguez","There was nothing incremental in Q3 in terms of just answering that question first, which I think is somewhat unrelated to the other questions. So the answer to that is, not that I'm aware of. There was no \u2013 nothing artificial done or nothing \u2013 remember part of \u2013 I tried to explain in the second quarter and hopefully this is some indication that we were giving you guys the right story is that calendar wise we had some, a couple of days of selling that moved into the third quarter from the second quarter. ","So if you remember we had a relatively weak second quarter new business booking. So I think some of it is calendar. Frankly it\u2019s even better than we expected based on just the calendar explanations. So I think it was just an overall good rebound and good performance. ","In terms of the size of the transaction impact on revenues, just because of the mechanics that our business operates on, as I mentioned that our sales forces is literally right now getting sales orders, converting the clients and we have implementation, people starting the implementation process. We have implemented some clients, but it was \u2013 it's an insignificant impact on revenues for the fourth quarter, but a significant impact in booking in new business bookings, which is why we've adjusted the guidance the way we have. ","The other factor that I would mention is, as you do your work on margins and so forth and you might notice some pressure in the fourth quarter, there's also again typical of the way our business works. We have a significant pressure from an expense standpoint in the fourth quarter as a result of incremental selling expense and in this case we also have the amortization of the intangible without the offsetting \u201crevenues\u201d because they haven't started yet. ","Some of them have stated, most of the impact on revenues is in the first quarter and beyond of next fiscal year. So it's a meaningful headwind from a cost standpoint and the other thing to keep in mind is if you recall, last year's fourth quarter we had very, very strong margin improvement. So the comparison is difficult, plus we have this fairly significant expense pressure from this transaction which obviously hurts us in the fourth quarter and it\u2019s slightly dilutive. I think we figured it\u2019s a couple of pennies I think we talked about?","Kathleen Winters","Yeah, a couple of pennies in the fourth quarter. ","Carlos Rodriguez","But it will help us I think on a go forward basis, because obviously by the first quarter almost all of that selling expense will have \u2013 and implementation expenses will be behind us. The amortization expense will still be with us, but most of the acquisition and implementation expenses will already be behind us, and then we\u2019ll have the revenue and incremental margin from that business. ","So again, had we just made sure that we don\u2019t over complicate this, if we had a \u2013 which we\u2019ve had in the past. If we had a blow-out fourth quarter sales results, it would be about the same discussion. We would have had a lot of incremental selling expense and implementation expense, and it would be good news for future growth and for revenues that it will be pressure in the short term on the earnings. ","Jason Kupferberg","Right, right. So that kind of leads to my follow-up question just on margin, because obviously the execution continues to be very strong there. So you are absorbing some of these incremental costs, yet you did raise the guidance again for margins for this year. ","So I wanted to talk a little bit about just your plans to backfill some of the roles that are being vacated or have been vacated by the early retirement program. How are you thinking about that now versus what you initially envisioned in terms of back filled percentage? ","Carlos Rodriguez","It's a great question. I think the way that I look at it, just from a 40,000 foot level is really head count growth year-over-year, because there's so many other pieces of noise like this incremental expense pressure we have in the fourth quarter that\u2019s the best way to really kind of \u2013 given that most of our expense is really people related is really FTE growth year-over-year and I think on that basis as we expected and as we predicted and as we encouraged our organization to do, we closed some of the gap that we had in the first quarter by the third quarter. ","So we're still ahead and we wouldn't be increasing our guidance if we hadn't been still ahead. So we\u2019re still a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be in terms of not back filling as much as we expected, but we closed some of that gap. ","Now that was the appropriate thing to do, because we want to make sure that our client retention, our client satisfaction, our NPS score stay. I think it\u2019s at the record levels that they are in some of our business units, so that was an important objective for us, which was to extract incremental margin and efficiency out of the organization and out of the business, but at the same time making sure that we stayed focused on client satisfaction and client service. ","I think we're doing that, I think we've landed the plane in a fairly good place. I think the organization responded well. I think to the absorption of the early retirement reductions, as well as the reworking of some of the things that we do and some of the processes that we have in order to make sure that we can continue to deliver the high levels of service that we have with fewer people. ","Jan Siegmund","And maybe I'll add within the nuts and bolts, as a reminder we anticipated the impact of the older early retirement program to happen in your life. The impact of approximately $150 million and we are anticipating that to be true going forward. So the overall opportunity has not increased, but we captured in this fiscal year a higher percentage of that total number which we now expect slightly to be below that and like 140 \u2013 I would say roughly $140 million to $150 million. So we think Jason that the overall assumptions regarding the back hiring and the backfills remains intact. ","Carlos Rodriguez","And I think in terms of new contact this was a fairly large undertaking that we hadn't been through before. So I think in the context of you know the guess work that went into the backfills and the pacing of those backfills and so what, I think the organization did a great job. ","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. Jan, best of luck to you and Kathleen, I look forward to meeting soon. ","Jan Siegmund","Thank you.","Kathleen Winters ","Likewise. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jim Schneider","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations to both, Jan and Kathleen. Maybe just to start out, maybe Carlos, can you provide a little bit of color on your view on where the PEO market demand stands right now. Anything that you are seeing that makes you kind of more or less encouraged about the demand outlook and your ability to kind of sustain the same pace of growth over the next few quarters as you have seen, and maybe kind of give us any color around the comment that I believe Jan made on the kind of cautious optimism around the healthcare renewal season. ","A - Carlos Rodriguez","No, I think from a long term strategic standpoint, don't really see any changes from what we've seen for the last, honestly a couple of decades, which is kind of the underlying environment of increasing complexity for small employers and even in this case mid-sized employers I think continues to be a reality. I think the war for talent I think just adds to that dimension of you know small and mid-sized companies now on top of having to deal with regulation and complexity and so forth and it happens in every administration. ","We\u2019ve seen now this administration obviously has a different view of regulations, but there's still a lot of activity. Like there\u2019s a recent announcement around changes in the overtime regulation that had been previously announced under the Obama administration. So that the world continues to become difficult and complex for small and mid-sized employers and then on top of that very low unemployment rates create a real competitive issue for people to find talent. ","So all of those things I think are, I think fuel for kind of the long term strategic growth of the PEO models. So there's really nothing that I see that\u2019s changed that potential net trajectory. There\u2019s still relatively low penetration whether it\u2019s at the ADP client base level or even out in the marketplace. The number of clients on PEO's relative to the available market is still relatively small. ","You know there's obviously noise along the way as Jan mentioned. You know we have a healthcare renewal in the fourth quarter, but we have that every year. We have year-end which tends to create a lot of activity as well and by that I mean January 1, which that's now the times this year, but that occurs every year. You have other kind of events that happen along the way, like ACA was an event that I think had an impact, first positive and then slightly negative afterwards in its week. So there are things that you know will create ups and downs, but overall we're still very bullish on that business in terms of the long term outlook. ","Jan Siegmund","And on the short term Jim, you were following up on the specifics of the healthcare renewal I think. We don't see anything specifically positive or negative on this healthcare renewal, so it's kind of \u2013 it always changes by carrier as we receive the proposals, but it feels like largely in line with the historic trends that we have seen. ","Jim Schneider","That\u2019s helpful, thank you. And then as we think about the kind of go forward impact of the book of business you are taking on, can you maybe help us a little bit as we model forward or model in terms of for example over the next quarter or by the end of June if he signs the rough number of clients you expect to get out of and be able to convert. What percentage of those clients you think you'll be able to sign up of the total by the end of June? ","Jan Siegmund","I think the easiest way Jim to think about it is we increased our guidance and you've got basically the incremental number from Carlos today. If you translate those new business bookings, they will be caused by largely smaller clients. We anticipate an almost full run rate of revenues for next year. So you just translate the incremental new business bookings into yes, they are all yes clients and then they will become revenues. ","Jim Schneider","Helpful, thank you. ","Jan Siegmund","Like 1% of new business bookings growth Christian reminds me, there\u2019s approximately $15 million of revenue. So that gives you a good \u2013 I think that gives you a fair sizing of the opportunity. ","Jim Schneider","Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Your line is now open. ","Ramsey El-Assal ","Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the pricing environment. I think you mentioned last quarter it firmed up a bit and I just was wondering if you could update us on any pricing trends that you are seeing more recently, maybe into the year and selling season? ","Carlos Rodriguez","In my advantage \u2013 yeah, you're right. By pricing I mean we said that our promotions were down year-over-year and I think that was a sign of maybe things firming up. I would say that the information this quarter is not consistent with that, so I think if you look at the full year now after three quarters, they are probably like around the same place we were in the previous year, so again that's why sometimes it\u2019s better to not say much, because it will look like maybe there was some kind of trend there, but I would say there's really no, there's no trend. ","I think that we don't see any major, unless Jan has or Christian has any other observations, but I think \u2013 because we get so much information and so much data to prepared for these calls the sometimes we get too much into the weeds. And so there was some signs of use of less promotions in the first two quarters of the year and you know I think now when you look at it over the course of nine months \u2013 by the way our heavy selling season is the third quarter in one of our business where we sign up a lot of the clients as of the beginning of the year. So I\u2019d say there is really probably nothing meaningful to report, is that a fair\u2026?","Jan Siegmund","I think that's fair. ","Ramsey El-Assal ","Okay, great. [Cross Talk] ","Carlos Rodriguez","For whatever that was. ","Ramsey El-Assal ","Great, terrific. On just a broader macro question, are you seeing any changes, any you know updates on the broader macro environment, and maybe sort of a slice there kind of U.S. versus non-U.S. business, maybe particularly Europe. Is there any interesting call outs there to report or is it just sort of you still see a pretty smooth macro environment sort of unfolding. ","Jan Siegmund","Yes, I felt \u2013 I think it was a couple of quarters ago where I got a question, I gave a very short answer about nothing or anything going wrong in the economy and then I looked like I was going to have egg on my face in December and January, but maybe we\u2019re now somewhat vindicated in terms of \u2013 our data has been consistently showing I think the economy continuing to move along at a very good pace. And so I think today we \u2013 the national and former report came out. ","You see our pace booking pool number and you see government GDP reports a few days ago and I think all of those are consistent with I think an economy that's performing quite well and so I would say we would stick to the same; won\u2019t be quite as cavalier anymore about making economic predictions, but we don't see any real change in the current trends. ","Obviously Jan and I've been saying this for a couple of years and I think we\u2019ve so far been proven wrong that you know with unemployment as low as it is, the growth in the amount of employment at some point should slow, but it appears that there's enough people on the sidelines just based on this labor participation rate number that people are still being drawn into the workforce. ","You know the one thing that we will point out is we\u2019ve seen like the government and others some wage pressure which actually is good for us and we kind of like wage pressure. Not necessarily because of the pressure it puts on our cost internally, but you know our flow business benefits a little bit from higher wage inflation, obviously because it increases our balances. It\u2019s not a meaningful number given how much inflation we've had, but the trend has been up for multiple quarters now. ","But I think it's all \u2013 it seems like the economy is performing very well and we look at all the other indicators that everyone else looks at, like NFIB optimism leading indicators, all the other Michigan leading indicators, all those other things, I think all look very strong.","Jan Siegmund","And if I add two seconds on our European business, the last three months in Europe actually were also stronger relative to our pace for control metrics. I wouldn't over read it, but it was a very solid European quarter also. ","Ramsey El-Assal ","Great, thanks so much. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffetNathanson. Your line is now open.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good morning guys and welcome to Kathleen. I wanted to ask just a broader question about the competitive dynamics and ADPs performance in the mid and up market. You called out continued strength in RUN and International as drivers of growth. Those have been bright spots for ADP for a long time. Can you just give us an update? I think we're now well over a year past the completion of the workforce now, migrations. Are you back to positive client growth in the mid-market and then also what\u2019s just the update on like the new payroll engine and sort of the long term strategy to improve your competitive position in the upper end. Thanks. ","Carlos Rodriguez","So when we made the comment about the strength coming from small business and international, it was actually multinational is what we said in our prepared remarks. We\u2019re referring to revenue if you'll recall, which is accurate and actually makes sense, but on our bookings I think we also said that we had broad based new business bookings performance that led to the 10% growth and so by broad based it would include the mid-market and the up market. ","So we've gotten some help from the decision to you know deploy and sell more aggressively workforce now in the lower end of the national accounts market where the clients that are in kind of the less complex range if you well in smaller size, so call it 1,000 to 5,000 employees and less complex. So that's given a little bit of a boost to our up market sales. ","I think in the mid-market, when we look at our mid-market business kind of across categories, because we have our traditional payroll business, but we also have a fairly fast growing mid-market business within our PEO, because our PEO sells also mid-market clients. Some of those incentives that we talked about a couple of quarters ago have started to kind of have the desired impact and we've had a little bit of a rebound in the growth of our mid-market PEO business. ","We also have a mid-market outsourcing business that doesn't have co-employment [ph]. We\u2019ve had it for many years, but that's also a fast growing business as well as within the HRO segment when we talk about the strategic pillars, so it's kind of a sister business if you will to the PEO. So when you add all those together, I think we feel pretty good about our performance in the mid-market. I think our bookings were very good in the third quarter in the up market and I think when you add in global view and some of our other solutions in the up market like standalone tax, like we feel okay about it. ","As you know we've been very transparent. This is a place where we have work to do and we still think we have some work to do in the very \u2013 in the up market domestic business and our new platform that we affectionately referred to as Lifion I think is intended to help boost that. I think the combination of Lifion, Workforce Now and Vantage I think really are positioning us for a much stronger position in the future than what we've had over the last couple years. ","A - Jan Siegmund","If I add to this, we have seen continued improvement in our client satisfaction and retention in particular in the mid-market we\u2019re seeing the benefit of being on one platform, clients staying longer and now for many quarters in a row mid-market retention has really improved overall and so the mid-market, it is to me the midmarket compound of all these factors together is a much stronger position that was just a few quarters ago. ","Lisa Ellis","Traffic and then maybe my follow-up, you would call out, you are now lapping Cash Card and WorkMarket. Can you help a little bit with where those are starting to plug into your business and how big contributors they are today? Thank you. ","Carlos Rodriguez","I think that again unfortunately for Work Force, depending on how look at it for ADP, like Global Cash Card had a certainly a measurable impact, just because of the size and I think we\u2019ve disclosed the size of that acquisition and I think the revenue impact. But generally speaking some of these acquisitions tend to have long term strategic value. ","I think Celergo which you didn't mention, but is another one that I would bring up, we\u2019d expect that to really have a big impact on our multinational business in the future, but it's just you know because of the size of ADP as $14 billion, these acquisitions just are more strategic rather than kind of short term financial impact plays. ","On the Global Cash Card side, you know that's a place where we're very I think bullish in terms of the future of using the Pay Card I think as an avenue for growth, because we have a very large installed base that we think will fit \u2013 that solutions will fit well for and I think a \u2013 there\u2019s demand out on the market place for it. I think WorkMarket as we\u2019ve said, there\u2019s a huge market if not the size, close to the size of kind of our traditional ADP W-2 business for independent contractors. ","But you know it\u2019s a very, very small impact in the current fiscal year and probably for the next couple of fiscal years. And so how we are \u2013 what we are doing with these products as an example in the case of WorkMarket, we are building WorkMarket into Lifion. And so you will have a platform available to clients in the up market that will allow them to manage their entire workforce, their W-2 employees, as well as their independent contractors to have full visibility of their entire work force. So that\u2019s an important, I think move that we\u2019ve made to use the intellectual property and leverage that intellectual property. ","And then in terms of how we are building, the Cash Card into the future is I think we\u2019ve kind of signaled that we think we have an opportunity to create a larger relationship with the worker and so this concept of B2B2C I think is something that Global Cash Card and Wisely specifically gives us I think an entree into it. So again that\u2019s something that its three, five, ten years down the road, but we're very excited about it. ","Lisa Ellis","Traffic, excellent!. Thanks Carlos, thanks Jan. ","Carlos Rodriguez","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. ","Tien-tsin Huang","Thanks. Just one question on margins, because you are running ahead with the raised guidance. I\u2019m curious if this changes your thinking on margins or investments in relation to your longer term targets on margin expansion? ","Jan Siegmund","So, I think we traditionally provide guidance in August. So I think that would be the tradition that we will stick to. I think we are a middle of our operating plan season here and that will obviously give us a little bit more visibility into \u201920, into fiscal year \u201820 which will then appear in August. You know we gave three year guidance and I think our intention wasn't to update it quarterly. And I think when we get to I think the guidance for fiscal year \u201920 we\u2019ll see I think what that implies in terms of the guidance. ","Tien-tsin Huang","Got it, so we\u2019ll stay tuned for that. Jan, all the best to you and Kathleen, look forward to working with you. ","Jan Siegmund","Thank you. ","Kathleen Winters ","Thank you, likewise. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is now open. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thanks, good morning folks. Kathleen welcome. Jan, it was a pleasure working with you. All the best! ","I guess my the first question is, in both ES and PEO you seem to have, you seem to be trending more to the lower end of revenue expectations, you did well on margins. I want to ask how you are now thinking of sort of this revenue growth versus margin growth trade-offs. All these margin initiatives have been successful, but is it leading you too much in one direction versus the other and specifically what do you need to do to get up to your 7% to 9% mid-term growth rate?","Jan Siegmund","So I mentioned two things. First on Employer Services, I think we tried to be clear that we have a little bit of additional FX pressure which is obviously something that we don't control over or we don't factor it in at the beginning of the year. So I think that\u2019s \u2013 at least for now that\u2019s some of it, because you would see from our third quarter bookings that we feel pretty good about the long term future trajectory from a revenue growth standpoint. ","On the PEO I think we cautioned I think over many years and even when we did our Investor Day, that a very large part of our guidance around PEO revenues and overall ADP revenues is that the growth of pass-throughs, which has no impact on dollars of profit. It has an impact on margin, because the slower those pass-throughs grow they actually help us with our margin percent objectives, but the faster they grow the more they hurt that margin. And so we\u2019ve cautioned and encourage people to not get too caught up. ","If the source of weakness is pass-through revenues, that's really not a value creating revenue stream for us. It\u2019s part of the way we \u2013 the business model and its part of the way we bill our clients, but I would say that the tone you should be hearing from us on the PEO is actually quite positive. It has been positive since the first quarter and was positive even entering into the first quarter and the only thing that changed from you know six months before that was the pace of past-through growth which slowed in a meaningful enough way that it put pressure on the top line revenue growth for the PEO. ","But I would encourage you to stay focused on kind of the revenues, excluding pass-throughs and worksite employees and the other metrics which we feel are actually strong if not ahead of where we expect them to be. ","Jan Siegmund","And maybe I'll add a more tactical comment because this quarter really had an unusual revenue growth outcome. Just reminding everybody that much of that in the PEO of course we explained with the timing of SUI revenue collection and a couple of other one-time moving items also and we had also a timing effect of revenue relative to processing days in the second quarter that moved into the second quarter on the site.","So once you adjust for all of that, actually the organic revenue growth rate for the company is fairly close to where we want it to be and if you look on a year-over-year comparison I think we remain optimistic about an acceleration of our organic revenue growth, in particular in the ES segment that should really drive overall, long term success of the company. ","And as you know, we have built in scale in our business model. A growing company and shows competitiveness so that\u2019s a strong commitment to drive the revenue growth as we had indicated going forward. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. I did want to go back to the transaction that you announced with what I think is a large bank distribution channel. Without that I believe you said you\u2019d be at the lower end of the bookings range. Is there something going on there with regards to competition, prior year comps pricing, something we should be aware of that is temporary affecting that bookings performance and typically when you buy these sorts of portfolio, I\u2019d imagine they don\u2019t quite have this richer set of portfolio of services you have. So is that an opportunity?","Carlos Rodriguez","The last part of your question is there\u2019s defiantly an opportunity there, because you're right, our portfolios a little bit broader. So we are very bushing and very optimistic on the transaction. Just to clarify, we didn't say that we would be at the low end. I did say we would be at lease at the lower end and so we feel based on the third quarter bookings performance, based on momentum we feel pretty good about our situation around the business booking. So maybe we weren't strong enough in conveying that. But I think our sales force is executing quite well. I just want to clarify also, it may not have come through that. I've been working on this deal for, personally for than\u2026 ","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Since 2007, yeah.","Carlos Rodriguez","I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s working on it before. So we didn\u2019t just run out and try to make an acquisition to make the quarter or to get our booking number up for the fourth quarter. I wish it were that easy because we tried many, many times to make this happen over the course of a decade and this happens to be when they occurred and we would have taken it any time any day, because it's good for our shareholders and its good for our business and we\u2019re very, very pleased that we have it. But we have no concerns about anything happening in the macro environment, on the pricing front or otherwise to make us feel less positive about our sales force, our distribution and our new business bookings.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it, thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of James Berkley with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. ","James Berkley","Thanks and congratulations Jan and Kathleen. Just a quick follow up on the booking side. Obviously great seeing the guidance being raised. Just how big was the days of selling impact since there was no discounting? I\u2019m just trying to understand the acceleration. I know like holiday sales in January a lot of people struggled across a lot of different industries there, but just trying to get a feel for you know the current trend and how sustainable that is excluding you know the impact of the transaction you are expecting in the next quarter? Thanks. ","Carlos Rodriguez","If I remember correctly, it would be the same impact that we talked about that impacted the second quarter. We just \u2013 we ended up getting, I think it was two days of less selling in the second quarter which then we got in the third quarter and we saw it. If you remember the conference call that we had, we already had those two days, so we knew we could see that our sales in the first couple weeks of this quarter had kind of rebounded and I think it was a few percentage points if I\u2019m not mistaken. I think was two to three percentage points of impact on the second quarter, which means we probably got a little bit of benefit to that extent in the third quarter. ","Jan Siegmund","And this timing event overall didn't really impact our full year outlook for new business bookings. So it was really neutral and everything we thought we lost was made up as precise as it can be, and these things was made up in January. ","Carlos Rodriguez","I think it's fair to say if you take all the noise out of calendar and so forth that we feel like we're right where we thought we would be in terms of book, in terms of where our plans were and where our objections were. ","Christian Greyenbuhl","And James, I would just remind you like we talked a little bit about FX, right and we also talked about interest income being a little bit weak. So if you are talking about you know in the context of the strength of revenue growth just keep those two items in mind.","James Berkley","Okay, great, thanks a lot. I appreciate the color. ","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one last question. So our last question will come from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. ","Kevin McVeigh","Great thanks. Is there any way \u2013 and congratulations again on both Jan and Kathleen. If you think about the impact of the retention across \u2013 so the 25 to 50 basis point to that. How much of that come kind of from down market versus mid versus up, just sort of thinking about the year overall? ","Carlos Rodriguez","Well obviously we don\u2019t provide retention by business unit, but maybe we can give you some \u2013 I think we already gave you some colors, and some sense of that. I think Jan talked about some really good improvement in our mid-market and our mid-market business. We do have obviously a number of other businesses besides kind of the general categories of small, medium and large. ","Like for example in the down market we have our retirement services business, we have an insurance businesses that really acts as an agency in addition to the traditional payroll business. We talked about the outsourcing businesses that we have, that are in employer services, but are not part of the PEO. So these kind of more comprehensive solutions if you will that those are, those business have gotten to be a meaningful size as well. ","We have a screening and selection business, we have an RPO business. So we have a lot of moving parts, and I think for us to get improvements in retention, we have to have broad-based improvements and client satisfaction and NPS scores and execution. It\u2019s just there is no way around it. ","So you have to assume that \u2013 by the way for the last, as long as ADP has been around, we have some people that are performing better, any particular quarter or any particular year, and others that are performing less well. But when you see this kind of trend, you have to assume that the overall company is performing better and executing well, which is what is happening. ","Kevin McVeigh","That\u2019s super helpful. And then just on the acquisition, are the clients mostly kind of down-mid enterprise or across the board and historically has there been kind of more of a service or they already on the cloud or you would shift them to the cloud as you kind of bring in the mid. ","Carlos Rodriguez","Its small and mid, which is traditionally the way these \u2013 these acquisitions are typically in that space and technically not acquisitions just to be clear. If you remember, the right to convert the client on our platforms from their previous provider. ","So these are typically, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever been able to do \u2013 who knows, but we\u2019ve never been able to do this with kind of enterprise size clients. I guess it's technically possible just to buy the right to convert. This typically happens with small and mid-size client. The majority, of the clients would be small clients and some mid-sized clients. ","Kevin McVeigh","Super, Thank you. ","Operator","This concludes our question and answer portion for today. I\u2019m pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. ","Carlos Rodriguez","Thank you. So as you can tell, I think from our comments we are really pleased with the rebound in our bookings. We are happy with this transaction that we consummated in late March. I think we have good momentum. I think our financial performance has been strong. But I also want to kind of call out to the comment and the question about retention. ","We really wouldn't be able to perform on a long term basis as well as we're performing if we weren\u2019t really delivering strong client satisfaction and better products. So I want to also complement our associates and our organization on staying focused on NPS scores, on client satisfaction and on building stronger products, because the performance of the financial side doesn't come without those factors. And all while we are doing that, we are trying to transform our business and I think become more efficient. So there is a lot of effort and a lot of work and I appreciate all of that everyone is doing.","Last thing I just want to mention is obviously we\u2019re very excited about having Kathleen here with us and everyone will get to know her, but it's bittersweet moment here with Jan leaving. As always, even the way he handled this transition was a total class act. So you know we've been partners here for a long time, prior to us being either CEO or CFO, we've been through a lot together, we've done a lot and I just want to thank Jan one more time for everything you've done not just for our shareholders and for all of you who are here on the call. But he\u2019s also done a lot for our clients, our associates, and he did quite a bit for his community as well.","So Jan, I thank you again, and I declare you not only Ironman Athlete, but Ironman CFO. ","Jan Siegmund ","Thank you. ","Carlos Rodriguez ","Thanks for everything Jan. Good luck to you. And thank you today for your attention. I appreciate it.

We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos Rodriguez","Thank you, Christian, and thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019 results with revenue of $3.5 billion for the quarter up 6% reported and organic constant currency. We ended the year with total revenue of $14.2 billion up 6% reported and 7% organic constant currency in line with our expectations.","We are pleased with our ability to balance the strong top-line revenue growth with a substantial 160 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion for the year. This margin expansion was ahead of our expectations as we executed well on our transformation initiatives, including our voluntary early retirement program, while also benefiting from increased operating efficiencies. When combined with share buybacks and a lower adjusted effective tax rate, we delivered very strong 20% adjusted EPS growth this year. Our core drivers of growth are also strong with Employer Services new business bookings growing 11% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the year. We are especially pleased with this performance given the difficult compare in fiscal 2018 when bookings grew 19% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year.","To put our Employer Services new business bookings performance into perspective, this year we sold approximately $1.6 billion of new annualized recurring revenues, which is a testament to the strength and scale of our sales force. When you add in the results of our PEO bookings, which grew double-digits in 2019. Our overall worldwide new business bookings continue to perform in line with our June 2018 Investor Day expectations, benefiting from our investments in targeted incremental selling opportunities as well as investments in our sales force, product and improvements in our productivity.","We are very pleased with our strong recent track record of Employer Services bookings in fiscal years 2018 and 2019. With this in mind, we have continued to invest in our distribution and currently expect Employer Services bookings to grow 6% to 8% in fiscal 2020. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 benefited from incremental organic sales related to our recently completed client list acquisition, with this strong second half performance in fiscal 2019, following a strong second half performance in fiscal 2018, we anticipate a difficult compare in the latter half of fiscal 2020.","Our Employer Services revenue retention rate is another important indicator of the health of our business. And as you will recall, this is the first year we provided guidance for it. We are pleased to now report an improvement in our retention rate of 40 basis points to 90.8% in 2019, which was in line with our expectations. This increase was driven primarily by our midmarket business, which is benefiting from rising NPS scores following the completion of our platform migrations in late fiscal 2018, continuous investments in our Workforce Now platform and service related transformation initiatives. This puts us closer to our all-time high of 91.4%, which is no small accomplishment given the amount of change we've been undergoing as an organization.","Our strategy is working, and on a broader level our efforts over the past three years to improve the service ability of our clients by migrating them to our strategic cloud-based software solutions and simplifying the service experience, while also closing sub-scale locations and transforming our client service model through our service alignment initiatives have contributed to improvements in our client satisfaction scores in overall service costs. You will hear more from Kathleen shortly on some of our more recent transformation related investments and anticipated benefits. But before that, I would like to briefly discuss some of our recent efforts around our product and innovation.","The global human capital management market is strong and continues to benefit from an evolving regulatory landscape that increasingly elevates the value of HR as a strategic business partner. At our June 2018 Investor Day, we shared how we intend to position ourselves to take advantage of some of these trends. One such trend is the evolution of payments were employers increasingly recognize the need for differentiated payments and financial wellness offerings in order to attract and retain talent. A recent study by the ADP Research Institute identified that nearly 80% of employers in North America believe that companies will need to customize their employee payment options to remain competitive in the war for talent. While two-thirds of employees say off-cycle pay options such as the ability to choose pay frequency would make a difference when considering a job offer.","At ADP, we continue to invest in new solutions in the tackling is evolving trends with ADP's wisely pay we are enabling our clients to provide their employees with a fully electronic and proprietary payment solution which we complement through our financial wellness tool the my wisely companion mobile app. Recently, we enhanced our electronic payment functionality with the launch of widely now, which helps organizations and their HR departments address compliance risks by bringing automation to Instant Payments such as off-cycle and termination fee. With these solutions organizations can leverage ADP's compliance expertise to pay unscheduled or off-cycle employee wages in order to meet the diverse range of local employer requirements.","Tight labor markets -- the tight labor market has also increased the importance of recruiting. Organizations are increasingly looking to utilize technology that enable a more seamless and effective recruitment process. Providing employers in an integrated offering that equips the recruiters with tools that effectively identify and connect with top talent is therefore paramount and helping them stay ahead of the competition. It is with this objective in mind that ADP recently integrated ADP recruiting management, our all-in-one automated recruiting platform with LinkedIn recruiter system connect. The integration allows recruiters to easily export basic profile data into ADP recruiting management while servicing critical candidate information in real-time into Linkedln recruiter.","With this integration, recruiters have access to everything they need in a single time saving workflow without the inconvenience of manual data entry, moving between systems or repetitive candidate outreach. Innovations like these demonstrate our commitment to delivering best-in-class products, and earlier this month, we were pleased to be recognized by both NelsonHall and Everest Group as a leader in their respective recruitment process outsourcing assessments. This is just one example of how most mid-and large-sized businesses today use multiple systems and vendors to manage their workforce needs. The seamless integration of solutions is critical to ensuring that employee experience is executed flawlessly.","As the HCM markets largest digital source for people management solutions, ADP Marketplace enables employers to build this more flexible HR ecosystem to fit their needs. This approach to providing an open ecosystem is integral to our open API strategy, and is a foundation for our next generation HCM solutions. We were therefore pleased this quarter to host our second Annual ADP marketplace partner summit, which allowed us to recognize our partners for the creativity and success of their solutions, while also allowing them to share in best practices. We are proud to have been the first HCM vendor to launch a marketplace and we're pleased this year to see our total number of partners grow by 33% with ADP Marketplace now offering almost 370 solutions across the HCM spectrum, representing 40% growth over the past 12 months.","Let me conclude my remarks by saying that our evolution towards becoming an HCM technology company that provides great service would not be possible without the dedication of our associates, who are integral and helping us accelerate our pace of change. We are proud of their efforts to deliver innovative solutions like these to our clients and for their efforts to ensure the success of our transformation initiatives.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Kathleen for her commentary on our results in the fiscal 2020 outlook.","Kathleen Winters","Thank you, Carlos, and good morning to everyone on the call. As Carlos said, we're pleased with our financial results for the year. We continue to make progress in delivering leading cloud-based software solutions to our clients and improving the client experience through our ongoing service and transformation initiatives. Our focus on delivering top-line revenue growth while also improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations in order to drive sustainable long-term value creation is working.","This morning, we reported full-year revenue growth in line with our expectations at 6% on a reported basis and 7% on an organic constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBIT increased 15% in with ahead of our expectations. Adjusted EBIT margin was up about 160 basis points compared to fiscal 2018, and included 30 basis points of unfavorability from acquisitions. This margin improvement benefited from both discrete larger transformation initiatives and various operating efficiencies. The details of which I will now take you through.","First, we completed a voluntary early retirement program with an annualized recurring cost saving of $150 million in line with our original expectations. However, due to the timing of our backfill hiring we realize the full benefit in fiscal 2019. We do not expect any incremental savings from this initiative in fiscal 2020.","Second, this year, we fully realize the remaining benefits from our service alignment initiative. Having completed our hiring needs in fiscal 2018, we exited the remainder of our previously identified 68 subscale service locations for an annualized recurring cost saving of approximately $60 million. This was in line with our expectations as we achieved most of these cost savings in fiscal 2018, while fiscal 2019 benefited from the lapping of approximately $20 million in dual operating costs.","Finally, following our recent platform migration efforts this year, we also saw continued benefits from efficiencies within our IT infrastructure. These cost savings initiatives were further supplemented by a number of smaller more tactical transformation projects that have collectively helped to drive productivity improvements across the business. Some examples of these initiatives include an enhanced client relationship management system. Our ongoing investments to automate manual tasks and elevating the use of artificial intelligence, which together help reduce contacts per client. The benefits from these initiatives were partially offset by the investments in our new brand platform and growth in selling expenses.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 23.8% and benefited from the impact of the lower federal statutory tax rate due to corporate tax reform, partially offset by the loss of certain tax deductions. This rate compares to our 26.2% adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2018. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 20% to $5.45 and in addition to benefiting from our revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate was also aided by fewer shares outstanding compared to a year ago.","Now for our segment results. For Employer Services, revenues were in line with expectations and grew 5% reported and organic constant currency. As a reminder, this fiscal year we experienced approximately one percentage point of benefit from the impact of acquisitions, which was offset by the impact of FX. Interest income on client funds grew 20% and benefited from a 30 basis point improvement in the average yield earned on our client fund investments to 2.2% and growth in average client funds balances of 5% to $25.5 billion. This growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control, partially offset by lower SUI collections. Our same-store pays per control metric in the US grew 2.7% for the fiscal year.","Moving on to Employer Services margin, we saw an increase of about 230 basis points in the year, which included approximately 50 basis points of unfavorability from the impact of acquisitions. The strength of our performance this year was enabled by some of the same factors that I mentioned earlier when discussing our consolidated results. PEO revenues grew 9% for the year to $4.2 billion with average worksite employees growing 8% to 547,000 both in line with our expectations.","Revenues excluding the impact of zero margin benefit pass-throughs grew 8% to $1.5 billion, also in line with expectations despite continued pressure from lower workers' compensation and SUI pricing. Margins increased 60 basis points for the year due to operating efficiency within the business and benefits from our voluntary early retirement program. We also saw a better than expected changes to our ADP indemnity loss reserve estimates with about 10 basis points of unfavorable year-over-year impact in fiscal 2019 as compared to our previous estimate of 25 basis points.","We are pleased with the strength of our results in fiscal 2019. And with the year now behind us, I want to share a few thoughts related to our balance sheet, cash flow and financial liquidity. We have a robust business model with high levels of operating cash flow, our strategy is to leverage the strengths of our model to reinforce our competitive position by first and foremost reinvesting in the business. We believe that balancing investments in innovative solutions, client service tools and distribution is critical and helping to strengthen our market leading offerings. And we supplement these investments through a disciplined approach to M&A. We also remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and disciplined share buybacks. And this year, we returned approximately $2.2 billion. Finally, our strong balance sheet multiple sources of liquidity and AA credit ratings all help support our $2.2 trillion in global client money movement operations and our investment strategy for our client fund's portfolio.","Let's now move to our fiscal 2020 outlook. Starting with Employer Services, we expect 4% to 5% revenue growth in our Employer Services segment, which includes anticipated pays per control growth of about 2.5%. We also expect Employer Services new business bookings growth up 6% to 8% and for our Employer Services revenue retention to improve 10 basis points to 20 basis points.","Moving on to margins; we expect margin in our Employer Services segment to expand by 100 basis points to 125 basis points. Our margin growth continues to benefit from a combination of operating leverage together with the impact from our various transformation initiatives.","Regarding our PEO segment, we expect 9% to 11% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and 7% to 9% growth in PEO revenues excluding zero margin health care benefit pass-throughs, both driven by an anticipated growth of 7% to 9% in average worksite employees. We're pleased with the strength of our PEO bookings in fiscal 2019. But healthcare inflation remains high and as we anticipated, we experienced volatility and some churn in our fourth quarter. Accordingly, we anticipate being on the lower end of our average worksite employee guidance range at the beginning of the year, with a gradual reacceleration of our growth rate as the year progresses.","We meanwhile continue to expect lower workers' compensation and SUI pricing to have an impact on our total PEO revenue growth. For PEO margin following a strong fiscal 2019, we anticipate margins to be flat to down 25 basis points in fiscal 2020, which includes approximately 50 basis points of unfavorability from adjustments to our ADP indemnity loss reserve estimates.","I'll go now to the consolidated outlook. We anticipate total revenue growth of 6% to 7% in fiscal 2020. This outlook contemplates interest income on client funds of approximately $580 million to $590 million and net interest income from our extended investment strategy of $585 million to $595 million. This outlook is approximately $30 million lower than our June 2018 Investor Day estimates for fiscal 2020.","With that said, we expect to overcome some of this interest income pressure through operating efficiency, and we anticipate adjusted EBIT margin to increase 100 basis points to 125 basis points in fiscal 2020. With more expansion in the second half of fiscal 2020 given our very strong first half margin performance in fiscal '19. In addition to benefiting from our operating leverage our fiscal 2020 margin growth is anticipated to benefit from the following two transformation initiatives.","First, during the fourth quarter of fiscal '19, we recorded a severance charge of approximately $26 million related to a broad-based workforce optimization effort focused on spans of control and management layers throughout the organization. Second, this year we're accelerating our procurement transformation efforts through a number of initiatives aimed at third-party vendors and internal expense management. These two initiatives combined are expected to generate about $100 million of savings in fiscal 2020. We anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.8% in line with last year, this rate includes about 50 basis points of estimated excess tax benefit from stock based compensation related to restricted stock vesting in Q1 of fiscal 2020, but it does not include any estimated tax benefit related to potential stock option exercises. Given the dependency of that benefit on the timing of exercises. We expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 12% to 14% in fiscal 2020.","I'll now share a few thoughts resulting from the discussions that I've had with some of you doing my first few months here at ADP. At our June 2018 Investor Day, we set target ranges through fiscal '21, and we've been pleased with our progress to date. In particular, we are pleased with how our associates have responded to the challenges that we have set and with how the business is executing on our strategic plan. It's now been a little over a year since we share those targets, and a few things have happened since then, including the adoption of ASC 606. Therefore, we felt it might be helpful to share a couple of reminders.","First, you will recall that we based on our Investor Day targets on ASC 605, and we provided you with the anticipated ASC 606 impacts to margins. Second, our growth targets were baseline off of the mid-point of our fiscal 2018 guidance at the time and we subsequently reported our fiscal 2018 results better that exceeded our expectations. So although we are not providing a re-issuance or an update of the targets we provided at our June 2018 Investor Day. To better assist you in today's earnings presentation you will find a recast and walk of certain of our Investor Day targets using fiscal 2018 reported results and the ASC 606 basis of accounting.","Taking a step back, we are pleased with our performance in fiscal 2019. And we continue to make great progress on our transformation initiatives. We have a lot of opportunities ahead of us and we're excited to continue to challenge ourselves to become an even stronger organization.","With that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.","Jason Kupferberg","Good morning, guys. I just wanted to start maybe on the bookings side of things, just looking at the fiscal '20 guidance. It's actually in line with your typical annual target even though you do have that tough grow over as was highlighted in your prepared remarks, especially in the second half. So I just wanted to see if you can go into the visibility on that target. I mean it's a stronger guide than we were expecting in light of the comp issue just maybe deconstruct the market a bit in terms of where you see that sustained strength coming from. And as part of that, if you can just clarify what the bookings contribution in Q4 was from the quasi-acquisition, if you will?","Carlos Rodriguez","Sure. Let me just start by the -- I guess the first part of the question and then maybe Kathleen can address the quantification in terms of the numbers in the fourth quarter. But we look at a number of -- I guess, objective things in terms of trying to come up with our bookings forecast for the next year. As you know, that is the number that we have the least visibility on, because it's unlike the rest of our business which is recurring revenue. This is every week, every month, every quarter, start from zero in terms of new business bookings. But having said that, we have a lot of historical information around. For example, sales force productivity, so we call sales per diem or average sales productivity and then we have the number of sales people that we have hired into the system over the past three or four months, and so that, that all goes into a model and you add on top of that are feeling some subjectivity around new product strength and in some cases may be acquired products that we have and that's really how we come up with our number for bookings. So I think borrowing changes in the economy and borrowing kind of -- some kind of external shock or factor. We've been doing this way for decades and it works. We have a certain amount of head count that we had, we have a certain amount of productivity that we drive toward then we change our incentives and ratchet them up in order to drive those productivity improvements. And then we have kind of new products that we introduced to try to help our sales force get that productivity and also help us competitively in the marketplace.","So all other factors remain relatively constant. Even though there are tweaks here and there, depending on the segments, but no big changes in pricing, no big changes to report on kind of other fronts other than as you insinuated kind of business as usual. Although that underestimates the difficulty of selling the amount of new business bookings that we have to sell every year in order to hit our target. But that gives you a little bit of a flavor of how we kind of build our planet's -- it's a tried and tested approach and we did have a little bit of a challenge because of the grow over from the fourth quarter client acquisition list, but we feel good about our momentum and I think our headcount adds were probably in the 4% range, I think it was. I'm not sure with the exact number was, but our head count is exactly where that's the one variable historically it would behind in hiring that can generally create an issue for us and if we are in good shape on hiring or even ahead of the game, it gives us a little bit more confidence and I think we're exiting the year fully staffed and I think with a good head count in our sales organization. And I know, Kathleen, if you want to address?","Kathleen Winters","Yes. And maybe I'll just also comment a little bit on the process having come in and been here for a couple of months now and coming in with a fresh set of eyes or different set of eyes looking at the process. I mean, I can attest to the very detailed bottoms up process that we go through in terms of, as Carlos said, looking at head count looking at productivity improvements. How does new product functionality or new product add to the growth. What is the market conditions look like. I mean, we've kicked the tires on this process and is a really, really solid process. I'm really happy to see that. In terms of the year-over-year and the growth of -- particularly the client list acquisition. I mean, look, we're really, really pleased with how the organization, sales organization performed and the end result for fiscal 2019, it's a little hard to exactly parse out and identify the exact impact of that client list acquisition. Because we think about it in terms of look it's truly organic, we've got a sales force and sales associates that we've had to dedicate to go out and work those conversions and close those sales on balance we're just really happy with the outcome we had in 2019. And we think we've got a really very balanced and solid outlook for 2020.","Carlos Rodriguez","And so -- I just went back and listen my notes, our head count actually is a little bit stronger is around, a little bit over 5% in terms of. So that's actually probably better than historical norm and we did have conversations about six months ago that given the discussions out in the external market about the economy and difficulties potentially -- difficulties with the economy is before, obviously, the discussions about lower rates etc. And we decided that we're going to take a little bit of an insurance policy and add a little bit more headcount in our sales organization. So I think we're entering the year in a very good position from a headcount standpoint.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay.","Christian Greyenbuhl","Jason, I would just add briefly to that to Carlos' point about headcount investments, they are in put more focused on inside sales, which is in line with what we outlined at our Investor Day that we were going to try focused on.","Carlos Rodriguez","And one last comment about that, because I think you referred to as a quasi-acquisition. So it was just to be clear was -- we bought the right to convert clients and so every single client had to be resold and re-implemented. We bought no platforms, no assets, no people, just to be clear, because that was a very difficult and an incredibly well execute is probably one of the best executed initiatives I've ever seen. That was months and months of planning, and it was executed virtually flawlessly.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, that's really good color. I just wanted to switch gears for a second over to PEO. I mean, if we just reflect back on the Analyst Day last year. I think, the three year revenue guidance to the CAGR there on PEO was 11% to 14% if memory serves. I know we did 9% in year one, and at the midpoint in year two, I think we're looking at about 10%. So how should we perhaps recalibrate our expectations a little bit in terms of what the realistic three year CAGR is, and at the end of the day, is that just attributable more to variations in the WSE growth as opposed to some of the pass-through pieces or the SUI pricing as you reflect on kind of what the thought process was a year plus ago versus today.","Carlos Rodriguez","Sure. So for 2019, as Kathleen was talking about things that we needed to kind of provide some clarification on from Investor Day, because as time goes on more things change so ASC 606 was one of the things that we highlighted. But another thing that we've tried to highlight every quarter since the fiscal year started in '19, because given the timing when we gave our Investor Day guidance it was June, and it was really just a month later that our benefits billing cycle changes for our PEO. In other words are open enrollment takes place because of the way our fiscal year works that's when our renewals take place in our PEO and that's when we give visibility really to the biggest pass-through which is a zero margin benefit pass-through.","And as we mentioned last year around this time, we were pleasantly surprised have gotten kind of given what was happening with healthcare inflation, low health care renewals, lower than we had anticipated, certainly in our Investor Day. Again zero margin, so no impact on EPS, but certainly had an impact on growth in '19 of total PEO revenue. We also had a renewal of our workers' compensation policy that ended up being again lower than we had anticipated. That was a smaller impact in the zero margin health care benefits pass-through. But the combination of those two items is really the largest component of the difference between Investor Day guidance in 2019 PEO performance.","Now, we move on to 2020. Now you start to get the impact of what is a combination of that -- of the slower pass-through growth, but also slightly slower worksite employee growth, so it's really a combination of those two factors. I just want to give you a little bit of color, because it depends on '19 versus '20. And as Kathleen mentioned in her prepared remarks in '20 our health care renewals, which we do now have come in line with historical expectations. So that portion for 2020 is more in line with what we've had historically. So '19 was really the anomaly when it comes to zero margin, pass-through, but we still have pressure from workers' compensation pricing coming down and SUI pass-through also coming down in 2020.","And again, these zero margin or low margin pass-through costs coming down in cost or price is generally a good thing competitively for the PEO. So it has relatively small impact on the overall profitability of the PEO and very little impact on the overall profitability of ADP. But certainly impacts the headline revenue number.","Jason Kupferberg","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffetNathanson.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good morning, guys. And great results. Here, if I would call correctly, I believe your new high-end product is in beta testing with a handful of clients. Could you -- as really peaking out into 2020 now. Could you give us an update on where you are in that rollout? What type of feedback you're hearing what features our clients liking the most about that product and kind of what's the timeline for the rollout? Thank you.","Carlos Rodriguez","Sure. You're obvious -- as you can imagine, we're very excited about we've been for several years working on a solution that will really address some of the needs in the market that are unmet today. We just as a little bit of color before I get into that, keep in mind that we also have our Workforce Now platform that we've brought up into the upmarket space, which has really helped us competitively quite a bit. There is a segment of the market where Workforce Now works very well for larger clients, if those larger clients are \"simpler\" and don't have kind of global needs and relatively simple benefits needs. And so, it's been a two-pronged approach in the interim of using continuing to use Vantage and investing in Vantage and also bringing Workforce Now up into the upmarket. Those two things in combination I think have led to -- we consider to be good unit growth in the upmarket, which is very satisfying for us.","But obviously, we believe there's a lot of upside with our new Lifion platform. And so, this is the first year where we've had clients in pilot. We do have a sales team, which we have expanded just very recently. So we are not in general availability, but we are selling new clients, and I would say that our sales expectations have -- I think it's safe to say, been in line to maybe even exceeded our expectations. So we're very happy on that front. But now we have a lot of work ahead of us, because we've got, I believe it's about four or five clients that are implemented and live, and obviously in the agile development approach we are continuing to improve and add to the platform as we bring on clients. And so, we're just in this gradual process of making sure that we can get to the point where we can have exponential growth of the platform and for that we need to make sure that we are fully ready with our implementation resources that we've been adding sales people. We've been adding implementation resources, and I think 2020 is a year where we expect to get traction in the market, particularly in the second half of the year.","But again, the caution of course is given ADP's size and our $14 billion in revenue. This is not something that is a one or two year horizon story, this is in terms of impact on ADP is a very, it's a long-term investment and is expected to have a very long-term and positive impact on our competitiveness. But we shouldn't be expecting if -- in fact, I would say, it's fair to say that, in the short term it really create some financial pressure, because we're putting a lot of the -- besides the R&D investments that we've made over the last four years or five years. Now we're investing heavily in sales distribution and implementation. And as you know, especially in the upmarket that doesn't translate into revenues until 6, 12, 18 months down the road depending on the size and complexity of the client.","Kathleen Winters","Yes. So we did -- we had given a range of sales units that we had expected and we were at the high end of that range that we had given as Carlos said, we've been adding to sales and implementation team there, but we'll continue to do so during the course of 2020 for sure. So yes, we'll start to get more feedback during the course of the year as we do these pilots with the clients and we'll keep you updated on that.","Carlos Rodriguez","And I think, since you -- I think, very specifically talking about Lifion. But I think it's worth also mentioned, we have couple of other next-gen projects that are progressing quite well as well. One of them is more back office or tax engine, but it's very exciting, because, I think, it should lead to some real scale and efficiency gains there and more flexibility for our service organization also for our clients. But our new payroll next generation payroll solution is also kind of progressing well. I think we have around a dozen clients again in pilot. That's it also a global platform with a rules-based engine. We are very excited about that in terms of the flexibility that it will give us in terms of our core business around payroll and that's also progressing quite well. And I think we are intending to ramp up our sales, implementation resources on that front also.","Lisa Ellis","Okay. Well, I'm excited about your new tax engine. Different topic, in your 2020 guidance, you're forecasting again about 2.5% pays per control growth, which implies a pretty robust outlook on the US economy. Can you highlight what you're seeing in your underlying numbers that's giving you that level of confidence as you look out into 2020. Thanks.","Carlos Rodriguez","It's a very fair question. I'd say the -- given that we're not economists and don't have a crystal ball, probably the biggest factor we look at is trend and momentum. And I think we had 2.7% in the fourth quarter if I'm not mistaken, just to check. And I think it was two point something -- 2.8% before that. So we're believers that when it comes to the economy, the economy behaves somewhat similar to ADP, which is things don't change that quickly overnight, unless there is of course, some kind of external shocks. So could that number end up exiting at a lower rate by the end of the year due to an economic slowdown. I mean, that's up to the economists to the forecasting to predict, but based on what we're seeing like in the trends and the momentum we just issued our employment report actually this morning, and it was once again, I think, kind of in the target if you will, I think it was 150-something thousand jobs. So it feels like there is still some gas in the tank, and when you look at labor force participation we do, even though we're not economists, we do look at these things. And yes, unemployment is very low and that should make it a little bit harder to find people, but there are still a lot of people out there. And I know there explanations around the baby boomers retiring and so forth, but it appears every month that we and the government everyone else is surprised by the ability to bring more people into the workforce. So we think that at least for the next couple of quarters that feels like a good bet. And I think, beyond that probably up to the economists.","Lisa Ellis","Perfect, thank you. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys, just wanted to ask on employee services growth. I know at the Analyst Day we talked about 5% to 6%, it's only modestly different now 4% to 5%. And just a different factors going into that guide now from what we've learned over the last year. And also I think, Kathleen, you talked a little bit about beating expectations and revenue which had some impact as well? Thanks.","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes, I think there are -- let Kathleen talk about the math, but just as an overall big picture. Again, as we get further away from Investor Day, there's a lot of things that go into the mix for Employer Services. For example, we do now include client funds interest in Employer Services. And so, we're getting slightly less contribution from that in '20 versus Investor Day and versus '19. We also have a little bit of FX pressure that obviously, it's not something that we forecasted an Investor Day. So I think those generally would explain, I think over the two years of '19 and '20, I would say that Employer Services growth is in line with Investor Day.","Kathleen Winters","Yes, I don't really have anything to add further. I mean, those are the factors, as Carlos mentioned, that is various puts and takes. But generally in line with those expectations.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And just as a follow-up one to ask about the M&A pipeline and what you guys might be looking at to continue to add and supplement to the portfolio? Thanks so much.","Carlos Rodriguez","Well, we, this fourth quarter client list acquisition that we made I think, piqued our interest in using our capital in more than just kind of the traditional organic fashion. And we did do a few acquisitions. If you recall, we acquired Global Cash Card. We just acquired Celergo, WorkMarket. So we planned to some seeds, and some of those were really investments in the future. So, call it, two, three, five, 10 years down the road WorkMarket as an example. We're incredibly excited about our strategically, but it's just because of its size and relation to the size of ADP. Today, it doesn't really change the numbers a lot, but it could down the road, it's a very large market for freelancers out there so.","So the question is, besides that, or the things that we can use our capital for that would have a greater impact on the kind of short-term revenue, if you will, and we're certainly interested in looking. But we're also highly disciplined right in terms of requiring the right kinds of returns. And as you know, the bar for us is -- one of our bars is that we are trying to avoid adding a lot of additional platforms, because we've been working very, very hard to rationalize platforms and the migrate clients onto our strategic platforms. So that does create a little bit of a high bar, but it doesn't mean that we wouldn't be willing some extraordinary circumstance to make an exception of was a very strategic opportunity, we may be willing to spend the time and the effort to migrate clients off of an existing platform onto our platform, like we did with Global Cash Card as an example.","Bryan Keane","Okay, helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Marcon with R. W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon","Good morning. You have really nice progress with regards to the client retention improvement. I'm wondering if you can talk about how broad base that was, it sounds like there is really good improvement on the midmarket? But wondering to what extent that extended to the other areas. And then, you're looking for some more improvement going forward. I'm wondering if that's expected to be broad based or how we should think about that?","Carlos Rodriguez","So, yes, a little bit of color is that the reason we called out as we usually do, we try to call at the one or two things that are the most significant in terms of moving the numbers, but whether it's retention or other parts of our business -- the rest of the business is performing relatively well, it's very hard to generate that kind of improvement. So in terms of additional color, in our SBS business, as an example, we had record high retention, but it was off of what was already a very high retention rate. So, what I'll call it modest improvement in retention, but frankly very satisfying, because we're trying to -- we're trying to stay away from quarterly or specific business segment discussions about retention, because there is, there can be volatility in those numbers. But to see the SBS retention improve on top of where they already were after five years of improvement was very satisfying.","But the real standout was really our midmarket business and it really performed according to script. So we -- as you know, we once had some very difficult times in 2017 with a combination of ACA have been happening right in the middle of what we're trying to migrate our clients off of our legacy platforms onto our current version of Workforce Now. And what we said at the time was that we wanted to -- the script was and we wanted to follow what happened in our downmarket business where we consolidated and migrated all of our clients onto one single platform called run, and after that for four or five years we had very healthy increases in retention, very healthy increases in new business bookings and just great performance in this business around margins and so, for fiscal year '19 we're very happy that our midmarket business followed that part of the script of really taking the benefits of a simpler environment both for our associates and for our clients and we're hoping that there is more gas in the tank.","And in the rest of the business performed, I would say, well, we don't have any -- I don't think there any places where we have -- we will rise to the occasion of us mentioning that we had a big dip in retention in Employer Services.","Mark Marcon","That's great. And then, it sounds like there's a lot of excitement around on demand pay. I'm wondering when we think about the concept and the promise that that hold. How should we gauge that relative to being realistic in terms of when it's actually going to really generate material revenue? How do you envision that rolling out over the next two to five years?","Carlos Rodriguez","My instinct would tell me slowly and with very little impact, but it could be important competitively. And so, I think being able to provide these solutions in a market where again we already have a very large new business bookings number, and we have every year to grow that, that number we need up every weapon in the arsenal. So we are still very positive and optimistic about that business. And, but over the course of a couple of years, I would say, I would have modest expectations around financial impact. Longer term, we have a lot of -- we didn't buy Global Cash Card without keeping in the back of our minds that this was a potential very large opportunity for us down the road. But again, I hate to sound like a broken record, but in relation to the size of ADP, we look at all these things over the course of three, five, seven years rather than what's it going to do in the next couple of years.","Mark Marcon","All right. I appreciate that. And then lastly, just on the PEO side, any changes in the market that you can discern Carlos with regards to just when we take a look at on WSE growth and how we should expect trends to unfold or any regional differences anything that's changed with regards to the promise there?","Carlos Rodriguez","No, I mean, I think it's still, it's still a little bit of the same, a similar story where we do say in the industry says the same thing every year, but it's still true that it's a relatively under penetrated market. So I think there is no, there is no lack of opportunity in terms of addressable market out there. I think the key is really being very disciplined about your health care and you're workers compensation, so that you have a truly long-term sustainable and viable business model. And I think we've tried to follow that approach by taking no risk on our health benefits and being very disciplined and careful on workers comp or we have indemnity which is run by corporate, which provides the pricing to our PEO, and frankly where we also offload most of that risk.","As you know in our 10-K, we fully disclose the way we color basically that risk to a relatively small number. So I think the key is just really focusing on the value proposition and not getting distracted by the short-term fluctuations in volatility of health care costs. And I think, that's served us well, and that's we're going to continue to do. We have obviously inherent advantage in -- that we try to exploit of having a very large installed base and a very large referral network called the ADP sales force outside of the PEO. And so, you heard us talk last year about tweaking these incentives in the midmarket. We had great results from that. We had double-digit growth and referrals from our midmarket business. I think you saw it translate into really good results and our new business bookings. I think we talked about double-digit bookings growth in the PEO for the year.","So we're feeling pretty good about the PEO business and I think nothing that I can see has changed dramatically. The environment compared to three or four years ago, there is less rhetoric around -- regulatory issues and obviously ACA people go back and forth on that, but there is enough state and local regulation that small companies deal with that. It's a target rich environment for whether it's a PPO or some of our other traditional services. It's very hard to be a small employer out there.","Mark Marcon","I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies.","Samad Samana","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious when you think about the $1.6 billion of bookings that you added in -- in fiscal '19. I'm curious maybe you can give some color on the composition, when you think about it as core payroll versus some of the additional offerings that are in Employer Services. What was particularly strong and what drove the outperformance relative to expectations. And then I have one follow-up question.","Carlos Rodriguez","I'm sorry. Back to the beginning of your question, you're telling about 2019?","Samad Samana","Yes, of fiscal '19 as you think about the strong bookings performance within Employer Services. If you think by product or by the services that are offered in Employer Services was there anything that stood out in particular -- as particularly strong and\/or that drove the outperformance.","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes. And I think we were kind of generally in line with the last couple of years about where we were in terms of about 60-40 in terms of the breakdown between new and upsell opportunity, and that's kind of not that far off from our historic numbers. A couple of other places where we had good results, we talked about SBS in the down market, they were on a great trajectory to begin with. And I think the client list conversion \"acquisition\" that we did at the end of the year helped that even more. So we had just really great results in SBS, but our International business did well, also particularly because of the MNC multinational sales that we have with global view Celergo streamline. So that was also a big positive. And frankly, our domestic upmarket business did pretty well, we had a good, they had a good year on new business bookings. So we were pleased with that. So we had -- I would say, probably SBS is probably the standout with some tailwind because of the client list acquisition. But I think we had broad based strength.","Samad Samana","Great. And then just a follow-up on the additional $26 million in savings expected from the changes internally to the structure to make things more streamlined. I'm curious if that's something that's part of a more to come, or is that what maybe the last of what you see as restructuring that's needed as part of driving efficiencies or how should we think about that in the context of that new $26 million and then with the $150 million of savings driven by the -- is there additional efficiencies that the company seems that can drive from that perspective. Thanks again for taking my question.","Kathleen Winters","Yes, thanks for the questions, Samad. Just to clarify, the $26 million was the charge we took the severance charge in Q4 of 2019 related to the workforce optimization, if you will efforts in terms of span -- looking at spans and layers. And so forth, that will drive in addition to that plus the procurement work we're doing will drive about $100 million of savings in fiscal 2020.","Carlos Rodriguez","And I would say that, just to add a little bit of color to you, because your comment about are we done with kind of trying to look for efficiency gains or we done with the restructuring. The answer is no. I think that -- very large complex global organization and I think we have a lot of opportunity for improvement. We probably always will. But I think in the short-term, we have a lot of opportunity just because of what we're seeing with the capabilities of our new platforms as an example, they really -- I think highlight the opportunities we have for automation for digitization and for efficiency. And so we intend to continue to stay on that path here for some time to come. So I think we're -- the answer is, we're not done. I think, we are still working on that.","Kathleen Winters","Yes, I mean, and just kind of add-on to a little bit more there is really a lot of energy and alignment. And those two things together really important, a lot of energy and alignment in the organization around doing this transformation work on those. It's a lot of hard work, there's a lot of execution work going on, but there's also a lot of work around developing the pipeline. What is the next set of projects that we're doing in areas like, is there potentially more on procurement, is there more in terms of how we utilize our facilities automation projects. I think there is a whole host of things that we can look at here.","Samad Samana","Great. That's really helpful color. Thanks again for added additional detail.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David [ph] with Stifel. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Carlos, you've done a good job of outlining how the operational changes system in there that ADP over the last two years as well as describing the new product initiatives underway. How should we think about which of these will be most impactful to revenue growth over the next 12 to 24 months.","Carlos Rodriguez","I don't mean to insult you, but I don't spend a lot of time thinking about the next 12 months, because the -- like, this thing is a ADP is that from a recurring revenue standpoint, the momentum that we have is hopefully discernible right in terms of when you look at retention, you look at new business bookings and you look at the momentum of our business. And we tend to spend more time on the kind of 24 months and beyond timeframe. But having said that, I think some of the recent acquisitions that we made over the last couple of years. I think our -- strengthening our product line, I think that the next-generation products that are actually really getting sold now and getting implemented have the ability to start really moving the needle on new business bookings. But those have relatively modest impacts on our overall revenues, just because of the size of the business. So it's not because of lack of excitement around the things that we are doing that I say that, that the 12-month horizon is really not something that I spend a lot of time on. It's just because of the math in terms of the way the math operates. But I think that we have a number of things that we've been working on for, and it's not really just over the last couple of years. We focused a lot on the last couple of years around kind of increasing the pace of change moving faster and also becoming a little bit more incrementally efficient whether it's through the voluntarily retirement through the strategic alignment initiative or some of the other things that we've done.","But I think our sales force, our products and the rest of our business continues to execute at a very high level. Unfortunately, now we're getting that the benefit of those -- that execution plus we're getting reasonable margin improvement, because of some of these actions that we've taken. So we're very happy and very satisfied with the performance and I don't expect to be any less satisfied over the next 12 months.","Unidentified Analyst","Right. I think that fair. The question was operationally, obviously, you've done a great job, which is impacted retention and service levels, which obviously impacts also new sales. I guess I'm trying to understand whether or not some of the product initiatives could in fact be more impactful, if you will over the next 24 months or so, or do you think it's going to be just kind of an even kind of contribution as it's always been over the last several years.","Carlos Rodriguez","Well, since you mentioned 24 months, that's a different story. So I do think that given the ramp and the kind of the lines that we have on the charts on the grass, if you will, what we expect from our next-gen products. I would expect that over the 24-month horizon, there will be a measurable impact particularly on new business bookings from next-gen. But in the kind of the 12-month timeframe, the things we've done for example around moving Workforce Now into the upmarket. I think it has been incredibly impactful and helpful in the upmarket competitively for us. We're also using our Workforce Now platform in the PEO now and in our HRO business, which has been incredibly impactful. So now we have a very large next-gen platform, because we consider Workforce Now to be next-gen as well and to be out there competitively. So that's very helpful. This retention improvement that we've talked about beneath the surface of that is really big improvements and NPS scores, client satisfaction and referenceability. And I think that probably got alone has the single biggest potential impact on our sales force and our growth because we have a very large distribution network out there. And any improvement in productivity for them because of any kind of tailwind, and I think that reputation and referenceability and client satisfaction provide that tailwind, I think can really move the needle.","And then lastly, the run platform our downmarket platform just continues to execute incredibly well and they continue to innovate and we have a couple of things cooking there as well in terms of things in the downmarket that we think could also strengthen our hand in the marketplace as well there.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks for that clarification. And just one other question, really just on cyclicality. I just looking at the headlines and we will report this morning and some of the reports from paychecks in their monthly reports over the last several months, it looks like small business hiring is challenged with the tight labor markets. And is that typical for this stage of the cycle? And have you seen any impact of that in your downmarket business or the fee?","Carlos Rodriguez","I -- you kept that a little bit of a disadvantage, I don't think I even looked at my own employment report, I look at the headline number, which is 150-something thousand, but it sounds like there was something about small business employment slowing there, but I don't -- I think that based on kind of the trend, if you will over multiple months. I don't think there's anything really to read there. It is true that our pays per control number comes largely as a -- from a subset of our auto pay, payroll engine, which is does not include SBS. But we're not really seeing anything -- I mean our impact would be -- we would feel it, if there was a big issue in SBS, we have pays per control growth in SBS of 1.7 for the year. Not sure if I have prior years that I could compare that to, but it's positive, and it's growing. And the question about the cycle that we probably have some data around that it, I have to go back and look at, but that's probably more of a question for economists in terms of what turns down first is it large employer hiring or is a small business, hiring it's not sure that I have that one at the tip of my, on my fingertips, but there's really nothing, it's roughly comparable. So it's roughly comparable --","Unidentified Analyst","Last year's growth rate in SBS pays per control roughly comparable to this year.","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes, pay per control -- yes, so, that feels similar-ish, it doesn't mean that it can fluctuate from month-to-month, because I don't want to contradict our employment report. But in this kind of economy, I just don't think that there is so much demand out there and you saw the consumer spending numbers and you see what's happening in the consumer sector, a lot of small business serve that part of the economy. It's just -- it's hard to believe that small business employment is going to have a dramatic slowdown here anytime in the near future.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Carlos, good to see the retention improvement in fiscal '19, the 40 basis points. If you go back and look at fiscal '19 by segment downmarket and midmarket and upmarket. And clearly you've talked about the downmarket haven't done better for some time. Did the midmarket retention kind of performed to your expectations. And as you look into fiscal '20, what do you expect to kind of the line share the retention improvement come from?","Carlos Rodriguez","The midmarket really outperformed our expectations in fiscal year '19, the way we build our plan for '20 is even though there are probably some tweaks here or there. We are getting back to kind of close to record high client retention, so there would be -- I would considered, I would call a modest improvements expected in various parts of our business and others kind of flattish, because we just want to be realistic about the potential for retention in the absence of for example, some large change. So as an example in the midmarket we expect further improvements because we continue to still get benefits from the migrations in the consolidation of our platforms there. Excuse me.","Kathleen Winters","It's pretty modest, as we said 10 basis points to 20 basis points improvement for next year and spread pretty evenly across the board across the different market segments and there's always puts and takes, but it's pretty evenly spread in terms of where that improvement comes from and as you're at these high levels, and particularly in small business being at record highs. The higher you go the harder it is to get that incremental retention improvement, but obviously something we're continuing to focus on.","Carlos Rodriguez","And just one last little piece of color. I didn't go back and look at where our retention rates were over the last, call it 10 years. And we are now at a higher retention rate, then we were pre-crisis. So if you look at '06 and '07, our retention rate was actually lower in Employer Services than it is today. Despite the fact that the mix of our business is more heavily tilted now towards our downmarket business than our upmarket business, and that's in large part as a result of the outperformance if you will. So we are downmarket business has grown faster over the last 10 years than our upmarket and midmarket business. And the downmarket business has a lower natural retention rate, just because of out of business in bankruptcy is and so forth. And so even though SBS is at record highs that retention rate we've told you before is still lower than the midmarket and the upmarket retention rate. So the fact that the overall ADP retention is higher today than it was pre-crisis, despite what is a very, a much larger downmarket business, I think it's impressive.","James Schneider","It's good to see. And then on the PEO business. I think, Carlos, you called out a couple of items related to some increased client churn in the quarter. Can you may be kind of talk about what drove some of that was it. Specific offerings was a competitive, was a pricing, and I guess, how do you feel about kind of improving that metric going forward in the next couple of quarters?","Carlos Rodriguez","That's a good question. We spent some time kind of trying to find the silver bullet there in terms of what kind of drove this. And I think it feels like some of it was the health care renewal, which is not out of line with historical norms and just remember that for us from a health care standpoint we take no risk on health care, so we pass-through whatever health care costs we have. I would say that '18 was the anomaly, where we had a lower-than-normal health care renewal and then now we are back to kind of a more normal health care renewal and that may have had some impact in terms of client shopping because it's a relatively large part of the overall employment, employer cost. But we looked at it, we sliced and diced by size of client by industry, by geography, etc. And it's hard to find a pattern. Now happen to think that's good news, because that means that we think it will potentially something that we can work our way out of and reaccelerate the growth there. But the renewals were actually in line with our expectations. So last year's when we were currently surprised with the old story of may be a little bit of a grow-over issue for the clients themselves because and we got a little over excited about the good news last year. Now, even though these healthcare inflation rates are back to kind of historical norms still compares to what was better the previous, the previous year. But there may be other noise that I'm not aware in the system, but I can't really put my finger on anything that's permanent or with what's kind of mentioning.","James Schneider","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for just one more question. And our next question will be from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hi, thanks so much. I know it's getting late. Appreciate the time. Just on the margin outlook. I'm curious if we were to go back to the nice margin walk that you provided at the Analyst Day. Curious what's left to do to get to that 23%, 25%. I know you re-basing it here with 606 and what have you, but what's left to do another voluntary early retirements mostly done it sounds like service alignment mostly done where is the focus from here?","Kathleen Winters","Yes. So, as we mentioned a little bit earlier, we've just been looking at kind of org structure, if you will. And looking at spans and layers and so that will benefit us. And I think where we're doing some procurement work, but I think there is a lot more to go on the procurement side. And as I said, the organization is really energized around not only executing what we have, but saying what else can we put in the pipeline? So we've got some things near term that will help us near term in the pipeline and then we're working really hard to say, okay, what helps us two years out and three years out, and after that, there could be a lot of automation work that we can do across the organization, whether it's front-line or back office. I think there is a lot yet to go in terms of identifying those opportunities. So a lot of execution work we still have to do and we'll be working a lot on identifying new things to.","Carlos Rodriguez","I think to be a little bit more -- to be even more explicit the transformation office that we've set up. And I think, as Kathleen mentioned the whole management team, I think is committed to kind of this increased pace of change. I think that we've been talking about. So to be very clear, we actually have initiatives for '21 already. So we -- that's '21 that wasn't -- didn't misspeak there. So even though we're talking about '20 in terms of financial guidance we're meeting and talking now about things that we're working on during fiscal year 2020, that will have an impact on '21. And it's a number of different initiatives, we're not ready to talk about them because we're just not at that stage yet. But you should expect us to be talking about things that we're working on along the lines of what Kathleen mentioned, and we have those things already in process of getting ramped up and some of them require investments and that's built into our operating plan as well.","On the negative side, even though we've done all these positive things back to the investor days. Since you were asking about Investor Day and getting to the margin, one thing is not going to help us is if interest rates stay at the same levels as they are today. That would be a reasonably heavy headwind for us in '21. If you go back to Investor Day, I think you can do the math we provided you with what we expected the balances to be and what the forward curves we're seeing at the time. And unfortunately the forward curves are saying something different now. Of course, we have our optimistic hats on, and even though short-term rates might come down. That's less of an impact on us than kind of the mid-term rate. So if the 3s, 5s and 7s move up a little bit as a result of hopefully continued economic activity in a more positive outlook about the future and about inflation, we could get some recovery there. But as it stands today, I think we were very clear that we have about a $30 million delta for '20 versus Investor Day. And if it's $30 million for '20, I can guarantee you it's a bigger number and for '21 and I think the math is relatively very poor.","Kathleen Winters","I think if you just assume the same forward curve that we see today, if you assume that you'd be in about the same level of client fund interest in '21 as we're expecting in '20.","Tien-tsin Huang","Yes.","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes, like I said, we have a lot of stuff, we are a lot of stuff cooking. So we're not a -- we've learned to be agile, we've learned to be a debt and we will adjust to the environment, if necessary. And just as a point of reference in terms of being able to adjust I'll just point out that I took some notes here last night that we went in the pre-crisis our yield, our average yield on client funds was 4.5% on approximately I think it was $15 billion to $16 billion in balances. And the yield on our client funds when all the way down to 1.7% before now getting back to 2.2%. And so, if we were able to grow through an improved margins and improved profit going from 4.5% yield to 1.7%, I think will be okay. Because the good news is from 2.2% to 0 is less than 4.5% to 1.7%. So even if we go to zero, ADP will continue to chug along. We'll continue to grow and will continue to find ways to generate margin.","Tien-tsin Huang","Yes, I know you're thoughtful about what you can control. So just really, really quick, I promise. Just on the PEO side, I know a lot of questions. We've seen a couple of assets trade Carlos in the last year. So I'm curious if that changed your thinking on maybe one just scale up in PEO.","Carlos Rodriguez","I'm sorry. Say one more time.","Tien-tsin Huang","Yes. We've seen a couple of acquisitions, right, take place on the PEO front here in the last nine months or so. If I'm counting right, just curious did that changes your thinking I want to maybe do deal on it.","Carlos Rodriguez","I misunderstood. I heard trading and I thought I you were referring to something.","Tien-tsin Huang","Yes, I -- which is my [indiscernible].","Carlos Rodriguez","That's alright, that's alright. I think we have the same I think position that we've had all along, which is -- we have capital we after paying dividends and after a modest share buybacks, we have excess capital and we would love to deploy it. And I think we love the PEO business, but again, at the risk of a broken record, we're highly disciplined and sensitive about price, which matters in terms of what you pay in terms of valuation. But in the PEO business, there is another dimension of discipline around the quality of the business that you're buying, because again, most of our competitors take more risk than we do and that creates the potential for more volatility in their business. And so whether or not these assets that are trading that's fully contemplated or recognized only history we'll tell, but we understand this business fairly well and we are -- I guess, I will leave it at that. I think we just careful about it I'm sure that that's factored into any kind of due diligence, and it is what it. So we are where we are. But we would love to find an opportunity to grow our PEO business inorganically if the opportunity were to arise.","Tien-tsin Huang","Got it. Congrats on a good clean results guys. Thanks.","Carlos Rodriguez","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for his closing remarks.","Carlos Rodriguez","So I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We obviously had a strong year you could hear our optimism and hopefully it came through. We have a lot of stuff going on. We executed on our voluntary early retirement program. We're very excited. It didn't come up in the call. But our new brand platform, I think is, is important, it's something that is new to us as a company and I think, we think that could incrementally help our sales force and make them more productive. And we talked a little bit about all that we have going on with our next generation solutions, which I think should power ADP for the next three, five, 10 years and hopefully more years to come with these global platforms.","And last thing I'll say is, for those you who are not aware, we actually reached our 70th birthday this year as a company. And it's not every company that survive that long. And I thought it was just a second to reflect on what is it about ADP, that has allowed it to make it through so many technology changes through so many economic cycles. And I'd say that the one thing that I keep coming back to is the commitment of our organization to focus on our clients and to deliver value to them and to deliver service. I think is probably the thing that all of my predecessors would say, and I would reiterate, is the key to our success and we've done that by staying focused on our associates, by staying focused on what they need by listening to them and supporting them and they then deliver the outstanding products and the outstanding service that we deliver to our clients. We then stick around with us and deliver great returns for our shareholders.","And so it's been a great run for seven years for our Company, I think all of our associates who, today, continue to carry the torch and continue to execute and work hard on our strategy to take us forward. We remain incredibly optimistic and positive about the future and we really appreciate your support and your interest in ADP. Thanks again for joining us and appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","And with that ladies and gentlemen we conclude the call. You may now disconnect.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Webcast. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Elena Charles, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elena Charles","Thank you. Good morning. I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our fiscal 2013 earnings call and webcast.","Our slide presentation for today's call and webcast is available for you to print from the Investor Relations homepage of our website at adp.com.","As a reminder, the quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings for our reportable segments has also been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. These schedules have been updated to include the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. The website schedule also include a statement of consolidated earnings for fiscal 2012 and each quarter, restated for the discontinued operations we spoke about in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.","During today's conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risks. And these are discussed on Page 2 of the slide presentation and in our periodic filings with the SEC.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos for his opening remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Elena. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today's call with some opening remarks about our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. Then I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will take you through the detailed results, after which I'll return and provide you with our fiscal 2014 forecast. And before we take your questions, I'll provide some concluding remarks.","As you read in this morning's press release, we adjusted our earnings for certain nonrecurring items. Excluding these items, ADP reported very solid results for fiscal 2013. Total revenues for the year grew 7% with 6% organic growth. On a comparable basis to last year, pretax earnings grew 4%, net earnings grew 5% and earnings per share increased 6%.","I view these results as good, given the slow pace of the global economic recovery and the negative impact on revenues and earnings from the decline in client funds interest. I'm particularly pleased with our worldwide new business bookings growth of 14% for the quarter and 11% for the year. This beat our 8% to 10% expectations for the year and is particularly noteworthy, given the tough grow-over comp we had in last year's fourth quarter growth of 20%.","As a result of the strong new bookings growth, the new business expense was also higher than anticipated and negatively impacted fiscal 2013 earnings per share about $0.02 or 1%. As we have said over many years, strong bookings growth adding some incremental selling expense is a good problem to have.","Let's continue with ADP's results. The most significant economic headwind we continue to face is the low-market interest rate environment. Jan will take you through the year-over-year drag from lower interest rates for fiscal 2013 and how this is expected to lessen in fiscal 2014.","Now let's move to the business highlights. Our business segments performed well, achieving good revenue growth and pretax margin expansion. Importantly, organic revenue growth has improved each quarter during the year. As I mentioned a moment ago, I'm also very pleased with the execution of our sales force in Employer Services and PEO Services during the fourth quarter. I'm particularly pleased as this strong performance was across the board.","Our major market segments in the U.S., our best-of-breed solutions in the international markets and globally on streamline serving our multinational market, all achieved double-digit new bookings growth in the quarter. New business bookings were strong in absolute dollar terms as well and totaled $1.35 billion for the year. And to remind everyone, our new business bookings represent the anticipated annual recurring revenue that will come into our P&L as we install this new business.","To give you more color on our core offerings in the U.S., in the small business division of Employer Services in the U.S., bookings for our RUN solution were again strong and we're pleased with our market share gains in that space.","Moving to the mid-market space. You may recall here in our last earnings call that our newest version of Workforce Now is now in general release and available across North America and new bookings for this solution is also good. This version comes with additional functionality and language capabilities for a total HCM solution with a global system of record.","New bookings for larger companies in the U.S. were also strong. We continue to be pleased with the new bookings of our Vantage solution and attach rates for the year were good, with 100% of the Vantage deal coming with HR, 80% with benefits, 85% with time and attendance and 60% with talent. Sales productivity and efficiencies also continue to be very solid.","Now moving from our bookings to our other key business metrics. Client retention increased during the fourth quarter and for the year to a new record level in Employer Services, achieving such high-retention rate provides a good step off point for fiscal 2014 as the 2 most important drivers of future revenue growth, our new booking and retention of our existing revenues.","Client balances continue to grow and a number of employees on our clients payroll in the U.S., as measured by same-store pace for control, also increased. The PEO continue to grow nicely with solid worksite employee growth of 9% for the year. The PEO also had a great fourth quarter for new business bookings, where we had seen mixed results earlier in the year. So the step off point in fiscal 2014 for the PEO continues to show positive momentum.","Moving on to Dealer Services. The outlook for the automotive landscape in North America is good and the market forecast for calendar 2013 vehicle sales is the strongest it's been in 5 years. Dealer is performing very well. Transaction volumes were up this year, new bookings growth was solid, growth in our digital advertising business is strong, our win\/loss rates were good as we continue to gain market share and I'm pleased that Dealer Services worldwide revenue retention also improved.","On the acquisition front, in the fourth quarter, ADP closed the acquisition of Payroll S.A., headquartered in Chile with operations in Argentina and Peru. This is an important strategic transaction for Employer Services. The addition of Payroll S.A. significantly increases our presence in Latin America, where we already served more than 3,000 local and multinational clients from our offices in Brazil.","You may have noticed in today's press release in the About ADP section that we updated our client count. We now have more than 620,000 clients worldwide. This is a 5% increase from a year ago. I'm pleased that we are growing our client base, especially in the small business division of Employer Services, and believe this is in large part due to our focus on product innovation and providing stellar service to our clients.","And now before I turn the call over to Jan, I want to discuss the charge we took in the fourth quarter relating to the 2011 acquisition of AdvancedMD. This non-cash charge was a result of our annual goodwill impairment review. While ADP AdvancedMD has grown its revenues, our expectations for the future growth and profitability of this business are lower than previous estimates. Having said that, ADP AdvancedMD is well aligned with our strategic pillar to grow and deepen our solutions offering to ensure our key adjacencies are market leaders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jan to provide the financial highlights and a look at next year's forecast for our client funds investment strategy.","Jan Siegmund","Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Let's now turn to Slide 5. Total revenues grew 7% to $11.3 billion for the year. Employer Services grew total revenues 11%, the PEO group 11% and Dealer grew 9%. On an organic basis, total revenues grew 6%, with Employer Services growing 6% and Dealer Services growing 8%. The PEO revenue growth was 11%, all organic.","I'm pleased that ADP's organic revenue growth improved each quarter during the year. As Carlos noted, combined worldwide Employer Services and PEO Services new bookings growth of 11% was strong and beat our own expectations. Solid new bookings growth over 7 quarters now, along with the acquisitions we made in fiscal year '11 and '12 to complement our solution set and extend geographically, continued to positively impact revenue growth.","In Employer Services, revenue growth was broad based. We are pleased to have ended the year with strong client revenue retention of 91.3%, which improved 40 basis points from a year ago. Same-store pays per control Employer Services in the U.S. was strong with an increase of 2.8%. However, same-store pays per control continued to decline across Europe as anticipated, though at a lesser rate of decline than in previous 2 quarters.","The full year decline in Europe was just under 1%. And to remind you of the sensitivity on this metric, a 1% change in this metric across Europe has an impact of about $5 million to $6 million to annual revenues versus a 1% change in the U.S. pays per control of about $20 million annually.","Average client fund balances increased 7% for the year, driven by new client growth especially in small business services and increased pays per control. PEO revenue grew 11% for the year with 9% growth in the average number of worksite employees to about 277,000 worksite employees.","Moving on to Dealer Services. The automotive backdrop in the U.S. is quite healthy as is the Asian marketplace. Across Europe, however, we are seeing little sign of recovery in the automotive market.","Digital marketing continues to drive nearly 1\/2 of the revenue growth and the North American core business drove nearly 1\/2 as well. The North American core business benefited from continued strong transactional revenues, which are tied to auto sales volumes, which were good this year.","Overall, Dealer Services continues to execute well. We're effectively selling layered apps into our client base, retention is improving and we are gaining market share.","Now let's turn to Slide 6 and continue with the highlights for the year. As Carlos spoke earlier, this year's fourth quarter, we took a non-cash goodwill impairment charge. The charge was $43 million on both a pretax and after-tax basis. This represents $0.09 per share. You likely saw this charge, which is a separate line item on the statement of consolidated earnings and is reported with the other category in our business segment reporting.","Additionally, in last year's second fiscal quarter, we sold assets related to a third-party expense management platform that resulted in a pretax gain of $66 million, $41 million after-tax and $0.08 per share. As these are non-recurring items, we're excluding them for comparative purposes.","So although we have shown the year-over-year results, both including and excluding items -- these items on the slide, I'm going only to take you through the results excluding these items as detailed on the next slide. But before we move to Slide 7, I want to remind you that ADP has continued its shareholder-friendly action.","We repurchased 10.4 million ADP shares during the fiscal year for a total cost of $647 million and returned $806 million through dividend payments. And for your models, basic shares outstanding at June 30 are 483 million. Our cash and marketable securities position was strong at $2 billion at June 30, or $1.8 billion excluding assets related to outstanding reverse repurchase agreement and support of our extended investment strategy for the client funds portfolio in Canada. Repayment occurred on July 2.","Now let's turn to Slide 7. I know this is a busy chart, but we wanted to be transparent in what we present to you. As you see, we achieved a 7% revenue growth and on the adjusted basis, pretax earnings grew 4%. Net earnings grew 5% as we improved our effective tax rate and EPS grew 6% on fewer shares outstanding. The largest negative impact to our result, as Carlos stated earlier, is the continued impact from low interest rate.","ADP's revenue growth was muted at 4 percentage point due to the decline in client interest revenues that resulted from low interest rates, more than offsetting the benefit from the healthy 7% growth in balances for the year. This continues to be the most significant drag on ADP's earnings and margins as well, negatively impacting growth and pretax and net earnings and diluted earnings per share, 6 percentage points for the fourth quarter and 4 percentage points for the year.","As anticipated, the negative impact to the pretax margin was 120 basis points in the fourth quarter and 110 basis points this year. Excluding this impact, you can clearly see the leverage in ADP's business model is strong and intact.","Additionally, we had a small drag from unfavorable exchange rates, foreign exchange rates, as well as from loss revenue and earnings associated with the prior year's asset sale and the expirations of certain tax credit in our Tax Credit Services business. You can also see the impact from fiscal year 2012 acquisition here.","Before we turn to Slide 8, I want to let you know that the details of the fourth quarter results are included in the Appendix section of the slide presentation for your reference.","Now turning to Slide 8, I'll take you through the forecast on the client funds investment strategy in support of our overall ADP forecast, that Carlos will take you through in a few moments. Before I get into the details of the forecast, I would like to inform you that objectives of our investment strategy remain safety, liquidity and diversification.","At June 30, approximately 83% of our fixed income portfolio was invested in AAA and AA rated securities. We continue to base the interest rate assumptions in our forecast on the Fed Funds futures contracts and the forward yield curves for the 3.5- and 5-year government U.S. agencies, as we do not believe it is possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the yield curve or the new bond issuance behavior of corporations and other issuers.","I also remind you that our strategy usually results in 15% to 20% of investments maturing each year and are therefore subject to reinvestment risk each year. However, as you see from our quarterly SEC filings, we anticipate less than 10% of the investments will mature in fiscal year 2014, while the maturities in fiscal year '15 will be more in line with the 15% to 20% range.","Focusing now on the slide, you see a summary of the anticipated pretax earnings impact of the extended investment strategy for the client funds investment portfolio for fiscal year '14. We anticipate average client fund balances for fiscal year '14 in the range of $20 billion to $20.2 billion, which represents about 5% growth.","We anticipate a yield on the client fund portfolio of 1.8% to 1.9%, down 30 to 40 basis points from fiscal year 2013. We anticipate a year-over-year decline in client funds interest of $40 million to $50 million. And as you can see in the lower right of the chart in terms of the total pretax impact of the extended investment strategy, we anticipate a decline of $50 million to $60 million for the fiscal year 2014.","As anticipated, this forecast decline for fiscal year 2014 is lower than the $88 million decline in fiscal year 2013, which we had previously communicated as the bottom of the cycle in terms of the size of the year-over-year decline.","Now I'll turn it back to Carlos to take you through the remainder of the forecast for fiscal year 2014.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Jan. We're now on Slide 9. First, I'm going to take you through our fiscal '14 forecast for our reportable segments.","For Employer Services, we are forecasting revenue growth of about 7% with pretax margin expansion of 50 to 100 basis points. While client retention is at an all-time high, we always strive for incremental improvement each year. We anticipate an increase in our pays per control metric in the U.S. of 2% to 3%.","For PEO Services, we're forecasting 10% to 12% revenue growth with slight pretax margin expansion. We're forecasting 8% to 10% growth in the annual dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new business bookings from the $1.35 billion sold in fiscal '13. And for Dealer Services, we're forecasting about 8% revenue growth with about 100 basis points of pretax margin expansion.","Let's turn to Slide 10 for total company guidance. We anticipate total revenue growth of about 7%. We anticipate slight pretax margin improvements for total ADP from 18.8% last year, which excludes the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal '13. We expect the effective tax rate to be about flat with fiscal '13 effective tax rate of 33.9%.","We anticipate 8% to 10% growth in diluted earnings per share compared with $2.89 in fiscal '13, which again excluded the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal '13. As is our normal practice, no further share buybacks are contemplated in the forecast beyond anticipated dilution related to employee equity comp plans. So it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders depending, obviously, on market conditions.","Before we move on, I want to give you some perspective on our range of 8% to 10% earnings per share guidance. There are both opportunities and challenges that will impact ADP's ability to achieve either the high of the low end of the range in fiscal '14.","For example, typical things to think about as being impactful to earnings will include employment levels at our clients, our ability to implement the fourth quarter's strong new business bookings and our client retention levels. Additionally, the interest rate environment will impact our new purchase rates and foreign exchange rates could move either up or down. So this is early in the year and we provided you with a range that Jan and I believe has complicated both the opportunities and the challenges.","While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I want to give you some insights into the fiscal '14 year-over-year comparisons as they impact our total ADP guidance. Let's turn to Slide 11.","As Jan mentioned, we have previously communicated that we believe that fiscal 2013 represented the bottom of the cycle in terms of the size of the year-over-year decline in client funds interest revenues.","And as Jan just took you through on the forecast related to our client funds investment strategy, we are forecasting a decline of $50 million to $60 million for fiscal '14 compared with the $88 million decline in fiscal '13. As you read in this morning's press release, we anticipate that almost 1\/2 of this decline will occur in the first quarter fiscal '14.","As we continue through the year, while we do anticipate a year-over-year decline in each quarter, we expect a reduced negative impact to ADP's financial results each quarter as we progress through the year.","The forecasted decline for fiscal '14 translates to 0.5 percentage point drag on ADP revenue growth, with nearly a 4 percentage point negative impact in the first quarter alone. We anticipate a negative impact to their pretax margin for the full year of 70 to 80 basis points, with a drag of about 110 basis points in the first quarter.","Taking it down to EPS. The $50 million to $60 million anticipated decline in pretax earnings equates to a drag of $0.07 to $0.08 in earnings per share, with a drag of about $0.03 per share in the first quarter.","So to sum this up for you, the drag related to the client funds investment strategy does not significantly lessen until the fourth quarter of fiscal '14. As a result, for at least the first half of the year, we anticipate that earnings per share from continuing operations growth will be below the low end of our full year forecast range.","Now turning to Slide 12, I'd like to leave you with some closing remarks before we open it up for your questions. Overall, I'm very pleased with our results for fiscal '13. Our performance has been good. ADP's organic revenue growth improved throughout the year and each business segment achieved good revenue growth and drove strong pretax margin expansion.","We are keenly focused on our 4 strategic pillars for growth which are, number one, to grow our integrated suite of cloud-based HCM benefits and payroll solutions to serve the U.S. market. And we're executing on this pillar with RUN, Workforce Now and Vantage, which are all growing nicely. And we're pleased that our client migrations to RUN and Workforce Now are progressing quite well.","Number two, to invest and grow and to grow and scale our HR business processing solutions by leveraging our platforms and processes. The PEO and ADP resource serving small businesses, comprehensive services serving the mid-market and our comprehensive outsourcing services for large companies are all performing well.","Number three, to leverage of our global presence to offer clients HCM benefits and payroll solutions where they do business. We've been successful in executing against our multinational strategy for large companies with multi-country presence around the globe. And even though the economic environment across continental Europe is soft, we're growing our multinational offerings there. They have been successful in newer and growing markets, such as Latin America, India and China.","And four, grow and deepen our solutions offering to ensure our key adjacencies are market leaders. Dealer Services is our largest adjacency and as you heard, is performing quite well. And of course, we are also focused on delivering stellar service to our clients in creating an environment that fosters innovation, thereby, positioning ADP as the leading global Human Capital Management provider.","ADP also remains committed to shareholder-friendly actions and returned nearly $1.5 billion in excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during fiscal '13.","We have a good step off heading into fiscal '14, though there are reasons to be somewhat cautious. The continued low-market interest rates, coupled with historically low amounts of maturities in our client funds portfolio in fiscal 2014, results in diminished reinvestment opportunities. The economic indicators remain mixed in the U.S. and the economic backdrop in Continental Europe is still soft.","I am also pleased that ADP continues to be rated AAA by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's, reflecting the strength of our business model and of our balance sheet. And finally, I believe we're doing the right things to grow the business and to enhance long-term shareholder value.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We would take our first question from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Nice to see the better-than-expected ES global bookings growth in the quarter. Could you give a little more granularity on growth by small business majors and nationals. And in particular, if you could quantify the number of new clients you've signed for Vantage, HCM, both in the June quarter and since the product was made available for general release.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think Jan probably can give you specifics on the numbers on Vantage. Just in terms of -- I'll make a couple of general comments that really the growth for the quarter was really strong across the board. So we typically don't get into specific percentages by business unit, but it was well into the double digits for each of the segments that you mentioned and some of them actually got into the high-double digits. So it was really an impressive performance in the quarter. And really, across the year, we had very good performance across all the segments as well. So I can't tell you how pleased we are because, as we've mentioned many times before, for us to be able to lift the organic revenue growth of our business, given that it's a recurring revenue business, there's really no other way to do it other than to drive multiple years of double-digit new bookings growth, while at the same time, either holding onto or slightly improving our client retention, which we did this year. So this is a very important part of our acceleration of our organic growth and we're very pleased with the results in the fourth quarter. And Jan probably has the numbers on Vantage.","Jan Siegmund","Yes. David, the rollout of Vantage continues to accelerate. And not only did we sell more client than we ever sold per quarter in our short history of Vantage, but we also got a large number of clients live and generating revenues, which is both good news on both sides. So I want to start to talk a little bit more about our annual impact that we have. So this quarter, I think we sold a little bit short of 20 new units for approximately 50 units for this fiscal year, slightly ahead of our original plan. So performance of Vantage continues to be good. And as you asked for client growth by segment, I think we can also give information that in the downmarket segment and our small segment, really driven by the success of RUN, the client growth was above the average that we just gave you for the 5% total ADP. We achieved a new record there also because we sold really more than 100,000 RUN units this year, which is a great milestone to achieve.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Good to hear. And just a quick follow-up. Could you provide the gross price increase you put through in Employer Services at the beginning of FY '14? And if you could give us a sense of how much is sticking or what you're seeing in terms of the net price increase?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I'm going to let Jan answer that question, but I was just looking at my numbers and I just want to clarify that, for the quarter, we did have, in the upmarket, was slightly below double digit. So I want to make sure that I got my facts right. For the year, the upmarket actually grew in the low-20s, so still incredibly pleased with the year. And the comparable for the quarter, last year, they had very, very high growth, which I can't -- I won't even say what it was, they had a very, very difficult comparable. I just want to make sure that I got my facts straight. So Jan, if you want to, on the price increase.","Jan Siegmund","On the price increase. Yes, David, what we like to talk about is the net impact on revenues for our price increase. And I think we had talked in the past about approximately 1% of our revenue growth was driven by price increases. And we anticipate to continue with our balanced pricing strategy maximizing the value for the business in the long term, while reaping the pricing opportunities that we see in the market for this year. So you should not expect a change in our pricing philosophy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to talk about the fiscal '14 guidance assumption of having 8% to 10% bookings growth, plus 2% to 3% pays per control growth. Those are pretty strong guidance assumptions, especially on top of the performance you put up on the bookings front in fiscal '13. So my question is, can you give us some insight into the underlying factors that give you confidence in the guidance assumptions for bookings and pays per control in fiscal '14? On bookings growth, can you give us any insight into how much of the bookings growth will come from a sales force increase versus sales productivity increase and to what extent you're assuming better progress on small business formation?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","A great question. And I'll start just by talking a little bit about on the last point that you just made, which is an incredibly important one to us for a number of reasons, so the issue of around how much of the improvement in '13 and forecasted for '14 comes from productivity versus headcount growth. As you can imagine, it gives us tremendous operating leverage in our business model if that we can accelerate our new bookings growth, while we are getting better productivity out of the sales force. In other words, we don't have to add as much headcount growth as we get growth in new bookings, it's a very powerful lever for us in terms of our business model. And that's what we've done over the last couple of years. In fiscal '13, more than half of our growth came from productivity improvements versus headcount growth. For next year, for fiscal '14, and the way we typically plan our years is to have about half of the growth coming from productivity and half from headcount growth. And as you can see, we exceeded that target this year in '13. So that's really how we plan our sales force headcount and our productivity. In terms of how we get that productivity, besides really having excellent execution in providing hopefully better tools and helping our sales force be more productive, hiring the right people, et cetera, all those things, the other thing that we think we're doing is we're providing them great products for them to be able to win in the marketplace and win more often. And so the strategy that we have of focusing more on innovation and on product, I think is related to trying to drive sales force productivity because it is an important lever in the overall P&L for ADP to drive some reasonable level of productivity as we try to grow that new bookings number. In terms of our confidence for next year, it's a great question. As we finished the year as strong as we did, as you can probably imagine, we had to adjust some of our plans internally in order to be to able maintain that 8% to 10% forecast that we're committed to, which made it even more difficult for folks in the field because the strong finish really creates a need to sell even more in the following year. But our confidence is really related to the years that we've had, over the last 2 or 3 years, of being able to execute around that half productivity and half headcount growth and really achieving the numbers that you've seen we've been able to achieve over the last couple of years. So there's no question that it gets harder as you go forward and you continue to execute well, but that's really our job, is to continue to march forward and deliver those kinds of results so that we can continue to lift that organic growth. I will add that, when we have these kinds of strong finishes in the fourth quarter, which we have a number of levers and place to drive, so we have a lot of incentives to drive sales force results, particularly toward the end of a fiscal year, we do have sometimes end up starting soft at the beginning of the following quarter. So if you look at our history, we have had some soft first quarters after -- following up on 1.25 years like the one that we just had. So we're still very confident based on what we're seeing in terms of our products and our headcount plans and our historical productivity improvements that we will achieve the full year result. But my sense would be that we will get off to a slow start here in July.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. That's very helpful color. Can you specify, I mean, it sounds like you adjusted your plan given the tough comparison in order to maintain the 8% to 10% number. What adjustments were made to the plan? I mean, did you decide to add more to the sales force or invest more in sales productivity tools?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We decided to add more to the sales force.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And will that be, what, around 5% growth in sales force or maybe more than that?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","That's correct. You should plan on or expect somewhere around 4% to 5% headcount growth.","Jan Siegmund","Rod, if I follow-up on your questions on pays per control. The number that we're forecasting with 2% to 3%, of course, is similar to our past performance. It's faster than the U.S. economy is growing as you know from our national employment report, but the job market is quite solid and our clients have been hiring faster than that and we have seen that trend to be very stable. Just as a reminder, a sensitivity of that 1% more or less in pays per control will have a revenue impact of annualized $20 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Thomas with Goldman Sachs.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Last year, you talked about client fund interest potentially being down $35 million to $45 million in FY '14 and you're guiding for a decline a bit wider than that. Is there any conservatism built in your expectations for that guidance? I would have thought interest rate trends sort of made a -- indicated a little narrower decline this year?","Jan Siegmund","Yes. So the forecast is really based on the most recent forecast that you can draw from the forward yield curves of the U.S. government agencies. And we have this low-maturity issue that we alluded in the beginning of the call. It is really only 8% of our client fund balances that are available for reinvestments throughout the year '13. So we benefit from the higher long-term rates, really, only for those securities that mature, plus the growth in the client fund balances. And the impact is really very mathematical. So we don't really -- we don't even make a big adjustments to it. Also, the embedded rate that is maturing is around 4%, so there's still a steep decline of the maturing rates that we see. So all together, gives you really -- we try to be very transparent about these assumptions. There's really not a particular conservatism that is built in.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the competitive environment, can you update us there with record retention rates. Where do you see the most risk for arising competition?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, the -- just to be clear, in terms of the retention improvement, also, was really across the board. We had softness in a subsegment of one of our segments, a very small business and we really had great retention across the board. So what do we attribute it? I think, in part, to better competitive position, but there's just a lot of people doing a lot of great things around client service. I mean, this is -- our culture besides this strong focus we have on new business bookings to help grow our business organically, we have an equal focus on client retention. Because any slippage in client retention makes it harder and harder to grow organically, despite whatever number we get on new business bookings because, obviously, we're losing it out the bottom, it's hard to replace it on the top. And so we have a lot of work being done by literally thousands of associates and leaders trying to provide stellar service to our clients so that they stay with us longer and longer and that's exactly what we've been able to do. And I think it's a cultural issue across all of ADP and it's been around for decades. And I think we're just -- happen to be executing really well over the last couple of years. And there is some bumpiness in that number. As you recall, last year's fourth quarter, we had a couple of large losses in our upmarket related to mergers and other factors. And as we expected that kind of bounce back, so that does make fourth quarter comparable, I think, relatively easy. But having said that, when you look at the full year results, the 40 basis point improvement and the fact that it's really across the board in all of the segments, is incredibly pleasing. And I think -- I wish there were a simple answer as to what we've done to be able to accomplish that, but it's a number of different things. I think the product strength helps. The fact that we're migrating clients I think, believe it or not, helps even though in the short term, it is hard because sometimes trying to get clients to migrate, in theory, creates some risk. But what we've seen so far in our key products is that we really have probably strengthened our position versus the competition by taking our client off of some of our older legacy platform. So that's probably helping us a little bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Carlos, I wonder if you could just expand on that last question. And specifically, as it relates to mid-market, can you talk a little bit about how you view how your market share is trending in the mid-market, the timing of the upgrade of the installed base with the new version of Workforce Now? And what changes, if any, you're making within the sales approach to drive attached rates and higher revenue per client?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We had a meeting a couple of weeks ago with a number of constituents from sales and service and other parts of organization to actually talk about our competitive position in the mid-market. I think the way I would summarize the discussion is that, we feel quite comfortable about our competitiveness on both the product, the pricing, the breadth on a number of fronts in the mid-market. So we feel very, very comfortable from a selling standpoint that we are well positioned and that we -- and this is, again, coming from our sales force. It doesn't mean, by the way, that it isn't hard to get the business, but I think they feel that we've positioned them well and positioned ourselves well to be able to win in the marketplace. I think that on the existing base, the installed base which we are, as you mentioned, slowly migrating, our goal is to make the pond that our competition fishes in, smaller and smaller. And I think we're doing that and we've made a lot of progress over the last couple of years. So our view is that, once we transition all of those clients on to our newer strategic platforms, that our competitive position will be much stronger and will put us in a position to, hopefully, be able to grow and gain market share in the mid-market, where it has, admittedly, been tough for us against the competition over the last few years.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So I think when we last spoke, if I'm remembering right, you talked about the end of next fiscal year to fully upgraded the installed base. Is that still a good targets? Could you perhaps do it a little sooner or do you think you're maybe trending a little bit slower than that?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So the -- at that same meeting, that topic also came up, brought up by myself, because it's an important topic for me. And I received some very good news that they had made a good deal of progress in being able to accelerate, I think, our plans. But I think that timing that you just mentioned, I think, is still what our plan is. But I feel more, I guess, more positive, more confident, more optimistic than I have in the last few quarters that we're actually going to get that done. And again, in our world, I would love to have it happened overnight, but that would be irresponsible and not practical. And if the timing that we have now we actually execute on, we're going to be extremely happy. And I think our competitors maybe extremely unhappy.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","All right. Great. And if I could just stick one thing in on the rates. I mean, I think I understand your commentary about the trend during the year. So if rates -- if the current yield curve stay where they are, does that imply that we'll still have a headwind in fiscal '15 or do things flatten out pretty much as we get into fiscal '15, particularly given that you've got the churn on the portfolio increasing next year?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","If I can give you just a couple of -- first, I just want to say that, with the position we're in now is, I would describe it as we see the light at the end of the tunnel with regards to interest rates and it's no longer a train. It has been a tough couple of years as we were kind of facing what was coming down the pike for us, which was -- this last year that we just passed, which was very difficult in terms of the size of the drag. So the fact that the organization was able to drive the kind of margin improvement to almost overcome the entire drag was really quite impressive, but it was very, very difficult headwind. So really the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, the first quarter of this fiscal year, as we've said multiple times in our speaking notes here, is really kind of the last quarter where we have, what I would call a really an enormous headwind from a P&L standpoint. And that headwind does get smaller as the year progresses. To put it in perspective, this year we have -- and this is again in our, I think, publicly available documents where we have provided a slide, that shows for each year how much of our portfolio was maturing and what the embedded yield is of those maturities. And just to put it in perspective, I believe that for '14, we have around $1.5 billion in maturities with an embedded yield of around 4%, 4.1%. For '15, we have $3.5 billion in maturities and an embedded yield of 2.7%. And then for '16, we have a $4.5 billion in maturities and a 2% embedded yield. So I think you can probably do some of the math yourself and you could probably come to the conclusion that '15 is probably, assuming things stay as they are today, will be a year where we might see some actual positive lift, if not flat it's probably positive. Clearly, we don't give guidance this far in advance, but I'm just running you through numbers that we've already provided publicly, where people should be able to do the math themselves. So I don't know if Jan has something he wants to add.","Jan Siegmund","Yes. Like if I do the math for you and you assume that our balances continue to grow at a pace that is in line with our current guidance and the yield curve doesn't move materially, I think about a flattish impact on the client fund strategy on our bottom line is not a bad assumption in '15.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Foresi with Janney Montgomery.","Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","This is Jeff Rossetti in for Joe. Just wanted to see if you could give some more detail around the migration of platforms and its impact on your retention rate and how you view your retention rate with respect to your FY '14 guidance?","Jan Siegmund","Yes. We made good progress on our migrations and we moved significantly more than 10,000 clients in Workforce -- on to our Workforce Now platform in the mid-market, so good progress. We have approximately 20,000 clients to go. So you can see at this rate, in how they multiply with potential movement and progress and productivity, how our forecast for migration is evolving. We continue to be very pleased with the client satisfaction during those migrations and the retention impact, if anything, is slightly positive for these clients. And we have slight revenue uptick in mid-market by clients, buying as they migrate to a broader solution, buying more bundle. So that's an all-good story in the mid-market. The similar thing we can report for RUN at EasyPay, which is our legacy platform, EasyPay, in the down market, we moved about 25,000 clients, we're making very good progress and both categories exceeding our own internal plans. So we feel comfortable of our own migrations and there's really no measurable impact. If any, a slight positive impact on retention rates. But really, probably for planning purposes, no impact is a good assumption.","Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just regarding the Affordable Care Act, just wanted to see if there was any update on developing products for reporting requirements?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes. We've got a lot of people working on solutions to help our -- I mean, this is really right in ADP's sweet spot, is helping clients with compliance challenges. And Affordable Care Act is quite a challenge, right, from a reporting and compliance standpoint. So we have a number of initiatives underway. Probably not enough time to get into them today, but we'll certainly provide more information as we go along. But we expect this to be a big event for our clients and the employees of our clients. And we expect to be there to help them through it and to provide them help and assistance. And I think our plan is to not only provide specific solutions around the Affordable Care Act, i.e. reporting tools and compliance solutions, but our plan is really to try to market much more strongly our integrated HCM platform solutions that really are almost central to being able to comply with the new Affordable Care Act regulations. Because we really need time and attendance systems that are connected to payroll systems that are connected to benefit administration systems in order to be able to effectively and smoothly get the information you need to be able to comply. And so I think it presents an opportunity, not just for us, in the short term to provide reporting tools and compliance solutions for the Act itself, but also presents a real opportunity for us to help our clients with our fully bundled, integrated HCM solution, which I think are really the key to being able to keep up with all these regulations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First, just a follow-up on the question about ACA. I think it's probably too small, but did the delay of health care reform implementation by a year have a negative impact on your expectations for fiscal '14 at all?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that -- clearly, there was a lot of discussion in the press about the delay. Just to be clear, that is only one aspect. And it's clearly one that's important and gets a lot of attention, but it is only one aspect. So it's not like the entire law was delayed by a year. I know you know that, but some people in the press may not have been completely clear on the kind of the fact that there are numerous other compliance requirements and regulations that still are going to go forward and be enacted at the beginning of the new calendar year. As to the delay itself, in terms of our business plans, we see it as kind of a wash in terms of negatives and positives because it really does give us more time to communicate and talk to our clients about a fully integrated HCM solution, both in our mid-market and also in the upmarket. So I think it gives us more time to get to clients and to be able to move them on, either existing ones or new ones, on to this HCM-integrated solutions. So at the same time, it does provide more time for the competition to get ready and it provides more time for clients to make decisions. And so net-net, it's probably -- in our view, we haven't seen any negative repercussions yet in our business as a result of the delay, but there's probably positives and negatives as a result of the delay.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then, separately, another -- or kind of a little bit past midyear and the macro environment in the U.S. is probably feeling a bit better than businesses would have expected headed into the year. Can you talk about whether or not you're seeing any changes in client decision-making processes? Are they speeding up their decisions and is that reflected in the stronger bookings?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think it's a great question and I wish we had a scientific answer to that. I think we've -- over the last couple of years, we typically give you anecdotal stories around that topic, right? When we hear, for example, when we had the fiscal cliff issues, we think that there were -- we were hearing anecdotal stories that there were people kind of waiting to see what was going to happen with the resolution of the fiscal cliff. And so we don't have any scientific evidence one way or the other. What we do have is our results. And if you look at it historically, at our new bookings and how they relate to the economy and you look at it kind of in a rearview mirror, it does get harder in a more difficult economy to sell. It helps a lot to have great products, to have a great sales force and execute well, but it does get a little harder. So I have to believe that some of the strength of our new bookings is as a result of some better decision-making environment out in the economy, both in the U.S. and also outside of the U.S. But we really don't have any specific thing that we could point to, to give you evidence about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, I keep hoping that Europe will start to turn and it still sound soft. So I guess I'm hoping for some green shoots you could talk about on the European outlook.","Jan Siegmund","Okay. Ever so slightly, Bryan, our pays per control declines softened in the fourth quarter, probably too small for statistically significance but we do see it. And as we -- in our last quarterly call, I think, talked about Europe being weak on the new sales side. We did see Europe coming back in the fourth quarter and we had a particular success with European multinational deal. So in all our reporting about Europe being economically weak, in this quarter we did have some good results. I wouldn't make a full long-term story out of it, but at least for this quarter, we saw some signs of improvement for it. I mean, you'll see the unemployment numbers and the economic news out of Europe, so we see the same thing. So we are cautious about Europe for the next fiscal year.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then overall guidance, I know client growth was up 5%, pricing was about up about 1 point or so. Are those similar metrics that are in the guidance? And is there a way to think about it more on a longer-term basis? Are those about the right numbers or do you expect the economy to rally and new business starts to get better that we could even see better numbers in those?","Jan Siegmund","Well, our 5% client growth is an excellent number for our size of the company. I would caution you that the client number and the revenue number are asymmetrical in our client base, so we have a large number of clients in our small markets. So 5% client growth does not equate to 5% revenue growth at all, really. But the strength in our downmarket with the client growth even ahead of the 5% is a strong indicator of our strength in downmarket. You saw the PEO growing very nicely, also rebounding in sales. So in the downmarket, we see really good momentum in the business, which is exciting. And then as we roll out these platforms in the upmarket, we feel -- I mean, you'll see it reflected in our sales growth number that we're forecasting, kind of good about that going forward. I don't know if -- we don't forecast, really, we don't guide to the client count number, but it's also a number that has been moving fairly steadily. So I think you almost don't need our guidance for that.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Last question, if I can just sneak it in. On the strong bookings growth, just remind us how that translates into revenue growth. I mean, there's a slight lag there, but I just want to make sure I know the moving pieces.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that's a good question. I think Jan was just kind of alluding to the fact that some of our strength, even though it was across the board, some of our strength in the fourth quarter really was around very large upmarket domestic and multinational clients. Some of those clients won't start, literally, for a year. Having said that, we had really good strong growth for the quarter and for the year across all of our other segments and that will continue to push up our organic growth rate. And so the model is probably using kind of a half-year convention. The real challenge for our business model, which is also an incredible positive, is that it is a recurring revenue model. So when you do the math and use half-year convention, so you take half of last year's sales and they turn into revenue this year and half of the following year sales and turn them into revenue for that year, and you sprinkle in retention and you sprinkle in price increase and all the other things that we talked about, driving up that organic growth rate is not easy because you have this large recurring revenue base. But that's also a wonderful thing because every year, we're starting with 91.3% of the revenue that we had in the prior year. But if you kind of do the math that I do a lot, you'll start to figure out that, to move our organic growth rate up 0.5 to 1 percentage point requires multiple years of double-digit sales growth, which is exactly what we've had, and good client retention. So I think what you need to think about in terms of from a -- when you add all that stuff together, is that in an environment like we're in now where we're really executing on just about every front, it's really, call it 0.5 point to 1 point of organic growth. And there's, obviously, a lot of other stuff in the mix, FX, acquisitions and whatnot, but that's really the core of our business and that's the core job that Jan and I have, which is to move that number up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to start with a question on the fiscal '14 revenue growth forecast for Employer Services. And can you break that apart into core payroll versus ancillaries? And also, give us a sense whether there's any meaningful amount of acquisition revenue in that ES number? I know you did the deal in Lat-Am, but not sure how big that is.","Jan Siegmund","Yes. Jason, I'll take the last question first. Really, this is a good organic number that you see this year. We're entering the year with virtually no impact on acquisitions on our revenue number. We stopped reporting the breakout between payroll and non-payroll payroll a while ago. And it's really a consequence of how we sell our product. We sell it really now as an integrated bundle and we started reporting, really, more on the progress we're making with our core strategic platform. So I don't think the payroll number versus non-payroll number is that meaningful. I would allocate revenues in a way that would make it really not that insightful for everybody to do it. And as a matter of fact, we don't quite do it internally either anymore. So we're focusing on our core strategic platforms. And when you hear us talking about the progress we're making with Workforce Now, Vantage and RUN, those are, I think, also our internal key metrics that we watch for our success.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. Understood. And just to follow-up, I know you were asked the question around market share in the mid-market earlier, but I wanted to focus on the small business side. I know you indicated that the client growth in small business was actually greater than the 5%, which was the corporate average. So -- then that's quite a bit more small business client growth than your biggest competitor in that space is seeing, which certainly seem to point to some market share gains. And obviously, you've talked about RUN and the past, but maybe you can just talk about feedback that you actually get on the ground from the sales force, qualitative or quantitative, to support the fact that those market share gains are in fact occurring, if, in fact, you agree with that statement?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Just one clarification, I don't think that we said that small business market actually grew more than the 5% and that the 5% was the corporate average. So even though the corporate average is 5%, I think what Jan was really saying was that, just because of the skewing of our business, the majority of our clients, not the majority of our revenues, but the majority of our clients are in the small business segments. We have about 400,000 clients in the low end of the market. So from a growth rate standpoint, which again is not necessarily tied to revenue, I think Jan was clear on that, most of the 5% growth actually took place in the low end of the market. So having said all that, that's outstanding growth. And we believe that it's faster than the market and faster than a number of our competitors. So we're very confident that we are gaining market share just from the facts and the math. In terms of anecdotal evidence from the sales force, we do see, both on the retention and on the new business sales side, good evidence that our folks are executing well, both on the product side. In other words, they're putting a market -- a product out in the market that is resonating and helping us sell new business and new units and is also helping us to hold on to the clients that we already do have. And so we have a number of, I think, pieces of evidence that point to, I think, really good strength competitively in the low end of our business.","Jan Siegmund","I think there is the element of our product, but we also have a unique 24\/7 service offering that finds great response in our client base. We have a fantastic set of supplemental products and our attach rates are rising actually nicely and across the board, contributing to good revenue growth in the small segment. So the combination we have great success with the channels, our channel partners are pleased with the future functionality that the product set offers in the SBS market, all these factors together give you the momentum that we have been seeing. And that has been really going on for, now, a couple, few years, so it's not really a recent change. That momentum continued in this quarter.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And I think that just one other thing on small business in terms of the migrations. I think we put out a press release, I believe, when we reached 200,000 clients on RUN. So clearly now we're at...","Jan Siegmund","253,000.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","253,000. And so our clients on EasyPay are down, as you can imagine. If we have 400,000 and we have 250,000 on RUN, you can probably do the math. So we are -- even though Jan said that we've moved 25,000 clients this year from EasyPay on to RUN, the pace at which we're moving those clients now is much faster than that, so it's been an accelerating trend. And so we have some belief that we might be able to get off of EasyPay within the next 18 months. And the momentum that, that is going to -- is creating already for that business and it's going to create, down the road in terms of both retention and just new business sales, because having the entire energy and focus of that organization be on our strategic platform, one that's versionless, one that's cloud-based, is going to be enormously powerful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I know it's late, I'll just ask one. In terms of -- I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but you mentioned in your remarks about the, I guess, the rate of change and the decline of interest income getting less worse throughout the year and maybe some potential softness early on because you had such a strong fourth quarter. Is there anything else we need to know on a quarterly basis when we're doing our modeling?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think you got it. But I think it's not just the first quarter, I think the first half. I would -- even though we don't give quarterly guidance, I think it's good to think about the first half, particularly in the first quarter, being well below the guidance that we're giving for the full year in terms of the EPS growth. And think about the headwind of, for example, just interest. Because we plan to continue to run our business and execute in terms of the core businesses, which really doesn't vary that much quarterly just because of the nature of the business, but for your model, it is important to understand this interest rate drag. And it is probably in the first quarter in line, in terms of amount, with what it was on a quarterly basis during fiscal '13 and then begins to abate. And I would say that, by the fourth quarter, the abatement is significant, would be a good way to describe it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim MacDonald with First Analysis.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Just a question on ES growth this quarter was up to 8% organic then you have a dropping down to 7%. Was there something unusual that impacted that number?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","No. I think it's probably seasonality or there may have been a little bit of something that happened around -- I guess that excludes FX for this segment. But no, there's nothing meaningful. I mean, I think that the -- we still see acceleration for the full year versus what we had for the full year this year. So there may be some noise in the quarter that we would have to, again, look a little bit deeper into, but there's no secret there underneath. It's still an acceleration for the year in '14 versus '13 in terms of organic growth. And some of that is as a result, obviously, of a couple of softer quarters at the beginning of the year in '13.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And just quickly, one more ACA question. Anything you're doing differently on the PEO to deal with the ACA?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, again, that's another one where it's probably -- there's probably pluses and minuses because the formation of additional dual options in terms of the exchanges could provide competition for the PEO. But as you saw from our sales results, it's also kind of causing people to look for alternatives. So I don't think that everyone is going to go to an exchange and not everyone will stay where they are. But what it's certainly doing is it's creating activity. So it's creating an opportunity for our sales force to have a discussion with people in the marketplace about what their goals are and really help them find the best solution for them. And that's a good thing. So I think anything that creates activity and opportunity and opening is usually a good thing. So we're seeing some of that. But having said that, could there be some clients, particularly in the small business market, in the PEO, where a delay for a year of the requirement for employers to provide health care, that may delay some of the decision-making. For large clients, these decisions have to be made well in advance of any kind of execution of the decision. So I think the extra time is probably net positive for us in the upmarket. Whereas, I think in a place like the PEO, you could see someone who was potentially planning to move to the PEO or to make some other change to say, \"Well, now I have a little bit more time, I think I'll just wait another quarter.\" That's obviously not what we're encouraging to do, but that's obviously a possibility.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to circle back on the client migrations and the good progress you're making there. Can you maybe ballpark for us what client migration costs or how client migration costs compare in 2014 or in 2013 versus 2012? And maybe kind of your outlook for migration costs perhaps coming down in 2015 from the 2014 level?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So I don't know that we can talk about 2015 just yet. But our '14 plan, obviously, have migration costs included. And what's really, again, very satisfying and very pleasing about the performance of the organization, is that we're able to drive the kind of margin improvement when you really normalize for the interest rate drag. We had really great margin improvement at the segment level and you'll see that in our segment results. And there are migration costs embedded in those results. And so the fact that the organization is, basically, overcoming at the segment level those migration costs and making the progress that they're making is, obviously, a sign that there is no -- and I think we've told you this in the last couple of years and as we kind of focus on this issue of migration, there are clearly additional expenses and additional costs. And we certainly hear that from our folks in the field, but we weren't expecting and aren't expecting to have some big announcement that we have some tens of millions of dollar extra expense that we are putting into our run rate. We are a highly disciplined organization and we're finding a way to get this done within the resources that we have by trying to focus less on other things and more on the migration. And so there really -- I wish I could give you, to make it more exciting, big news there, but what you see is what you get. And you're going to see more of it in '14.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question for me. Can you give us an update on GlobalView? I think that was slated to achieve profitability or at least hit breakeven here in the fourth quarter. Did that happen? And kind of how the sales outlook for it?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes. It did occur in the fourth quarter and it had a great fourth quarter in terms of sales. As you know, as I just mentioned a few minutes ago, for those sales converting to revenue takes a while, particularly in GlobalView. These are large complex multinational implementation that take a while. But we had kind of over 20% revenue growth for the year. We have now almost 1.5 million paid employees, which is up more than 20% for the business. We have over 100 clients, 110 clients as of the end of the year, so we feel pretty good. And I think, in fairness, we look at our multinational business as a combination of GlobalView and streamline, both of which are performing very, very well. And now we have those under one umbrella as we've kind of change our organizational structure. And we really believe that, that's going to drive I think even more effective selling, if you will, and also client relations by having all of our multinational solutions under one umbrella. And the combination of GlobalView and streamline, the growth rate looks even more positive. And that's over the next couple of years going to be $0.5 billion business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","One short one, I guess, it's just on PEO. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what's changed versus early in the year when you said you had a little softer trend? Is it the market or is it something different in terms of how you approached the business?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think it's probably a combination of things including great sales leadership. It's really one of the more remarkable turnarounds that I've seen in a long time in ADP. We had a couple of others, by the way, in the quarter that did really remarkably well, as well, having had a tough beginning to the year. But really, the PEO was a standout in terms of the turnaround, in terms of their sales performance. So again, I attribute it to good execution and good cooperation. As we exited the first half of the year, our sales leaders in the PEO, but also in our other major segments who feed a great deal of leads to the PEO, gathered together and figured out how they were going to fix this problem and they fixed it. And we really, dramatically, increased the number of leads to the PEO in the second half and the PEO was able to close on those and execute well.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So was the number of leads going into there was -- I guess, if there's a \"problem\" with it? Was that early in the year?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I wouldn't call it a problem. I think that we just noticed that there was a -- we have a lot of products and we have a lot of opportunities in the marketplace. And keeping our sales force focused and having the right incentive is very, very important. And so there was really no problem. We just, I think, sat down and our sales leaders and Ed Flynn, who runs our sales organization, made some great moves that, obviously, worked in terms of making sure that those incentives were properly aligned.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Yes. My questions have been asked and answered.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was wondering what's embedded in your plan with regards to client retention. It's obviously at record levels, you've done a great job there. How much more upside do you think is possible?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, as you probably know, we have to -- we kind of put our plan together before the year actually finishes. And so our budget for '14 was -- we started it 2 or 3 months ago and we finalized it before we knew what our client retention rates were going to be for the year. So we almost never plan for flat client retention, but I must say that this is one of those situations where it's very, very difficult for us to go and change everything, especially when, as you said, it's at record levels. And so I think that we would hope that we get some improvement here again, but right now as it stands it would be flat, flattish client retention from year-to-year. Which, again, I have to say -- I won't say that I'd be happy with that because I think we would love to have some improvement, but...","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","It seems like you should be able to get some improvement with regards to the continued migration. And then you've continued to improve your service support, as well, so...","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think there's a -- to be clear, there's a difference between hope and desire and incentives versus what we plan for financially. So I think that it's prudent and correct to plan for flattish client retention, but that is not our ambition.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I hear you. And then with regards to Vantage, what would your expectations be in terms of that's earlier in terms of roll out? How should we think about that over the next couple of years?","Jan Siegmund","Well, maybe, a rough indicator for the national accounts base is, we fell -- it varies a little bit, but we fell between 100 and 200 new deals each year in the national accounts space. And you'll see us, hopefully, continue with the acceleration of growth of Vantage deals. So it gives you kind of a little bit of perspective relative to the number of deals that we had this year to where we want to get it. Obviously, Vantage is an important product and we kind of want to make a big involvement to the national accounts base.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then, lastly, when I think about all your logical competitors across your various subsegments, and you don't have to elaborate on who those are, it seems like they're all seeing some improvement. When we think about, broadly speaking, your new sales growth, who is that coming from, or is it that there is just a greater level of implementation, particularly with regards to attached rates in certain areas where, for example, you switched somebody over to Workforce Now and maybe they were only doing a few modules and now they have expanded the number of modules. Can you just help us think conceptually the sources of growth?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes. We can give you some color. We're such a broad-based competitor that it really isn't as simple as 1 or 2 competitors. In some ways, it would be nice if it were that...","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","No. I'm aware of all your competitors, at least within domestic, the domestic market across your segments, so...","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Let me pick on -- so I'll pick one, happened to be studying that topic a couple of nights ago. And if you look in the mid-market, we made some really good progress against the competition in terms of some of what we call our regional competitors that you're, I'm sure, are quite aware of. I also look at our national account competitors, so in the upmarket, and saw very little discernible pattern in terms of, all of a sudden, one competitor is doing incredibly better than us or another one doing incredibly worse. So it really is just kind of just methodical improvement across the board and it's really a mixed picture. I mean, particularly in that upmarket segment, we have ERP competitors, as well as the 1 or 2 kind of cloud-based competitors that you're aware of. And I think we're pleased with what is happening competitively in that market, as we are in major accounts and as we are in the low end of our market. And I wish I could tell you there's one specific competitor or one company that we could point to that's making the difference. But I can tell you that the improvement is there and it is more -- across the board is not the right word because it is mix: some better; some worse. I have multiple years of data that show what's happened with our losses and what's happened with our new starts against each competitor. But overall, it's been an improvement in each of the 3 segments. And so, very, very pleased with that. We have to say, having said all that, that in the low end of the market is probably where we had the most visible success.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'll mix it up and just ask about Dealer. That came in ahead of our plan, looks like a strong organic growth. How much of that is market share gain versus underlying growth? Just trying to better gauge that plus the visibility into the 8% this year with what's driving that?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, it did have continued market share gains. That's a business that tracks very carefully their win\/loss ratio and the market share and they're kind of in the 2 to 1 ratio of wins to losses. And so we're very pleased with that. And they kind of edge their market share up in their core North American business. I think the digital marketing business also performed very well this year. So again, you see the results. I mean, that is an adjacency that is clearly accretive to ADP's growth and success right now. So really good performance on the revenue side and also on the margin side. And again, they're doing some of the same things that we're talking about in Employer Services. So a very, very big focus on product innovation there and integration of their own products within the Dealer management suite. And I think they're just, again, executing well, have made some good investments and good changes on the product development side. And I think that they are winning in the market place.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The 8% visibility there, Carlos, is high, I guess, not assuming anything unusual on SARs, it's more just backlog conversion, et cetera?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think you -- I think some of it is -- I think we have pretty good visibility in that business as we do in Employer Services. But I think you're right that if there was a major change in the backdrop, you'd want to probably re-think that. But we don't see any, I mean the SARs rate is around $15 million plus and the forecast is for even more strength there. I think that the market in Europe has been weak, but probably hard to imagine it's now bottoming or at least close to a bottom there. So I think we feel pretty good about the forecast on Dealer.","Jan Siegmund","One more thing that you may want to include in your thinking is the strength that we have in digital marketing growth that has been accelerating the average. And so that is clearly our highest grower in that portfolio of businesses and it continues to drive. And I think we feel good about that expansion to the overall 8%.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you update us on how big that is now?","Jan Siegmund","The digital marketing business on the revenue side, approximately $400 million.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So it's gotten quite large. Okay. So it matched well to your Analyst Day. Sticking with the Analyst Day and I'll jump off. Just I'm thinking in the past at analysts events, investor conferences, you had talked about the mix of revenues across ES, right, small, majors, nationals, internationals, since the fiscal year just ended. Can you give us some rough sense of what the contribution from each bucket was for the year?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","No.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, thank you. Thank you very much for joining us today. As you can tell, we're very pleased with our fiscal '13 results. I really think the business is performing well and, as you heard, we're growing our client base.","I also want to thank each and every one of our 60,000 associates worldwide for helping us to deliver the sales and retention results that we delivered this year. It really was an amazing performance and it takes every single one of those 60,000, whether in the field delivering the service or making the sale, everyone else who's behind the scenes supporting them. So I really appreciate their efforts.","I think we're very well positioned going into next year. I think we're doing the right things. And as you know, we're going to be continue to be shareholder-friendly and deliver value to our shareholders in addition to our clients and to our associates.","So thank you very much for joining today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'll now introduce your host for today's conference, Elena Charles, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elena Charles","Thank you. I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call and Webcast.","Carlos will begin today's call with an overview of our key achievements during fiscal 2014 and a discussion about our financial results. He will then provide a high-level update on the status of the spin-off of Dealer Services. Next, Jan will then provide further information regarding the spin-off before taking you through our detailed financial results and our fiscal 2015 forecast. Finally, before we take your questions, Carlos will provide some closing remarks.","I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such, involve some risks. These are also discussed in our earnings press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Elena. Fiscal 2014 can best be described as a year of innovation at ADP. From increasing the speed with which we bring new solutions to market, to opening ADP's second Innovation Lab, this latest one located in Manhattan, where we develop the new technologies that change the way businesses manage their human capital, to designing new solutions that focus on both our intuitive user experience and solid performance, fiscal 2014 has been a year of innovation at ADP.","ADP is happy to enjoy a market-leading position with our Mobile Solutions app. In fiscal 2014, we more than doubled the number of people using our mobile app, passing the 2.5 million user mark. This growth shows that the way people prefer to manage their personal HR needs closely mirrors how they choose to shop, bank and connect via their mobile devices.","We've exceeded our own expectations for fiscal 2014 client migrations. We successfully migrated almost 100,000 existing clients in the small and mid-market to our newest cloud-based platforms. This brings the total number of businesses that currently benefit from ADP's cloud-based solutions to over 430,000. ADP now has more than 50,000 clients enjoying our HCM platforms, Workforce Now and Vantage, compared with 40,000 a year ago.","Through the globalization of our solutions, we are making it easier for clients to manage employee populations across borders. For example, our solutions are now offered in countries that are home to virtually all employees who work for multinational corporations. And as we increased strategic investments and innovation, we simultaneously managed our internal operations to achieve expanded margins in our business units. We did this while continuing to improve our service model to better reflect the needs of our clients.","Our small business clients continue to enjoy ADP's around-the-clock support. Since many small business owners do not have the time during regular business hours to address their human capital needs, our move to 24\/7 service for small businesses allows them to focus on HR at their convenience. In other business units, we've extended our service hours during the busiest times of the year, which has been well received by our clients.","Overall, we want to make sure that when our clients are hard at work, ADP is hard at work with them.","And finally, we sharpened ADP's focus on human capital management through the decision to spin-off our Dealer Services business into an independent publicly traded company.","Overall, as ADP invests in innovations of tomorrow, our clients are enjoying our leading solutions today.","So now let's move on to the fourth quarter and fiscal year results. ADP reported solid results for the fiscal year. Total revenues grew 8%. Worldwide new business bookings growth in Employer Services and PEO were 5% for the quarter and 7% for the year. These results were just below our expectations. However, as we mentioned in last quarter's call, the fourth quarter was in an especially difficult grow-over compared to the prior year. Nonetheless, we are very pleased to have sold over $1.4 billion in new annualized recurring revenues, which will contribute to our revenue growth over the coming months.","New business bookings growth for the fourth quarter was mixed by market segment. In the small and mid-markets, we were very pleased with the double-digit growth ADP experienced and the PEO results continued to be strong. However, we were disappointed with the results in the high end of the upmarket where we sold fewer deals to companies with more than 10,000 employees compared with a year ago.","In the low end of our national accounts market, meaning companies with 1,000 to 10,000 employees where ADP has historically been successful, new business bookings of both our Workforce Now and Vantage solutions were good. And we are pleased to have added 100 new Vantage clients during fiscal 2014. This is almost twice the number we sold last year.","In our International business, we continue to see softness in new bookings growth in our in-country solutions in Europe due to continued economic recovery on the continent. However, we are pleased with the growth of our multinational solutions for companies based outside of the U.S. In Latin America, our new bookings growth was strong.","As a result of the mixed results in the upmarket, our forecast for fiscal 2015 is for about 8% growth.","Our long-term goal of 8% to 10% annual new bookings growth remains intact.","Moving on to retention. Full year Employer Services worldwide client revenue retention increased this year to 91.4%. For those of you who have followed us for some time, you are aware that this level is an all-time high. I'm particularly pleased with these results as I believe they demonstrate the success of our new cloud-based platforms and are evidence that our migration strategy and focus on innovation are resonating in the marketplace.","The success of the PEO continued with strong revenue growth reaching 15% for the year, primarily from growth in average worksite employees paid, which was a very strong 15% for the year.","Dealer Services posted solid revenue growth in fiscal 2014 primarily through additions to its client space -- client base, resulting from positive competitive win rates and higher digital advertising revenues. The global automotive market continues to be strong with U.S. vehicle sales reaching prerecessionary levels.","Our planned spin-off of the Dealer Services business is progressing well and we are still anticipating completion of the spin-off by October. There will be a pre-spin roadshow with the Dealer Services management team in the weeks leading off to the final spin-off. We are getting close to a decision on the name of the new company, as well as the branding and we'll be ready to share that information with you in mid-August. We remain excited about the planned spin-off of Dealer Services and the focus it will allow both management teams as we complete the separation of these 2 businesses.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jan to give you more details on the spin and walk you through our fiscal 2014 results.","Jan Siegmund","Thank you, Carlos. As Carlos stated, we are progressing well with the planned spin-off of Dealer Services. An updated Form 10 was filed with the SEC on July 25 and can be found on the ADP Investor Relations website. We expect to file an updated Form 10 with fiscal 2014 results for the new company in early September.","In conjunction with the spin-off, we are still expecting that ADP will receive at least $700 million from the new Dealer Services entity, which we intend to use to repurchase ADP stocks.","With that, let's move on to our fiscal year 2014 results. Our fiscal year 2014 results include about $15 million of spin-related costs, and as indicated last quarter, these costs were excluded from our forecast for the year. We expect to incur an additional $40 million to $50 million of spin-related costs over the first 2 quarters of fiscal year 2015, which are also excluded from the fiscal year 2015 forecast as these costs will be reported within discontinued operations upon completion of the spin-off.","And just to note, my comments exclude the impact of the $15 million of spin-related costs recorded in this year's fourth quarter, and the year-over-year comparison I am discussing are to the fiscal year 2013 financials adjusted to exclude the impairment charge of last year's fourth quarter.","Before I get into the results, I want to call your attention to our cash and marketable securities balance of $4.1 billion at June 30, 2014. This includes 2,000 -- $2.2 billion of assets related to outstanding commercial paper in support of our extended investment strategy for the client funds portfolio and is footnoted on our condensed balance sheet. This borrowing was repaid on July 1.","I also want to point out that ADP continued its shareholder-friendly actions, repurchasing 9 million shares for $679 million and paid cash dividends of over $880 million during fiscal year 2014.","So now for the results. ADP's revenues grew 8%, nearly all organic, to $12.2 billion for the year. We achieved 8% growth in both pretax and net earnings and 9% earnings per share growth on fewer shares outstanding compared with the year ago. Overall, our results were solid, with each of our business segments performing well.","Employer Services grew total revenues 8%, nearly all organic; the PEO grew 15%; and Dealer Services grew 7%.","In Employer Services, growth in the small and mid-market contributed particularly well. And as Carlos mentioned earlier, Employer Services worldwide client retention improved to 91.4% on top of an already historically high retention rate.","We are pleased to see continued strength in our same-store pays per control in Employer Services in the U.S. with an increase of 2.8% per year. In Europe, same-store pays per control declined by 0.5% for the full year and 0.3% for the fourth quarter. So while the economy across Europe remains a bit soft, it does appear to be stabilizing.","Average client fund balances increased a healthy 8% for the fiscal year. Lower state unemployment tax rates were offset by: increases from our new business growth, especially in the small and midsized markets; wage growth, including bonus payments by our clients; as well as pays per control.","The PEO delivered higher than anticipated results for the year with 15% revenue growth, driven by 15% average worksite employee growth and strong revenue retention.","Dealer Services revenue growth of 7% was driven by new clients and applications installed, as well as increased digital advertising revenues, but was lower than our expectations because of continued weakness across Continental Europe and some softness in one of our transaction-based businesses. Dealer Services margin expansion of 130 basis points for the full year benefited from certain nonrecurring items in both the third and fourth quarter.","As anticipated, ADP's pretax -- total pretax earnings were negatively impacted in fiscal year 2014 by the decline in client interest revenues resulting from low interest rates.","The impact of low interest rates reduced ADP's revenue growth by almost 0.5 percentage point and pretax earnings growth by 3 percentage points as the lower yield more than offset the benefit received from the 8% growth in balances. Pretax margin was negatively impacted 80 basis points, and diluted earnings per share were lower by almost $0.08 or 3 percentage points for the year.","Excluding the impact of the client funds investment strategy and recognizing the healthy margin expansion our business segments achieved for the fiscal year, largely driven by operating efficiencies, it is evident that there is leverage in ADP's business model and you will see this as we move on to our discussion of next year's outlook.","So let me take you through our fiscal year 2015 forecast, starting with total company guidance. Remember that the forecast includes the Dealer Services business, but excludes any spin-related costs.","We anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 8%. Pretax margin for total ADP is anticipated to improve by 75 to 100 basis points from 18.8% last year, which excluded spin-related costs of approximately $15 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.","We expect a higher effective tax rate of 34.6% compared with the 33.7% in fiscal year 2014.","Diluted earnings per share are expected to grow 11% to 13% compared with $3.14 in fiscal year 2014, which excludes spin-related costs recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.","As it is part of our usual practice, the forecast does not contemplate further share buybacks beyond anticipated dilution related to employee equity comp plans, though it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders depending obviously on market conditions. In addition, this forecast does not contemplate any share repurchases from the $700 million or more ADP will receive from the new Dealer Services business at the time of the spin. Consistent with the tax-free nature of the spin, we are required to repurchase ADP shares with this cash within 12 months of the spin. However, our intent is to do so over the 9 months remaining in fiscal year 2015 after the completion of the spin, which would result in slight earnings per share accretion for the full year.","We believe the ranges we have given you for revenue and earnings per share growth have contemplated both the opportunities and the challenges ADP is facing in fiscal year 2015. Typical items that could be impactful to earnings would include the success of our sales force in bringing new products to market and our ability to implement those products, possible changes to the regulatory environment, particularly any changes relative to the ACA, as well as our ability to sustain our client retention level.","Consider, for example, at the high end of our revenue and earnings forecast ranges, we have anticipated the renewal of certain high-margin WOTC tax credit revenues in the second half of the fiscal year. Additionally, the interest rate environment will impact our new purchase rates, and foreign exchange rates could move either up or down.","And while we don't provide quarterly guidance, I want you to be aware of certain items impacting the first 2 quarters for the fiscal year. As you may recall, we stepped up our investment in R&D during the second half of fiscal year 2014. Investments we have made include such innovations as data analytics user experience, enhancement to our strategic platforms and improvements in our time-to-market capabilities. I also would like to remind you that new bookings growth in the last -- in last year's first quarter was 1%, and as a result, we anticipate higher selling expenses in the first quarter compared with the year ago. We expect that the year-over-year pressure from these items will result in additional expense of about $30 million in each of the first 2 quarters of fiscal year 2015. Therefore, you should assume that ADP margin improvement and profitability is weighted more towards the second half of the fiscal year.","And now before I take you through the details of our forecast for the client fund investment strategy, there are a few things I would like to point out.","First, the objective of our investment strategy remains safety, liquidity and diversification. At June 30, about 82% of our fixed income portfolio was invested in AAA and AA-rated securities. We continue to base the interest assumptions in our forecast on the fed funds future contracts and forward year curve for the 3.5- and 5-year U.S. government agencies, as we do not believe it is possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the yield curve or new bond issuance behavior of corporations and other issuers.","I'll also remind you that our strategy usually results in about 15% to 20% of the reinvestments -- of the investments maturing each year and therefore subject to investment risk each year. We anticipate that the maturities of fiscal year 2015 will be in line with this range.","We anticipate average client fund balances for fiscal year 2015 in the range of $21.8 billion to $22.2 billion, which represents 5% to 7% growth.","About 1 percentage point of this growth is expected to come from outside of the U.S., evidence that our global money movement operation is gaining traction.","We anticipate a yield on the client funds portfolio of 1.7% to 1.8%, which represents a decrease of up to 10 basis points from the fiscal year 2014.","We anticipate that client fund interest, as well as the total impact of pretax earnings from the extended investment strategy will be up to $5 million to $15 million compared with fiscal 2014.","And although we are forecasting a positive impact to pretax earnings from the client fund investment strategy, we are still expecting a slight drag of 10 to 15 basis points on ADP's pretax margin due to the highly profitable nature of these revenues, which are forecasted to grow at a slower rate than overall revenues.","If this fiscal year 2014 forecast for the client funds investment strategy is realized, it will be the first time since 2008 that ADP will experience a positive impact to both revenues and earnings. However, the benefit is not expected to occur until the second half of fiscal year.","Now the guidance for our business segments. For Employer Services, we are forecasting revenue growth of about 6% to 7% with pretax margin expansion of about 100 basis points. We anticipate an increase in our pays per control metric in the U.S. of 2% to 3%.","For PEO Services, we are forecasting 13% to 15% revenue growth with up to 50 basis points in pretax margin expansion.","We are forecasting about 8% growth in the annual dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new business bookings from the over $1.4 billion sold in fiscal year 2014.","And for Dealer Services, we are forecasting 7% to 8% revenue growth with about 50 basis points of pretax margin expansion.","And now I will return the call back over to Carlos for his closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Jan. As I discussed earlier in the call, with the announcement of the spin-off of Dealer Services, we have sharpened our focus on HCM.","As such, we have slightly modified our strategic growth pillars to demonstrate this refined focus. In fiscal 2015, we expect to grow our business by focusing on these 3 pillars.","First, we intend to grow our integrated suite of cloud-based HCM, benefits and payroll solutions to serve the U.S. market through further penetration of our strategic platforms: RUN, Workforce Now and Vantage, as well as new HCM offerings. Further offerings, including products related to compliance with the Affordable Care Act and other innovative solutions are expected to be released in fiscal 2015. We look forward to continuing our migration efforts in the mid- and upmarkets.","Our second pillar is to invest to grow and scale our HR business process outsourcing, or BPO solutions, by leveraging our platforms and processes. The PEO and our BPO offerings in the small and the mid-market are performing well.","And finally, our third pillar is to leverage our global presence to offer clients HCM, benefits and payroll solutions where they do business. As I mentioned earlier in the call, ADP solutions are now offered in countries that are home to virtually all employees who work for multinational corporations. We believe our multinational solutions bring global power to the marketplace and will be part of our future success.","All 3 of our strategic pillars are based on ADP's history of stellar client service, ability to navigate regulatory compliance, rich data set and passion for providing innovative solutions to the market. Our accomplishments in fiscal 2014 reflect the commitment we've made to maintain our position as the leading global provider of human capital management as we step into fiscal 2015 and beyond.","I believe ADP is focused on the right things to grow the business and enhance long-term shareholder value. We remain committed to shareholder-friendly actions and return over $1.5 billion in excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during fiscal year 2015.","And before we take your questions, I wanted to let you know that Elena has decided to join the new Dealer Services company that will be formed at the conclusion of the spin-off. Elena has provided more than a decade of strong leadership and insight as the Head of Investor Relations at ADP. I wanted to publicly thank Elena for her years of service and wish her nothing but the best as she joins the new company.","Starting today, please direct your questions and requests to Sara Grillot. Many of you already know her and have worked with her.","And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Togut of Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Congratulations, Elena, on your new role.","Elena Charles","Thank you.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Carlos, could you just walk us through your thought process on FY '15 ES bookings growth and maybe dig in a little more on FY '14. You seem to be scaling back expectations throughout the year. I know you highlighted weakness in the National Accounts market, but do you think some of this was execution-oriented with the ADP sales force? Increased competition? What are your thoughts?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think we -- from the beginning of the year in the first quarter, I think we shared with you that we had some what we consider to be some execution issues, not across the entire ADP sales force, but really concentrated in our upmarket sales force and I think that unfortunately continued throughout the year. It's not unusual for us when we have the kind of, I would say, very slow start to then continue to struggle throughout the rest of the year. It's just -- it's been something that historically has been hard to overcome just because of the way the incentives work and momentum and so forth. But just want to reiterate that, I think, it was clear in our comments that the rest of our ADP sales force and the rest of our markets performed incredibly well, even including the low end of National Accounts. So it was a fairly concentrated issue in some respects because of some grow-over issues with some large accounts we sold in the previous year. But there's really no escaping the fact that we had some execution issues in our upmarket and it is an important part of our overall results. Although it's not -- as you can see from the results, despite that weakness, we still managed to achieve what I would say are pretty respectable sales results, especially when you look at them in the context of compounded annual growth rate over the last 2 or 3 years. So it's an important part of our sales results, but -- so is the low end of the market and so is the mid-market and so is PEO and insurance services and a lot of the other products that we sell. But I think in view of some of those execution challenges we had, I think Jan and I think took the position that we just thought it was prudent to be careful in terms of our planning process for fiscal year '15 in terms of what our expectation is from our new bookings growth. But we hope and we -- that's why we reiterated our commitment to the 8% to 10% long-term growth in sales because that's really what we planned for in terms of our headcount and productivity improvement expectations. But I think, we're -- you could call and you could say that we're hedging, but we're just being -- we're being careful because of some of these challenges we have just in case they're related to anything other than specific execution issues, which is, right now, still our hypothesis.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Understood. Just as a quick follow-up. What are your headcount growth targets for the ES sales force in fiscal 2015?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Our headcount growth is expected to be around 3% to 4% next year. And again, you can obviously then back in to the fact that we expect about half of our sales growth to come from headcount growth and half to come from productivity improvements. That's a little slightly faster headcount growth, but not by much, than what we've been experiencing over the last 2 to 3 years where we've actually had more productivity growth and headcount growth into our sales results, which we'd been extremely happy with. But again, in view of our -- of some of our execution challenges this year, we thought it was prudent to invest a little bit more in sales and accelerate our headcount just slightly more to make sure we take out a little bit of an insurance policy in terms of delivering the results.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The 6% to 7% growth in Employer guidance for next year is, I think, a touch lower than what you've been doing over the last years. Is that just no M&A in the numbers and maybe in light of this slightly lower sales number? Or is there anything else going on there?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think some of it is -- there are some timing issues in terms of calendar that, again, we typically don't get into them but when you start getting into tenths of a percentage point, these things do unfortunately add up. So our growth in net new business is still contributing to our growth rate, but it will contribute about 0.4% less in terms of revenue growth rate in Employer Services, assuming that we hit our retention rate and our sales plan as we've given you in terms of the guidance. So that's some of it, but that's really not a big number. We have a couple of other items around calendar and assumptions around our balance looking slightly lower, which affects the way Employer Services reports its revenues because of the way we credit them at 4.5% fixed interest rate. So there are 2 or 3 items that add up to it, but it's really nothing -- there's no specific one item that I could point to that is creating some sort of big issue for us. We're still pretty positive about the acceleration on our Employer Services revenue growth over the last 2 or 3 years. I think we're at a level now where we're pretty comfortable with that growth. We'd love to accelerate it even more, but any major change in that growth rate would come really as a result of acquisitions or a major improvement in retention or a major, I guess, beat on the sales results as well.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then a follow-up. I don't know if it's possible, can you break out or give us a sense of the difference in the revenue retention rate between those on the new cloud -- newer cloud offerings versus legacy offerings? And if it is, in fact, a decent amount higher, what's the gating factor to more aggressively pushing through the migrations in the mid-market?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Let me just to go through a couple of numbers in terms of whether we're being aggressive or not. We have less than 50,000 clients left in our Small Business segment on EasyPay, which is our legacy platform and I think we're down to under 5,000 of the PCPW clients left on -- which is our legacy platform in our Major Accounts space. So this is a pretty, in my opinion, a lot of progress and very, very proud of the organization because 2 or 3 years ago we were on a different path here. And we're going to really be -- we're going to be off of these 2 platforms here in -- within fiscal year '15 and with -- off the EasyPay platform relatively quickly here, given at the pace that they're moving at. So I think we've been aggressive and we're going to continue to be aggressive because we have to move on to other platforms and other parts of the business where we have some legacy platforms. I think Jan might have some specifics on the retention rates. I can tell you anecdotally that the last several quarters, as we looked at the retention rates of clients who have moved from PCPW over -- which is our legacy platform in Major Accounts over to our Workforce Now platform, the retention rates have been higher than the line average. So we think it's helping us in terms of our retention rate, but there's lots of other moving parts in the retention rate other than migrations. So you have to be careful about building any kind of model in terms of any improvements. Likewise, we can't specifically attribute retention rates in Small Business to the migration of clients onto RUN, but that retention rate happens to have also been quite good over the last 2 or 3 years as we've been moving clients. But there are other moving parts at work. And then lastly, I would caution that, as we get to the last mile of some of these platforms and some of these migrations, we have to be prepared to potentially have some challenges with the last few clients in terms of retention and migrations. We're not planning for that and we're hoping against all hope that, that doesn't occur, but I think it's prudent to assume that the last thousand clients are going to be harder than the first thousand clients. We had a lot clients that have been raising their hands to migrate and the last year few of them are probably going to be ones where we're going to have to ask them nicely and provide them incentives to move over. So I think it's a balanced picture in terms of retention. And we also are moving on now to other platforms that are included in our retention rates overall, so it's not just RUN and Workforce Now and PCPW and EasyPay that impact our retention. We have a lot of benefits platforms that we're trying to consolidate and migrate off of and we still have a couple of other smaller payroll platforms that are legacy also we're on the process of moving off of. So we have still quite a bit of work to do, but the progress has been phenomenal. I'm incredibly proud of the organization. I think, overall, it's had a positive financial impact on us so far.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just following up on the last discussion. Could you talk a bit more about the magnitude of potential cost savings from shutting down legacy platforms? I know that some of that may be going back into investment plans, but I was hoping to get a sense of the growth savings that you might be able to get from here.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It really is a great question, which we're really trying hard to internally get our arms around exactly that issue. But for example, just in terms of real life example, the -- we're almost off of the EasyPay platform here and those migrations took a great deal of effort and we ramped up reasonable amount of expense and people in order to accomplish that. And so as we plan for fiscal year '15, our business units are working very effectively together in terms of seeing what we could do to help overall ADP rather than just focusing on any individual business unit. And in this example, we've decided to move some of the resources that we're working on the migrations of EasyPay to RUN and moving them over to our Major Account and National Account migration efforts because those folks are -- even though they were working on a different platform, they're dedicated resources that were also trained on migration efforts. So even though they have to learn new products and new platforms, rather than downsizing or eliminating those resources, our decision was to move those resources over. And in fact, overall, Jan may have the exact number, but we actually are increasing incrementally our investment in our spend on migrations in fiscal year '15 versus '14. So I think this call is really -- very difficult on this call to go through the level of detail. We're a, as you know, a $12 billion company with a fair amount of legacy and there's a very reasonable list of projects and targets that we have that we believe will really create a better financial picture for ADP long term and we see evidence of that already in what we've done with RUN and with PCPW and SBS and in Major Accounts, but I think as you said it -- you said it best that we are not done and we're continuing to invest. So I think for '15, it is not appropriate to plan any kind of savings or improvement as a result of migrations because we actually are planning for a slight incremental increase in spend on that, obviously with a view -- we're not doing it without the expectation that there will be some large benefit in the future, and I wish I could quantify that and give that to you today, but we're just not prepared to do that.","Jan Siegmund","And I think what Carlos is saying is above and beyond of the margin expansion that is pretty healthy that you have seen in our business segments -- I mean you see the results of ES in this fourth quarter, which had really very, very nice margin expansion. We delivered our margin expansion fiscal year '14 above our kind of long-term expectation of 50 basis points and the confidence that, overall, the business is scaling to which migrations in an indirect way and in this complicated way help us is also reflecting in the 100 basis points guidance that we give for the improvement of pretax margin in the Employer Services segment, which is also above of what we have historically really committed to at this point in time. So as the CFO, I'm pleased with the progress we are making in the business overall, of which migrations are a small part and a part, but in driving the scale for us. So my hope is that, that is being recognized as progress we're making relative to scaling of our business, which we put a lot of effort in and it's showing the results now for a number of years in a row.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. Just switching gears briefly. Given the improving labor market trends, I'm wondering if, when you put out the 2% to 3% guidance range for pays per control, if you see any bias towards the high end of that and if that is potentially a conservative approach.","Jan Siegmund","Well, the range includes the full range, 2% to 3% and -- but you're right. Of course, our pays per control have been now very strong for a couple of years really, but at 2.8%, growing again faster than the U.S. economy is growing. Employment, which is a benefit that ADP has that our clients -- doing a little bit better on employment growth than the rest of the country. And it is just I think more prudent planning, and looking forward, the economy seems to be picking up and being on solid grounds. But since it is, A, above the national growth rate and we have this up for a number of years, we don't really have a strong formed opinion that it's going to be at the upper end or the middle of the range. But it moves slowly, you know that from observation, and we exited at 2.8%. So that, I think, is where I would form my mind around.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Grossman of Stifel Financial.","We'll move on to Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Wanted to switch gears to the PEO business. It's been fairly strong and your expectations are for that to continue. Can you just give us a little bit more color, what's driving that and how sustainable you think that is?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It's a great question because we've been asking the same question over the last 6 to 9 months. And I think, as usual, it's a combination of things and I don't know that we have a scientific answer about the percentage of each factor. It's impossible to deny that some of it is just good execution because that business has been executing well for several years. And I think we just -- our sense of just watching what they've done in terms of building their sales infrastructure, their go-to-market strategies, their product, et cetera, is that they are just doing well from an execution standpoint and from a leadership standpoint. So I think some of it is that. And I just want to remind everyone that, that business has had double-digit growth here for several years and our sales results have been really quite impressive for several years as well, not just this one last year. Having said that, as we've said in the call before, we believe that we have some help from the Affordable Care Act, which has caused, if nothing else, a lot of activity in all of the markets, but particularly in the small end of the market in terms of people looking at alternatives whether they be the exchanges or they be a PEO. There are some things about the structure of ACA around large groups that provide some potential benefits in some states, some of which we got in '14 in terms of health, some of which we might get in '15 and '16. But there are also some things in the ACA that beyond 2016 may make it actually difficult in terms of acting as -- or at least may level the playing field and remove any potential advantage that anyone, including us, may have had in '14, '15 and '16. And so I think it's a balanced picture there where I think ACA appears to be helping, but we're not planning on it helping forever and the combination of that with just great leadership, great execution and good value proposition and I think competitive offering from a price standpoint. And so I think it's a combination of a lot of factors, but as I think you just alluded to, we're incredibly pleased with that because it's helping, not just our overall growth rate, but growth in earnings. So that business, as you know, has a lot of pass-throughs in it, but what we care about is obviously dollars of profit, and in terms of our -- the growth in pretax operating income from that business, whether it's on a per employee, per client or any basis is really quite helpful to ADP's overall growth and profitability.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, you mentioned the additional expense in each of the first 2 quarters in the current fiscal year. Can you just tell us, which line items that will be affected? And also, does that mean you're not expecting pretax margin expansion in the first half of the year and it's all going to be back-end loaded?","Jan Siegmund","I don't think we want to go as detailed as to the guidance the pretax margin by quarter. I think the attempt to isolate these 2 items was to help you a little bit with the skewing in your models. And they will be found, really, in the segment reporting line as they pertain mostly to the ES segment basically.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes. I guess, I was alluding to the expense line item on the income statement. Is that all in SG&A?","Jan Siegmund","It would be in systems development, as well as SG&A.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It's going to be in a couple of places because -- I think that's why we mentioned where the comparison year-over-year of our R&D and technology spending, which is on a couple different lines and then our sales expense, which most -- would be mostly in the SG&A line. So I think it is probably spread out in a couple of different places, but tilted towards the SG&A.","Jan Siegmund","And back to your initial question, the first half is really going to be depressed on the pretax margin side. I think you got that right. And...","Carlos A. Rodriguez","But depressed compared to the full year, not necessarily going backwards from the previous year. Because I think your question was around -- I don't remember exactly how you worded it, but you don't expect to go backwards necessarily. It's just that, in comparison to the overall pretax margin for the year, Q1 and Q2 will be lower, as -- just as we expect the growth rate of operating income to be slightly -- the growth rate to be slightly lower in the first half versus the full year.","Jan Siegmund","Compared to overall guidance range.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. My question was in regards to the interest on funds held for client. It's positive to see that number turn around and be positive in fiscal year '15. But as you think about the out-years and the funds coming up for reinvestment and the interest rate based on the forward curve, I was just wondering if you could provide some color on your expectations for the growth in that interest on funds held in -- going beyond fiscal year '15. If you could just provide some color on that.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Jan and I are fighting over who gets to answer the question. We've been waiting for 5 years to talk about this. So I will let Jan do the honors.","Jan Siegmund","The -- so just to provide a little bit more color to '15, which we are guiding towards is you'll see our balance growth to be still healthy, which is driven by new -- good new additions to our client base, which is a good sign and then continued good pays per control growth, et cetera. But our rate of funds maturing during fiscal year '15 is still higher than our -- the rate is approximately 2.7% and the reinvestment rate is lower, so we do expect overall pressure on our yield for fiscal year '15. So you'll have as the turnaround situation, that it will be accretive to our earnings by the $5 million to $15 million of a client fund strategy impact, but it will be putting pressure on our margins because the growth of that client fund revenue is lower than our overall revenue base due to the situation that I just described to you. So it's in fact really just a turning point and you have to be very careful in thinking that through because it does -- it expands earnings, but it depresses margins and this is the mechanics beyond it. As we look forward, and this is now based on the forward yield curve that you could look also in material we published for you about the embedded rates in our client funds portfolio in the third quarter, this will get better throughout the next few years. We don't provide specific guidance, obviously, for fiscal year '16 and '17 and '18. We're happy to provide '15 guidance in this detail, but it will be naturally better.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","No, that's great. Good to hear that. And just a quick follow-up on the Dealer Services spinoff. As we think about the model post the spinoff and think about the other expense line item and the margin expansion in fiscal year '15, I was just wondering if you could provide some color on how we should think about the model post the spinoff.","Jan Siegmund","Yes. So we mentioned it in our comments. We just filed an updated Form 10 responding to questions that the SEC gave us and should have a look for that. We are not prepared to provide additional financial updates at this point in time. You'll see the updated fiscal numbers for '14 included in the September numbers. And then Dealer Services will provide their go-forward financials. But we reconfirm that we're expecting $40 million to $50 million of incremental public company cost for the company, and that's pretty much, I think, the model that you should build up to the level of position that we see today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","I think you mentioned that the ACA benefits in the PEO may diminish over time. Maybe you could explain that a little more.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I can attempt it, but again, this call may not be the appropriate place to get into all the details. But we're happy to -- because this is all public information, and we're happy kind of off-line to take anyone through kind of our view of the world, which is an uncertain view of the world because it's been constantly changing. As you probably also know, things have been delayed multiple times, and there's been multiple changes in the laws and the regulations, so we will keep every quarter on top of that and updating you. But in general, in 2017, there are some changes that take place, that are scheduled to take place, that I think would potentially diminish any -- if there is an advantage or a positive wind at the back of our PEO or any other PEO, we believe that, that might diminish in 2017 as a result of the opening up of all the exchanges and all the regulations to now large groups as well as small groups. So I think getting into more detail would probably not be easy to do here, but we're happy to have that conversation off-line with anybody because it's not obviously related to our specific guidance, just related to how the law and the regulations operate. But again, just the footnote on that is that 2 or 3 -- what we thought was going to happen 2 or 3 years ago has changed multiple times as a result of adjustments that have been made to the laws and the regulations. So it's something that, unfortunately, we have to continue to monitor. But overall, it's definitely a positive right now for us.","Jan Siegmund","And maybe I'll add to just remind, the PEO has of course executed and grown for a decade in a long, long time for us. And as Carlos alluded in his initial comments, the principal driver or a principal driver of advantage that ADP has, aside from a competitive offering, is our strong distribution capability that leverages the scale and scope of our overall down and mid-market operations to feed leads into the business. And that strong new business bookings growth that we have seen this year was definitely aided by an excellent execution in that space, and that is something that is due to ADP's inherent structural advantages. And that would not diminish, hopefully, in the long run.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes. And I think to be -- again, I think that's a fair point. I'm glad Jan brought it up today. The PEO has, from the time that ADP entered the business, has grown -- from the time it made a major acquisition in the business in 1999, has grown from 65,000 worksite employees to 300,000 worksite employees before any Affordable Care Act impact. So we're not planning to go backwards or to change the growth trajectory of that business as a result of ACA. We're just acknowledging that it may be giving us some incremental help today and that incremental help may not be large in the future, but we would not be planning for anything other than what we've been able to do for -- because it's just the inherent advantages that, that business has in terms of its value proposition and distribution as being part of ADP. So we will continue to leverage those advantages beyond any kind of regulatory changes that may take place in the next several years.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And related to that, your guidance for next year of 13% to 15% is below the 19% this quarter. It seems like you're sort of built in for growth above that rate, at least early in the year. Is that right? And what would cause the lower growth rate maybe later in the year?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","That's a great question, because we did look at it, again, over the last couple of days as we were getting ready to make this call. And all I can tell you is we had, again, a small item that helped -- that was a onetime item in the quarter, and we kind of relooked at our expectations or our plans for sales in that business and our loss assumptions in that business. And we felt comfortable that, that was the appropriate range to provide you guys. Because, again, the business tends to, like all of our businesses, we do have sometimes small calendar issues and other onetime issues that affect us, but we try to be transparent and give you guys a fair range of what we really expect. And I think we're being fair based on what we -- because I -- you could probably look at the previous quarters and see that the 19% is somewhat -- it's great news, and we appreciate it and we'll take it. But it's not -- on a trend line, it would be out of trend on the upper end. And so I think we expect to get back on trend, which is a slightly lower number than the 19%.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Grossman of Stifel Financial.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I dropped off for a few minutes, so I just -- if this was covered, just -- we can pass. But Carlos, you talked about the sales execution, obviously, at the high end, and I think I understand that. I'm just curious whether or not, since this is a new product for this segment of the market, do you have any feedback on the technical merits of the product? And for those that have purchased it, what their experience has been and how it stacked up?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So to clarify, we're talking about the upmarket, especially the higher end of the upmarket. We also -- I'm assume you're referring to Vantage, but I just want to clarify that global -- some of the GlobalView sales would be in that same category, and any increases or decreases in sales of GlobalView would also impact our comments and our guidance around growth in the upper end. We also have some sales that take place in our benefits platforms that are also very high end, and those comparisons also would be in those numbers. So having said that, I just wanted to clarify that we have -- we're broader than just our Vantage platform in the upper end of the market. Having said that, the answer is, no, we're not aware of any issues that would prevent us from winning. So again, that's why we keep harping on the execution issues. We're clearly still -- you heard the comments about our focus on innovation and our time-to-market and how fast we're trying to move, so to be clear, we're not standing still, and so we are making a lot of enhancements as we speak not only to Vantage but also to our other strategic platform in national accounts, which is our enterprise platform. And so I think that we are doing whatever we can to improve our user experience to make sure that we have the right kind of functionality, to make sure that our -- the products are -- provide global solutions as well, not just GlobalView, but Vantage itself has also been enhanced with some global capabilities. So we're doing a lot of things to enhance our competitiveness in the upper end of the upmarket, but we're not aware of any glaring holes or problems from a competitive standpoint.","Jan Siegmund","And David, in order to give you a little bit more color around the momentum of Vantage is, as Carlos mentioned, we doubled the number of sales this year that got to new clients throughout the fiscal year, so that is in line with our expectations and our plans. So the interesting part is the comments have to be really dissected by the part of national accounts that's selling in the 1 to 10,000 and above 10,000 so it's not a general upmarket comment that color for you [ph].","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I'm wondering, Jan, maybe if I could just ask a financial question. Could you perhaps give us some more color on free cash flow in fiscal '15 and perhaps help us understand whether the Dealer business contributes pretty much prorated a [ph] free cash flow?","Jan Siegmund","In general, yes. Let me jump back to free cash -- or to cash flow in -- to '14 that provides you the starting point for '15. You saw our cash flow from operations to be above [ph] $1.8 billion and that was up 16% year-over-year. And I want to caution that, that is impacted by items that are onetime or timing items so when you adjust for our changes in working capital and some lower pension contributions we made and the increase for stock comp, our actual kind of like-to-like cash flow has been closer to about $1.6 billion or 7% growth, I would say, in a like-to-like comparison. And historically, our cash flow from operations has really grown in line with our operating results. And that's a good assumption to have, and there's no difference between the business in principle. Obviously, the cash flows that ADP will receive from the dividend are excluded from this. But from the operational perspective, I can answer your question, that is really kind of in line with what the business is doing. We published our capital expenditures for Dealer Services on Form 10 that you can find. So there's really nothing unusual in the cash flow situation for Dealer Services.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So the free cash flow conversion of Dealer is very similar to ADP?","Jan Siegmund","Very similar, very similar, very similar.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Ramsey for Jason. On your -- back to your new business bookings, you're guiding for a slight acceleration in the metric for fiscal '15. And as you mentioned, your easiest comp is by far in the first quarter, which has historically been a relatively inconsistent quarter. Can you give us some additional color on your confidence level, your expectations or just dynamics you see for the metric specific to the first quarter? I mean, should we assume, because of the easy comp, that the Q1 result should be quite high? Or anything additional there would be helpful.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I wish I could, but getting the look from Elena that -- and really, all kidding aside, we -- as you know, we're only in the first month of the quarter so it's very -- sales, unlike revenues, for us, like, we have a lot of visibility around a lot of things in our business because it's a great business model because of its recurring revenue nature. The sales are something that we really can't -- like we have -- we know what our headcount growth is, which drives on a -- if you look at it over multiple quarters and multiple years, it's very easy to answer the question. If you look at any individual month or any individual quarter, we have to be careful because it's just -- it is a -- like other companies in terms of their -- what they consider to be revenues, which is sales. For us, sales is like other companies' revenues where it's very, very -- it's harder, not very hard, but it's harder to really pin that number down. So I think we've avoided giving quarterly guidance in the past and we certainly don't want to start now. So unfortunately, I'm going to have to defer, but we believe we have a headcount in place. We believe we have a easier grow-over so there are some factors that give us comfort about the first quarter. But I just don't have the ability to give you -- and I honestly don't have the visibility today to be able to comment on it.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","All right, that's fair. On another track entirely, you mentioned you're seeing some stabilization in Europe. It's obviously been a headwind in the last couple of quarters. Are you seeing what you'd describe as sort of an infection point there? How should we think about Europe in the context of contribution to your fiscal '15 projections, guidance?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think the -- for example, from a pays per control standpoint, I think the stabilization that Jan was referring to is really purely on the employment levels in Europe, which, generally speaking, whether it's in the U.S. or Europe or anywhere else, are indicators of other things also stabilizing. But the only comment we're making is that the pays per control has gone from 0.8, 0.9 negative to now 0.2 or 0.3. So the trend is heading towards flat, but not obviously growing yet. So that's better than where we have been and it's indication of some stability. On the sales front, we had a slight decrease in our sales results in Europe, which, in a context of the situation, we were very pleased with, and we expect that to grow. That's our plan, is to have our European sales results grow in fiscal year '15. So that's part of our assumption that there is stabilization, that there is some improvement and there will be some end demand generated in Europe. So all of those things added together with very good retention rates because I should add also that they had an improvement in retention in fiscal year '14 versus '13, which was great, and we certainly appreciate. So when you add that all together, we expect to have positive revenue growth. And I think in the context of the situation, we're happy with that, but it's not helping accelerate ADP's revenue growth. And it was the European results, not the international results, but the European results were, net-net, had a lower growth rate in '14 than the line average of ADP.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Foresi of Janney Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","This is Jeff Rossetti on for Joe Foresi. Just a quick question. I think, Carlos, you alluded to the transition of some of the remainder of your clients that haven't switched to cloud maybe taking a little bit longer. Is there any kind of incentive, any kind of discount that you might provide them and how that might impact your assumptions with respect to margins?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think the incentives are so far, again, and one might argue that we have gone after the largest segment first to where they was probably the biggest opportunity, and they were -- and it's probably there where there was the most natural demand for movement. So there, the tool was largely around better products and enhancements and integration. And so there really wasn't year-to-date -- not year-to-date, but up until now in terms of our migration strategy, it hasn't been around giveaways or lower price or incentives, it's been around you are on this legacy payroll platform. And I think of you move to an HCM cloud platform, you now have time and attendance benefits, it helps with compliance of ACA, easier user experience. You have access to mobile applications. So it's been largely a pull strategy, if you will, of getting people excited about a product that we believe is better for them and helps them manage their employees better and more effectively, more cost effectively. So we haven't yet found ourselves in a position where we had to do unnatural acts to move clients. That doesn't mean we haven't spent money because we've invested a lot in the migration tool, and generally speaking, we haven't \"charged\" for it, so we've incurred the expense of some of those migrations and some of those movements. So as we go forward, we'll keep you apprised of whether or not we end up needing to use incentives, discounts, pricing, et cetera. We are considering using our sales force more than we have thus far. The sales force has been involved only to the extent that there's an opportunity to add additional modules and increase the penetration rate of our clients at the individual client level. As we move more upmarket in our migration strategy, we are likely to involve our sales force, which would obviously result in the incurrence of some commission expense, and we would certainly keep you updated as to whether or not pricing is affected. But so far, nothing to report.","Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, very helpful. And just as a follow-up, could you provide any time line with respect to some of the compliance-related products that you'll be rolling out this year related to ACA?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Jan probably has the answer to that one.","Jan Siegmund","Yes, I think we have current plans to introduce the ACA compliance product in its comprehensive view at the -- in the second quarter of this fiscal year and then we hope to see it contributing to sales for the second half of the fiscal year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Marcon of Robert W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","A couple of specific elements with regards to products, particularly as it relates to the higher end in terms of Vantage and Workforce. Can you talk a little bit about the -- some of the new upgrades that are going to be coming out? I was at SHRM, saw the previews and looked pretty interesting. Just wondering when those would be rolled out and if your guidance is assuming any sort of specific impact from those.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think in terms of the impact on the guidance, I think we have convinced ourselves over the last 2 or 3 years that for us to drive our sales growth, it can't just be elbow grease. It has to be product-driven. We also have to execute, but they have to have product to help, right? The market wants it. The market wants integration. It wants global. It wants a good user experience. So those are all the things that we are focused on. I think some of the things you may have seen are specific items around data analytics that are going to, I think, really help our clients manage their workforces better, both from a planning standpoint but also from a compensation standpoint. We've added some great tools in the talent management space that, from an onboarding and recruitment standpoint, we think are very positive. So we're adding a lot of enhancements to Global -- we think we've talked over the last couple of quarters that we've added Global system of record. In our Vantage platform, we have added a capability to provide streamline as an offering with Workforce Now in major accounts, which is -- there are many clients in our national -- in our major account space, and those are 50 to 1,000 that have employees in other countries, and so that's a fairly significant enhancement as well. So I think we have a lot of things and it's reflected in our spend rate on innovation and product development and R&D, and I think you've seen a few of them. And how much each one specifically is quantified in terms of its -- in terms of our forecast in sales, the ACA is really the only one where we have kind of specific dollars assigned because it was -- not because we have a scientific way of doing it, it's because it was easier as a separate swim lane, if you will, to look at. But all of the things I just mentioned and all of the things you've seen are part of the plan to continue to drive our win rates in the market and to help us hopefully grow our market share and grow slightly faster than the rest of the market, which is what we're trying to do through our sales results.","Jan Siegmund","And Mark, the features that Carlos described are either available today or will become available in fall of what were presented at the SHRM. So -- and naturally, it will enhance overall sales dynamic, driving hopefully Workforce Now and Vantage sales.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And I think from a packaging standpoint, which I think is important because I think the world has moved in a direction where consumerism is a big factor in all technology solutions, so we are really putting a new skin, if you will, on most of our products. And some of them what we talked about in terms of our innovation going on in our New York innovation lab is a combination of a lot of things, some of which we're not prepared to talk about yet. But our new user experience and our new packaging, I think, is something that is coming out very, very soon here and I think will again, I think, help us from a competitive standpoint and just, I think, really help the sales force in terms of its ability to get in the door and close business.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So you mentioned in the fall, do you think it will be ready for the key fall selling season? Or would it be more of a -- this is, we're rolling this out and GA will be -- and I'm referring specifically the analytics and the user interface is what I was specifically relating -- referring to as well as the social aspects.","Jan Siegmund","So the analytics product is in the market, actually. I have a statistic here that we sold already the first client, so I think in the fourth quarter, we have -- we sold a number of clients actually and there's a great dynamic already, for [ph] dynamics in the marketplace, so it's available and being sold. And the user experience coming out in fall is already part of our demonstration. I think you saw in the third quarter Carlos presented, I think, a snapshot in the slides about it. So I think I want to take it, from financial point, I think that what you're angling for. Our new product introductions putting risk or opportunity into our new growth number and my assessment would be that it is, as in past years, contemplated in our overall guidance. They don't form a huge amount of planned sales dollars, but they're clearly a part of making our product more competitive. So I don't think there's more or less that's [ph] relative to these product introductions in our sales numbers than in previous years.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then just a follow-up question, just with regards to new sales. What percentage of the very upper end of the client base would typically account for -- what percentage of new sales would that very upper end 10,000-plus typically end up accounting for?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Very small in terms of the overall percentage, which I can say for almost any other category of ADP, we're so big and so diversified that there isn't any one thing. But the difference is that it is very lumpy and we've -- this has been going on for decades, right, and we've got a few quarters where we've had to tell you about some of this lumpiness that happened in the upper end of the market. So when you're comparing just the upper end of the market to the upper end of the market, you can have swings and variability. But in terms of its impact on overall ADP, as you can see, it can affect our overall sales growth by around 1%. But 1% sales growth is about a, I think it's a $15 million impact on revenue for ADP in fiscal year '15. So these are just not giant impacts or giant numbers, but they affect the numbers, and that's why we're trying to be transparent, help you guys with it. But it isn't what's going to make or break our results or ADP.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.","Siva Krishna Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is S.K. Prasad Borra for Jim Schneider. Couple of questions, if I may. Firstly, on your cost base, how do you expect the cost base to roll [ph], especially your investments around cloud solutions. How much of that would be dedicated to R&D and how much would go to sales and marketing? And secondly, on the margin profile, what you get for cloud solutions, if you compare that with your legacy products, is there a huge gap? Or do you think it will be comparable in the medium term?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I'll take the second part first and then maybe Jan can help with the first. But I think on the second part, just as a reminder, so we are not a pure software technology company. So the spend that we have on the services component and the compliance component of our products, we hope, becomes more efficient and more productive over time in part because of help from going to cloud-based products. But there isn't an -- there is not an enormous change that we have planned there yet. We have seen some improvements in terms of what we need to spend on service in our low end of the business and in mid-market as a result of new cloud-based solutions, and our implementation processes, in some cases, are easier and faster. So I think there's some benefit there. But we have, unlike, again, a pure play technology software, it's not quite -- if I'm -- because I think, if I understand the nature of your question, it's not quite as scientific as you might find in other companies where you can say you're a software shop and this is how the cost changes because now your cloud versus -- because we have a lot of expense in our P&L that is not related to technologies, related to service. So with that as a backdrop, we do think that it is helping us and will help us, which is why we're moving on these migrations as aggressively as we're moving. But it isn't, I think, as dramatic as you would find in a software technology company. The good news for us is some of the software -- pure software technology companies, that transition comes with lower revenues in the short term as you make a transition because they're not on a recurring revenue model. In our case, we've always been on a recurring revenue model, so there isn't as much change to our overall financial model other than maybe some help in terms of our cost structure long term as you might find in other places. So Jan, I don't know if you want to add to that?","Jan Siegmund","Yes, referring to the first part of your question, if you look at our overall P&L, you notice that our systems and development and programming costs grew by approximately 10% for the year, a little slower in the quarter, and that acceleration of expense is in line with our strategy of focusing on innovation. So we anticipate, and we have talked in the past, about aligning our investments into R&D with revenue. So I think that cost line, you should not expect scale because we're committed to executing our innovation strategy in '15 for sure. Our sales and distribution and marketing costs are part, of course, of SG&A, and this year, SG&A grew about 5.5%, so we did gain scale, obviously, relative to our revenue growth. But the sales and marketing costs are largely driven by the new business bookings that we do, and we have talked in the past that we have gained productivity in that channel historically, so some very slight productivity improvements we would hope to gain also in '15. But that's, I think, is as specific as we can get for '15 for you. Those are the 2 big drivers that you alluded to and I hope that's kind of helpful.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And one last stat that, I think, helps in terms of -- to show our commitment to innovation and then also something that may not be obvious from the numbers that Jan just talked about in terms of our increase in system and development expense, which we're trying very hard to grow at an appropriate rate and not trying to drive scale from it. But in addition to that, 3 years ago, we set a target. We want to move the amount of spend that we have on new R&D or new cloud-based products compared to legacy products, and 3 years ago, that mix was about 40% on new and 60% on legacy. And the reason we know that number so well is because we actually included that in the MBOs of myself and the entire management team to move that number up, so that we can not only grow our total expense but grow the proportion of that expense that we're spending on new stuff versus legacy. And that number now has moved from 40-60 to 60-40, so we're spending a lot more on new, not just because of the absolute increase in expense, but also because of the change in mix of old versus new.","Operator","We'll move on to Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Danyal Hussain calling in for Smitti. I just wanted to follow up on the PEO business. Obviously, it's done extremely well on organic basis, but Carlos, maybe you could just comment again on the potential to acquire some of those smaller PEO businesses out there, kind of in the same style that you've done with Payroll.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So it is -- I understand the comparison and we actually had some hopes over the years that we would be able to do that because we have done that fairly effectively in the Payroll business at times. But the 2 businesses are really completely different in the sense that in the payroll space, it's really one of, frankly, just a valuation issue. Does it make sense in terms of the economics because as you can hear, we're not interested in new platforms. So the question is, can we absorb financially and is it a net positive for our shareholders to acquire and roll up payroll businesses? In the PEO, it's slightly different because there's a risk component where what you acquire has underlying workers' compensation and health insurance risk, both in terms of renewal and in terms of just pure balance-sheet financial risk. And so we've been, over the years, looked at really frankly dozens of PEOs and we just never felt that we ran across something that made sense from a risk profile standpoint and the return we thought we might be able to get for our shareholders. So it's one thing to do the math on paper. When you introduce a risk element, then you have to risk adjust it, if you will, in terms of its potential downside, and we decided to just go it organically. And so we will continue to look as we always do because we're open-minded. I would count on us continuing to follow the path that we followed because it's been pretty successful. And ironically, the PEO is one place where when you hear us talk about migrations and multiple platforms and so forth, one might argue and might speculate that part of why the PEO has had all the success it had -- and I would attribute a small percentage of the success to this. But that simplicity and that focus on having one platform and just focusing on day-to-day execution and beating the competition and winning in the marketplace rather than being distracted by complexity and multiple platforms, I think, probably has helped them, and so we're not in any hurry to change that.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And maybe could you just comment on how attach rates have been trending and your price expectations for 2015?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Attach rates for, sorry, what products?","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ancillary products on your ES segment.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So I'm glad you actually brought that up because I think I said that in the migrations, when someone asked the question about pricing, I said there's nothing to report, and it wasn't completely fair because even though on specific the payroll portion of what we're migrating clients on, there's been no discounting or unnatural acts. In general, we've actually benefited overall from a pricing standpoint as a company as clients have migrated because, in general, they've taken on additional products because of the opportunities that we have with integration of the multiple modules, if you will, being on a single database. And so I think those attach rates continue to be very good, in general, on new sales and also continue to hold up very well on our migrations. I think in Vantage, the time and attendance attach rate is somewhere in the 80% range, plus we're getting good attach rates on benefits and also on talent. And so we're very pleased because these are products that we used to have to sell first one product and then another product and then another product, and now, we're doing much better in terms of our attach rates up front in the sales process, as well as in the migrations. And when you look at our penetration rates of our various ancillary products, in general, of the base and you compare it to the attach rates on new sales, you would conclude that there's a huge opportunity there, but it's going to take many, many years to get there and there's a lot of execution risk along the way. But I just want to be clear that the attach rates on new business are multiples of what our penetration rates are in the base of benefits, time and attendance and some of our other products.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then pricing for 2015?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Oh, pricing for 2015 is very much in line with what we've been doing for the last 3 or 4 years, which is net price increase of around 1% through in terms of the impact that you would see from that in terms of our revenue and what the clients would experience in the marketplace. So we're still -- it's a competitive market space. Inflation is still low, and so we've -- historically, prior to the financial crisis, we were a little bit more, I wouldn't call it aggressive, but I think our price increases were healthier than they have been in the last 3 or 4 years, and there's no plan to change that in '15.","Operator","I'm not showing any further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Carlos Rodriguez for any further remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, thank you very much for joining us today. As you probably could tell from our tone, we're very pleased with the results. When we report the year-end results, we don't always focus on the quarter, but we really had a great fourth quarter. And I just want to thank all -- the entire organization and all of our associates, including our sales organization, for delivering great results in the fourth quarter. We continue our shareholder-friendly actions, as Jan mentioned, through dividends and also share buybacks. We continue to be excited about the opportunities that the spinoff provides both for Dealer Services and for us, and we'll continue to update you along the way as we get closer to the date of the spin.","I'm incredibly enthusiastic about the future as we begin 2015. This focus that we have on Human Capital Management has finally come to fruition here as a result of the spinoff, and I think all of our efforts and our focus are going to be in that space, which we believe is a great opportunity on a global basis.","I want to thank you again for joining us, and this concludes the analyst call for today.

My name is Karen, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Sara Grilliot, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sara Grilliot","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Sara Grilliot, ADP\u2019s Vice President, Investor Relations, and I am here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Jan Siegmund, ADP\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","Thank you for joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call and webcast. Carlos will begin today\u2019s call with some opening remarks, and then Jan will take you through the quarter\u2019s results and provide an update on what you expect for fiscal 2016.","During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","I would like to remind everyone that today\u2019s call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","With that, I will turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos Rodriguez","Thank you, Sara and good morning everyone. This morning, we reported results for our second quarter of fiscal 2016, which included revenue growth of 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was impacted by about 1 percentage point from the sale of our AdvancedMD business at the end of the first fiscal quarter.","In the second quarter, we continued to see very strong demand for our solutions, which is evidenced by our new business bookings growth of 15%. Sales of additional human capital management modules that assist with Affordable Care Act or ACA compliance continued to contribute meaningfully to this performance, which has exceeded our expectations on a year-to-date basis. As a result, we are now forecasting new business bookings growth of at least 12% for fiscal 2016.","In addition to delivering this solid performance, we have returned to shareholders an additional $780 million through share repurchases in the first half of the fiscal year. And in November of 2015, our Board approved an increase of our cash dividend of 8% marking our 41st consecutive year of dividend increases. These actions demonstrate our commitment to shareholder friendly actions and are intended to contribute to ADP\u2019s goal of achieving top-quartile total shareholder return.","It has been an exciting and challenging quarter for ADP and our associates as we help our clients prepare to comply with the ACA. Our teams have worked very hard to implement, human capital management modules that were sold during calendar 2015, and I am pleased with the number of units started on our ACA platforms during the quarter. This is performance that we should be proud of. And I want to thank our associates for all of their hard work and dedication to our clients.","We now have more than 14,000 US clients with over 50 full-time employees live on our ACA solutions. Let me put that achievement into perspective. By the end of March, employers with 50 plus employees will be required to send Form 1095-C to each of their employees describing the health insurance available to them. This is the most significant employee tax filing form that the US government has introduced since the W2, and ADP is on track to deliver about 10 million of them in the first year.","Success of our ACA solution is just one example of ADP\u2019s proficiency in dealing with complex compliance issues. From helping clients determine eligibility for Work Opportunity Tax Credits signed into law just weeks ago to preparing for anticipated changes in overtime rules, ADP\u2019s expertise is unique in the dynamic world of HR compliance. And as this complexity grows, many clients are choosing to outsource HR entirely to ADP.","Our PEO business, ADP TotalSource experienced another strong quarter growing revenue 18% and average work site employees by 14% in the second quarter. With this growth, we eclipsed an exciting milestone. ADP TotalSource, already the largest PEO in the US, now supports more than 400,000 client employees. In fact, if ADP TotalSource were an independent employer, it would rank them on the top size private employers in the US.","On the new product front, while in its early days, we are excited about the progress we are making with our analytics platform called ADP DataCloud. During the quarter, we fully released the benchmarking capability with more than a 1,000 job titles, which allows our clients to generate actionable insights from workforce data embedded in their ADP HCM solutions. The benchmarking platform available for US companies draws aggregated and anonymized information from ADP\u2019s large US client base.","And of course, ADP\u2019s data advantage is a global one. During the quarter, we introduced the ADP France National Employment Report as part of our commitment to adding deeper insights into the labor markets globally and providing businesses, governments and others with a source of credible and valuable information. Similar to the US report, each month ADP will publish aggregated employment statistics from an anonymized sample drawing from 1.3 million workers included among ADP\u2019s client base in France.","Here is just a few examples of ADP\u2019s leadership in the HCM category, which continues to receive positive external recognition. Most recently, Ventana Research recognized our ADP Vantage platform with its Technology Innovation Award in the Business Innovation Category. In bestowing this honor, Ventana recognized us for our ability to \u201chelp employees not just the efficient through modern user experience, but actually enjoy working with the application\u201d. It\u2019s always gratifying to see the HCM community recognize the progress we have made with our platforms.","And now, I would like to give you an update on client retention. In the second quarter, ADP experienced a decline in retention of 120 basis points, which marks a sequential improvement over the first quarter. While we are disappointed to see this metric slip from its recent historical high, we are pleased that retention on our strategic platforms remains high. Consistent with the first quarter, the majority of the retention decline stems from clients on mature technology and we still believe that market activity from employers choosing their ACA providers has introduced a change event for our clients. Although disappointing, our management team remains focused on this metric and we have taken actions to address opportunities we have for improvement.","Our progress on client migrations remains a key area of focus for us. And based on the success we have seen in our small business services unit with all clients now on ADP RUN, we believe these migrations are the right thing for our clients and for the long-term success of our business. As evidence of this, in December, we reached a milestone as we were able to sunset the PCPW platform in the mid-market, a legacy payroll product.","Many clients have chosen ADP for our strength and expertise in compliance. We are in a time when the level of uncertainty in the regulatory environment is higher than it\u2019s been in decades. And as a result, our clients are even more reliant on our service teams. As a management team, we remain focused on the client experience, which includes staffing our service teams to the level appropriate for assisting our clients with these HCM needs. Since last quarter, we have hired over 1,000 associates to assist our clients and expect to receive the benefit of adding these talented people in the coming months. Once again, I want to thank and congratulate these new, as well as our tenured associates for their continued contributions to our success.","I\u2019ll wrap, which is one reflection from our ReThink Global HCM Conference, which I attended last week in Rome. There we had Executive HR, Finance, IT and Security leaders together to explore global perspectives around managing and cultivating the foundation of organizational success. It\u2019s clear that winning the war for talent as well as handling compliance on a global scale are critical issues facing businesses around the world. What\u2019s even clear to me is that no organization is better positioned to help these clients that we are.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our second quarter results and an update on our fiscal 2016 outlook.","Jan Siegmund","Thank you very much, Carlos and good morning everyone. During the quarter, we realized a gain of $14 million from the sale of the building. My comments on the quarter refer to adjusted results, which exclude the impact of this gain.","ADP revenues grew 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This growth includes approximately 1 percentage point of pressure due to the divestiture of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred at the end of the first quarter.","As Carlos mentioned, our new business bookings remained strong posting 15% growth for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings, before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 2% or 4% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 70 basis points compared to 18.7% in the last year's second quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 4% to $0.72 or 6% on a constant dollar basis, and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with the year ago.","The slower earnings growth we realized in the second quarter as well as the decline in margins were anticipated as we made planned investments to increase operational resources in support of our service teams and new product implementations. In addition, increased selling expenses resulting from higher than anticipated new business bookings also contributed to the slower growth.","In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 3% for the quarter or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was primarily driven by net new business additions in the quarter. As a reminder, new recurring revenue from ACA related modules is not expected to impact revenue growth until the third fiscal quarter.","As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 120 basis points for the quarter as we continued to experience an elevated losses from clients on legacy platforms. Our same-store pays per control metric in the US grew 2.5% in the second quarter. Average client fund balances grew 4% compared to a year-ago or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions from new business as well as increased pays per control.","Outside the US, growth in our multinational solutions remained strong. Employer Services margin declined about 30 basis points in the quarter due to planned investments that we have made in operational resources to install new business sold and provide services to our clients as well as higher selling expenses from continued strong new business bookings.","ADP's PEO continues to perform very well with revenue growth of 18% in the second quarter. As Carlos mentioned, the PEO reached a milestones in the quarter surpassing 400,000 average client employees to reach 403,000, which represents growth of 14%. We continue to see an increase in benefit plan participation rates from our work site employees, a trend we expect to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year. The PEO also continues to drive margin expansion through operating efficiencies expanding margins by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter.","We are pleased with the progress we've made through fiscal year - for the first half of fiscal year 2016, particularly with the success we have seen in new business bookings. As Carlos mentioned, we are now forecasting new business bookings growth of at least 12% compared to our prior forecast of at least 10%. As a result of this change to our expectations and the strengthening of the US dollar, which occurred towards the end of calendar year 2015, we have updated certain elements of our fiscal year 2016 forecast.","ADP now expects fiscal year 2016 revenue growth of about 7% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 8%. This change is due to higher than anticipated pressure from unfavorable foreign currency translation, which is now expected to impact our revenue growth by about 2 percentage points for the fiscal year.","On a constant dollar basis, ADP now expects revenue growth of 9%, which is the higher end of our previously forecasted range of 8% to 9%. This updated forecast reflects our increased expectations for new business bookings growth as well as our confidence in the recurring revenue, which will start from new solutions sold over the past three quarters. And as a reminder, this forecast also includes almost 1 percentage points of expected pressure from the sale of the AdvancedMD business which occurred toward the end of the first quarter.","For the Employer Services segment, revenue growth is anticipated to be 4% to 5% compared with our prior forecast of 5% to 6% due to higher than anticipated pressure from unfavorable foreign currency translation. On the constant dollar basis, revenue growth is now expected to be about 7% compared with our prior forecast of 6% to 7%. Due to the strong half performance - first half performance of the PEO, ADP is now anticipating 16% to 18% growth for this segment compared to our prior forecast of 15% to 17%. Our forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points is unchanged.","On a segment level, we are now expecting margin expansion of about 75 basis points in Employer Services compared with our prior forecast of about 100 basis points. Margin expansion expectations for the PEO remain unchanged. ADP has made some minor changes to our forecast for the client funds extended investment strategy to adjust for the December 2015 increase in the Fed funds rate as well as additional pressure anticipated from foreign currency translation that is expected to reduce our balance growth. These changes are not material to our overall forecast and the details can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 11% to 13% from the $2.89 in fiscal year 2015 compared with our prior forecast growth of 12% to 14%. This forecast reflects additional selling expenses anticipated from increased new business bookings, higher than anticipated pressure from unfavorable foreign currency translation which is assumed to have a negative impact of 1 to 2 percentage points on earnings per share growth. On a constant dollar basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be 12% to 14% compared with our prior forecast of 13% to 15% growth.","These changes to our full year outlook reflect the results of our first half and our expectations for the balance of the fiscal year 2016. However, we continue to acknowledge that changing factors in the marketplace due to uncertainty around ACA compliance could put a short-term strain on our earnings growth. We remain committed to our strategy and to our clients, which we believe will yield the best results for ADP over the long run.","So, with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Grossman from Stifel Financial.","David Grossman","Thank you. You mentioned that the Sunset PCPW platform in the mid-market during the quarter, given that a lot of the churn has happened in the legacy platform, should that favorably impact retention just arithmetically as we go into the back half of the year?","Carlos Rodriguez","So we have been keeping track of retention by platform which is obviously where we have the information about our legacy platforms versus our strategic platforms and there is no question that the PCPW platform as it got into its final stages of migrations had very low retention rate, but over the last 12 months that was relative to the total size of ADP and even to the size of our mid-market business, I would say that, it would not be a material change. We have other legacy products that are - the largest of more clients on them that are also underperforming from a retention standpoint that are greater focus for us than just a mathematical improvement from PCPW retirement, because it is just not mathematically, I think, significant because it's been waning over the last 12 months even as we got close to the final retirement of the final clients.","David Grossman","I see. So, I mean, if you step back and you just look at some of the some changes, Carlos, in the enterprise IP staff impact that\u2019s having on customer buying patterns, with that as a backdrop, are you seeing any change in the way the market is segmenting between those that choose a platform like ADP with services wrapped around it and the software-only platform and if you are, what are the key differentiators that are changing between the different buyers?","Carlos Rodriguez","I think if you take our new business bookings as an indication it would seem that there is still quite a lot of strength and interest in buying a solution that has services wrapped around it. And I think the fact that we\u2019ve had these robust sales around ACA compliance which does include a service component to it in terms of assistance with compliance, not just providing the software, reinforces our belief that we think our technology and services enabled model is the right model. It doesn\u2019t mean that other models are not good and that other people won\u2019t choose other models, but we like our approach and it seems to be frankly right now gaining traction in the marketplace.","David Grossman","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.","Jay Hanna","Hi, this Jay Hanna covering for Gary today. I just had a question regarding the buyback. Are you anticipating using any additional operating cash flow in addition to the $2 billion you already planned on the buyback or are you happy with the offering covering most of the buyback for the remainder over the next two years? Thanks.","Jan Siegmund","Jay, you will see our cash balances of slightly below $3 billion at the end of the quarter and we stopped really thinking in ADP about separating our initial debt offering from the cash at hand that is generated out of the operating cash flow. So we continue on our steady path of returning the cash to shareholders via an ongoing share buyback program and will proceed to work those cash balances down over time.","Jay Hanna","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins","Thank you. Good morning. Could you remind us where you are in the migration of midmarket clients to Workforce Now, so what percent are still on legacy platforms? And are the retention issues largely concentrated with those mid-market customers?","Carlos Rodriguez","Sara, we have a - I\u2019d give very rough numbers here to give you more an idea directionally around 75,000 clients in the mid-market and we have about 45,000 clients. So, around 60% or so on the latest version of Workforce Now. So this gives - answers also a little bit David\u2019s first question around the impact that the settlement of PCPW had. It was a small client base and we still have a large number of clients to be migrated in the remainder of this fiscal year and the next fiscal year. That's kind of - those are big milestones and we have communicated prior that we are anticipating to make significant progress towards the end fiscal year \u201817. That's still our plan.","Sara Gubins","Okay. And just from a retention perspective, is that really where the primary issue is?","Carlos Rodriguez","I think that\u2019s fair. I think that\u2019s what we said in the first quarter. There has really been no material change and again, I think that consistent with what we said in the first quarter, I think the piece of migrations was quite accelerated in the first quarter versus the prior year first quarter. And in the second quarter, it was the same, in part because we had a lot of migrations already in the pipeline and we had momentum. And so I think it\u2019s safe to say that we were on kind of in the same place, if you will, in terms of the pressure that migrations which were the benefit of hindsight and I take some accountability or I take all the accountability as the boss for this that migration is a very big priority for us, but not at any cost. And organizational, we have put a lot of focus and a lot of pressure and the organization as usual responded to the boss. And I think we may have overdone and created an inordinate amount of pressure on the organization as a result of the piece of migrations.","I think we also have mentioned that I think the ACA decisions that some of our mid-market clients were making, because in the up-market these are not decisions that you can make over the course of two or three months and in the low end of the market, it doesn\u2019t apply, because companies under 50 employees don\u2019t have to comply. So it really is a mid-market issue and we think it had an impact. We just don't know really how to measure that.","And then lastly, I also knowledge that I think we exited the last fiscal year with not enough resources to handle everything I just mentioned, the extra activity around migrations and all of the activity and noise around ACA. So as we\u2019ve mentioned in our comments we\u2019ve added resources and we've taken actions. This is not the first time - ACA is definitely a new factor and the pace of migrations is something that with the benefit of hindsight we probably stepped on the accelerator a little too fast, but we've been through this type of events before. It seems similar to prior times where there's really no concentration of any one particular competitor or any pattern that we can see other than self-inflicted wounds that are reparable and we are in the process of repairing them and we see some signs of improvement.","So despite the fact that we still have 40% of the clients in the mid-market, it doesn't necessarily mean that we will have to continue to see and we don't plan on continuing. We obviously have no - we don't provide a forecast and we don\u2019t provide guidance around retention, but I can assure you that we don\u2019t believe that we have to accept the retention levels that we have on our legacy platforms today. So we are not just standing idly by and continuing on the same pace of migrations and with the same actions and don't expect the same results going forward.","Sara Gubins","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Bernstein.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good morning, guys. Can you give any qualitative feedback that you get back from the sales teams out there around how clients are thinking about the ACA implementation and whether this is sort of it as we go through this season or whether you expect or they are anticipating making some additional changes over the next year?","Carlos Rodriguez","Maybe two comments. Number one, the number of clients that we now have and are eligible and which is the part that\u2019s eligible represents approximately - sold about half of our client base. So we still have I think another half of the client base that we expect to offer some future opportunities, although probably at a slower rate than we expect in the first year to sell the product. And then secondly, the product is for use on an ongoing basis, so it is not really just the implementation and the printing of tax form. It is an advisory tool that helps clients to manage actually their liabilities and the compliance on an ongoing basis, so it's really just a component of an HCM module that clients use and we expect the clients to benefit from it throughout the year as they keep the employees in compliance and like an ongoing tax filing offer.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo.","Rick Eskelsen","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess I was wondering if you could touch more on the new business bookings and talk about sort of the trends that you are seeing in terms of winning new clients versus expanding and up-selling with the existing clients? So what\u2019s been the biggest driver of the bookings beyond the ACA stuff that you are seeing? Thanks.","Carlos Rodriguez","Again, given that we historically don't get into a lot of detail for obviously competitive reasons on our new business bookings, in terms of breaking by segment or by product, but I think it's important for you to understand directionally. And so I think the wording we've used and I think it may have been in my comments or in Jan\u2019s opening comments is that clearly ACA added to our new business bookings growth and exceeded our - or allowed us to exceed our expectations in terms of bookings.","So I guess an indirect way of answering your question is that the long-term 8% to 10% new bookings growth that we strive for absent changes [indiscernible] ACA would be safe to say that this year we're on track to achieve that and that performance above and beyond that would be attributable to ACA. And of course that's only with six months done that could change in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. But I think right now based on the information we have and what we see in terms of market activity, I think that the fair way to look at it and it's important for all of you to understand that because as Jan said, even though we still have an opportunity in front of us, the opportunity is obviously smaller now then it was in the prior year.","And so, we don't expect to get as much lift, we hope we do, but we won't expect to get as much lift from ACA in fiscal 2017 in terms of our new bookings growth. Having said all that, most exciting thing for me around ACA and this event in general is it, it should and we hope will drive companies to look at the full HCM bundle. So ACA compliance really requires that you have information not just about how many employees and what they're paid but also about their time, how many hours they work per week, whether they have benefits or don't have benefits.","So having for example a Workforce Now platform like we in the mid-market really helps a lot with ACA compliance, not to mention that as we rollout analytics tool and other things to help manage people better those are also attractive features. So I think the combination of the improvements in our user experience, the information that we provide through analytics plus the advantages you get through compliance, we believe and this is our expectation and our hope is that that will continue to generate new business bookings growth in terms of clients and also sales dollars into the future even if the tailwind that we get from ACA diminishes a little bit in fiscal 2017.","Rick Eskelsen","Thank you, that's helpful. Just as a follow-up, I was wondering if you talk a little bit more on the mix shift that's you\u2019re seeing in terms of the strong new business bookings and still some challenges with the retention. Any margin implications we should be thinking about here longer term from that mix shift? Thank you.","Jan Siegmund","As you saw our adjustment for the forecasts on margins it\u2019s really primarily driven by only two factors. It's driven by higher selling expense, which is, levels above our long-term expectation of new business bookings growth and FX. So, you saw that in that we upped our revenue guidance for the year on a constant dollar basis on a slightly, which kind of takes into account the cost for a higher selling more clients and of course slightly elevated retention if you will. So it's all contemplated in this overall. So the recent adjustment of the margin has really mostly to do with FX and selling expense.","Carlos Rodriguez","And I think the base - mathematically with the information that we have today and baked into our forecast is an assumption that despite the pressure we're getting from retention, our revenue growth is accelerating as a result of our strong new business bookings growth. So I think net-net, Jan and I are happy, and I think the organization is very happy because obviously that growth rate, our plan obviously is to get retention stabilized and to make improvements in that area as you've heard because of our additional resources. Assuming that we do that and acceleration in our long-term revenue growth rate is very, very positive for ADP because of the recurring revenue nature and the lifetime value of these clients that we're bringing in.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI.","David Togut","Thank you, I appreciate the helpful detail you gave on the remaining conversion schedule, the Workforce Now. Just taking a step back, should we expect client retention to begin to improve again once you complete the conversion to Workforce Now or you just in general seeing much greater competition in the mid-market. And so retention should be something we should keep an eye on even post the conversion to Workforce Now.","Carlos Rodriguez","Again, consistent with what we mentioned in the first quarter and I think mentioned a few minutes ago, we have information around both our sales successes against competitors and we also information around our lawsuits against competitors. So unless all of the sudden all of the competitors got together and did something different, there would be nothing in our information that shows that this is a competitive issue in terms of what's driving our retention. So, I think that's one answer to the - one part of the answer to the question.","So again, note we don't see any changes in the pricing environment or in the competitive environment. In terms of you know the conversions and immigrations; it is clear as we're pointing out that we're getting pressure on legacy platforms. But it doesn't mean that we can have a better retention rate even on the legacy platform. So, take the example of our down market SBS business. In that business, we went through a migration similar to the one we're describing in majors over the course of multiple years. And as in this case, you have to balance speed with the desire to get done. And in that case, I think we've felt some level of pressure around retention at various points and when we were done with that migration, our retention rates have definitely improved.","So they just didn't stabilize but they improved. But in the case of that client migration, we did not encounter some of these - what we term as self-inflicted wounds that we're having here that we believe we can address and we believe we can correct as we're going through the migration. So again, the problem is there is a lot of uncertainty and it's you know very would be I think responsible for us to make definitive statements because we just don't know for sure but I want to make sure that everyone is very, very clear that we believe that we can impact the retention rates in the mid-market even as we're doing these migrations. And I also everybody to understand that we're not going to stop doing the migrations, but we will moderate, we still are on track to be finished by the end of fiscal '17, which was our original plan but the pace at which we do these and the timing of when we do them, I think we will do on our terms in order to maximize the balance between client retention and also the long-term health of our business and what's right for our clients.","David Togut","Thank you that's very helpful. Just a quick follow-up. Recognizing you don't give guidance beyond the current year, I'm just trying to understand clearly the bookings growth has been terrific and well above expectations. Client retention possibly could be an issue going into '17 as you continue to convert from legacy mid-market onto Workforce Now. Should we think of the retention issue with being offset by the stronger bookings trajectory or should we think that the retention issue potentially could be an issue for FY17 and beyond?","Carlos Rodriguez","So, I'm going to let Jan make a comment but you should again back to the discussion we had about PCPW, just if you think about this mathematically, clearly as we continue to migrate clients, the number of clients on legacy platforms becomes smaller and smaller and mathematically has a smaller and smaller impact on our retention rate. So I would just caution a linear assumption around retention into 2017 even though that's clearly a possibility. But I would caution against making that assumption because that base of clients is becoming smaller and smaller and will have a smaller impact of our overall retention rate.","I also want to just reiterate and I'll let Jan weigh in, what we just said earlier, which is, at this point our new business bookings is more than offsetting the pressure we're having from retention. And our revenue growth rate we moved up in terms of our guidance for this year and we're very, very happy with where we are versus our long term range. We have said in the first quarter and we'll say again today that in the second half of this fiscal year on a constant dollar basis, if you adjust for the AdvancedMD disposition which typically would have been included in discontinued ops but because of accounting changes is not in discontinued ops, so if you adjust for that, we will be at the high-end of our long-term revenue growth guidance.","Jan Siegmund","And David I think, while we don't give guidance for fiscal year '17, of course I have to wait for two quarters for that. I have only maybe one more comment to emphasize I think in the script call I said, retention of our strategic platforms remains very good. So and I think out of that you can deduct that as that base is growing there should be a mathematical re-weighing of the retention rate that will help and plus what we hope to achieve an improvement of retention in the legacy base. So, those things together plus our revenue update guidance, I think sends you the signal about how we think about the impact on retention really.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of SKPrasad Borra from Goldman Sachs.","SKPrasad Borra","Thanks for taking my question. Carlos, just on the client migrations levels, can you remind us what was the client migration level in mid-market beginning of calendar 2015. And also a small clarification is the FY17 objective for only for mid-market or does that apply to up market as well?","Jan Siegmund","So I - you addressed it to Carlos, but I'll give you some idea. We migrated almost 7,000 clients in the first quarter of fiscal year '16 in the mid-market and close to 4,000 clients in the second quarter; year-end slowed migrations down a little bit and for the reasons that Carlos described obviously that tempered a little bit in the second half of the last quarter. So that migration pace compared to the prior year was accelerated as we increased the resources available to them. So you should expect basically continued focus on migrations maybe at a similar level as last year maybe slightly accelerated, we're going to go and determine that as operations allow to maintain our goal of finishing migrations, the vast majority of migrations in the mid-market by the end of fiscal year '17. So that's the goal, the up market migrations will be a multi-year effort and we're going to proceed together in partnership with our clients and I don't think we're going to give specific migration numbers for the up market, will be an ongoing effort to move those clients.","SKPrasad Borra","Jan, this question is definitely for you. Just on the margins, obviously ACA business is the mix of products, services and various offerings from your end. To the point you can clarify, is the margin profile of the ACA business going to be post all this implementation costs and higher selling costs. Is the margin profile going to be more closer to the products business or is it going to be closer to the PEO business.","Jan Siegmund","Well that is a loaded question because the PEO has pass-throughs in its P&L and if you exclude the pass-throughs from the P&L, PEO margins you'll see actually there even slightly ahead of our ES margins. So, the characteristic of ADP and then very interesting way is that we have a margin profile that is actually very similar between our product sets and even our HR BPO products excluding the pass-throughs have margin characteristics that are roughly in line for most of the cases with our overall margin profiles. So if you think about ADP as a kind of growth margin for an ongoing contribution of the recurring revenue model. The ACA product is to have - expected to have exactly that margin profile. So we don't think about it in anyway different than the rest of our product set.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra","Hello. This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. A quick question on the PEO, the gap between revenues and the worksite that was 4% this quarter. So on the last call, you had mentioned that it may normalize to 2 to 3 points, but it looks like it's trending north of it. I was just wondering do you continue to see some good traction there on the benefit adoption, what's driving it and how do you think about that gap going forward for the rest of the year?","Carlos Rodriguez","Yeah. I think that you hit the nail on the head, which has been the benefits. The number of clients selecting and the number of worksite employees selecting benefits does have an impact on the growth of our top line revenue versus worksite employee growth because of the pass-through nature of the benefits revenues. And so we do have a chart that shows and I think we may have even mentioned it in our comments in the script that the benefits participation rate is trending upwards, so it had been trending downwards several years ago pre-ACA, and now it's trending upwards, it's not a dramatic increase, but it's enough to help drive additional difference between our worksite employee growth and our top line revenue growth, which is why it\u2019s so important until we get the margin dynamics of that business, excluding those pass-through revenues.","Ashish Sabadra","That's great color. And then quickly on the pricing, you\u2019re in the peak selling season, are you seeing any shift in the pricing environment?","Jan Siegmund","No. We observe pricing very closely and two factors are important. One is our discounting levels, as we distribute new business in our new business bookings and those discounting levels have been very consistent with prior quarters, so no change in the marketplace. And secondly, we indicated that our long-term goal is to have price increases to our client base closer to 50 basis points than the historic 100 basis points and we're trending right along that, right in between this year, a little bit less than a percent of price increases to our client base, unchanged and 100% in line with our expectations.","Ashish Sabadra","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hussain from Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Hussain","Hi, Carols and Jan. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a couple of clarifying questions about new business bookings. So first on your back half guidance, it seems to bake in 10% growth, is that just conservatism given you\u2019re not really sure what demand for ACA would look like in the next couple of quarters or are you actually already seeing some slowdown there?","And then secondly, I know new business bookings is at the run rate revenue number, so wouldn't there be FX impact in there as well, and therefore with newer bookings a couple of points higher, or would it be very similar given a lot of that came from the ACA product, which is mostly US? Thanks.","Carlos Rodriguez","I think at the risk of getting into trouble, I think the answer is yes to both questions, but it is what our forecast is. So I think you\u2019re mathematically correct about second-half bookings growth, so I don't think we want to say much more, rather than its accurate that we have no real definite sense of what's going to happen in terms of the tailwind around ACA in the second half and hence it is what it is, in terms of our forecast.","And then the second part of your question is accurate, too, I would just remind you that our bookings outside of the US are not a large part of the overall sales result, but there would be some impact from FX in it. That would be a fair statement. But I would not quantify a couple of percentage points extra growth in new business bookings.","Jan Siegmund","I think that's fair. And maybe one point that we finished our last fiscal year 2015 in the fourth quarter with a very, very strong quarter. So there is a big growth over in the fourth quarter that you would also have to consider. So that probably factored also in our overall expectations.","Daniel Hussain","Got it. Thanks. And then maybe a high-level question on PEO, so it's been growing at a healthy pace for the past 15 years or so since you've been in the business, and I imagine a lot of your customer base has now been educated about it or has heard of it, but at the same time, the value prop seems to be increasing over time, so just in that context, is there a way that you can help us think about maybe what inning we\u2019re in, in terms of double-digit growth or is it just really hard to tell and it just depends too much on regulation and insurance, and so forth?","Carlos Rodriguez","Well, again, I am not going to attempt to answer that question, because if you had asked me that question six or seven years ago, I would have probably said that it was going to get really, really hard because how big the business had gone. So we\u2019re selling now just each month, the number of worksite employees we have to sell in order to and start in order to maintain this growth rate is close to what the size of the business was when I first entered that business, because that's where I started my career was in a PEO. I then got acquired by ADP. So I\u2019m the wrong person to answer that question in terms of, because it is large numbers, it\u2019s becoming - as we said, it\u2019s now one of the largest private employers in the US, but it is a very, very strong value proposition with very strong momentum and very talented management team.","So we definitely don't have any plans to slow it down and to see a slowdown because on a per client or per worksite employee basis, no matter how you look at it, that business is a winner for ADP. And we convert about half of the business that starts into PEO, comes from existing ADP clients that we upsell and that's an incredibly powerful formula for us because I think we are one of the few that have that advantage of having the salesforce and the installed client base that we have that we have the ability to upgrade. So we\u2019re very, very happy with that business and we hope that it continues to grow at these robust rates.","Daniel Hussain","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","Thanks. Just two questions, just on the upper end of the market or the enterprise side of the market, what's going on there in terms of sales and retention, any change in trend there given the macro?","Carlos Rodriguez","Again, I will say that we try to avoid for a variety of reasons getting into specifics by segment or by business unit. But I think it's safe to say that we don't see any - in that business, you do have to look at it, I think multiple quarters, I think one month or a couple of months does not make a trend, just because of the lumpiness of that business, but I think if you look at our upmarket business overall, I don't think we see any material change. I think our vantage platform is still selling well. Our multinational international platform is selling well. I think on the retention front, there is really nothing to report either in terms of any trends. So I think that we\u2019re I guess satisfied with that business in terms of - well, obviously, we'd love to have more, but I don't think there is anything material to report in the upmarket.","Tien-tsin Huang","Thank you for that. And then just on the PEO, just one question there, just with I guess Paychex, they\u2019ve introduced minimum premium plan and I guess TriNet is also looking to make some changes in how they handle the risk side of insurance. Given all these changes, does that create share opportunity for ADP and are you considering making some changes as well, I'm assuming not, but I figured that out, given some of the changes happening in the marketplace?","Carlos Rodriguez","I think we\u2019re always looking at all of our options, but there is no current plans to make any changes and we have really no way of knowing what competitive impact it's going to have in terms of what other people are doing.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird.","Mark Marcon","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions as well. Just on the PEO side, you mentioned that half of the clients are basically existing payroll clients. Can you describe a little bit how much more profitable or what the revenue uptick is when we typically go through a conversion from a payroll centric to a more comprehensive PEO solution?","Carlos Rodriguez","Excluding pass-throughs, it obviously depends on what the client had when they were a payroll client and depends on what the pricing is when they become a PEO client, but you can think of the range being between 8 and 10 times multiple of revenue on a net basis, excluding pass-throughs.","Mark Marcon","That's great. And then - when we talk about the new bookings, how much of the new bookings is from upsells of either modules or versus brand-new clients?","Jan Siegmund","Mark, historically, our mix has been 50-50, about 50% of bookings roughly towards new client counts and logos and 50% of upsell. And but obviously at the elevated levels of ACA selling, the mix has shifted a little bit because most of the ACA has been really selling to our existing client base. So in the current year, that mix is a little shifted, but as we indicated without ACA, we would have grown with our long-term expectation of new business bookings going up 8% to 10% for that component that roughly holds in line.","Mark Marcon","Great. And then you mentioned 14,000 clients using you for the ACA, can you give us a percentage of the core target there in terms of the companies, above 50 employees, but not overly huge that are using you for the ACA, like how far penetrated are you?","Jan Siegmund","I think we have captured about half of the opportunity in total. At the large market, this is a smaller number. So at these ranges, it doesn't really make that big of a difference to include them or not include them. So I think we have captured about half the opportunity.","Sara Grilliot","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Jim Macdonald from First Analysis.","Jim Macdonald","Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in. With the fall selling season over, could you talk about if there are any qualitative differences, like more active than normal or people frozen because of the ACA or?","Carlos Rodriguez","I think based on our results, excitement would be the qualitative description.","Jim Macdonald","Okay. So you are at success. And then you mentioned that the ACA revenue would be more felt in the third quarter and that was maybe for the modules. I know you\u2019ve been charging monthly to some people, could you just talk about how the revenue from ACA will dovetail in?","Jan Siegmund","Yes. It is a monthly per employee charge that the clients start to incur with really January or February, depending on when they launch their product. So you will see the full swing of our implementations that we finished in December into January by building up, and that's basically reflected in our revenue guidance as Carlos indicated we will reach kind of by the end of the year the double-digit revenue growth, 10% revenue growth if you adjust for FX impact of the AdvancedMD business. So you will see it kind of from our current organic growth rate accelerating to those levels in order for us to make the full-year guidance.","Jim Macdonald","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.","Carlos Rodriguez","So thank you all for joining the call today. We\u2019re obviously halfway through this fiscal year and I think we\u2019ve described some of the challenges we still have ahead of us, but obviously we\u2019re very happy with the progress we've made. I don't usually use the word, exciting, but I just used it in the last question to describe how we feel about our new business bookings growth. Clearly getting some help from ACA compliance, but it\u2019s really an incredible achievement to have the kind of bookings growth that we have this year on top of what we had last year.","I want also just to remind the folks on the call that we still remain committed to the shareholder friendly option that we've always been committed to around share repurchases and increasing our dividend. And I want to end by, besides thanking all of you for joining us and thanking you for your interest in ADP, I just want to end by saying that there has always been a strong work ethic here at ADP. But over the last 12 months, it has been a very challenging environment for our associates with the ACA rollout and some of the challenges we've had around our resource constraints.","So, I once again would like to thank all of our associates for their dedication to ADP and more importantly to our clients. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a good day."],"2636":["Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) Q1 2014 Earnings Call October 30, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Elena Charles","Carlos A.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Q1 2014 Automatic Data Processing Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Elena Charles, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elena Charles","Thank you. I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call and webcast.","Starting today, we are modifying how we conduct ADP's investors calls. We are no longer speaking to formal presentation slides; however, a slide deck containing this quarter's financial results has been posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at adp.com.","As a reminder, the quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings for our reportable segments is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website. These schedules have been updated to include the first quarter of fiscal 2014. When you review these schedules, it is important to note that we have made changes to what is included in our segment reporting to align our financial reporting with how management views the businesses.","As a result, effective this quarter, we are no longer allocating a cost of capital charge to the segments and all prior periods presented have been restated to conform.","Additionally, we are no longer restating prior year segment results for current year budgeted foreign exchange rates for these periods.","Rather, the segment results for the current and prior periods are presented at actual foreign exchange rate.","As a result of these changes, you will no longer see reconciling items on our website schedules attributable to cost of capital or foreign exchange.","And as we have gotten feedback from many of you on the effect of our restatements, the effect that the restatements have had on your model, this should greatly simplify your process.","I'd like to remind everyone that during today's conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risks, and these are discussed in our earnings release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos for his opening remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Elena. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to start the discussion with an update on how we are executing against our growth strategy and focus my comments on Human Capital Management, which we refer to as HCM.","I will also provide my thoughts on our results and update you on how our business is doing. Then Jan will take you through the financial highlights for the quarter and our current forecast before we take your questions.","From an overall standpoint, ADP is growing its integrated suite of cloud-based HCM, benefits and payroll solutions, which is at the core of who we are. I'm pleased to state that ADP is delivering on this growth initiative by enhancing and innovating across our HCM platforms for companies of all sizes.","Our RUN platform for small businesses continues to sell well. Through our deep experience in servicing this segment of the market, ADP understands that small business owners need work solutions that are as effective as those used by larger organizations.","We're pleased by the continued success of RUN and have about 285,000 clients on this platform.","In fact, the number of RUN clients now exceeds the number of clients on our former platform by more than 2:1.","We also recently introduced exciting enhancements to our ADP Workforce Now and ADP Vantage HCM solutions in the U.S.","Today, more than 40,000 employers who use these integrated platforms can benefit from some exciting innovations. We've added analytics that support data-driven decision-making, a new digital document management solution that stores the myriad of employee records within ADP's secure ecosystem, which average about 50 documents per employee, and a new global human resources system of record for U.S.-based midsize and larger businesses that helps to manage employee populations in multiple countries.","It's important to note that our global Human Resources system of record build on ADP's long-standing expertise in managing the global needs of businesses.","And finally, we've enhanced ADP's mobile solutions app, which is already used by nearly 1.5 million workers and is frequently rated as a top business app in iTunes.","We realize that both employers and employees are dramatically changing how they do business and mobile is a large part of that story. I'm proud that ADP is pushing the boundaries of how mobile solutions help employers and employees manage their Human Resources need, and I view this as a market differentiator.","The last product innovation that I want to leave you with today is our next-generation recruiting platform that we just introduced to the public at ADP's first innovation day. This sophisticated recruiting platform is a significant enhancement that rounds out the spectrum of our HCM solutions set. Its deep integration with social media differentiates ADP in the marketplace and is an important means for employers to identify top talents and communicate with prospective employees.","I also want to discuss the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as ACA. You've heard us say that compliance has always been a key part of ADP's value proposition. And we believe that the ACA creates opportunity for ADP to assist our clients in managing numerous compliance requirements.","ADP is uniquely positioned at the intersection of payroll, time and attendance and benefit administration, which is the core of our HCM solutions, making our platforms ideal for employers to navigate their responsibilities under ACA. I hope you're as excited as I am about the new innovations ADP has brought to market, and I look forward to sharing more with you on future calls.","Now let's move to the first quarter results. ADP reported solid results for the first quarter, starting the fiscal year with strong revenue and earnings growth.","I'm pleased that revenues grew 8% and earnings per share grew 10%. Our business segments performed well and achieved solid revenue growth during the quarter with good pretax margin expansion. Jan will take you through more of the details, but before he does, I'll provide you some comments on our business segments and more detail on Employer Services and PEO Services new bookings.","Overall, Employer Services delivered solid results. The integration of Payroll S.A., a small but strategic acquisition we completed in Latin America in last year's fourth quarter is going well, and the business is performing in accordance with our expectations.","Worldwide client revenue retention continued at a very strong level. As you read in this morning's press release, new business bookings growth from Employer Services and PEO was 1%.","I want to remind you that in our last call, we've stated that our past experiences with very strong year end finishes, as with the case with this fourth quarter, often lead to soft first quarter bookings growth.","In the U.S., small business bookings were very strong. However, large multinational enterprise market bookings fell short of last year's first quarter, due in large part to a very strong finish in fiscal 2013.","I also want to remind you that these larger transactions create lumpiness in bookings growth from quarter-to-quarter.","In the U.S., we are actively rebuilding the pipeline for potential new transactions.","For large multinational companies, I'm pleased that the pipeline for potential multinational transactions for our GlobalView platform is growing. And we're investing in our sales force and plan to increase our sales headcount by 4% for the year.","Our hires will be concentrated upmarket in the U.S. and in markets outside the U.S.","Having said all this, we are confirming our guidance of 8% to 10% growth in new business bookings for the year.","Turning from Employer Services, the PEO continue to grow nicely. Our PEO is the largest in the U.S. in terms of worksite employees, and I'm excited that we reached a new milestone, serving 300,000 worksite employees during the quarter.","Moving on to Dealer Services. The outlook for the automotive landscape in North America is good, and the market forecast for calendar year 2013 vehicle sales is strong.","The automotive landscape across Continental Europe is still soft, though our International business continues to grow on strength in the Asian markets.","Dealer Services is also innovating through continued investment in digital and layered applications.","For example, Dealer has exciting new cloud-based workflow platforms to seamlessly join predictive digital advertising in a superior consumer experience while significantly improving dealership productivity.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jan to provide the financial highlights and a look at the full year forecast.","Jan Siegmund","Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. ADP delivered strong revenue growth of 8% for the quarter. Over 7% of this growth was organic. We achieved 7% pretax earnings growth, 9% net earnings growth on a lower effective tax rate and 10% EPS growth on fewer shares outstanding. These are very solid results in my view, and I'm pleased that revenue growth was strong across our business segments.","Employer Services grew total revenues 8%, the PEO grew 12% and Dealer grew 7%.","In Employer Services, revenue growth was across-the-board. Each of our strategic pillars, Human Capital Management, our HR BPO solutions, global and adjacent solutions contributed to growth this quarter.","We continue to focus on providing excellent service to our clients, and as a result, we continue to enjoy strong client revenue retention.","Additionally, as we continue to successfully migrate our existing client base to ADP Workforce Now and sell more bundled HCM solutions in the mid and large markets, we believe client retention rates are higher than our older standalone solutions.","Same-store pays per control in U.S. Employer Services were strong, with an increase of 2.6%. However, same-store pays per control declined 0.8% across Europe as anticipated.","Although the Eurozone recession has officially ended, economic growth lags the U.S. and unemployment remains high.","Average client fund balances were strong during the quarter, increasing 8%, driven by new client growth, especially in small business services and increased pays per control.","The positive impact from the January 1, 2013 expiration of Social Security tax holidays also contributed to balanced growth, and once anniversaried, the year-over-year comparison for balanced growth is expected to become more difficult in the second half of the year.","Additionally, the holding period for certain tax liabilities was larger in the quarter than in last year's first quarter due to certain remittance dates falling on a weekend this year, and we anticipate this will reverse on us as we progress through the fiscal year.","The PEO had a solid quarter with 12% revenue growth, driven by 11% average worksite employee growth.","First quarter new business bookings were strong in the PEO. Moving on to Dealer Services. The North America core business drove just over half of the revenue growth in the quarter and benefited from continued strong transactional revenues. Revenues from digital advertising, websites and search are strong and growing.","ADP's overall total pretax margin declined slightly for the quarter. Margin expansion in the business segments was offset by the negative impact from the decline in high-margin client fund interest revenues due to lower interest rates.","The strong pretax margin expansion in both Employer Services and in Dealer Services was driven primarily by operating leverage.","The lower level of new business bookings for Employer Services resulted in slower growth in sales cost, which benefited the Employer Services margin this quarter, but is anticipated to turn around as the fiscal year progresses.","As Carlos mentioned, we are confirming our full year new bookings forecast.","In achieving this bookings forecast, we anticipate that next quarter's sales expense will grow faster and, therefore, not contribute to the pretax margin expansion at the same level as we saw this quarter. The success achieved by our in-house sales organization is another area of positive contribution to pretax margin expansion. We are seeing the benefit from their use of online tools to drive efficiency and to better partnering with our feet-on-the-street sales force. And before we leave the discussion on the quarter's results, I want to point out that the decline in client interest revenues resulting from low interest rates continues to be the most significant drag on ADP's result.","As anticipated, ADP's revenue growth was muted, nearly 1 percentage point as the lower yield more than offset the benefit from the 8% growth in balances.","Pretax margin was negatively impacted by 110 basis points, and diluted earnings per share was lower by 3% or 5 percentage points for the quarter -- by $0.03, I apologize, or 5 percentage points for the quarter.","Excluding this impact, it is evident that the leverage in ADP's business model is strong and intact.","The important takeaway I want to leave you with related to the client fund investment strategy is that we believe the bottom of the cycle in terms of size of the year-over-year decline was last fiscal year and the worst is behind us.","Now looking ahead for the year, I am pleased to reaffirm our initial financial 2014 guidance that we provided to you on August 1.","And before we take your questions, I want to remind you that ADP has continued its shareholder-friendly actions. We've repurchased 4.2 million ADP shares in the quarter for a total cost of $303 million.","I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of Paul Thomas with Goldman Sachs.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, I'm starting off on the new sales growth. Was any hesitation related to the government shut down? At least, in magnitude, the drop looks similar to what we saw last year ahead of the fiscal cliff. And any update on new sales 1 month into the December quarter?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that when you think about the timing of when the shutdown took place, it doesn't feel like it was a major factor. I think we believe that a bigger factor was the very strong finish in the fourth quarter. When we look at our overall sales results, we had really good results that were in line with our expectations in every segment except for the upmarket, where there is a great deal more lumpiness, and we've -- this theme has been recurring for years if not decades at ADP, that it's when you have a very, very strong finish in a large market, it tends to drain the pipeline into the following quarter. So we believe that that was a -- the most significant factor was the strong finish in 2013, and then just poor execution on our part overall of not making sure that we have sufficient pipeline in going into the first quarter. We also had a difficult compare over last year's first quarter, so that also doesn't help. But I wouldn't ascribe a great deal of blame to the government shutdown, at least not on our sales results, perhaps on what you saw this morning with the employment report and maybe other factors, and our October results may have been affected by some chipping away of confidence or whatever you want to call it as a result of the government shutdown. But the quarter was basically done by the time the government shutdown issues really emerged.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you spoke in the past about your new sales goals for the year, you expect to meet those roughly half from sales force productivity and half from headcount growth. The 4% increase in headcount you talked about, was that in reaction to the slow start of the year, or was that already part of your plan entering the fiscal year?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It's actually a great question. As I was reading it, I was wondering if someone would ask that question because it's a logical question, and no, we were just kind of reaffirming that we are -- we have a few other things that we're going to talk about that we're continuing to invest in on the sales cycle, like we're doing a lot of investment in search engine marketing and trying to increase the number of leads to our sales force. We're also investing in headcounts. So no, there was no -- that comment was really just to reaffirm that we're doing the same things we've always been doing, so you didn't get the impression that we had under-invested or that we were under-investing in sales. So that is in line with our plans, and we just wanted to make sure that we reaffirm that.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. One more from my end. On your innovation day, you highlighted some of the new document management and recruiting functions. And I just want to be clear on as part of the product refresh, were there any features added specifically for the reporting requirements of the Affordable Care Act? You talked a little bit about that in your prepared comments. Is there more to come or you're expecting those to be met with the features you already have?","Jan Siegmund","No, there will be, through the reporting but also through workflow adjustments, specific use cases. They relate mostly to the management of part-time versus full-time employees and other enrollment actions in each of them. So the reporting will support, but there will be also these use cases that flow in workflow streams through the -- both the HCM applications.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We do have -- we have a dedicated group working on solutions to help with compliance of ACA. And we have had one thing that we already had that helped our clients just from a communications standpoint regarding ACA, but it didn't really require any technology. It was basically a communication to all employees about their coverage that was required as part of the ACA.","Operator","Your next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Ashish Sabadra, calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. I just have a follow-up question on the sales bookings. So you highlighted that the bookings were strong in the small businesses, the weakness was mostly in the national accounts, I believe. How about the mid-market? If you could just provide some more color by different size, merchant sizes? And also going -- just to follow-up on that, going into your peak selling season, how do you feel about the competitive environment? And if you could just comment on that as well.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","In terms of some additional color on sales, I think in the fourth quarter call, we talked about, again, just to reiterate, when we have, just voice of experience, when we have these strong finishes, and we really did have an exceptionally strong finish in the fourth quarter of '13, we always tend to struggle in terms of in the first quarter. So we had plans, and I think we signaled that in our last call that our sales growth, we don't disclose quarterly sales growth in terms of our plans, but I think we did signal that we expected the first quarter to be below the full year in terms of sales growth. And of course, that's what we've got. This was obviously even below what we expected, the 1%. We expect the weakness anyway. And so the rest of the business units outside of the upmarket basically delivered results in line with those expectations. So not in the strong double-digits because of the strong finish we had in 2013, but in, call it, the high-single digits, which we consider to be strong based on the backdrop of the strong finish in 2013. So really, the entire sales force performed as expected, and in our view, in a strong manner, except for the upmarket. In terms of going into the selling season, you heard us reaffirm our guidance. We believe we have the headcount, we believe we have the products, and we believe we need to execute in order to hit those numbers. So we don't -- at least right now, it's too early for us to say that we either can't make it or that we're going to exceed it. So that's why we kept the guidance the same in the 8% to 10% range. So I think that would tell you that we have not seen any material difference in the competitive environment, our ability to win, and we expect to have a very strong selling season.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up on pricing, have you changed any -- have you seen any change in pricing dynamics in the industry?","Jan Siegmund","No, we have not seen any material change in the pricing dynamics in any of our markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Mihalos from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just to go back one final time on the new sales growth. Is there a way to think about the percentage of new sales that typically comes in through the first quarter as we go through the year?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I seriously doubt that would be the last question about sales, but we'll answer your question anyway. So Jan may be busily trying to find what that percentage is, but it's not 25% because our first quarter skew is typically lower than the third -- I'm sorry, than the second and the third quarters, so I'm confident that it is less than 25%, but I don't know the exact number. And so I think your math -- I think it's a fair question. I don't think it helps us that much. We still have a lot of work to do, so we'll have a lot of wood to chop to get back up to the 8% to 10% range. Because although it's true that the first quarter isn't as important as other quarters, it's -- we have big numbers. These are -- we have one -- I think our forecast for the year is over $1.4 billion in sales. So even if the first quarter is 20% and another quarter is 28% or 30%, it's still challenging. We have a lot of work to do.","Jan Siegmund","We don't disclose our quarterly sales volumes, but the skewing is in a few percentage points, not in the double-digit changes.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on Europe. I think you said that pays per control were down 0.8%. I think that was largely in line with what you saw last quarter, if I'm not mistaken. Do you think that Europe in aggregate is starting to bottom?","Jan Siegmund","This is a question that I also discussed at length with the team. I was, last couple of weeks ago, in Europe, and I'm trying to sniff out if we see the early signs of that recovery, and it's really exactly the same number that we had in the last quarter. Notionally, we would feel it should have bottomed out and we want to see slight improvements. But -- and that's kind of what the gut feel tells you and me, but the numbers are really exactly what we expected and we have not seen an upshift. But it's almost smelling that there could spring in the air, but we have not seen it in the numbers. It continues to be that Southern Europe is struggling, and that's where most of the challenges are, and then the core countries feel like that they're kind of at the verge of getting better.","Operator","Your next question is from Sara Gubins with Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'll start off with an HCM question. How do you think employers are thinking about switching HCM providers as opposed to upgrading systems? And I'm wondering, because there's been some research that suggested that there would be more interest in replacement as opposed to upgrades now versus in the past, and I'm kind of wondering what you think about that and what it could mean for ADP.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We've seen, I think, a lot of different research that comes to -- everybody has different conclusions depending on who funds the research, that's why we prefer independent research. The -- I think there's no question that the changes in technologies infrastructure around cloud have created a potential opening for people to reconsider and think, not just for HCM, but other parts of their business, how they use technology and whether they want to make those infrastructure investments themselves or they want to have them reside in someone else's backyard. And so, I think it is possible that the acceptance and the growth of cloud-based solutions across multiple industries will create a greater propensity or more openness towards potentially switching versus simply just upgrading, so that's a possibility. We believe that we would be beneficiaries of that because at the end of the day, we are kind of the ultimate cloud provider and have always kind of provided our clients on a hosted basis, if you will, on an outsourced basis. So I think the willingness of people to rethink how they do things and willingness to outsource more around their infrastructure in the cloud, I think, is something that we hope will benefit us.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then a question on RUN and EasyPay. Is the overall count of clients, when you combine RUN and EasyPay, going up? And given the shift of the pace towards RUN, do you think it will still take about 18 months to get everybody on RUN or could that actually happen faster? And if it does, if you could talk about the cost benefit of maybe not having to run EasyPay, that would be great.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes. The combination of EasyPay and RUN, our unit growth is in the 4% to 5% range year-over-year, which is quite strong. I'm looking for a fact check on that, but it's in the 4% to 5% range, which obviously we're extremely pleased with that because it does feel like we're gaining market share and, certainly, doing well against the competition in that space. So we are selling very little EasyPay now, so obviously, it's just a combination of what we're selling and what we have on RUN and then what is attriting, if you will, on EasyPay. But to answer your question if you combine those 2 is that we have very good growth in that part of our business. And as we disclosed our unit growth numbers overall for ADP, it is important to remember that, because of the skewing of how many clients we have in that space, which is over 400,000, it does tend to skew the growth number. In other words, i.e. most of the growth for units for us is taking place in that space, in the combination of RUN and EasyPay. And I'm sorry, the second part of your question was?","Jan Siegmund","On migration.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","On migration. How could I forget? That was one of my favorite topics. So we're having some internal discussions, if you will. I would almost call them fun, if they weren't so serious about how fast we can get off of EasyPay. Because we do think that it has a value financially for us, which is I think the nature of your question, but it has also much more value for us symbolically, right, in terms of our push to just overall focus more on migrations not just in small business, but really across all of ADP. So this concept of really simplifying our platforms and migrating clients is a big deal for us internally. We don't talk about it a lot externally, but we do have a lot of focus on it. So as of right now, I have a discussion last week with the leader of that business, Anish, who is -- they're working very, very hard on bringing that 18-month time horizon in closer to 12 to 15 months. But we also don't want to obviously leave clients to the competition. And so we want to make sure that we migrate those clients in an orderly fashion and that we consider what their needs are and that we make sure that we have the right level of support and service for them when we bring them onto RUN. So I would say that the short answer to your question is that 18 months at the longest, and I'm hoping that it is shorter than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Carlos, you addressed the migration timeline from EasyPay to RUN, but could you also give us an update on the timeline to Workforce Now?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I know Jan is going to give you some of the specifics. But again, anecdotally, I also happen to speak with the other -- the leader of that business, Regina, last week as well, and very, very pleased with the progress in our mid-market in terms of client migrations as well there. So heard some -- seen some really great results in terms of some older versions, if you will, of Workforce Now, our previous platform, PCPW, and another one, Pay eXpert, that have been -- a couple of which have been retired. So we still have work to do to get all of our mid-market clients onto Workforce Now. But I think it's another place where I think we're ahead of our plans, and I'm really pleased with the focus of the organization and the pace that we're going. So I don't know, Jan, if you have...","Jan Siegmund","No, I believe we have approximately 15,000 clients left on PCPW. And both in RUN, for the first quarter, as well as for PCPW, we're ahead of our plans. So the migration teams are working well, and migration's accelerating in pace basically overall. So that gives us that comfort that the timeframe is -- the range that we gave you is probably more comfort towards the earlier than the later finish at this point in time.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And we're very -- part of the strategy behind migration is first of all, it's the right to do because the clients should be on our best platforms because we believe they really help them run their businesses. But it also, as a side benefit, reduces the size of the pond in which our competitors fish. So we believe that head-to-head competition, our platforms today sell very well and compete very well, and we need to really get those clients on those platforms to really keep the competition from getting to them first.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Second question. If we add back the impact from lower interest rates on your earnings, it looks like you would have posted 15% earnings per share growth x the lower interest rate, which is a rate of earnings growth I don't think we've seen since before the financial crisis. And even then, you still have the brokerage business, at least up until about a year before the financial crisis. So more of a longer-term question, based on the results you've recently seen and some of the new products that you've introduced, is it possible we could be looking at a higher earnings growth rate than we've seen historically once we get past the negative impact from lower interest rate on slowed income?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Let me start answering the question by focusing on revenues. Some of the times that you're mentioning in terms of periods back where we had slower earnings growth, we also had lower revenue growth. And so our model really does benefit quite a lot from a margin and profitability standpoint when we can accelerate revenues, which is why we've been so focused on this concept of net new business and the difference between sales, or the business we start versus the business that we lose. In the last 2 or 3 years, we've gotten decent traction in terms of that net new business contributing to our revenue growth. So when you combine that with pays per control growth and a little bit of price increase, we're getting, as you can see, into the 7% to 8% growth range, revenue-wise, and that's with the 1% drag from interest income. Because interest income doesn't only drag the bottom line, but because of the way we report interest revenue, because it's part of our core business, it also affects our revenue growth. So getting solidly into the 8% to 10% revenue growth range really provides us with a lot of opportunity to drive margin improvement, and also to invest in the business, whether it's in some of our technology and product or in the sales force. And so we feel extremely good about the progress on margins in the quarter. I think your statement was accurate, but I just want to make sure that I added context in terms of 2 or 3 years ago, it would have been hard to generate the kind of earnings growth that we just delivered this quarter just because the revenue growth wasn't there. And some of that was the backdrop of the economy coming out of a difficult recession in terms of sales and losses and so forth. So we had the benefit, I think, of the economy recovering. I think we've had good execution from sales with 2 years now of double-digit sales growth. And I think we're really getting that top line revenue growth that allows us -- provides us a lot of flexibility in terms of generating resources both to give back to shareholders in the form of earnings growth, but also to reinvest in the business. So I'm not going to get into the math. The math that you, I think, laid out is accurate, and it is the math.","Jan Siegmund","Maybe to be the conservative CFO for a tiny bit, David, consider also that we had slight help on the NFE because of our weaker sales results in the quarter that helped a little bit. Not much, actually, not as much as the degree we talked about in the fourth quarter. But -- so there's a little bit of quarter-specific items in here that make the margin expansion really nice for the quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Can you just remind us where you delineate in terms of number of employees between small, mid and large enterprise? I don't know if that's changed at all. I feel like we haven't discussed that in a while.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It's actually a great question because we're trying to delineate less and less in the sense that, again, I think we said this in a couple of calls and it's worth reiterating, that we are selling our platforms across market segments. And so the bright lines that we had 5, 10 years ago, I think, are fading for the right reasons because those bright lines are not market-oriented. And so as an example, we sell our RUN platform into the mid-market and we sell Workforce Now into the national accounts market. But to give you specifics on the answer to your question, internally, we have a business leader responsible for 0 to 50 employees. We have another business leader responsible for 50 to 999 or to 1,000. And then above 1,000, we have a different business leader, and we consider that to be national accounts or upmarket. But all these leaders are part of the same team. They're part of my team. And one of the things we've been focused on a lot in the last several years, and this goes back probably 3 or 4 years, is figuring out how we sell the right platforms to the right client, irrespective of the segment. And we've actually executed quite well against that in the sense that we're selling a lot of RUN into our major accounts segment and we're selling a lot of Workforce Now down into the small business market when it's a complex client or a client that has complex needs. And just this last quarter, we had really robust sales of Workforce Now in our national accounts space, where that platform is a good solution for many clients where the Vantage platform may not necessarily be the right fit.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. And just going back to your comments earlier around rebuilding the pipeline for the large enterprise. I mean, I just want to get a sense because I know the sale cycles are obviously long in that segment. So as you sit here with, I guess, what do we have, 8 months left in the fiscal year, I mean, is there enough time to rebuild the pipeline and then actually convert the pipeline into sales to make sure that you get to that 8% to 10%? Or do you think it's really just going to come down to how a few deals break either way in Q4?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It's actually both things. You're quite correct about the few deals breaking things. This is one of the things that's been -- this has been true for years, whether in GlobalView and in national accounts, a few deals do make a difference, particularly in 1 quarter. And so we probably need a couple of deals to break our way over the course of the next 8 months, and then we also need to rebuild that pipeline and close some of that business. And just remember that, for us, again from a revenue standpoint, we want to close the business and then get it started. And so right now, we are actually benefiting from all the strong sales we've had over the last couple of years, including the last quarter, and we need to kind of rebuild that. But from a revenue standpoint, it doesn't have a huge impact on us in the short term. This is all about getting the signature on the deal. We still have to then start the deal after that. So as we rebuild these pipelines and execute and close the business and get the sales, there's still a 6- to 12-month lag for that business to become revenue. So I know you all know that, but I just want to kind of put that reminder out. But you heard our guidance. We believe that we can rebuild those pipelines, we can get enough business closed to help us get to that 8% to 10%. But I think you also hear us being somewhat cautious in the sense that we would have preferred to have ended up in the mid single-digits growth for the quarter in sales and not low single-digits.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, that's fair. And just last question for me. You made a brief reference to the national employment report you guys put out this morning. And it looked like the job number was somewhat below consensus. I think it's declined for 4 straight months or so now. I mean, is this turning into a potential pattern that we should be concerned at all about in terms of possibly reversing the trend of improving U.S. employment that we had been witnessing for a while?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think when you listen to the economist Mark Zandi, who really helps and kind of has the real data behind the numbers that we report, we do believe, in this case, unlike in our sales results, that the government shutdown did have an impact. And so, if you listen to him this morning describe kind of where he is, he believes that that number probably had a 20,000 to 30,000 impact, if you will, from the government shutdown. But even excluding that, that gets you back to, call it around 150,000, which is really below the trend back 6 months ago. So when I look at these numbers, I try to look at more than just 1 month. And if you look at, excluding October, the previous 2 quarters, the last quarter was down sequentially about 20,000 per month on average than the previous quarter. So the trend was definitely down, but it feels like 150,000 is where Zandi would say we are right now, which is not where we were before at 170,000 or 190,000. But right now, it doesn't seem like it's the number that's -- there is no clear indication yet that, that's going to break even lower than that kind of 150,000 trend. Because this month had some noise in it because of the government shutdown.","Operator","The next question is from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Carlos, as you look at the payroll business, do you see competition changing at all, especially now that you have more cloud-based products? Is that allowing others to maybe enter the industry that you didn't see previously?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I mean, I think that we've had a lot of competition forever. So as long as I've been around at ADP and I, obviously, have the benefit of talking to a lot of people who've been around even longer than I have. So we have had a lot of good competitors for a very long time, there's been multiple changes in technology. And so we've been around, as you know, more than 60 years. And so we have gone all the way from punch cards to PCs to the cloud, and we've had competition all along the way, that's just the nature of the beast both in the U.S. and globally. But I think, as Jan said, we haven't seen any indications yet from a pricing standpoint that there's any issues around pricing. And in terms of the amount of competition or the fierceness, if you will, of the competition, I think our sales results, notwithstanding the first quarter, speak for themselves. We had 2 very, very strong years, even the year before that, we just missed being double digits. So we have almost 3 years of double-digit sales growth and 2 years of solid double-digits sales growth. And I think that is the best indication of all of kind of your competitive position, whether you're winning market share or whether you're not winning market share. And we feel pretty good about our position and the pivots we've made to really address the changes in technology around cloud. So we feel comfortable where we are, but we understand very well more than anyone else that there's a lot of competition, because everyone is obviously aiming at us, and we have lots of people to aim at.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just to go back on your comment, you said you see less delineation in your customer segments. Is that the result of just all your customers wanting technology or almost the same level of technology? Is that the primary reason, or are there other reasons for your comment?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think, frankly, the reason for my comment was really more around internal issues around the blurring of our silos and our segments. We've been -- again, my observation of my tenure at ADP is that we've made a lot of progress now on being able to focus on the client and not on the business unit leader, and that their specific segment is their responsibility. So I think we've worked really hard over the last 5 to 10 years to blur those lines, and I think it helps us because it makes it harder for the competition, and I think it gets the clients the right solutions that they need to get the job done.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Carlos, you talked about the addition to headcount on the sales force side being up about 4% this year. Can you remind us how that compares to prior years? And I'm also curious, has that already happened this year or is it going to be more kind of smooth throughout the entire year this year?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that that is pretty close to last year's headcount growth because we had, obviously, very strong sales results. And so we had more than double, if you will, the number of headcount growth from a productivity standpoint, which we're very pleased by, but we haven't planned on and we weren't counting on. And we're certainly not counting on for this year. So last year, we had around the same headcount growth, but had just some amazing productivity gains that ended up giving us double-digit results at the end of the year. I believe our plan for this year is to be around that 4%. And I think right now, we are in that range, around 4%.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. And then I'm shifting back to the bookings number, I'm sorry about this. But you've talked about past experience having a strong fourth quarter and then potentially a softer first quarter. How long does it take to get back to a more normalized trend? Will we see it in the second quarter or it will be more back-end loaded?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Sorry. Could you repeat the question one more time? We're checking on your headcount growth number, which is 4% this year and I'm just looking at last year was 3%.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. That's helpful. My question was on bookings. You mentioned the strong fourth quarter leading to the softer first quarter. I'm just curious, historically, how that -- how long it takes to get back to normal. Will we see it bounce back in the second quarter or it would be more gradual throughout the year?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think, unfortunately, there's more moving parts in terms of the comparison to the previous second quarter also matters. So last year's second quarter versus this second quarter will have some impact as well. As you can imagine, there are potential, other moving parts like -- we're not seeing anything yet in our sales results. But the government shutdown, and the hit to confidence, if you will, or people delaying decisions could have had an impact on our results in the October or in the second quarter. So there's a lot of other moving parts in terms of how quickly that number comes back. The real key to focus on is the pipeline, is do you have the headcount and do you have the pipeline. And we believe we do. Notwithstanding that, there will be noise along the way, whether it's fiscal cliffs or government shutdowns or other factors, strong fourth quarters and strong compares or difficult compares. So all those things are factors. But fundamentally, you have to have the headcount and you have to have the pipeline. And those are the numbers that Jan and I spent some time looking at. And that's why we believe that we can reaffirm our guidance.","Operator","The next question is from Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","One more just on the bookings side. When I was over at HR Tech, it looked like there've been some nice product improvements in terms of Vantage, and it sounds like the number of clients on that has been growing. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? You did mention that the bookings were softer on the upper end of the market. What are you seeing in terms of the win rates that are currently going in terms of the actual engagements that you're going through or the RFPs that you're going through at this point? And is it more a question of pipeline build as opposed to improving win rates?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that in the upmarket for us, besides Vantage, just to be clear, the Vantage sales themselves are one, frankly, relatively small part of the overall sales results in the upmarket. So in addition to Vantage, we have our multinational sales, which were, I think, weak could be an understatement for the first quarter because we had none in GlobalView. We usually don't disclose that, but we -- that's a very, very lumpy business. So whether or not you get 1 or 2 deals in a quarter in GlobalView is very normal. So sometimes, we'll have 2 or 3 in a quarter and they help us a lot, and this quarter we had none, so that hurt us in terms of that growth rate in the upmarket. We also have our upmarket BPO solution in those results, which also tends to be a very large sales number when we sell those, what we call COS deals. And this quarter also happen to be weak from an upmarket BPO standpoint. By the way, we had a very strong year and a very strong fourth quarter in BPO, so there is no -- I don't think there's any negative news to report there other than the pipeline having been emptied. And then you come back to we have a lot of other products that we sell in our national accounts space in addition to Vantage such as standalone benefit solutions and other solutions for the benefit space. And unfortunately, it was weak across-the-board, but it really wasn't a Vantage issue. Vantage is still selling well. We had a good first quarter in terms of the number of new clients that we sold. We actually increased our starts by 50%, so we have -- we've doubled the number of clients that we have actually already -- that actually started, not just sold, in Vantage. So we really don't -- it's not really an issue of Vantage, singling out Vantage as a problem for the quarter.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. So it sounds like it's a little bit broader based, but just in terms of the general question in terms of pipeline versus win rates, was there any change in terms of the win rates and in terms of the ERPs that went through?","Jan Siegmund","No. Number one, of course, the deal volume was a little bit lower overall, so it's a little bit -- probably not a material change. Now we're talking here statistical numbers on percentage rates switch one way or the other, but nothing that has changed really relating to the competitiveness of Vantage that we can see.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think some of it is just the nature of the large account market in terms of the lumpiness as part of it. And I think we believe also we have some execution issues, where I think we have -- all of us put an enormous amount of pressure on each other to make sure that we get the sales results every quarter. But there's also an expectation as from a leadership standpoint that you maintain your platforms that you have, for the next quarter and the quarter after that. And we dropped the ball and we didn't execute, I think, is at the end of the day part of the challenge.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then with regards to the migration, I didn't get the migration schedule for both RUN and for Workplace. Can you talk a little bit more about -- I mean for Workforce. Can you talk a little bit about how we should think about that, and then what the implications would be for the margins?","Jan Siegmund","Yes. We talked, I think, in the last fiscal year, RUN, we migrated approximately 24,000 RUN clients over. And about half of them were migrated in the last quarter. So we had a very steep ramping of the migration pace. And now, in the first quarter, migrations accelerated another 50% above that rate in the last quarter. So we're still ramping, although that's not going to continue; it's going to level at some point in time. So we're getting close to that level that we anticipated is good and sustainable, but we have still a rapid acceleration and pace for migrations in this quarter, it seems. So we want to get out of this accounting for the quarter here, but the general guidance that within -- now we have quarter, we said 18 months. So the game here is really how fast in fiscal '15 are we going to be off the platform or not. And as Carlos indicated, that's moving more towards the beginning of FY '15 than the end of it, if you want guidance. So the pace of migrations in RUN is really nice and ahead of our plan and scaling well and so forth. The same thing in Workforce Now, we increased the number of migrations quarter-over-quarter, but they kind of have the teams going, they go fairly stable. Last year, we migrated approximately 10,000 clients. Now I said we have about 15,000 clients, I think, at PCPW. So clearly now, we're going to come into more tricky client situations, clients that were highly satisfied with the PCPW environment and so forth, and we want to treat them right. So as you get a smaller base to convert, there could be slowing in pace, more indicating just that the bowl to fish in is getting smaller. But same thing, the Workforce Now team is really doing a great job and they finished also ahead of their goals for the quarter.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think just in terms of, again, general dates, I think, we think that RUN may be able to get done in -- earlier in calendar '15 than what we previously anticipated because we, I think, previously thought it would take us kind of towards the middle of calendar '15. We think we can pull that in a little sooner. And I think Workforce Now and PCPW migrations are probably somewhere in the same time frame.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And can you talk -- I know you're going to continue to invest for innovation, but can you talk about just the -- what that would free up in terms of funds to invest for innovation?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I don't know that we have that level of detail to be able to share yet. I think it's a fair question as we get closer to the time and we're able to quantify more the numbers. Because the pure R&D dollars, for example, that we spent on EasyPay, that alone is nothing to write home about, frankly. And it's -- we'll take it, and we'll reinvest it in innovation. But I think there are ancillary costs related to friction around having multiple platforms, around having multiple service people, multiple implementation methodology. So I think it is broader than just the R&D. And so I think it's fair to do for us because we're doing some of it internally. But I think finding a way to communicate with all of you what we think might be the outcomes of that, I think, is a fair question. So we'll work on that, but it's not as simple as just the R&D cost because we know what those dollars are, but we think it's a broader benefit to us.","Jan Siegmund","As we have stated before, I think the increased focus on innovation will result effectively, but at this point, we are aiming to keep the ratio of R&D spend relative to revenue growth in line. So that's the area that we're not planning to scale significantly. Within that R&D budget, we fund portfolio of initiatives and innovation that we allocate, so this will give us effectively more room to invest into our strategic platforms, accelerate the pace of innovation, to make even further difference for our product. And then the operational scale that the reduction of complexity would yield will, in my point of view, support our general guidance of gaining operational leverage that we need to and want to provide to our shareholders, as we have done successfully in this quarter in particular. So if you think about it, those are the by [ph] part of our plans for the long run, to feel comfortable that the operational scale will be maintained at a good pace.","Operator","Your next question is from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of follow-up questions. First on the ES margins. Obviously, really nice, 160 basis points year-over-year. And I think you sort of called out partly the benefit of the lower sales commissions, you're sort of tied to the bookings trends we've all been talking about. Is there any way to sort of quantify directionally how much the margin benefit year-over-year was from the lower than kind of expected sales commissions? And I think you sort of were suggesting that that could conversely be a drag into 2Q. And just kind of like looking at your sales comparison, it looks like 2Q is your easiest comp of the year. So it kind of implies that you should see a nice acceleration in bookings into 2Q. So there's kind of 2 questions there.","Jan Siegmund","All right, that's 2 quick questions. The -- I'll take the margin question. It's less than 50 basis points on the ES margins that helped, so it's less than $0.01 and so forth, so it's really smaller on the sales cost line. But it did help us a little bit. In the second quarter compare, I think you're an astute observer that the second quarter last year was hampered by Sandy impact and also another government friction that we experienced, which gave us that quarter. So your observance is correct, but we're not even closing October yet. We're just in the process of closing October. So yes, that will be our quarter that we have to grow over.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And if I can just add. So I think, as Jan described, the margin issue, I just want to make sure that it does not come easily, the margin improvement. So I just want to compliment our field operations groups who were able to kind of deliver this kind of --","there's been a lot of hard work around, driving productivity and efficiency in the field to basically deliver the results we want to deliver to all of you, but also to be able to reinvest in the business. And they certainly have come through in the first quarter, and we expect that they're going to continue to come through. And so I just want to make sure that I got that out here. This does not come easily because your observation is correct, that it was -- that's an impressive margin improvement. And even backing out the benefit of lower sales cost, it's still pretty impressive.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a little bit different direction. The RUN product, obviously, has been -- you continue to put up good numbers there, good unit growth, and it seems to me gaining nice market share at that end of the market, and maybe just sort of color or commentary on that, I don't know, I doubt you'd have any specifics on it. But is there any way to sort of think about the market share you gained, you've had with RUN since you've rolled it out?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It feels -- again, back to the research, if you look at research reports, and you look at the growth of the market itself, new business formations, there's a bunch of things you could look at that would lead you to believe that we're gaining some market share. But those numbers are so big and so squishy in terms of the range of error in terms of like every time I look at some of these numbers, it makes me uncomfortable. The only thing that I want to see is for us to continue to grow. And it feels great when it feels like we're gaining market share, but we need to focus on ourselves and we obviously need to focus on what the competition is doing to win. But this is about us, not about competitors. And we think we're doing well and we're executing, and that's where we're going to continue to focus on.","Operator","And your final question is from David Grossman with Stifel.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I jumped on a little bit late, so if any of this has been already asked and answered, we can take it offline. But the first thing I wanted to ask is just, could you give us some updated thoughts on the Affordable Care Act and what impact, if any, you're thinking it may have on the PEO business, whether that be positive or negative?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes, we had actually quite strong sales results in the PEO in this first quarter. And so, obviously, it doesn't seem like it's having an effect yet. We think that the position of the PEO is quite strong in terms of providing an alternative. Because when you really get down to it, the PEO is an exchange. It's a very large employer option for small companies. So we -- this is the way the business has always been managed and it's just the nature of the business that you're creating scale in what we call the PEO for small companies, not just for health care, but also for workers' compensation, for technology, for HR services, for a number of things. In other words, giving small companies things that typically are only accessible to large companies. And health care plans are in that category. So the quality of our health plans and the price of our health plans, we believe, has always been a differentiator for us in the marketplace. And we believe that's what's allowing us to be successful through what is now other options. So there are other options being created for individuals and for small companies as a result of the ACA. But we believe that the PEO is one of those options, and it's very viable, and in fact, it's executing quite well and growing quite nicely.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the alternatives and the alternative would be, at least on the health care side, right, the private exchanges that emerged. Any thoughts on how we should think about the scale of your business versus potentially what these other exchanges could look like? Or is it just too early to really kind of make that assessment?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I can give you a little bit of color in the sense that not every PEO will be the same in terms of how it handles the ACA changes. So as an example, our average wage, the pools of our clients tend to be more white-collar, higher average pay, greater participation and benefits and a greater percentage of contribution to those benefits by the employers themselves, by the small business clients that are part of our PEO. So that is a fundamentally important issue to keep in mind because, where there is potentially the biggest risk is from an exchange is where you have low average wage, low benefits participation and an exchange may provide a very attractive alternative. So this is not to say that it won't be an attractive alternative to some small business clients, but the types of small business clients that we target in our PEO, we don't believe will be immediately tempted to move to an exchange. Although some, I'm sure will. But we don't -- we believe that we have some advantage in dealing with the change because of the nature of the types of clients that we attract and that we actually have in our PEO.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just a second question, just gets back to -- on the products side. Obviously, one of the great benefits of the new platform is the ability to sell a suite of different ADP products. And again, perhaps given where we are in the migration, it's a little early to kind of provide an update on some of the anecdotal data points that you provided in the past. But is there anything new you can share now that we're 3 or 4 months further into this? What the take rates look in terms of your ability to sell suite and how the sales force is gearing up to do that, the changes you've made to incent them to do that?","Jan Siegmund","There are 2 questions. So in the migration, we mentioned in the past that we up-sell certain product components because clients learned about the product and immediately buy some more. And we have seen up-sell activity, I think I disclosed it's about 20% higher revenue in the migration that happens in Workforce Now as we do it. That's really where this is relevant. And we have not seen any change in that momentum. So we should anticipate that that continues. Those are new sales to us, only the 20% up-sell component that flows into our new business bookings, and it's reflected in the thing. So as migrations, too. That has been part of the last year's new business bookings numbers and will be this. So there's no change in that. I think that's now fairly stable on it. And secondly, selling of bundled solutions, the attach rates remain very high in Vantage on the deals that we have sold. No change, really, to the rates that we have reported back, slight, slight error of statistics here and there, but they're really essentially the same. So I think we have -- we are delighted with the high attach rates that our upmarket products achieved and the up-sell opportunity that we had in Workforce Now. The incentives have been the same. Our sales force gets only incented on generating new return revenue that has been historic model for ADP and we didn't have to change that for this process. So the incentive structure is supportive of the overall strategy.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Great. Thank you, all, for joining us today. As you could tell, we're very pleased with our results. We continue to do the right things from a shareholder standpoint, paying our dividends, executing our share buybacks when the market allows. You've heard a lot of our discussion and our focus on innovation, which I think you're going to continue to hear about. I think that it's really developing a set of products where we have, I think, offerings that are both deep, but also broad in terms of back to this issue around attach rates and the number of additional platforms that we sell along with our payroll solutions. So all of that, I think, is better positioning us to meet the needs of our clients and actually around the entire globe, not just in the U.S. And so we look forward to sharing more of these thoughts with you about our HCM strategy in future calls.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now turn the conference over to Ms. Elena Charles, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elena Charles","Thank you. I am here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Reidy, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter fiscal 2013 earnings call and webcast. Our slide presentation for today's call and webcast is available for you to print from the Investor Relations homepage of our website at adp.com.","As a reminder, the quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings for our reportable segments have also been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. These schedules have been updated to include the first quarter of fiscal 2013, and all prior periods have been updated to reflect fiscal 2013 budgeted foreign exchange rate and the impact of discontinued operations.","During today's conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such, involve some risks. And these are discussed on Page 2 of the slide presentation and in our periodic filings with the SEC.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos for his opening remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Elena. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. For those of you joining who have been impacted by Hurricane Sandy, our thoughts are with you and we extend our best wishes for a speedy recovery.","ADP's headquarters and many of our other operations were in the path of the storm. I'm proud to say that when I visited 4 of our major facilities in New Jersey on both Monday and Tuesday of this week, all were operational, running on emergency generator power and with committed and dedicated associates who continued to make good on our obligations to our clients and our employees.","As all of you know, ADP pays 23 million people in the U.S. and 34 million people worldwide. And while the safety and security of our associates is our #1 priority, the last 3 days were another example of ADP's commitment to deliver.","While there are obviously areas where courier deliveries are not yet possible, our associates worldwide are supporting each other, going above and beyond to make sure our clients and our employees don't have yet another challenge during difficult moments.","[Technical Difficulty]","Carlos A. Rodriguez","All right. Thanks for joining us again. As you can tell, we're still having some challenges with Hurricane Sandy. Apparently, our webcast is not functioning, but we are going to go ahead with the call since we have over 50 people on the call waiting for us. And then we will provide a recording of the call, as well as the slides that were in the webcast at a future date. I'm going to go through my opening comments again, and then we'll continue with the call. Thanks for your patience.","So as I was saying, for those of you joining who have been impacted by Hurricane Sandy, our thoughts are with you, and we extend our best wishes for a speedy recovery.","ADP's headquarters and many of our other operations were in the path of the storm. I'm proud to say that when I visited 4 of our major facilities in New Jersey on both Monday and Tuesday this week, all were operational, running on emergency generator power and with committed and dedicated associates who continued to make good on our obligations to our clients and our employees.","As all of you know, ADP pays 23 million people in the U.S. and 34 million worldwide. And while the safety and security of our associates is our #1 priority, the last 3 days were another example of ADP's commitment to deliver.","While there are obviously areas where courier deliveries are not yet possible, our associates worldwide are supporting each other and going above and beyond to make sure our clients and our employees don't have yet another challenge during difficult moments.","Before we get started on the earnings discussion for the first quarter, I want to discuss the CFO transition we announced earlier this morning. As you read in the press release, we announced that Jan Siegmund is transitioning to the CFO role as Chris Reidy will be leaving ADP. As Elena just said, Chris is here with me today to discuss our first quarter earnings, and I want to take this opportunity to thank Chris for his many contributions over the 6 years he spent at ADP. Chris and Jan will work together over the next few weeks to ensure an orderly transition.","Jan will be joining our second quarter earnings call on February 5, though our plans are to have Jan meet many of you over the next several weeks before the next quarterly earnings call. Jan's background is in the press release, so I'm not going to go through all of that, but I want you to understand why Jan has been selected for this key role.","As Head of Strategy at ADP for 8 years now, Jan has been instrumental in developing the strategy for ADP's evolution from a payroll-centric company to a leading provider of a broad and diverse human capital management solutions.  Jan's tenure and experience at ADP are enormous positives for ADP as we move forward to leverage the many opportunities ahead of us.  So I hope you will all join me in wishing Chris well and in welcoming Jan to the CFO role.","Now let's turn to the first quarter results. After my opening remarks about the first quarter, I'll turn the call over to Chris who will take you through the highlights of the quarter. After which, I'll return to provide you with an update on our fiscal year 2013 forecast. And before we take your questions, I'll provide some concluding remarks.","Now let's turn to Slide 4. As you read in this morning's press release, ADP reported good results for fiscal 2013's first quarter. Total revenue growth of 5%, 3% organic, and 2% earnings per share growth from continuing operations were in line with the expectations we outlined for you back in August.","I'm very pleased with the performance of our business segments during the quarter despite the negative impact on overall ADP results from several items that we communicated to you back in August, which you read in this morning's press release.","Once again, I'm particularly pleased with our sales execution and sales productivity in our Employer Services and PEO Services during the quarter, which resulted in 15% growth in worldwide new business sales in the quarter.","Sales were good across our core offerings in the U.S., which include RUN, Workforce Now and Vantage. Across our major market segments in the U.S., small business services and national account services sales were strong, with double-digit increases over the prior period -- over the prior year.","We recently released our latest version of Workforce Now, which delivers a robust new user interface and provides a consistent look and feel across all roles and modules. This new version of Workforce Now is also offered in Canada, and we are quite pleased with the positive early market acceptance in that region.","I'm pleased that sales of our GlobalView solution for multinational companies were strong in the quarter as well. In our Employer Services international organization, sales of our best-of-breed solutions across Europe were somewhat mixed given the economic weakness in certain of these markets. We saw strength in our other geographies, however, particularly in Canada, Brazil and Australia. And now moving from sales to our other key business metrics. Client balances continued to grow, and the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured by same-store pays per control also increased. As we indicated back in August, client revenue retention declined 40 basis points during the quarter. It's important to note that retention is near historically high levels, and this makes it difficult to improve on a quarterly basis.  Although retention declined this quarter, we do expect year-over-year improvement in client retention on a full year basis.","Moving on to Dealer Services. Automotive sales in North America were solid. However, the weak economic landscape across Europe resulted in lower car sales, though the Asian markets where Dealer Services participates are doing quite well. Dealer Services continued to execute well on a share of wallet strategy with strength in digital marketing. Transaction volumes, sales growth and our win-loss rate continue to be positive in Dealer, and I'm pleased with the improvement in worldwide revenue retention and market share gains.","With that, I'll turn it over to Chris to provide the financial highlights and a look at this year's forecast for our client funds investment strategy.","Christopher R. Reidy","Thanks, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to be on Slide 5 when you can see it.","Total revenues grew 5% for the quarter to $2.6 billion. Organic growth was 3%, and acquisitions contributed 2 points of growth. As anticipated, unfavorable foreign exchange rates during the quarter negatively impacted revenues 2%. As we indicated when we provided our initial forecast in August, lower client fund interest revenues due to low market interest rates negatively impacted revenues 1%. Revenues were also negatively impacted an additional 1% from loss revenues related to last year's second quarter sale of assets and the expiration of certain employment tax credits in our Tax Credit Service business.","Pretax earnings increased 2%, and ADP's pretax margin declined 50 basis points. As there were several items that negatively impacted ADP's revenue growth, many of these items negatively impacted pretax earnings and margin growth. Fiscal 2012 acquisitions did not have a meaningful impact on pretax earnings, but negatively impacted ADP's pretax margin 40 basis points.","The client funds extended investment strategy, which is driven primarily by interest on client funds, negatively impacted pretax earnings growth 4% and pretax margin 100 basis points. The impact from last year's sale of assets and expiration of certain employment tax credits negatively impacted pretax earnings growth 4% and pretax margins 50 basis points.","Moving next to net earnings. We reported a 1% increase on a higher effective tax rate.  Diluted earnings per share increased 2% and benefited from fewer shares outstanding compared to last year. The negative impacts from the decline in client interest and the grow-over from last year's second quarter items also created significant pressure on net earnings and diluted earnings per share. So the point I'm making is that when you peel back and remove the impact of these items, ADP's businesses are delivering very good revenue, earnings and pretax margin improvement.","We repurchased 3.7 million ADP shares fiscal year-to-date for a total cost of $215 million. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $1.2 billion, excluding the assets related to our reverse repurchase borrowing related to our extended investment strategy for the client funds portfolio.","Let's move on to Slide 6 and the business segment results. As I've stated, we are pleased with the performance of our business segments. Employer Services grew total revenues 6%; and PEO grew 13%, driven by 11% growth in the number of average worksite employees; and Dealer grew 9%. On an organic basis, Employer Services grew 5%, PEO 13% growth was all organic and Dealer Services grew 7%.","Worldwide new business sales from Employer Services and PEO Services were particularly strong in the quarter, with 15% growth. Carlos took you through the sales details a few moments ago, so I'll move on to discuss the revenue growth drivers in Employer Services. Of the items we called out that impacted total company results in the quarter, the foregone revenues related to last year's second quarter sale of assets and the expiration of certain tax credits negatively impacted our Employer Services segment revenue growth nearly 2 percentage points.","Good growth from RUN and insurance services were the primary drivers of our healthy growth in the small business marketplace. In the mid-market, revenues from our Workforce Now solution are growing nicely, as our HR services and comprehensive services revenues. Across the mid-market and large company market, we are pleased with the revenue growth from our Time & Labor Management solutions. And at the high end of the market, we are pleased with Vantage sales, but the contribution to revenue growth is still small at this point.","Revenue growth in the quarter from our best-of-breed solutions across Europe and for multinational solutions was also solid in the quarter. Same-store pays per control in Employer Services in the U.S. was strong, with an increase of 3.3%. However, same-store pays per control across Europe declined during the quarter, in line with our expectations.","And as Carlos mentioned, client revenue retention declined 40 basis points in the quarter. Average client fund balances increased 6% for the quarter. Solid new client growth continued, especially in small business services, and increased pays per control contributed positive balance growth.","Now let's turn to Slide 7, and I'll take you through the forecast on the client funds investment strategy in support of the overall ADP forecast that Carlos would take you through in a few moments. Before I get into the details of the forecast, I'll point out that the objective of our investment strategy remains safety, liquidity and diversification.","Fully consistent with these objectives, we were again able to take advantage of the supply of new investment-grade corporate fixed income securities in the first quarter and added more highly-rated corporate bonds to our portfolio. At September 30, approximately 84% of our fixed income portfolio was invested in AAA- and AA-rated securities.","We continue to base the interest assumptions in our forecast on Fed Funds futures contracts and the forward yield curves for the 3.5- and 5-year U.S. government agencies as we do not believe that it's possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the yield curve or the new bond issuance behavior of corporations. I'll also remind you that up to 15% to 20% of the investments are subject to reinvestment risk each year.","Focusing now on the slide, you will see a summary of the anticipated pretax earnings impact of the extended investment strategy for the client funds investment portfolio of fiscal 2013. We continue to anticipate average client fund balances for fiscal 2013 in the range of $18.8 billion to $19.1 billion, which represents 5% to 7% growth. We also continue to anticipate a yield on the client funds portfolio of 2.2% to 2.3%, down 50 to 60 basis points from fiscal 2012, resulting in an anticipated year-over-year decline in client funds interest of $70 million to $75 million, slightly worse than our prior forecast as anticipated new purchase rates declined from the time we provided our initial guidance in early August.","As you can see at the lower right of the chart, in terms of the total pretax impact of the extended investment strategy, we anticipate a decline of $80 million to $85 million for fiscal 2013, which reflects the $5 million deterioration in the client interest forecast.","Taking you back to our analyst conference at the end of May, based on futures and forward curves at that time, under the 0%, 5% and 10% balance growth scenarios that we provided, we expected fiscal 2013 to be the largest year-over-year decline in client funds and earnings, out to fiscal 2017. Specifically, under the 5% balance growth scenario, we expected a $70 million to $80 million decline in fiscal 2013.","Since the end of May, the 3.5- and 5-year agency forward curves have declined about 30 basis points on average. Combining the impact of current lower expected rates with our balance growth expectation of 5% to 7%, we anticipate a year-over-year decline of $80 million to $85 million so slightly worse due to rates, offset a bit by our balance expectations that fall slightly above the 5% scenario presented in May. Contemplating the current lower forward curves and looking beyond fiscal 2013, we still expect fiscal 2013 to be the bottom of the cycle in terms of the size of the year-over-year decline.","Now I'll turn it back to Carlos to take you through the remainder of the forecast for fiscal 2013.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Chris. We're now on Slide 8. Our forecast exclude the results of operations of a business we intend to sell as it is reported within discontinued operations. It is important to note that despite the impact of discontinued operations, we have maintained our fiscal 2013 forecast for total revenues and earnings per share growth.","For total ADP, we continue to anticipate total revenue growth of 5% to 7%. We continue to anticipate a decline in the total ADP pretax margin of about 30 basis points. We expect the effective tax rate will be about 30 basis points below fiscal 2012 effective tax rate of 34.5%. We also continue to anticipate 5% to 7% growth in diluted earnings per share compared with $2.72 in fiscal 2012, which excluded the gain on sale of assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.","As is our normal practice, no further share buybacks are contemplated in the forecast beyond anticipated dilution related to employee equity comp plans, though it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to shareholders depending, obviously, on market conditions. And while we don't provide quarterly guidance, I do want to give you some insights into year-over-year comparisons for the remainder of fiscal 2013 as they are impactful to the second quarter and the full year.","Let's turn to Slide 9. We anticipate that foreign exchange rates will negatively impact revenues about 1 percentage point for the year, with about 0.5 percentage point drag anticipated in the second quarter. As a reminder, movement in FX rates is not impactful to pretax earnings. In addition, as Chris just took you through the forecast related to our client funds strategy, the interest revenue piece of this strategy is expected to decline $70 million to $75 million year-over-year. The negative impact from an expected lower average yield on the portfolio due to lower new purchase rates is expected to be a full percentage point drag of -- full percentage point of drag on ADP revenues for the full year and in each of the second through the fourth quarters, mitigated to a very small degree by the anticipated growth in balances.","Including the corporate extended interest income and interest expense related to the strategy, we expect a decline of $80 million to $85 million in pretax earnings. This translates to a drag of about 100 basis points on ADP's pretax margins for the year. The negative impact by quarter is anticipated to be about 100 basis points in both the second and third quarters and about 120 basis points in the fourth quarter.","Taking it down to EPS. The $80 million to $85 million anticipated decline in pretax earnings equates to a drag of about $0.11 on earnings per share. We anticipate a decline of about $0.03 per share in each of the second through the fourth quarters.","Now continuing to Slide 10. Fiscal 2012 acquisitions are forecasted to be earnings neutral in terms of dollars, but we continue to anticipate pressure on the pretax margin in fiscal 2013. For the year, we expect about 20 basis points of negative impact, with 20 basis points negative impact in both the second and the third quarters.","Moving to Slide 11. Now lastly, I want to remind you about certain 2012 items that are expected to negatively impact the year-over-year comparisons. The sale of assets during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and the end of certain employment tax credits within our Tax Credit Services business are expected to pressure revenue and earnings comparisons in fiscal 2013. We anticipate nearly a 0.5 percentage point negative impact on revenue growth for the year, with about 1 percentage point negative impact in the second quarter. This equates to a $0.04 year-over-year decline in earnings per share for these items, with about $0.02 of decline in the second quarter.","I also want to point out that in last year's second quarter, there were favorable pretax items totaling between $15 million and $20 million that are onetime in nature that we don't anticipate recurring in this year's second quarter. So the takeaway here is that we expect continued difficult year-over-year earnings and pretax margin comps for the second quarter.","Now let's turn to Slide 12 for the segment update. The impacts from the expected drag from fiscal 2012 acquisitions, as well as the negative year-over-year comparisons from the fiscal 2012 second quarter sale of assets and the expiration of certain employment tax credits are reflected in these segment forecast.","For Employer Services, we are forecasting revenue growth of 6% to 7%, with pretax margin expansion of at least 50 basis points. We anticipate an increase in our pays per control metric in the U.S. of 2% to 3%. We are forecasting 13% to 14% revenue growth for PEO Services, with flat to slight pretax margin expansion. We are forecasting 8% to 10% growth in annual dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new business sales from the over $1.2 billion sold in fiscal 2012.  And for Dealer Services, we are forecasting 7% to 9% revenue growth, with about 100 basis points in pretax margin expansion.","And now turning to Slide 13, I'd like to leave you with some closing remarks before we open it up for questions. Overall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results. Our key business metrics are strong. Employer Services and PEO Services new business sales and productivity are particularly strong. Dealer Services is performing well and gaining market share. Momentum in the business is good, though I'm somewhat cautious given the uncertain economic landscape here in the U.S. and in Europe. And unfortunately, market interest rates continue to be very low, with little indication of rising near term.","But I believe that ADP is well positioned to leverage the opportunities of the large global human capital management marketplace. And we are keenly focused on our 4 strategic pillars for growth, which include cloud-based HCM solutions, market-leading HR BPO solutions, leveraging our global presence and growing and deepening our key adjacencies.","Now turning to Slide 14. We're focused on delivering stellar service to our clients and creating an environment that fosters innovation. ADP remains committed to shareholder-friendly actions and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I'm pleased that ADP continues to be rated AAA by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's, reflecting the strength of our business model and of our balance sheet. And to sum it up, I believe we're doing the right things to grow the business and to enhance long-term shareholder value.","And now I'll turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Congratulations on your retirement, Chris. Very strong new business sales growth, 15% for ES and PEO. Can you give us more detail by small, major and national accounts and maybe some insights into how some of the newer products you're doing, particularly Vantage HCM at the high end?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Sure. We really -- in all of our core markets, we had good growth. It was particularly strong in national accounts, and there, we did have an easier comparison. In small business, we had also very good results, which are consistent with what we've been seeing for a while now. In major accounts, we had solid results there as well. So I think it's somewhat reflective of, I think, the underlying product portfolio still generating good traction in the marketplace and our sales organization still being excited about the new product offering. I want to caution you that the strong sales in national accounts, just keep in mind that there is relatively long lag between when a sale takes place in national accounts and when it actually starts. And I think the other caveat there is that although Vantage sales are quite positive in the last quarter, still relatively small in terms of total dollars on our sales number, as well as relatively small impact on revenue given the lag for those also large accounts to start. But overall, you're on the right issue, which is our sales results were quite positive. It's been a while since we've had 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit sales growth. And I couldn't be more pleased with that because that bodes well for our future revenue growth.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Carlos, can you give us a little more granularity on Vantage HCM sales? You have a very effective competitor in the national accounts segment in sort of cloud and SaaS-based offerings. Can you give us some more -- I guess, some more details around bookings and how you're doing in head-to-head competition with Vantage HCM?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes. We have -- we obviously have a number of competitors, and our differentiation with some of the pure-play cloud competitors is really our service capabilities. And I think we're still effectively differentiating ourselves with now a better technology solution, which is more user-friendly and has better -- we actually -- it's a unified database in terms of across modules, so it's really not even an integrated offering. So we're quite pleased with the technology backdrop, but we're also very happy that we continue to differentiate ourselves and win business in the marketplace based on our ability to deliver service in addition to the technology. In terms of the numbers, I don't know that it would be appropriate for us to give specific numbers, but I would just say that we were very pleased and I would say that the results in the quarter were quite good and in an accelerating path in terms of numbers of new business sales. I think the last call, we told you we had a dozen or less. I would say we have over 3x that now. And I think that's probably as much as we would like to say there, and we probably won't say much going forward either because we don't really break out our sales results by individual products.","Christopher R. Reidy","It will show up in the results eventually, but again, it has a lag because of maybe the size and the timing of implementation.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Paul Thomas from Goldman Sachs.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Question, I guess continuing on the strong new sales start to the year, you talked about some macro concerns, of course, but it doesn't seem to be slowing new sales yet. Is the expectation that we're not going to see much change until the second half of the year or are there some signs of deceleration already? Or how should we be thinking about new sales progression through the year?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Paul, I think that -- the concern I have is a concern I think everyone has, which is the uncertainty in the economy as a result of the election and then the so-called fiscal cliff. And so what we have seen historically is that when concerns emerge in the economy or when the economy actually starts to slow, our sales results do get negatively impacted if people throw off decisions or don't make decisions. As you just pointed out, through this last quarter, we have not seen any signs of that happening yet. But I think we are appropriately cautious because of, obviously, what's going on in terms of the fiscal situation and the uncertainty in the marketplace regarding tax policy and other items as well. But we are not seeing it yet in our sales results, and obviously, we will -- if and when we do see weakening, we would share that with all of you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering, you've had, obviously, some strong renovations and new product offerings. You've made some acquisitions in adjacent markets. Can you share with us any metrics or trends perhaps in revenue per client or perhaps profitability per client given the exchanges?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think the trend -- the number that I think is the most interesting for us besides the absolute sales results, is the attach rates in both national accounts and major accounts of multi-modules, because we are trying to become more of a full suite human capital management solutions company in addition to just selling payroll. And so one of the things that our new products are allowing us to do is to really provide solutions across HR, payroll, benefits, time and attendance in a kind of a seamless technology solution. But obviously, those are also sold separately, so it doesn't necessarily mean that people will buy all of those modules. But we are actually pleased with how many multi-modules are being purchased in both Workforce Now, which is our new solution in major accounts, and also in Vantage in national accounts. So those attach rates are much higher in percentage turns. In other words, the number of clients buying more than one solution at a time is much higher than it has been historically in both of those businesses. And that, obviously, drives higher revenue per client, and it's -- obviously creates an opportunity for us to further differentiate ourselves and create additional stickiness with the clients given that we have other aspects of the human capital management strategy that we're providing to them.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So should we expect that to be a margin driver as well, then, Carlos?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that's fair because, for sure, that there is some sales efficiency that we gain, and we do have sales cost as a decent part of our overall cost structure, I think that providing service in a multi-module environment is different than when -- how we were doing it before. So we are kind of retooling and reequipping our folks to be able to deliver service in a seamless fashion. In other words, when a client calls in to ask a question, they can go to 1 team to be able to get the answers to their questions rather than having to go to 4 different departments or 4 different units within ADP. So that requires some investment up front, which is what we're doing now, to have kind of a seamless unified service experience in addition to our unified technology. But I think medium and longer term, I think both on the sales side and on the operating cost side, I do think that higher attach rates of multi-module and higher revenue per client should really generate improved margins for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My first question has to do with your view on IBM's acquisition of Kenexa. How do you think this might affect or compete with your current HR services offerings?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that there have been a number of transactions, as you know, so SuccessFactors and Taleo also were acquired by other providers. And so Kenexa is just kind of the latest in a number of consolidations taking place, and we've done a couple of acquisitions ourselves. We compete with Kenexa in our applicant tracking services business, as well as in some of our talent management businesses. But we don't anticipate a huge change, at least not in the short- and medium-term, and I guess we'll just have to wait and see. We don't -- we haven't seen really any major changes or disruptions to our sales force as a result of that transaction.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And just switching gears back to the macro environment. So over the past couple of quarters, we've seen some moderate jobs growth and choppy at best, including today's number from ADP. And I was wondering if there is a straightforward way of deducing how quickly jobs growth feeds into your revenue stream and specifically, what kind of threshold does national employment growth have to get to, to really move the needle in either Employment Services alone or the business in general?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","The metric that really that we've disclosed and we talked about in the call this morning, is really what we call same-store pays per control, and the dollar impact on revenue for each 1 percentage point increase in pays per control is $20 million. So that gives you -- and that's pretty much close to 100% margins, goes straight to the bottom line. Even though there's some additional expense related to serving additional employees at client site, it's a very margin-rich type of revenue. So we disclose that, we track it very carefully. And again, our business is going to be obviously reflective of what's going on in the economy at large. But we, for example, have less exposure to public sector, which has been a very hard-hit sector when it comes to employment over the last 2 or 3 years. So our set of clients is slightly different from the overall economy but obviously, also overall reflective of the economy. But that 3% to 3.3% pays per control growth that we are now experiencing does help us. And it creates wind at our back, and it's clearly helping us to the tune of $20 million per 1 percentage point.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","In your prepared remarks, you talked about your confidence in retention still being up this year despite the fact that it was down a bit in the first quarter. I'm just wondering what gives you that confidence. What indicators are you looking at?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Actually, the follow through of the call from last quarter where we experienced a couple of losses in the fourth quarter in our national accounts base -- and I think we also had notifications of another couple of losses that actually affected our retention rate in the first quarter so I think we talked about it in our fourth quarter call -- I know it was a while ago, but we were aware of these losses. Losses in our national accounts base are lumpy, if that is a -- it's not a scientific term, but they do go up and down, and we have decent amount of visibility into the future regarding losses in our national accounts base. And given that, that was where we experienced the decline in the first quarter and given the visibility that we have, we're very confident on a go-forward basis that we can deliver our forecast. Obviously, if the economy would change or other things, external factors could impact that, but we had good retention in our other businesses outside of national accounts in the first quarter.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, that's great to hear. And then just a couple of numbers-related questions. If you can give us what capital spending was in the quarter, what you think it might be for the year, and also, what you think the depreciation and amortization will be for the year as well.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Wow, that's specific. We never got that question before. In the -- let's see. In the quarter, we had -- it was -- capital for the quarter was $32 million, $30-ish kind of million. And last year, for the full year, we had about $150 million. We expect to be slightly higher than that but not much, so kind of in that range. And I don't think we've gone into depreciation and amortization, but that doesn't change too much. Wouldn't expect it to change too much year-over-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Jim Macdonald with First Analysis.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Question, just quickly, can you say anything about the business you divested, what area it was in?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Unfortunately, we're right at the -- in the tail-end of negotiations on that, so we can't. But I think we -- what we disclosed -- or I believe we were disclosing is that it's around $50 million in revenues -- in annualized revenues. So it's a relatively small business that I think it'll become clear that even though we entered the business with expectations, it doesn't really fit incredibly well into the existing portfolio. And that's the reason for the divestitures -- really just trying to focus in more on the HCM space.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And can you talk a little bit about health care going into 2013, calendar 2013, as some of the changes start to kick in here? And how do you think that'll affect your -- specifically your PEO sales?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I'm going to have a lot more detail on that after next week. I'm actually spending a day with our PEO folks in TotalSource to get into a lot more detail. Right now, our sales are actually doing quite well in PEO. So because there's a lot of discussion about health care, I think that, that creates opportunities for our sales force, because inertia's a powerful force, and now everyone's thinking about what the impact of health care is going to be both in small companies and medium companies and also large companies. We believe that we have a unique value proposition in the PEO as being a \"large employer\" if you will, and providing health insurance to small companies on an aggregated group basis. And so we think we're going to still be able to maintain our differentiation and the competitive advantage. But also obviously watching all of the implementations and all the regulations, because even though legislation is passed and has been upheld by Supreme Court, there is a lot of rulemaking still going on in the background by various government agencies. And so we so far have not seen anything that leads us to believe that we're not going to be able to continue to be successful in the PEO space. And we also have a national accounts business that does benefit administration, including COBRA, FSA administration, health and wealth administration, open enrollment, et cetera. We believe that they're -- because, again, of all the uncertainty and all the questions and all the changes that we will have opportunity to help our clients. In other words, providing them solutions to get through the changes and deal with the changes and staying compliant. There's going to be a lot of compliance requirements as a result of all these legislative changes. And the solutions and products we have in national accounts, as well as ones we have in the PEO, are really designed to help clients navigate those waters and get through all of that regulation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I had a quick question regarding the solid sales growth. Is that driven off share gains from your regional or national competitor, or is this mostly in-house or from smaller CPA moving over to ADP?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that we believe, again, across our markets that we are gaining market share. When you look at the number of the client -- the actual client unit growth, we mentioned earlier that we're also getting higher revenue per client in both our Workforce Now and Vantage products, but when you look at our overall client count, it is growing faster than the overall market, which leads us to believe that we are gaining market share.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of pricing, how's the pricing trending? Any color there?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Not really, no news to report other than business as usual. We -- our price increases last year, I think, was in the same neighborhood of, I think, 1% net. And I think that market environment from a sales standpoint in terms of sales, I think discounting and other aspects of our pricing, I think remain pretty stable. We haven't heard anything different.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And one final question, and this is in regards to your cloud solution. Is there any kind of a risk that the cloud solution -- as the cloud solution gets more traction, that could cannibalize your full service offerings, like especially as Vantage gets a lot more traction in the marketplace? And how do you think about that versus ability to sell on newer or additional modules? So the risk of cannibalization versus the ability to sell on additional modules?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","That's a great question. Just to be clear, to start off, I want to say that our cloud-based solutions are full service as well. And I can tell you that after 60 or more years in business at ADP, we've done a lot of cannibalization in order to be here today. And so we plan -- have every intention to, over time, move our clients to our new solutions. And they are -- the new solutions are full service as well. We believe that pricing and margins are at least the same, if not better in our new solutions. We believe that we can sell more modules by being broader with an ACM solution in addition to just being payroll. So we don't see this cloud opportunity as a negative at all. We've been selling cloud solutions for almost a decade now, and we wrap service around them. We wrap tax filings, we wrap open enrollment call centers. We do a lot of things that are beyond just the pure technology. And that's really our differentiator, and it works very well for us. And we're going to continue to do that. And that absolutely is going to lead to cannibalization, and we don't see add that at all as a negative.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask a question on the interest in client funds as you start looking out to next year. I know you guys had said at the analyst meeting that in fiscal '14, we would see a year-over-year decline in interest on client funds, and I know you're still saying that the trough will be in fiscal '13. But the magnitude of the projected decline in fiscal '14, is that now a bigger order of latitude than what you were expecting at the time of the analyst meeting, just given the move and the forward curves? And is there any way you can help us quantify that?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes. And I tried to give you some of that color in my remarks. But as we look out at '14, and not from a guidance standpoint but just as a way to think about it, we still see it being less of a drag than it is this year. And because of the year-over-year compare, it's not -- it hasn't moved much from what we disclosed to you back in May.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay, understood. And then any color you can give us -- and I apologize if I missed this earlier -- but in Europe, specifically, trends in new sales and pays per control and retention?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Pays per control were slightly down and actually have been pretty consistent. So it's not dropping like a rock, it's been a little less than a -- a little better than 1% negative. So 0.7%, if you will, negative pays per control. I think it's been there for several months now.","Christopher R. Reidy","Right in line with what we expected.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes, in line with what we expected. Our sales have been soft, but, frankly, has also held up relatively well. So I'm quite proud of our sales organization there, in the face of what's, obviously, a very difficult situation. But we do have revenue growth -- positive revenue growth, it's kind of low single digits in Europe and -- purely just in Europe. But our overall international business, under the circumstance, is holding up quite well. We obviously are seeing -- or you're reading about slowdowns in some of the emerging markets, but our Brazilian business continues to grow very, very well. They've had very strong sales results. So I think, all in all, I'd have to say that we're quite pleased under the circumstances with what's happening in our international business, specifically in Europe.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And just lastly for me, as you think about, again, just directionally for next year, understanding that it's way too early to give formal guidance, but should ADP, as a whole, be back to overall corporate level of pretax margin expansion next year? Again, understanding that the float income is going to be down year-over-year.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Listen, it's a fair question. The headwinds we've had from interest rates have been, obviously, very prolonged, and it's getting really frustrating for a lot of us. But it's a significant headwind. I think it's important to note that we have significant margin expansion this quarter and this year when we strip out interest income. And we have to be careful about stripping it out, because it is part of our business. So we get that, but for you to understand what's going on in the underlying business segments and the health of the business, it is important to strip out. And when you do that, the businesses are performing quite well in having really good margin expansion. And we have a couple of those comparison issues in the first and second quarter that we talked about that also aren't helping from a comparison standpoint. But those will abate in the second half of the year, and it will be even more obvious that we're driving very, very strong underlying margin improvement in this business despite the headwinds from interest. It's way too early for us to say anything about next year, because we just don't have the -- this is not the appropriate time for us to be talking about what's going to happen in interest rates. We have to wait quite a while to really know exactly what has happened in terms of market interest rate to give you a clear guidance on how much that headwind will be next year. At this point today, as Chris just said, we do expect it to be less of a headwind in '14 than it was in '13. But it's way to early for us to be able to give you any kind of sense of how much we have to overcome and then what the underlying margin improvement will be. But we are exactly driving towards -- as rates bottom, returning to our kind of historic, if you will, margin improvement ability that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Joe Foresi with Janney.","Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","This is Jeff Rossetti. Just wanted to see -- I believe you mentioned on the question back about the share gain. You highlighted Workforce Now and Vantage. Just wanted to see if that also -- if you were also seeing that on the small business side?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Actually, I don't think -- I may have highlighted them as doing well in terms of sales results, but when we talk about client count, we talk about client counts across all of our segments. So when I talk about market share, I'm talking about total client count, which includes also our Small Business Services division. So all 3 of those combined are growing faster than the market, and we are gaining market share. I -- if I was speaking about any specific product, I -- that's unintentional.","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes, the client growth in our Small Business is particularly strong.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And then just any kind of thoughts about the acquisition environment, what you're seeing out there?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We continue to look at opportunities in the marketplace. I think that we have a pipeline of things that we're looking at. I think nothing different from what we've been communicating in the past, in terms of the things we're looking for, which are tuck-in acquisitions that fit into our existing businesses. We probably have a couple of opportunities to round out our HCM portfolio. But we're actually quite pleased today with what we have, and we're very focused, as you can tell, on just driving additional new business sales to our distribution system of what we are -- currently have in place. But there are still things out there that we are interested in that we are looking at.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You mentioned in your prepared remarks that GlobalView was strong. Could you give us some more color there about what you're seeing? And any metrics that you could provide?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Other than it was strong, that's another business in addition to national. It's actually more than -- more true in GlobalView than in national accounts because the business is quite lumpy. So when the sales come in, and how they compare to the previous year are -- I think, are important. But nevertheless, we're pleased. So we had a good quarter, we had good sales, but I don't know that we can say nothing more other than we had a good quarter. I wish there were some underlying trend that I could point to, but I think it's somewhat of the -- related to the nature of the business, which is the lumpiness.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I could be off, but I seem to remember that you're expecting to reach profitability for GlobalView this fiscal year. Is that right, and is that still the case?","Christopher R. Reidy","Well, what we said was it would be breakeven in the next fiscal year, but we do expect to start to go positive in the second half of this fiscal year, but not positive for the full year this fiscal year.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and then just last one. Is there anything that's worth putting out around how U.S. fundamentals trended over the course of the quarter and in the earlier part of this past month?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Sorry, what fundamentals?","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just fundamentals in the U.S., I'm wondering if there's anything that you thought looks particularly interesting about how things trended over the last 3.5 months or so?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I mean, again I -- just to reiterate what we've already said, I think our pays per control was strong, and we're very pleased with that. Our retention results, when you peel behind -- peel back the onion, I think we're also -- we're satisfied because of what we saw in our small and midsized business segments and across some of our other businesses. Sales were strong. I think our revenue growth was in line with what we expected. So again, I know there's a lot of noise in the economy, and we have this fiscal cliff that we're all facing and a lot of uncertainty, but our ongoing fundamentals really held up and were in line with our expectations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk just a little bit more about the client retention trends. It sounds like it's primarily in nationals that you're seeing a little bit of a lumpiness. Is it normal for it to occur around this time of the year? When would it typically be most pronounced, in terms of client decisions?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, remember, the -- from an impact standpoint, we're -- these are -- also, we're talking about comparisons. So I don't think anything's changed in terms of the seasonality of when losses take place in our international accounts business. So there's no change in terms of what we're seeing, in terms of behavior of clients or otherwise. I think that when you look at being at 91% -- I think we were close to 91% retention for the year last year, and also that was close to what the retention was the previous year, that -- those are -- the previous year was a historic high, and last year was 10 basis points off of that historic high. And so we clearly are planning and are working towards continuing improving our client retention, and we believe our new products and some of the things we're doing on the quality side should drive better retention. But when you get to these levels of retention, it does -- the laws of large numbers make it difficult, particularly in places like our Small Business segment, which by the way, has had good improvements there as well. But they have a natural amount of attrition, just because of companies going out of business and just dropping out of the system, because we count everything in our losses and in our client retention. And so having said that, that's maybe a long-winded way of saying that we are -- I'm very proud of the organization in terms of where we are, retention-wise, and we'll continue to push to try to get better. But it does get hard at the levels that we're at now.","Christopher R. Reidy","I would also just point out, Mark, that the first quarter is not a huge driver of attention for the year. And usually, our third quarter is what drives the full year a little bit more, with the -- end of calendar year change, et cetera. So it's right in line with expectations, and no surprises there. And as we said, we do expect it to tick up for the year.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And Carlos, it's higher, obviously, in nationals. Can you give us a sense for what that level is? And also, how was the communication strategy going with regards to the significant improvements that you've made, particularly in terms of Vantage and potentially getting people transition to the new platforms?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Sure. I think in terms of the retention -- with retention rates, in national accounts, they do approach the mid-90s, which is quite impressive. And by the way, in GlobalView, it's in the high 90s. So we -- and you really -- when you think about that, those clients are staying, on average, 20 years with us, so it's quite impressive. As you go down in the major accounts, obviously, low 90s, and then, when you get into Small Business, low 80s. But those are all very broad numbers, obviously. We're talking about tens of basis points here as we measure the results. So you can just see just how easy it is to move the needle from one year or the other from quarter-to-quarter. But we're quite happy with the overall retention results. On the question about transitioning clients, we have not transitioned, I believe -- I think we may have 1 or 2 clients that we are piloting in terms of transition over to Vantage. But we are trying to use our implementation capacity to gain new share and to sell new business as much as possible. We are, obviously, now developing plans to be able to migrate clients as well, because we are getting demand, obviously, from our existing clients that they want to move over to our newest technologies. But we want to do that obviously in a thoughtful way, precisely because of this conversation. We don't want to negatively impact client retention. As an example, in our Workforce Now solutions, we have been transitioning clients over to our new Workforce Now solutions. And frankly, the retention rate of the clients that have been transitioned is actually higher than what the retention rate was of those clients before they -- when they were on their old -- the older platforms that we had. So I think that's a testament to our associates who are doing an excellent job of transitioning those clients in a positive way, so that they get all the positive things of the new platforms without any of the negative consequences that sometimes transitions bring with them. So I'm very optimistic that our transitions will actually help our retention in that hurdle.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Timothy McHugh with William Blair.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I was wondering if you guys can give a quick update on your hiring expectations for the next year, especially that relates to the sales force? I think it was up 6% last year. And I think you may have previously mentioned that you expected to go 4% to 5% this year. So how do you progress towards that this quarter, and if that's changed at all?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think it's in that range, around 4%. And I think that's what we are hoping to do for the year, 4% to 5%. I think what we're trying to get to is double-digit sales growth, and we're trying to get there half through headcount growth and half through productivity improvements. And again, the last year was remarkable in terms of the productivity improvement we had. And some of that continued into the first quarter. And I sure hope that continues into the future, because it's a huge leverage point for us from a margin standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Follow-up on the question around health care particularly as we looked to 2014. We have some of the health insurers out indicating that they expect the potential for some employers with less than 10 employees to kind of push employees off on to the exchange. And I was wondering, as it relates to your PEO business, whether you sense a similar risk or is it just simply, at this point, too early? And if you do, if you could give us just some general sense of what that would potentially mean in terms of percentage of the PEO book? And then with any dynamic like this, I know there are other potential tailwinds, so I was wondering if you could point to any of those as well?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Sure. PEO is relatively unique in the sense that our average client size -- I used to know this off the top of my head when I ran that business -- I think it's in the 20s. So that, I think, is reflective of a typically larger average-sized client than in a typical PEO. We do have clients that are under 10 but I can tell you that our sales policies and our sales training and our efforts are aimed at clients over 10. And it's been that way for over decades. So it's not as a result of the changes in health care. We just believe that once clients are under 10, the risk profiles from both the health care and the Workers' Compensation standpoint are not as attractive. So we naturally gravitate towards clients that are larger than 10 employees, but we do have, obviously, some clients that are under 10 employees. And so we're, obviously, watching that and monitoring, as I said earlier. And get a full deep reef next week, when I'm with the folks from TotalSource, just try to understand that better. But I think we're in a pretty good position just because of the types of clients that we sell to and the average type client that we have in the PEO. And I think you have another question, I apologize, I...","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, it's just a sense of any time you get this type of change there's -- always present some headwinds but also some tailwinds. And I was wondering, based upon what you know now, what other aspects of the business you might see a positive pickup in?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, it's a great question, because I'm fond of saying that ADP has been really benefiting from government regulation and compliance requirements and that tailwind for decades. So each time new regulation come up -- again, as a full-service provider in addition to just providing the technology -- we help clients with compliance. It's part of what we sell. And so you look at our set of HCM system solutions today, the likes of COBRA, FSA, now we're going to have the same sorts of situation in health care, where in addition to just helping people manage operationally their benefits plans, they're going to be -- serious compliance requirements that you're going to need to have someone's help with. You're going to have to have a time and attendance system to track who's part time and who's not part time. You're going to have to send out eligibility notices, telling people when they're eligible for health care, otherwise you'll get fined. And so all these things are significant tailwind to us and creates significant opportunities for us to go out and take advantage of and exploit. And that's what we're in the process of doing, building solutions and capabilities to help our clients get through these new requirements.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just want to start with my best wishes to you. I always enjoyed working with you.","Christopher R. Reidy","Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Thank you.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Certainly. Good luck to you. I guess just two quick ones. Just new sales obviously saw and there were a lot of questions about that, but any change in client desire to outsource more than before? Or is it really more just clients looking to be smarter -- existing clients being smart about some of their resources and pushing more to ADP?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We've been -- every time we do our strategic plan, we visit this issue of how many people are using outsources versus how many people are doing in-house versus how many people use software. And there have  been some changes depending on which market segment you look at with, for example, in-house declining, with software and outsourcing going up in small business. But in our larger space, the major accounts, the national accounts, those numbers have stayed relatively constant. So I think people do make a decision around whether or not they want to outsource, or they want to use software, or whether they want to be in-house. And they tend to stick with that. And so our job is, obviously, trying to convince people who are not outsourcing to become outsourcers but also to win as much market share in the space where people are willing to outsource. And we just haven't seen huge changes in those numbers over the last 5 to 10 years, other than in small business with some migration from do-it-yourself or  in-house to using software and also using outsourcers.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. So as a follow-up to that last point, thinking about the more self-service guys, like in Intuit and others, any thought on developing more assets that are geared towards the self-service side? And in addition, how about the indirect channel working more with banks and others to reach that market in this time of need for small businesses?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We have a very -- just for the record, we have a very robust and direct channel with banks and also with the CPAs. In fact, banks are very large part of our distribution. And we have do-it-yourself products that we provide to the banks which they private label, which -- with really us doing the processing in the background, which helps us take a lot of that segment of the market, that market share of the do-it-yourself providers. And so we actually have a couple of those relationships in the hopper right now, with banks that we're trying to provide them a do-it-yourself solution managed by us and provided by us as part of an overall solution to their small business clients. So I think we do compete in that space, but obviously, our strength is really in the outsourcing segment. But we do continue to look at that do-it-yourself market, and we, for now, have a tact at really using our bank partnerships.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. So do you foresee, Carlos, with the step-up and emphasis there in terms of investment to expand that? Or is it -- are you pretty happy with the go-to-market today?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, given the Intuit, I think -- is constantly thinking about our outsourcing market, we're constantly thinking about their do-it-yourself market. But having said that, when -- again, when we look of our strat plans and we look at the revenue per client that you generate on a do-it-yourself, pure software solution, a desktop or cloud, and you compare that to the revenue per client of an outsourced solution full service, it's really hard for us to really drive a lot of investment, a lot of attention to the do-it-yourself market, because we would have to sell really millions of additional clients to equate the same revenue that we get from selling in the outsourced market. So it's an attractive market, because it has a large number of units, the revenue per unit is quite low. But it's still obviously an opportunity, potentially to also upgrade and migrate clients upwards, so we're always looking at all those dynamics in that do-it-yourself market.","Operator","Your final question comes from line of James Friedman with SIG.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Carlos, I was wondering, and you'd addressed this to some extent on the call, but I was wondering, such a dynamic time for the company and for the industry. What sort of resources are you putting towards both training the sales force, because they seem to have so much in their toolkit now, and also, training the customer as to the new opportunities and solutions in the market?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Those are incredibly insightful questions. And so as we become more of a full-service HCM provider, we spend a lot of time talking about what we need to do to give our sales force the right tools to be able to help our clients identify what we can do to help them improve their business, as well as reduce their total cost of ownership. So I think we're investing more in sales. We've had a number of we call them kind of certifications, if you will. But basically, attempts to get people additional information, whether it's around benefits or talent management, or other parts of HCM. So we put them through training and then we give them tests and then we give them certifications, basically, a seal of approval that you now have the ability to go sell a broader suite of services beyond just the simple payroll. So we are investing more in sales training. I think your point about the clients is also very valid. The good news is even though our products are new, and we have multi-modules, they're much easier to use, they're much more intuitive than part of the improvements and upgrades in our products in all 3 segments, in the RUN, in the Workforce Now and in the Vantage. So I think more intuitive and easier-to-use products require less training and less support, frankly. So it doesn't mean that you don't have to have a change of management, and we are doing a lot of that, obviously, as we roll out new products. But I'm very confident that positives way outweigh the negatives in the transition to the new client -- I'm sorry, to the new products.","So I appreciate -- I want to give Chris -- I know that a lot of you had long relationships and good relationships with Chris. So I think it's appropriate to give Chris a second maybe to give you some thoughts.","Christopher R. Reidy","Thanks, Carlos. And I do want to start out by thanking you all for year well wishes. Really, very extremely proud of the accomplishments we've had here in the past 6 years. And I think you would all agree that the company is positioned better than ever to take advantages of the opportunities in front of it.","I think we clearly articulated who we are as a company, and then we executed against that vision. We focused on our core businesses. We've emphasized top and bottom line growth, coupled with strong dividend payout ratio. I'll remind you that it was only 45% back in '07. So we've increased that steadily over the past 6 years.  And we couple that with consistent, reliable share buybacks and acquisitions that enhanced our HCM offerings.  I think we navigated the economic downturn extremely well. We said we'd continue to invest in product sales and service. And I think we delivered on that commitment.","In this downturn and throughout this downturn, we introduced many great new products that we're now talking about, including RUN, Workforce Now and Vantage. And they're redefining the HCM market.  Our investment in sales is clearly evident in our results, and our investments in services has had all-time highs and retention. So I think our clients have seen the benefits of these efforts. I know our competitors have noticed, and I think our investors and all of you have noticed as well.  We've tried to increase the visibility that we provided all of you and the transparency that we have provided all of you and the details of our business.  I know I'll miss the deep dives on the portfolio, on our laddering strategy and the impact of interest rates. And I'm sure you'll miss my deep dives. I'm sure Jan will go through those as well.","As I've said, I think ADP's in the best position that it's ever been. Carlos has a year under his belt. So it feels like no better time to take on my next career challenge. I really appreciate ADP for giving me the first large public company CFO role, and it's been fun.","So thanks very much.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I just want to thank Chris one more time. It's really been a remarkable 6 years when you think about going through the most difficult downturn that I'm sure any of us will ever see. And Chris' part in helping us navigate through that is greatly appreciated. I also want to acknowledge that Chris leaves us with an incredibly strong and talented finance organization which he's helped to build over the last several years, so we appreciate that.","And just in closing, just want to reiterate again that we were very pleased with our first quarter results. As you can tell from the tone of our comments, I think our businesses are performing very well. Unfortunately, we continue to experience this headwind from interest rates, and there were some noise in the first and will be in the second quarter with some items. But I think the underlying trends in the business segments is quite positive.","Chris just mentioned the dividend. We continue to be, I think, focused on being shareholder friendly both in terms of dividends and on share repurchases. And the last comment I'll make is we're going to continue to focus on growing the business and enhancing shareholder value.","We look forward to talking to you in the next quarter. And again, to all of those who are impacted by the hurricane, our best wishes for a speedy recovery.","Thank you, again, for joining us today.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

My name is Brian, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Brian, and good morning everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations, and I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call and Webcast.","During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","I also wanted to highlight for you that the quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings for our reportable segments is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website. These schedules have been updated to include the first quarter of fiscal 2018.","Before Carlos begins, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","Now let me turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Christian, and thank you for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. This morning, we reported our first quarter fiscal 2018 results, with reported and organic revenue up 6% to $3.1 billion. We're pleased with this revenue growth which was above our expectations.","Revenue growth in the quarter includes approximately 1 percentage point of pressure from the fiscal 2017 disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, which were substantially offset by the benefits from foreign currency.","Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 6% to $0.91 per share and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. Overall, this earnings growth in the quarter exceeded our expectations, and we're very pleased with our solid results, which Jan will walk through in more detail shortly.","New business bookings during the first quarter were down 3% compared to the first quarter of 2017. This performance was in line with our expectations as we begin to realize the benefits of our fiscal 2017 head count investments while we continue to manage through the effects of the regulatory uncertainty that has prevailed since last year's U.S. elections. Despite the short-term bookings pressure, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our down-market businesses and the solid results in our multinational business.","As we communicated previously, we continue to expect our bookings growth to gradually expand back to pre-ACA growth levels as we progress through the year. As a result, we continue to anticipate full year fiscal 2018 new business bookings growth of 5% to 7%.","On the client retention front, we experienced a 160 basis point improvement during the quarter, which was ahead of our expectations and saw positive growth across all of Employer Services Markets. This performance is due in part to our continued efforts to upgrade clients to strategic cloud platforms as well as the investments we've made to improve the client service experience while also aided by the easier compare from our fiscal 2017 first quarter federal government OPM contract loss.","Our client upgrade initiatives continue to progress nicely and now we have more than 83% of our clients on our strategic solutions.","We also continue to make good progress on our Service Alignment Initiative where we now have 2,000 associates across our three new scalable service centers and 5,400 associates in total across all five of our strategic service locations, delivering service to clients across the HCM spectrum.","I'm proud of these efforts and of our speed to execute, which have enabled us to rationalize our footprint by exiting nine subscale facilities this quarter. This represents a closure of 63% of our total planned exits under this initiative in just over one year.","The progress we are making with respect to new platforms and improved service is leading to happier clients and improvement in our NPS scores. It isn't just our own internal metrics that are helping tell the story. Last month, G2 Crowd, a leading business software review platform ranked our Workforce Now solution number one in satisfaction for payroll and HR management suites in their fall mid-market grid report. In analyzing the reviews of actual users of the products, ADP was also named the leader in all five HR software categories: payroll, HR management suites, core HR, performance management and applicant tracking systems.","We're excited about the innovations we continue to introduce to the market that are helping clients meet the dynamic needs of an evolving workforce. And it's gratifying to see these investments in HCM innovation continue to be recognized with prominence in the industry.","A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to attend the HR Technology Conference in Las Vegas where few of these innovations took center stage. For the third consecutive year at HR Tech, ADP was recognized with an HR Product of the Year Award from Human Resources Executive magazine, this time for our Compass Solution which is designed to boost the leadership and collaboration behaviors of our clients' employees. In addition to this recognition, we scored a second three-peat at the show after our Pay Equity Explore Solution was named one of HR Executive's Awesome New Technologies.","Pay Equity Explorer is a powerful tool that combines data science and benchmarking and is built on the biggest data sect in HCM, the ADP Data Cloud. It was developed to help clients uncover insights and identify potential opportunities when it comes to gender or race pay gaps, so they can stay competitive in the war for talent.","Innovation is a job that's never done. While we are incredibly excited about the solutions we are delivering in the market today, we are even more excited about the future. In September, we had the opportunity to brief HCM industry analysts on the new products and services coming out of our global product and technology organization. At the event, we previewed our next generation of client-centered innovation including a low code application development platform that enables internal and external development teams to build agile country, segment and client-specific applications, leveraging the latest technology and delivered by the public cloud.","We also shared progress on our efforts to deliver next-gen payroll and tax filing engines which will further increase our differentiation in payroll and payments. These engines are designed for multi country localization and will enable us to deliver paid and other services with greater flexibility based not only on the needs of our clients today, but also their evolving future needs as organizations are increasingly comprised of both full-time and contract workers. ADP's unique ability to meet the needs of our clients today while anticipating their needs in the future have been hallmarks of our success over the past 68 years, and will drive our sustained growth in the years ahead.","Also before I turn the call over to Jan, I'd like to say a few words on our acquisition of Global Cash Card, which we announced in October. At the core of HCM is ensuring employees are paid accurately, securely and in a timely fashion. This is the DNA of ADP. And with the acquisition of Global Cash Card, we are strengthening and expanding this core capability.","For those not familiar, Global Cash Card is a leader in digital payments, including pay cards and other electronic accounts. The digital payment space is an exciting one for the future of payroll. The increasing use of contract workers in the gig economy has driven the demand for these accounts, which can let independent contractors bring their various wages and expenses into a single account, providing the best picture of their financial well being.","From the employer's perspective, digital payments can be less expensive, more immediate and a more secure option than other means of payment such as paper checks. With this acquisition, ADP becomes the only HCM provider with a proprietary digital payments processing platform which will be integrated with our aligned pay card solution for a seamless client experience. We are excited about this acquisition and we're pleased to welcome the Global Cash Card team to the ADP family.","I'm proud of the efforts of our associates. Our results in the quarter continue to reflect the enduring qualities of ADP, including a culture that is relentlessly focused on delivering a great client experience through best-in-class technology and unparalleled service.","Fiscal 2018 is off to a good start, and we look forward to turning over full attention to advancing our strategy and delivering on our commitments to all stakeholders, clients, shareholders and associates alike.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our first quarter results.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning everyone. In my commentary to follow, I will be referencing non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of certain items in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 as well as a first quarter fiscal 2017 restructuring charge of about $40 million related to our Service Alignment Initiative. A description of these charges and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","As Carlos mentioned, ADP revenues grew 6% in the quarter to $3.1 billion on a reported and organic basis. On a reported basis, net earnings grew 9% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, declined 3% on a reported and constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 150 basis points compared to 19.8% in last year's first quarter.","This decrease was slightly better than our expectations despite additional pressure from growth in our pass-through revenues and a very difficult first quarter fiscal year 2017 compare when we expanded margins by 230 basis points. As a reminder, this strong first quarter fiscal year 2017 margin performance was driven by incremental ACA-related revenues, together with operating efficiencies and lower selling expenses, which now have lapped.","During the quarter, we continued our planned investments into innovation, service and distribution while we worked through the short-term pressure from the anticipated lower revenue growth in the first half of fiscal year 2018. As we manage for the pace of our transformation efforts to upgrade our clients and to transform our service experience, we believe these investments will continue to help us deliver against our long-term financial strategic objectives.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 6% to $0.91 and 6% on a constant dollar basis and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. Our adjusted effective tax rate was positively impacted by unplanned stock compensation tax benefits, which accounted for approximately 90 basis points of the overall decline in our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter or $0.05 to our adjusted diluted earnings per share.","As Carlos mentioned, our new business bookings were down 3% and in line with our expectations for the quarter as we begin to reaccelerate our bookings growth and overcome the remaining additional sales of Affordable Care Act-related modules in the first half of fiscal year 2017. Overall, I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, off to a positive start and we're making good progress as we execute against our strategic initiatives.","Now let me take you through our segment results before moving on to our fiscal year 2018 outlook. In our Employer Services segments, revenues grew 2% for the quarter and 3% on an organic basis. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.4% in the first quarter. Average client fund balances grew 6% compared to a year ago, 5% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions of net new business and increased wage levels compared to the prior first year's quarter.","Outside the U.S., we continued to see solid performance from our international operations with double-digit revenue growth in our multinational businesses. Employer Services margin decreased about 110 basis points in the quarter. This decrease was driven by continued investments into our operations, innovation and distribution.","The PEO continues to perform well, growing revenues 14% in the quarter with average worksite employees growing nicely by 10% to 484,000 employees. This revenue growth was primarily driven by the growth in average worksite employees and accelerated growth in healthcare renewal premiums. This accelerated growth and pass-through healthcare premiums was also the primary driver for the 60 basis points decline in PEO margins this quarter. But its impact is expected to abate as the year progresses. And I'm pleased with the performance of both of our segments in this quarter. And as Carlos mentioned, we are off to a good start.","Before I discuss our fiscal year 2018 outlook, I wanted to highlight some additional detail regarding the acquisition of Global Cash Card. The results of operations of this business will be included in the Employer Services segment, and I expect it to contribute just under 1 percentage point of growth to our updated revenue guidance. While we anticipate future synergies, we also anticipate some slight pressure to margins this year, largely driven by integration costs. Accordingly, we have factors these operational impacts into our updated fiscal year 2018 outlook.","As a reminder, fiscal year 2018 has a mix of factors impacting revenue growth and margin the first half of the year, including the disposal of our CHSA and COBRA businesses in November of fiscal year 2017, the impacts to revenue and margin from the incremental ACA-related revenues during the first half of fiscal year 2017 which now have been fully lapped, and also the impact to revenue growth in fiscal year 2018 from lower retention and lower than anticipated new business bookings in fiscal year 2017. With these items in mind, I will now take a moment to walk through our revised outlook with you.","First, as Carlos mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our full year new business bookings guidance of 5% to 7% growth on the $1.65 billion sold in fiscal year 2017. With the acquisition of Global Cash Card and some adjustments to our anticipated impacts from our foreign currency translation, we have updated our consolidated revenue forecast growth to 6% to 8% compared to our prior forecast of 5% to 6%. And Employer Services revenue growth of 4% to 5% compared to our prior forecast of 2% to 3%. Separately, we are reaffirming our PEO revenue guidance of 11% to 13%.","We are also now expecting growth in client fund interest revenue to increase $45 million to $55 million compared with our prior forecasted increase of $40 million to $50 million. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is now expected to be up $35 million to $45 million compared to the prior forecast increase of $30 million to $40 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","Our margin forecast remains unchanged. We continue to anticipate our consolidated adjusted EBIT margin to contract 25 to 50 basis points from 19.8% in fiscal year 2017. And at the segment level, we continue to anticipate margin contraction in Employer Services of 50 to 75 basis points, with PEO margins expected to expand 25 to 50 basis points. We now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 5% to 7% compared to our prior forecast of 2% to 4%, aided by about one percentage points from the first quarter stock compensation-related tax benefit.","Having fully returned the proceeds of our debt offering to shareholders in fiscal year 2017, this forecast does not contemplate any further share buybacks beyond anticipated dilution related to equity compensation plans. However, it remains our intent to return excess cash to shareholders, subject to market conditions.","So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will take our first question from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Just I guess on the retention front, I'm curious where you're seeing the greatest improvement there. Is it more in the mid-market as you convert to strategic cloud platforms? Any color across the organization?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Well, I think as I mentioned in my comments, I think this quarter, the improvements were really across all of our ES segments. And as we've said in the past many times, retention can be a very volatile metric especially as you get into the up market. But this quarter, we happened to have good news and we're very happy about it. We think that is not just because of volatility but I think because some of the things we've been doing around investments in our service organization. We see our NPS scores coming up and so, we're very pleased with that.","I would say that, to your question about the mid-market, we are not finished yet with the migrations of our clients in the mid-market. We have about 2,000 left. We still think that we'll be close to done, if not done, by the end of the calendar year. We may have a couple of stragglers. But we do expect to be substantially done by the end of the year and that does put pressure on our retention because as we've mentioned multiple times, and the same still holds true, there's quite a substantial difference in retention between our strategic platform in mid-market and our legacy platform. So, what you're alluding to, we hope and we expect will happen a couple quarters from now as we get all these migrations and the mid-market behind us. But that would not be one of the reasons why there was improvement in the mid-market as well as in the rest of ES this quarter.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Thanks for that.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","One additional comment, don't forget that we had a little bit of an easier grow over this quarter. We lapped the loss of a large client that we talked about last, first quarter in the year. So, the improvement was in particular visible in the enterprise space but partially aided by the lapping of that large client loss.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think the impact of that large loss was around 100 basis points last year.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","That's exactly right.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So, the right way to look at this is about 60 basis point improvement in retention for the quarter.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. You get that back but still a little bit better. Okay, good, good, good. Just my quick follow up just on PEO. The WSE unit growth, up 10%, I think that's a little bit below trend. Anything to read into there in PEO?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Other than that it's getting really big. And we're still pretty happy with 10% unit growth. I don't think anything further to report there, but that's becoming a very large, we're close the 0.5 million worksite employees. That's one of the largest employers in the U.S., if you look at it as, which we do, as an employer even though there are sub-clients. Obviously there's more than 10,000 clients in the PEO, but it's a very large \u2013 the way we treat it for, the way we have our retirement program and the way we have our workers' compensation and benefits, et cetera. We are a co-employer and consider ourselves a co-employer for the purposes of some of the responsibilities around employment. And so technically, I think we're probably in the top five now in terms of size of employers in the U.S. which is becoming a very large base. But we feel pretty happy and pretty satisfied with that kind of growth rate.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","The development is right in line with our expectations and as you saw we are reaffirming our revenue guidance so, going good.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks for the update.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning guys. I just wanted to follow up on the comments around the migrations. I think you said 83% of clients have now been migrated to the next-gen platforms. Can you tell us in terms of percentage of revenue where we stand on that? And then any comments around a reasonable new bookings growth range for Q2. Thanks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So just to make sure we get our language clear here, because we have introduced some new terminologies. So, when we refer to next-gen platforms, so we have our strategic platforms, which are Workforce Now, RUN, Vantage and our Global View multinationals platform. We did start talking and we mentioned it in our introductory comments that we talked to industry analysts in mid-September about our next-generation platforms which we have only a handful of clients on today. So, I just want to make sure I clarified the language there. As we go forward, we'll be more careful about making sure that we pick the right language. So, and I'm sorry, what was the rest of the question?","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just the percentage of revenue then I guess that has migrated to the strategic platforms, because I think you said 83% of clients but percentage of revenue.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So since we still have a lot of work to do in the up-market where we've really only begun the migrations, I think that's consistent with what we've said before in our publicly released information around the proxy contest. I think we included there about 51% of our revenues being on our strategic platforms that I just mentioned the names of. It's very important to note that when we talk about our strategic platforms, we have a number of areas of our business where there's really no immediate plan to migrate or move clients.","So for example, our insurance services, our retirement services, we have some international platforms that we're happy with that we're not planning any movement there. So, we could probably in the future be able to provide some more color around the quote-unquote addressable market. In other words, what part of our client base is really up for migration, if you will, but the right answer, the straight answer is 51%. But we're not aiming to get to 100%, I guess is the.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And then Jason, if I pick up your question regarding the second quarter, is we're reaffirming just our full year guidance for 5% to 7%. And we don't give quarterly guidance really for our new business bookings nor any other number. And before, Carlos, the 51% of the revenues refers to ES revenues. That's our metric that we offer.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then it's good to hear about some of the innovation investments that you're doing. Any detail we can get on latest trends with respect to your overall R&D spending, the budgets there in terms of the maintenance R&D piece for some of the legacy platforms and how much of the R&D budget is being directed to new product development, and any shifts in those ratios?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Sure. We disclose a lot of information, again as we've been trying to communicate with shareholders about some of the things we've been doing here over the last five or six years. We've disclosed, I think, some additional information about that. And I think starting off with the fact that we've increased our innovation spend from around $150 million to around $450 million, I think or somewhere thereabouts in that neighborhood, so it's a significant amount of increase in our R&D investment.","A large part of that was in the next generation platforms that we just announced recently that we've been working on here in some cases for three to four years. But we've also made big investments in things like our data cloud and things like our mobile solutions and some of the other products and innovations that we actually already have out in the market and are helping us, I think, with our efforts in terms of helping our clients and also helping drive new business bookings and retention and so forth. So, that's a sense of what's happened with the innovation spend.","On the maintenance spend, for the sake of I guess government work, it's about flat. So it's increased slightly. But again, in the world of some inflation, the fact that we've held that constant, we see that as a good news story. It was a conscious effort to really shift the mix, if you will, in the balance of our spending to more innovation and less maintenance. A lot of our maintenance spend is focused on platforms that serve tens of millions of employees that get paid, both on our tax engine and our payroll engine. And so as we develop these next generation technologies, when we retire those legacy platforms, which is a ways down the road, then obviously, we would expect actual decreases in maintenance spend. But for the last several years, this has really been a story of increasing the spend and making sure that that spend is focused on innovation while we build out the necessary platforms to move clients to and then reduce the spending on those legacy platforms.","We have retired I think it's around 13 legacy platforms. So, it's the first time in a long time at ADP that we've actually retired things. So, it's not like we haven't made any progress, but those were relatively small dollar items in terms of the overall maintenance spend. The really big chunks of spend are on some of our large scaled legacy platforms that service, by the way, very well and are very efficient, very secure and very reliable. And we have no plans to get off of them in the next three to six months or any kind of timeframe like that. So this is a, as we always say, this is an evolutionary process, not an overnight change.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Well, thanks for all the comments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions. One, any sort of impact at all with regards to all the hurricanes in terms of sales cadence, implementations, anything along those lines? That's the first question. Second question is basically on the PEO and pass-through growth rate. When we think about long-term, would you expect this pass-through growth rate could be in this 14% range if we have underlying say PEO growth in the 10%, or how should we think about that from a longer-term perspective? And then lastly, can you just comment with regards to all the distractions that have been going on over the last few months in terms of how it's impacting the folks out in the field and operations? Thank you.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So, I'm going to let Jan maybe go through a few of the numbers here. But just quickly on the hurricanes and Jan will give you a sense of impact. Clearly, it had an impact on the business. But I just want to take a moment to also point out that these were massive storms, especially in Houston and in Puerto Rico. We have a decent sized business in Puerto Rico. We obviously have a very large presence in Texas and in Houston specifically. And what our associates and our infrastructure people did to be able to continue our business, not necessarily as usual, but to make sure the business went forward and that we served our clients was nothing short of heroic, including flying airplanes from Tampa when no other planes were flying into Puerto Rico to deliver supplies to our associates but also to deliver payrolls to the businesses that were actually still functioning and still wanting to pay their people so that they would be able to actually have money for, in obviously what was an incredible crisis. So, the fact that you're asking the question, I think shows the strength of ADP that we continued to perform and to deliver business as usual in the face of what was obviously a very, very challenging situation. I think Jan maybe has a little bit of color on the numbers.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, we experienced some impact on our new business bookings in the quarter, and October could have some bleed over, but as you can see from our reaffirming of our full year guidance on new business bookings, actually we had strong performance that overcame that in the quarter because we performed according to expectations. But there is an impact on our sales force and there could be an impact on our revenues and losses to be quite honest as Puerto Rico is recovering. It will not be material or meaningful to our overall full year performance, but we're sorting that out. So, the business and our clients in Puerto Rico are recovering and we're working with those clients, but not all of them are back online yet. But a large number has and there could be some second quarter impact. But it's not really that material it should impact your calculations.","In the long run, I think we expect this to be just back to business. There's a little bit of positive recovery impact that we sometimes experience in the longer sense of a year to 18 months out. But I would assume we're just going to work ourselves through it throughout the year.","Relative to your pass-through revenues, the 14% is a little bit on the high side. It has a variety of reasons. If you recall in the first half of last year, we experienced this meaningful margin expansion and the PEO and overall for ADP and it was part, as we illustrated then, by a lower than typical pass-through revenue growth. And so, the factors that impact our pass-through revenue growth are a multitude things that have all played in the last couple of years. The first thing is the participation rate in our PEO and throughout the introduction of the ACA in the last few years, we have seen an increase in employee participation in our PEO. That now has stabilized.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And health benefits.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Pardon me? And health benefits.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Sure.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And health benefits. Because, and that participation rate has now stabilized. So, we have seen now a year-over-year relative stable employee participation rate. What then comes is the overall renewal rate, which we're now experiencing is healthcare inflation as you would describe. And that's obviously dependent on the overall market development of medical health inflation. And the last component is the actual employee choice of plans of where we have seen a general trend to higher deductible, consumer health-oriented plans. But as a little bit of an anomaly in this quarter, actually employees opted out of the most skinny solution and diverted a little bit to higher-quality medical plans in our client base, which was a little unusual. So, the overall pass-through growth of 14% is relative to the 10% worksite employee growth is a little bit on the high side I would say in our long-term plans to anticipate. And we published this in our Investor Day pass-through growth of approximately 12% to 14%, Mark.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And just to point out, there have been times in our history in the PEO where it's been even higher than this. So as Jan said, it really depends on the general health care inflation environment. It's clearly not sustainable from a \u2013 it's not just about our PEO or our own company, but this is why there was healthcare reform to begin with, that you can't have this kind of healthcare inflation for a long period of time, because it just doesn't work from an economy standpoint. It becomes the entire GDP eventually.","So, it's safe to say that this is a number that has to, by definition, maybe not over a quarter or two or over one year, but that number has to at some point converge or regress back to the mean. But we have had times where we've had even bigger differential between worksite employee growth and our pass-through revenue growth. And this is probably from a three or four year standpoint, this is probably the highest it's been and it's probably in line with what you're hearing out in the world, right. Which is healthcare inflation's picking up a little bit.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Sure. I was just trying to get towards the longer-term and with a not so subtle reference to some of the discussion around, okay, well how much pass-through. When we think about the net operating profit margin growth that we're going to end up having, how much of an impact is the pass-throughs going to be and what's the right growth rate to factor in?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yes. We'll try to help with that, but again, what we encourage people to do is to look at Employer Services margins and profit growth and the PEO's margins and profit growth. Because what we're focused on is growing EPS and creating value for our shareholders. We're not fixated on a specific margin number even though we realize that the margin number is important to the overall economic model and to actually building a model that works.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","At the end of the day, it's return on invested capital, right?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Right. Exactly, I mean that's ultimately the \u2013 growth in Employer Services and profitability Employer Services and growth in PEO ultimately would drive return on invested capital and that's really the right way to focus on the business. As you know, our PEO business is our most profitable, most successful, best business. So, for us to get overly concerned about mix and what impact that has on the overall margin, I realize it's something we have to address and we have to talk about and help people with their models, but it's really not the right way to focus on the business.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I really appreciate that. Thanks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","One last thing, because you did mention about the distraction on the \u2013 I just wanted to answer that question because others may have the same question. I think the way I have been, had a lot of investors asking is the same thing, because there's a lot of concern about the distraction of the proxy contest and I would say that it's an extremely high distraction for an extremely small group of people. As you can see from the results of this quarter, it did not distract our associates or our sales force.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up quickly on Tien-tsin's earlier question on the PEO. Just the question is, you did see the PEO, the ending client's worksite employees down slightly sequentially. That's out of the ordinary for that business. I'm just curious if there's anything onetime going on. Did anything get pulled forward last quarter? Just maybe a little more color on the PEO would be helpful.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, I think, I wouldn't over interpret. This happens once in a while a little bit and we do have a little bit of fluctuations of how sales come in and how the last quarter ended. And they are like different growth dynamics. So, I noticed it myself but there is nothing out of the ordinary here in the field that I could report.","Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. That's helpful. Just a quick follow-up. You talked a little bit about the pay equity tool and the data cloud. Just wondering if you could talk more about what you guys are doing on big data. I know that's sort of the long-term thing that I believe Jan has been helping to lead. So, just any more details on the big data and the analytics progress would be helpful.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, so, as many of you know, we believe it is going to be one of our long-term strategic differentiators or is already today actually. We're selling a core product of data analytics and benchmarks to our core client base and to new clients, which is called Data Cloud that delivers now more than 30 benchmarks and we do sophisticated analytical reporting. And on top of that viewed as a platform we have released a numerous incremental value-add solutions and you see in our emerging strategy.","So, the first tool that we have been working on is a tool that allows our employers to manage the risk of employee retention and employee loss and can predict the likelihood of employees leaving the company and allow companies to way better manage performance. And over outcomes, we now released incremental tools on the pay equity explorer, which is a compliance tool that helps you to identify potential misalignment in your compensation relative to diversity measures.","And there is the richness of the tool is the exciting part because it will go in a variety of areas towards verticals, towards specific problems to be addressed. And you're going to see a continued innovation coming out and all being fully integrated into our cloud-based platform, which is the benefit that we are now reaping from having one data cloud tool that services all these strategic platforms and then the relative ease of integration of these insights and data analytics into the actual platform.","So, it's going to be a very important tool. And this innovation and explore the specific ones that Carlos mentioned really driving the differentiation, leading and client discussions helping us to increase our win rates. And so, it's truly exciting. And it is also revenue carrying. There's been a question around do we charge for this tool and we do charge for Data Cloud. It's a recurring revenue model that clients buy.","Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. [Operators Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of James Berkley with Barclays. Please proceed.","James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks guys. Looks like your top line guidance ticked up about 200 basis points, at the high-end of the range, versus an incremental 100 expected improvements coming from Global Cash and FX combined. Is this just a function of rounding or trends surpassing your prior expectations? Thanks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think it's probably, it's both. I think we had, we obviously feel better about what's going on with retention and I think the trends in the business. We got a little bit of help from, even from float income as you mentioned because that actually flows into our top line as well as into our bottom line. But I think you're correct that that just happens to be the way the numbers have fall out as well. So I think it's both things.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","It's Global Cash Card, FX and then a tiny bit of pass-through is in our increased guidance also. So, that may be the third factor if you're looking for a third factor.","James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up. You guys obviously did your down-market replatforming, doubled margins over a six-year period. The mid-market's almost wrapped up here. Could you just talk about your expectations from margin expansion over like say, another six-year period for the mid-market and then your thoughts on the up-market longer-term as well?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Sure. I think that one of the things we've been as we've been kind of going out talking to folks, making sure that this is an opportunity now to make sure everyone understands that the starting point for margins in terms of the amount of room there is for improvement was larger in the small business market than it is in the mid-market. So we have a successful good business in the mid-market including healthy margins.","We do think that based on what we see around retention potential because the real, one of the really important improvement to the small business division was the rise in retention which has a fairly big impact in that business on margins because the amount of business you have to sell, which brings with it sales cost, implementation cost, is less to achieve the same growth objective if you will.","And so that was an important part of that picture, if you will, in small business, the improvement in retention. I am hopeful, based on what we're seeing so far, that we are going to experience good improvements in retention in our mid-market as well once we're through migrations all of our clients on one platform.","Better retention should have the same impact that it had on SBS in the sense that you have sell that much less business in order to achieve the same growth rate or you can grow faster, like it's either you get the best of both worlds that you can choose which way depending on market conditions you want to move.","But the absolute starting point is important as it is always in any situation. And again, we don't give specifics sub segment data if you will. Neither do any of our competitors, I would just point out. But the fact is the margins are higher. They were higher to begin with in mid-market and the replatforming is really about strengthening our competitive position, driving faster growth and hopefully some modest improvement in margins as well because we do expect to get higher retention rates in the mid to long term as we get all of our clients onto one platform.","James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just maybe wanted to ask a follow-up question on the margin side of things. Can you maybe just give us an update short-term in terms of your investment programs on service realignment and any other new products and how that's kind of contributing to the margin degradation in the next couple quarters.","And then as we exit the year and head into 2019, is it reasonable to expect that you would, as you kind of get to the compounded 50 to 75 bps of long-term margin expansion you've guided to, whether we'd see kind of above normalized margin expansion in the back half of this year and heading into 2019?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, Jim. This year, we have about a similar amount of dual operations costs. I think it's about 20 to 25 basis points of margin pressure for the company in this fiscal year. And as we then complete our service alignment initiative, I think Carlos mentioned, we're making good progress on it. We exited nine locations already in this fiscal year and we are really on track on and on time. We see that those new associates going to be settling in and dual ops is going to disappear and then the next year, fiscal year 2019 and 2020, we did actually provide investors with an idea about the margin expansion which we I think characterized to be around 100 basis points at the enterprise level in our presentations.","And there's nothing changed in our view that that, what we would be doing at this point in time. So the dual ops would be dissipating and then I think also elsewhere in that presentation we alluded to the fact that we see then the benefit of the workflow efficiency, wage advantages and so forth that our strategic locations offer and contributing incremental to it, the productivity improvements and cost efficiencies. So I think what we're presenting is kind of the current plan.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, and think I also want to point out again, I want to say it one more time that clearly some of the pressure we're experiencing is from investments, because we have been investing in our sales force for example. But it's just important to note that some of what's happening in terms of these numbers is still these mathematical grow-overs and comparisons. Because last year, in the first half of the fiscal year, so the last two quarters of the calendar year, we had almost 20% operating income growth, and then in the last two quarters of the fiscal year, first two quarters of the calendar year, because of the ACA grow-over in the comparisons of having lapped the revenues, the revenue comparison, we ended up having the numbers go in the opposite direction.","And the two quarters that we're in right now, the quarter that we're just reporting plus the next quarter, are really mirror images of the first two quarters of the calendar year. And then as we've said multiple times in our guidance, our second half of this fiscal year gets back from a margin standpoint, from a growth standpoint, from a bookings standpoint to a more reasonable normalized place, if you will.","So unfortunately the way \u2013 you guys know this better than anyone else \u2013 like whenever, whether it's an acquisition or ACA or some other factor, you have to really look beyond that to understand what's really happening beneath the covers. And so we had 12 months of easy comparisons, and then we had 12 months of hard comparisons. And we have, I guess right now, a couple more months before we get through those difficult comparisons.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful context. Thank you. And then maybe a follow-up on the product side, maybe for Carlos. As you think about your enterprise product suite and how you plan to refresh and augment it over time, you referenced the low code application development platform. Can you maybe give us a sense about your conversations with clients in the early stages? What are the elements of this platform that are resonating with them? And do you get a sense that any of the enterprises that may be shopping around are swayed or potentially have changed their mind about switching off of an ADP platform or staying on an ADP platform because of this?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Well we hope, we do for example invite clients on a regular basis to visit our Innovation Center in New York City in Chelsea to kind of get first hand knowledge of some of the things that we're working on. And it's not just about the platform. We have other things that we are working on as well that we share with our clients. So obviously, part of that is an effort to make sure the clients understand our roadmap and so that they stick with us as we get through product development and then eventually a transition to our New York platforms.","I think that would be true in each of our business segments, but it's obviously very important in the up-market enterprise space where the client lifecycles are very, very long. So we have very high retention rates in our up-market business. Client stay 15 to 20 years on average. And obviously if they are staying with ADP for that long, that means they've already been through multiple changes in technology with ADP over the years.","So this is just another evolution if you will, which makes the products better for them, easier to use, easier to service, easier to upgrade. So these are all, I think, part of leveraging technology, which is one of the central themes that we've had here for the last five or six years. So we're really trying to do what ADP's been doing for many years with a slight change in emphasis, with greater emphasis on product and technology than maybe historically we had had 5, 10, 15 years ago.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please proceed.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. It's been a while since we've been in any favorable rate environment. So could you just help, or just review for us how higher rates flow through to ADP and how much of that perhaps is shared with a client and gets reflected in pricing over time?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So the second part is a tricky question, because the way it gets shared, if you will, is it makes our company stronger. It allows us to, for example, theoretically, to be more careful with price increases. None of which \u2013 so I guess the answer is, we haven't changed anything. Like it hasn't \u2013 if rates were as you know because of the way our portfolio is laddered, even though we felt multiple years of pressure on the downside, we are getting a little bit of help here on the upside. But there's really, this isn't like an overnight, and I don't mean overnight in the sense of rates. But because of the laddering, there's not that kind of dramatic of a change that we are all of sudden that it's raining money out of the helicopters and we have to figure out what to do with it.","But we definitely appreciate it. It's better than it was when it was going in the other direction. So it's all positive. So I think historically, I think it probably make us stronger, more competitive. But we really don't \u2013 there's no pricing mechanism. We didn't raise prices, when interest float income went down and rates went down. And we don't plan on lowering prices when it goes up. I guess to be completely direct.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Can I give of more couple more technical updates, David? There is no, if you ask revenue share of float income with any of our clients, we don't have that business model. It is a negotiated fee price and then some of our products actually declines really, we negotiate with them the value of the float and it reflects in the next contractual relationship we have with our clients. But it is not an explicit revenue share of float income.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And, Jan, just to add, just to be even more clear, we lost $300 million in float income and that's assuming that the balances have stayed flat, but the balances actually grew from about $15 billion to over $20 billion during that period of time. And I am thinking back to like 2007 and 2008 when we peaked in terms of our float income. And so there's a long way to go to get back to that $300 million and that would not be even adjusting for inflation and for growth.","And as Jan just said, we don't have those kinds of arrangements. We didn't increase our prices when that was going on. So we managed to improve our margins and grow our business in the face of that kind of headwind. And so I think it feels fair to us to now enjoy the fruits of a better environment on a go-forward basis would be the way we would look at it.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Understood. Thank you for that. And then I just have a follow-up to the last question that was asked about a little bit about the product roadmap for the up-market. Can you give us a better sense of timing of when you, or how you expect to roll out some the new future functionality of what you're working on. At least in your mind, what are the major changes, if you will, that you're making to the new version of the up-market product?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We never said there's a new version to an up-market product. And so you shouldn't say it either. So what we built was, we built a platform on which we can build apps that could serve a number of different clients. It could be used globally. It could be used in the up-market and frankly someday, can be used in the mid-market. So we're not ready. We shared a lot of information with industry analysts and we're trying to share as much information with all of you without sharing so much information that it creates a competitive problem for us. And so we're not ready to say exactly what we're doing and where we're going.","But I can tell you that the benefits are obviously usability, speed to change and speed to development, cost of maintenance, not to mention cost of development. So there are a number of benefits that we will get from our product development efforts. And that's really only talking about the low code development platform. We also have two very large investments in back-office systems. So this is our gross-to-net payroll engine and our tax engine as well.","There we expect and the plan is to have that be completely transparent. These engines are back-office engines that are really not visible to the clients. They just, they create outcomes. The front ends are Workforce Now, Vantage, and some of our other front-end products. And so there's really no expected impact assuming that we execute well in the kind of transition, if you will, to a new gross-to-net payroll and also tax engine.","The expectation for improvements, though, are fairly significant in the sense that we'll have a lot more flexibility around the things we can do around payments. So we may choose to, we may not necessarily do it, but we'll have the ability to do same-day payments, real-time payments. We'll have a lot more flexibility around speed to make changes, whether they're statutory or competitive changes in our systems. And then the cost of maintenance and the cost of support will go down significantly based on our business cases that we have for these back-office engines.","So these are really modernization efforts because those platforms serve us incredibly well today at high scale, high reliability and high security. But we believe based on our business cases that obviously, whether it's two, five, seven years down the road, that new technology can help us leverage those services that we provide in a much more efficient manner.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO. Please proceed.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey good morning, it's Henry Chen calling for Jeff. Just a question on the changing guidance for the EPS or adjusted EPS. Could you break out how much of that is the impact of the acquisition and how much is FX if you could?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Well the impact of the acquisition would be zero because it's zero. It's a great business and it's a good-sized revenue business fortunately it's around breakeven is the way we would describe it. So it's not a huge drag on our earnings and it's not a huge help. It has a small drag on margins obviously because at breakeven, and with some reasonable revenues, it doesn't help our margins. But I would say no impact in terms of EPS guidance from acquisitions. And the other, I'm sorry the second part of your question was?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I can give you a little bit on the tax side. Actually, that's a big chunk of it. It's a little less than 2% of that increase comes from tax and that's just the good performance that we had as well as the $0.05 that we'll have in flow-through.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it, Okay. And FX?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I don't have anything here. We're looking it up. I don't think it's that meaningful really.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Okay, got it. And just a second question on bookings growth and how it's tracking for the year. Just curious if you have a sense of what are some of the drivers for the rest of the year, whether it's product or by market for new bookings growth? Thanks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think for bookings growth, what we try to look at is the noise in the system has been pretty significant in the last 24 months because first, we had ACA and then we didn't have ACA. So I have to preface my comments by saying, it hasn't been exactly business as usual. But in typical business as usual for ADP, we would have a head count increase, accompanied by a productivity increase of our sales force, which would lead to our sales result.","And so the mechanisms that we would, the buttons that we would push to try to increase or improve our new business bookings would generally be around increasing our head count, or our capacity if you will of sales, because we could also spend money on digital marketing and other tools that make our sales force more efficient. And then what can we do around products to drive the productivity, because some of the productivity is just like in any business, we expect our sales force to do a little bit better each year. But we also try to give them better products and more things to sell so that they can also grow their productivity that way.","So one of the things we did last year is, in the face of the challenges we were having, we decided to actually invest in head count. We'd had two or three years where we were able, because of the tailwind of the ACA, to put less into head count because we were getting more from productivity. And we opted last year really to, in order to make sure that we had a good couple of years of new business bookings, we invested in our head count. And we're now I think at about 7% head count growth year-over-year.","That's pretty healthy for us when you look at the last five or six years. It doesn't have an immediate impact because those people have to become productive. They have to get ramped up. They have to get into the field. But as those people mature, that's an investment that should pay off for us for several years to come as those new sales reps become more mature and become more productive over time.","So I guess the answer your question is, the reason we feel good about our forecast, which again is subject to interference by, as we just saw the government had a fairly large change in direction nine months ago. So we can't ever say we're 100% sure, but we look at certain metrics that give us confidence in terms of what we have in terms of guidance and it's mainly around head count and modest productivity improvement.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay, thanks.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And throughout the year, basically, what we'll see is that that accelerated head count growth naturally becomes more productive as that sales force is maturing. And then secondly, it's an easier grow-over. So for your type of modeling, I think those are the two major growth drivers that will make the comparison, the second half of the year look \u2013 that will accelerate the growth in the second half of the year.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. All right. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question. Our final question will come from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. This is Jay Hanna on for Gary today. Thanks for sneaking me in at the end. Just regard to the three-year framework you laid out recently, should we expect any change to that based on the fiscal 2018 guidance increase given this quarter?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I don't think so because as Jan said, I mean I think it's first of all, it's early. We're through the first quarter and I think you could tell that we feel good about our results. We feel good about the future. But I think it's premature. We did get help from tax. We did get a little bit of help from on the growth rate from the floating come. So I think it's just too early. But directionally, we feel good. But I think it's way too early to think about how the first quarter impacts 2020 for us.","Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then with the next-gen tools and migrations you spoke to earlier, is any of that associated with the 500 basis points in margin accretion that you've spoke to recently as well?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","No, the scale and operational improvement that we illustrated in our margin long-term outlook is not counting on these next-generation products making a meaningful impact for that planning horizon, which ends at 2020.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, and I think part of the reason for that is we've obviously invested a lot already. But now we're in the process of quote-unquote hardening and also getting clients. We do have clients, by the way, on each of the three next-generation platforms. These are real platforms that we've invested hundreds of millions of dollars in over multiple years. So we feel good about it. They're real and they're going to drive long-term efficiency, lower costs, stronger sales, better client experience. But from a timing standpoint, I think it's clearly way too early I think for us to be factoring those types of improvements into our forecast. But for, there is no question that whether it's in 2020 or the last half of 2020 or in 2021 or 2022, these investments are expected to have meaningful impacts on ADP's competitiveness and its profitability as well.","Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you. As you could see, we're off to a really good start, and we're happy that the initiatives that we have around enhancing our service, the innovation of our products and expanding our distribution model are working. And we have obviously a lot of confidence that I think the investments will continue to deliver the results we expected from those investments, especially in the latter half of fiscal 2018 and beyond.","Over the last several months, obviously we've been involved in this proxy contest and I just want to acknowledge for a minute our associates, because obviously, some of them may feel like their efforts have been put into question during this process. And as I mentioned, I think the distraction has been largely to a small group, but inevitably our associates also hear some of the noise out in the market. And I just want to thank our associates for the resolve that they've had in delivering to our clients what the clients expect from ADP. And I also want to thank them for the encouragement they've given to us to continue to move beyond the distraction and continue to deliver valuable services to our clients. The dedication, I think, and the attentiveness and the integrity, more importantly, of our associates is what makes this company great and it's what our founder I think insisted on. And I'm confident that with their help and their support, we're going to continue to make ADP successful.","I also want by extension to thank our shareholders and the confidence they've put in our management and our board. As we've gone around visiting and talking to investors, the encouragement that we've gotten from them, I think just strengthened our resolve to continue to do the right thing for them, and also on their behalf.","And so with that, I want to thank you again for joining us, and thank you for your interest in ADP.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Elena Charles, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elena Charles","Thank you, and good morning. I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call and webcast.","As a reminder, the quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings for our reportable segments is also available in the Investor Relations portion of our website. Please be aware that we recently launched an updated Investor Relations website accessible at adp.com. Current quarter results, as well as the reportable segment schedules, can be found in the financial section of the new website and have been updated to include the second quarter of fiscal 2014.","I'd like to remind everyone that during today's conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risks, and these are discussed in our earnings release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos for his opening remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Elena. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. There are a couple of things I'd like to cover today.

Second, I'll give you my thoughts on our results for the quarter. Then, Jan will take you through the details of the second quarter financial results and guidance for the year. After Jan's commentary, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Before I give you an update on the business, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on calendar year 2013. I have some interesting statistics that remind me of how ADP solutions make a difference for our clients.","For example, our solutions enabled more than 15 million employees and their dependents to enroll in medical benefits here in the U.S. for the 2014 benefits year.","In addition, our Tax Credit Services clients realized about $1 billion in tax credits and, of course, in recent weeks, ADP produced more than 50 million year-end tax statements for our clients' employees: W2s in the U.S., as we know them, and T4s in Canada.","Our ability to help clients succeed is based on our Human Capital Management strategy, or HCM, as it's known in the industry. Deeply rooted in our culture and before the term cloud was part of anyone's vocabulary, ADP's one-to-many solutions offered clients the benefit of an application hosted in a secure, remote data center.","By having cloud-based solutions embedded early on in our innovation culture, ADP is able to say that today more than 360,000 client companies are using ADP cloud-based solution, a number that grows with each new client and migration.","However, what differentiates ADP from pure software and technology offerings is our ability to provide fully outsourced service solutions along with comprehensive technology. Our solutions span the full HCM life cycle, from the early recruitment of prospective employees through employee retirement, ADP provides organizations of all sizes and the human resources professional with a proven service model, strong history of compliance management and insightful expertise from our decades of experience in the industry, an industry that ADP had a large part in creating and shaping.","We continue to execute against our HCM strategy, emphasizing innovative cloud-based solutions, complementing technology with compliance and service.","As we continue to expand the functionality of our integrated platforms and focus on stellar service, migrating clients to our newest platforms remains an important initiative. I'm pleased to report that migrations to ADP RUN are progressing well. We migrated about 25,000 clients during the quarter, and now have about 315,000 clients on this platform. We expect to be complete with all small business migrations in fiscal 2015.","In addition to ADP RUN migrations, we are also executing on our plan to move all our midsized clients to ADP Workforce Now. We currently have more than 45,000 clients on this platform and expect to complete these migrations in fiscal 2015 as well. These migrations are an important part of our growth strategy as they allow for up-sell opportunities.","As you may already know, just about half of the clients we migrate to Workforce Now from a standalone payroll platform sign up for one or more additional solutions such as time and attendance, HR and benefits administration or talent.","Overall, we are executing well on our migration strategy and our new platform is providing more streamlined, integrated experience for our clients, as well as a better service experience.","Another important item to touch on is the level of product integration ADP offers. ADP sits at the intersection of benefits administration, payroll and time and attendance.","Within this intersection, human resources professionals manage regulatory requirements, such as the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, and other compliance issues. Having an integrated solution is essential to helping our clients minimize compliance risks.","For instance, we recently introduced additional innovative tools and resources to help our ADP RUN platform -- to our ADP RUN platform that allow our small business clients to comply with ACA.","Among them, the new simple-to-use full-time-equivalent calculator is essential in helping employers determine their status under the ACA's shared responsibility provisions.","As the regulatory environment becomes even more complex, be it as a result of ACA or other compliance matters, our clients take comfort in knowing that we have helped businesses manage all kinds of change for more than 6 decades.","When you combine our expertise in compliance matters with our service strength and innovative HCM solutions, you get a powerful platform that is second to none.","Before we turn to the quarter's results, you may be interested to know that we held our annual meeting called ReThink in Paris this year. This is a great networking event, where ADP management and multinational clients and prospects have the opportunity to exchange ideas and discuss global HR needs. We are quite pleased with the high level of interest in our multinational service offerings.","And now for the quarter results. ADP reported strong revenue growth of 9%, 8% organic, driven by solid starts of previously sold business.","New business bookings growth for the quarter in Employer Services and PEO was 7%. Our momentum of bookings growth increased from the first quarter, but we are still behind our expectations for the first half of the fiscal year.","I'm pleased that bookings growth in the U.S. in both the small and midmarkets were quite strong, which we believe is a testament to the strength of our RUN and Workforce Now offerings.","Additionally, we saw strength in bookings growth from the PEO, in large part because ADP's value proposition in compliance surrounding the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, is resonating with small employers.","Moving upmarket. As we discussed on our last call, we are rebuilding the pipeline in the U.S., which was drained as a result of the strong fiscal '13 fourth quarter. Our bookings results in this space were better than in the first quarter but are still behind our expectations in terms of closed contracts.","In the multinational space, we closed 3 GlobalView deals during the quarter, and as you can probably tell from my earlier comments about the success of our meeting in Paris, the pipeline is solid.","However, given where we are in the first half of the year, it will be difficult to make up enough of the shortfall to obtain the high end of our 8% to 10% forecast range.","As a result, we are now expecting new business bookings growth to finish at approximately 8% for the year, which is the low end of our previous guidance range despite expectations for a strong second half.","Now switching to the PEO. We continue to see positive momentum in this business. As I mentioned a moment ago, new business bookings were strong and growth in average worksite employees paid was a strong 12% for the quarter.","Moving on to Dealer Services. The global outlook for the automotive industry continues to be positive.","While we still see softness in Continental Europe, U.S. auto sales continue to advance towards pre-recessionary levels.","Dealer Services performed well in the quarter as they continue to grow their client base through strong, competitive win rates while also benefiting from increased transactions in the U.S.","I recently attended the NADA conference in New Orleans with the Dealer Services team. Organized by the National Automobile Dealers Association, it is the largest automotive trade show in North America, with thousands of attendees representing manufacturers, dealers and suppliers. We showcased a number of our product innovations that were very well received by our clients and prospects.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for a look at the quarter's financial highlights and the full-year forecast.","Jan Siegmund","Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. ADP delivered strong revenue growth of 9% for the quarter. 8% of this growth was organic and included certain nonrecurring items that I will discuss in a moment.","Focusing on continuing operations, we achieved 6% pretax earnings growth, 7% net earnings growth on a lower effective tax rate and 8% EPS growth on fewer shares outstanding compared with the year ago.","The quarter's results were solid, with each of our business segments performing well. Employer Services grew total revenues 9%, the PEO grew 14% and Dealer Services grew 7%.","In Employer Services, I'm happy that overall our revenue growth has been widespread, with the small business market contributing particularly well.","We are quite pleased with this strong revenue growth, but I do want to point out that this growth benefited about a point from certain items where the year-over-year comparables were easier this quarter and become more difficult in the second half of the year.","For example, you have heard us talk about the revenues we received from administering certain employee tax credits for our clients here in the U.S.","As these tax credit programs expire, they are not always immediately replaced with new programs, which creates lumpiness in quarterly revenue growth. We had such -- one such program that began last year's fiscal third quarter, and now that program has expired.","We are pleased to see continued growth and strength in our same-store pays per control in Employer Services in the U.S., with an increase of 2.9%.","However, in Europe, the same-store pays per control declined by 0.7%, as anticipated.","Although the economic situation in Europe has stabilized, we have not seen a meaningful improvement.","Average client fund balances were strong during the quarter, increasing 9%, driven by growth in standalone tax filings, an increase from new business growth, especially in the small business services, as well as increased pays per control.","The PEO had a strong quarter, with 14% revenue growth, driven by 12% average worksite employee growth. Second quarter new business bookings were strong in the PEO, and, as Carlos mentioned, small and midsized businesses look to be in compliance with the ACA were the primary drivers of this growth.","Moving on to Dealer Services. Revenue growth of 7% benefited from strong transaction revenues and was driven by new businesses installed, improved client retention and digital advertising.","ADP's total pretax earnings and margin were impacted by the following: the negative impact from the decline in high-margin client fund interest revenues due to lower interest rates; and there was also a higher level of expenses outside the business segments of about $20 million to $25 million, primarily relating to higher stock compensation expense as a result of the higher share price, as well as certain severance charges recorded in the quarter.","Also, as you may have seen in this morning's earnings release, we had an increase of 12% in our systems development and programming expense, which is ahead of our revenue growth. This increase is a result of our continued focus on innovation.","On the positive note, I would like to point out that Employer Services posted strong pretax margin expansion year-over-year, primarily driven by increased operating efficiencies.","Expenses related through the second quarter new business bookings increased compared to the first quarter as anticipated from the acceleration in new bookings growth, but I'm pleased that the expenses increased at a slower rate compared with revenue growth.","And before we leave the discussion on the quarter's results, I want to point out that the decline in client interest revenues resulting from low interest rates continues to be the most significant drag on ADP's results.","As anticipated, ADP's revenue growth was muted about half of a percentage point as the lower yield more than offset the benefit from the 9% growth in balances.","Pretax margin was negatively impacted 90 basis points, and diluted earnings per share were lower by $0.02, or 3 percentage points, for the quarter.","Excluding this impact, it is evident that the leverage in ADP's business model is strong and intact.","Now I will give you our full-year forecast, which we have updated to reflect the solid results achieved during the first half of the fiscal year.","We are now anticipating revenue growth of about 7% to 8% for a total ADP. I want to make -- I want to take a moment and remind you that although ADP's revenue growth was 8% for the first half of the year, we're anticipating some tougher comps in the second half, as I mentioned a few moments ago.","We anticipate slight pretax margin improvement for a total ADP from 18.8% last year, which excludes the goodwill impairment charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013.","We expect the effective tax rate will be about flat with fiscal year 2013's effective tax rate of 33.9%.","I want to point out that although the full year effective tax rate forecast is unchanged, the year-to-date effective tax rate is 33.3%, which means that the effective tax rate during the second half of the year will be higher.","We anticipate 8% to 10% growth in diluted earnings per share compared with $2.89 in fiscal year 2013, which excluded the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013.","As is it our normal practice, no further share buybacks are contemplated in the forecast beyond anticipated dilutions related to employee equity comp plans, although it's clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders depending, obviously, on market conditions.","And now for the segments. In Employer Services, we continue to forecast revenue growth of about 7%, but we believe we will now attain pretax margin expansion of about 100 basis points.","Consistent with our prior forecast, we're still anticipating an increase in our pays per control metric in the U.S. of 2 to 3 percentage points.","For PEO Services, we are forecasting 12% to 13% revenue growth, with slight pretax margin expansion. We are forecasting about 8% growth in the annual dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new bookings -- new business bookings from the $1.35 billion sold in fiscal year 2013.","And for Dealer Services, we continue to forecast about 8% revenue growth, with about 100 basis points of pretax margin expansion.","There is no change to our previous forecast related to the client funds investment strategy, and the detail is available both in the press release and in the supplemental slides on our website.","And before we take your questions, I want to remind you that ADP has continued its shareholder-friendly actions. We repurchased 1.4 million ADP shares in the quarter for a total cost of $109 million.","And as you know, in November 2013, the board approved a 10% increase in the tax cash dividend, our 39th consecutive year of dividend increases.","Now I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of David Togut with Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Carlos, you highlighted weakness upmarket in bookings in the December quarter. Can you give us a little bit more detail and perspective around client traction that you're seeing with Vantage HCM?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Sure. I think I'm not sure that we said that we had weakness. I think that it really was an improvement from the first quarter, so I think we're heading in the right direction from a trend standpoint. But mathematically, we still, obviously, came short of where we had our plans. So I think it's fair to say we had weakness, but I just want to make sure that we clarify that it was much better than in the first quarter. And we do have a little bit of visibility now, with January results in, and January, I think, was also even more promising from a trend standpoint than the second quarter. So we're actually feeling better about our comments last quarter that this is really a pipeline issue, that we needed to rebuild the pipeline and that we felt that the second half of the year was going to be better. So again, I think in my comments I talked about an expectation for a strong second half, which, obviously, to get us into the 8% to 10% range would be necessary. And I think January gives us some confidence of that, specifically in the upmarket business that we have, which really includes not just national accounts and Vantage, but also includes multinational benefits administration. There are a number of products that comprise our upmarket business globally. And I think Jan may have some additional information on Vantage, in terms of where we stand there.","Jan Siegmund","David, we don't really disclose the actual quarterly numbers of units sold, but we saw a significant increase in Vantage sales quarter-over-quarter, and we're tracking in line with last year and feeling good about the progress we're making with Vantage. Also, as Carlos said, we are upmarket, and particularly in the national account space, we see in addition to the demand for Vantage, also a demand for Workforce Now in the lower end of national accounts. So overall, the momentum is really increasing in national accounts.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That's very encouraging. And just to follow-up on a comment you made, Jan, 12% increase in systems development and programming costs year-over-year in the quarter. What do you have in the innovation pipeline? Is this enhancements to existing products or new products?","Jan Siegmund","Well, as you know, we have a product strategy that focuses really very much on strategic platforms in ADP, migrating clients from our legacy platform and focusing all our R&D and engineering efforts onto our core platform. And so it's a mix of highly innovative solutions for the next-generation that will really benefit most of our platforms, but in particular upmarket. Vantage was released just last year, so we'll continue to invest and make it better every quarter with new releases. So it is really our making real our promise on innovation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Carlos, I wonder if you could go back to the PEO for a minute. Obviously, a good quarter in PEO, and it sounds like with the changes that are going on with the ACA that, that service offering is becoming even more relevant. Can you give us any thoughts on whether you think that -- how sustainable that may be, given how things may play out? Is it the initial confusion that then runs off, or is this something that you think continues for a multiyear period?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It's a good question because we obviously over the last 2 or 3 years has -- the law has evolved, and eventually went to -- or parts of it were implemented, we were trying to assess both the upsides and the downsides for not just our PEO, but other parts of our business. So all I can tell you is that it looks right now like it's mostly positive. And based on the January results, which are an outsized proportion of the total sales of the PEO for the year, just because of the way that PEO works with tax restarts and other issues that's probably not worth getting into, a significant portion of our annual sales take place in the actual month of January or start in the month of January because we count, in the PEO, our sales and our clients started the same or in equivalent. And again, we did look at our January results and they were, I would say, even stronger than the first half. And so it really does feel like that business has quite a lot of momentum. And when we look at the factors that are driving that momentum, they do feel like multiyear or that they are not just 1 or 2 quarters. Now, whether multiyear means 5 or 10 years, that's a different story because it's hard to see that far out. But we don't see this momentum letting up in the near future.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And if you look at -- well, I guess, just a quick follow-on to that, so is that pretty much concentrated in the small business segment? Or are you seeing it overflow into other segments, like in the midmarket, for example, as well, even though it may not be tied to the PEO?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, our think our sales force is I think using the Affordable Care Act and changes in regulation and compliance and so forth as, I think, one of the reasons why we think prospects should be talking to us. And particularly the fact that we have integrated products in Workforce Now and in Vantage, I think, really help with that conversation. The ability to have time and attendance, benefits and payroll and HR all in one integrated database is a very, very strong value proposition. So I think it is providing a door-opening opportunity for all segments of ADP. But the PEO, I think, has -- is in a unique position, where they are benefiting, I think, in an outsized manner. I think I'd hasten to say that they're also just executing very well, so we have really great sales leadership there and great salespeople. So I don't want to take anything away from them because when I look back, I just happened to glance as we were talking about the PEO at our historical results in PEO in terms of sales, and this is really the fourth year of very good sales results. So I think we're benefiting somewhat from the wind at our back from ACA, but we've got to give credit where credit is due. They've done just a fabulous job execution-wise.","Jan Siegmund","David, just a quick reminder, the size of employees that we serve in the PEO ranges really from 10 to 250 employees, so it really stands a little bit different than our historical segments. So it does cover small- as well as midsized clients in there.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly on the bookings and the characteristic of those bookings relative to your revenue growth. Obviously, you're coming in a little bit stronger on the revenue growth -- and, sorry, I got dropped from the call, so perhaps this was covered. But is there something -- because of the relative strength of the small business segment and perhaps the midmarket, does that impact the conversion of the bookings to revenue in a different way than maybe what you've seen historically because of that relative strength? Or are we pretty much on kind of a trajectory that we typically are on in terms of the conversion of bookings to revenue?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I'll let Jan give a scientific answer. But I think the short answer is, yes, it helps. A shortfall in our upmarket business in bookings, I think, doesn't affect us as much in the short term as, obviously, a shortfall in our low end of our business because of just how fast those clients start. So I think we've done some modeling. And I think maybe Jan can talk about it a little bit in terms of the potential impact of shortfall in the high-end. But I think you're correct that it tends to be a more muted impact in the short run. It tends to be spread out more over time. And again, you should also keep in mind that our business is quite diversified. So we have a midmarket business, we have a low-end business and we have an upmarket business, we have international, we have global, we have dealer. So this shortfall in sales in the upmarket does not have a significant impact on our revenue growth, either in any of the ensuing quarters or, frankly, even in the long-term, as long as we recover as we expect in the second half.","Jan Siegmund","I think I have little to add. I think I just want to moderate that we have, of course, upped our revenue guidance for the year and you saw the strength in our revenues in the quarter. Some of it came due to this help of expiring tax credit programs, but then you saw we had strong balanced growth, we had strong pays per control growth, we had solid retention in the quarter. So all those factors together really helped to drive the organic revenue growth in ES. And the strength in the downmarket, where the conversion is a little bit faster to revenue than in the upmarket, obviously, helps. But as Carlos said, the misses on the upmarket are not impacting our revenue forecast in a meaningful way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Credit Suisse.","Ryan Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Ryan Davis, filling in for George. I want to start with the new bookings growth and kind of the new guidance. Could you give us maybe the puts and takes of what you were seeing when you gave the original guidance, the 8% to 10%, and kind of what differs now? I guess, the first quarter came in a little lower, so it's a little further to overcome.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, let me start by saying that we give guidance based on our plan. So we put together a budget or what we call our operating plan, obviously, well before the fiscal year started, that contemplated sales in that range. And then we had just what I would call a blowout finish in the fourth quarter that happened after we put those operating plans together. And clearly, we could have adjusted our guidance in our plans, but we felt that given the momentum we had in that fourth quarter, that we would go forward with the original plan that we had. I did mention in the fourth quarter conference call that based on our experience or my experience personally, even though we weren't trying to change our guidance, that, that fourth quarter strong finish presents some challenges for the first quarter just because of the way our incentive system works and just based on mathematics, just because of how large ADP's sales results are in terms of laws of large numbers. And so I think the 8% to 10% guidance was, I think, what we thought we could do. And that was our objective, and we weren't ready to come off of it. And then the first quarter, as you know, was 1% growth. And the math for us on making a comeback from 1% growth is not easy, again, just because of the laws of large numbers. But again, we thought because of what we had in our pipeline and the fact that we thought that our challenge is really more execution-related in the high end of our business, that we had a shot at still making somewhere in the middle of that range, which is what our intention would be when we gave 8% to 10%. And I think now we've moderated that to 8%, and it could be a little bit higher than 8%, frankly, or it could be a little lower than 8%. But I think prudence, I think, called for mathematically looking at the -- taking a hard look at the numbers and being transparent saying it's harder. It's harder to get to 10% now and it's harder to get to 9%, but we feel very comfortable getting to 8%.","Ryan Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just one more, and sorry to follow-up, I don't want to hit on the bad things, but could you just give a little commentary around the retention in the quarter. I see it's down year-over-year?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Happy to do that, although I wouldn't call it a bad thing. And again, I recognize the numbers are the numbers. But our retention rates are still at historically high levels. Again, we have the benefit of having seen our January results, and for those of you who follow us closely, you know that January is a very important month for us in sale -- or new bookings, but it's also very important for us in terms of retention. Obviously, many clients who decide to take their business in-house or look for another alternative do so December 31, and so those losses will show up in our results at year end, as well as in January. So now we have the benefit of both our December and January period, and I would tell you that coming out of January, we feel very good about our retention, which, again, when I look at it over the last 4 years is, I believe -- I don't have the number in front of me, but it's 20 to 30 basis points up or down each year, still at record levels. And so although we, from an operating plan standpoint, try to put additional pressure on the organization to drive that up a little more, and I think we can because our client migrations in some respects might help us longer term in our retention rates, but the fact of the matter is that they are very, very good right now, and we're very happy with our retention rates. And I think having looked now at the January results, I would say that the quarterly comparison is the same story that we've been sharing for many years, which is we have fluctuations because we have a few large losses here and there, and then it affects the quarter, and then the next quarter, we have, I think, a recovery. So we see nothing in either the quarter or in the January results to lead us to believe that there's any issues with our service or with our retention rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask quickly about -- you mentioned some severance in the quarter. How much exactly was that? And where are you reducing heads, anywhere in particular, or was it pretty minor?","Jan Siegmund","Gary, I mentioned it only because it happened in the quarter to be a little bit higher than normal. We had very low restructuring charges in the first quarter, so the difference popped up a little bit higher. And it's really broad-based and just regular business operations. So it just aggregated in this quarter, drilled a little bit higher, so it made it the second highest item. Nothing to worry about. Really nothing to point out and isolate in there.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I was wondering if you're going to say due to the migrations, you need fewer people supporting the legacy systems or something, but I guess, that's still the future...","Jan Siegmund","Not quite yet. I understand the interpretation toward the operational efficiencies due to migration that Carlos and I share the excitement for you, but as you know, the migrations require a big deal of resources actually to be invested themselves in the migrations and then also require the training of our associates on the new platforms, and that takes a little bit of time for them to gain full productivity. So that's kind of the fundamental reason why the efficiencies will trickle down a little bit later.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And I think to -- just to make sure that our level's set and people understand our business model from that perspective, ADP's business is, as you know, quite stable and predictable in terms of recurring revenues. And so there's no question we expect to become more productive and more efficient over time as a result of migrations, but also as a result of other initiatives that we have around productivity. That's been shared very widely internally with our associates and our leadership. Having said that, we hire approximately 4,000 to 5,000 new associates each year because of our size, just because of retirements and turnover. And by the way, we have a very low turnover rate. But that's a lot of people. So this process of us becoming more productive and more efficient will happen in an organized fashion. And you are unlikely to see a multi-hundred-million-dollar restructuring charge, which is not what this is. This is relatively small. But again, just because of who we are, we give you all the details. In the grand scheme of things it's a relatively small number, it just happens to affect the quarter and the results, and we thought you should know that the number was in there. But historically, some of our restructuring charges have been -- and I'm not saying that this one is, but as an example, if we do anything in Europe, even a restructuring that involves 5 to 10 people can add up to $10 million to $12 million. So it's not the case in this example. I just want to put perspective around -- when you do the math, around the size of this restructuring charge. This is not hundreds or thousands of people, and it's not a major shift. And I just want to level set that you are unlikely -- we will manage our way into productivity and efficiency without large-scale disruption to our associates.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. And then just one other quick one. I haven't got an update in a while on the trend towards profitability with the GlobalView product. And just maybe a little more color on -- you talk every once in a while about the contracts you sign. But how many people have actually been -- are up and running in the product? And is that really the key to achieving that profitability and targets unchanged? Any update there.","Jan Siegmund","I appreciate that. I'll take this question, I appreciate it. As you know, our multinational offerings are a key part of our global growth strategy. And just for level setting, when this discussion a number of years started, we focused on GlobalView. But today, we're really selling a combined solution between GlobalView and a product that is called Streamline. And almost all GlobalView deals now include also components of Streamline. So we internally really focus on our multinational solutions and, of course, they are profitable and continue to gain margin and growing very nicely. As a matter of fact, they are accretive to our revenue growth and our earnings growth overall ADP. So it's a very nice business that we really like and to do so. But in order to satisfy the academic question background about is GlobalView profitability? Yes, we're pursuing the plan. We indicated I think last year that we would achieve profitability, which we did. And of course, we'll continue to in the second half, and we continue to improve upon that business. We had more sales, as Carlos has reported, on GlobalView, so the product is doing fine, and we're very satisfied with it. But again, it is important to think -- better to think about our multinational offerings, and that's now more than a $300 million business for us, and it's growing very nicely. About 1 million employees are processing on GlobalView right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Ashish, calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. Looks like you had a pretty solid quarter for small- and medium-business bookings. And as you said, coming out of the selling season, that was pretty strong as well. Now the small-business formation overall, that has been pretty weak. So obviously, you're gaining share. So I was wondering if you could just provide some details on the competitive dynamics, like, are you gaining share from regional or national players, or is it mostly in-house moving over? I was just wondering if you could give some more color on that. And as well as talk about pricing and discounting, how that has trended during the selling season.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We haven't heard anything different about pricing or discounting. I think, obviously, we keep track -- very close track of those dynamics. And I'm not aware of any changes in the market in terms of pricing or discounting. In terms of the success in that business, I think, again, like the PEO, I think the first order of business is to give credit to the management team and to the organizations that have been working multiple years on making sure they have the right products, the right leadership, the right service because you do have to execute in this business and I'm sure in any other business, and they are executing quite well. I think that our success there, I think, is broad-based. Again, we do look on an annual basis and then in our strategic planning process at shifts in the marketplace in terms of in-house versus regional versus national competitors, and then we track obviously monthly and then quarterly where sales are coming from and where losses are going to. And I wish there was something exciting to report or something that jumps out, but it's just broad-based success, I think, across the board. And so it's not any particular category or size range, it's just across the board. And I think it's related to the very strong products and very strong execution, both in sales, implementation and in service.","Jan Siegmund","Just to answer your question regarding the discounting level, I did actually, prior to this call, review and anticipated your question and looked out across our business, and we have not seen any significant changes in trend relative to discounting level. As a reminder, approximately 1% of our revenue growth is driven by price increases.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's good, good to know. And one much more broader question about the industry trend. We've seen some increase in charter around private exchanges, large employers contemplating moving to private health-care exchanges. I was just wondering if you have seen similar trends, and if you can comment on what that means, would it have any impact on PEO or any other business, any impact on ADP?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, there really would be no impact on the PEO, at least not for the next, I believe, it's 3 or 4 years, because the exchanges are really not right now open to small companies. They're really, I think, really for large companies. And so, the -- I'm sorry, I think that's correct. I don't know if it's the public or the private exchanges. But my information is that this is really -- the exchanges are really not an issue for the PEO until I believe it's 2017. And then we have to -- as we get closer to that, we would, obviously, keep you informed in terms of whether we think there is going to be an issue or not. Because as of -- when we first started this process 3 years ago, I think it just doesn't help to -- the lesson learned is that we have to get a little closer, based on what you've seen around all the changes that the government has made to the original laws and regulations, I think it's just better for us to wait until we get closer to have that discussion. So I think no impact on the PEO. The only, I think, impact that I think we need to talk about and think about is our benefits administration business, which, again, in relative terms, it's an important business, as all of our businesses are important, but it's relatively small in the overall scheme of ADP's total revenues. But that business, we are hearing prospects and clients asking us about private exchanges. And so we are looking at alternatives, including partnerships and other options, building our own private exchange. There's a lot of ways you could go in terms of creating a solution. Some of which are easier to implement, for example, a partnership. And others, whether it's an acquisition or doing something organically, are probably a little bit harder to do. But we are hearing, I think, from some of our larger clients, specifically the ones that have a lot of hourly employees who are highly sensitive to employee benefit costs, we're hearing a lot of questions about private exchanges. Having said that, a lot of clients are not even bringing it up because they are very comfortable with the benefit plans that they have and the approach that they're taking with their current health-care carriers and their current health-care plans. I think we all read the papers, I think you tend to see restaurant chains and there are certain industries that are very sensitive to employee benefit costs that are very interested in private exchanges. And we, I think, are currently looking at how to fulfill that need for our benefits administration business.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jim MacDonald with First Analysis.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Going back to the PEO, could you tease out for me the strengths there between converting some of your existing customers and selling new customers? And as a follow-up in advance, are either of those particularly impacted by ACA uncertainties or trying to escape the impact of the ACA?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","That's a great question, because I think it's a really good example of, I think, the improvements we've had over the last several years, starting 5, 6, 7 years ago when we started focusing on this kind of OneADP strategy. One of the important, I think, benefits that we thought we could get is more synergies from cross-selling, among other synergies in our business. And the last -- certainly, this last quarter showed, and I think the last several quarters, and even for 2 or 3 years, an improving trend in terms of the amount of business that the ADP is -- I'm sorry, that the PEO is getting from some of the sister divisions within ADP. Specifically, I want to point out that the -- our mid-market business and major accounts, which, as you know, goes all the way from 50 up to 999, so in the low end of that major accounts business, there's been a really nice improvement in the amount of leads being given over to the PEO that have been converted into PEO clients. Very, very happy to see that, and I think that goes back to a lot of hard work over multiple years of aligning incentives and people working together to make that happen. Other than that, I'm not sure that we have a lot to report because I think in our low-end of the business, we've always had a very good exchange of leads between our SBS business and the PEO. I think where there's been the noticeable improvement is in the mid market and in major accounts, and we're very pleased with it.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And just my second part of the question, were new customers kind of frozen by some of the ACA implementation issues or existing customers impacted, thinking about those -- some of those implementation issues?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So I think it's a great question. I think what -- the way I would say it is that, we've always believed, whether it was in Y2K or ACA or other major compliance issues, that you get more at bats. There's just a lot more activity, because people are looking for help and they're looking for solutions. And we have a more-than-5,000-person direct sales force, and it is a huge advantage in terms of being able to take advantage of these disruptions, if you will, to the average small business, midsized business or large business. And so we spent the last 2 or 3 years gearing up our sales force to be able to talk about ACA, and the day has arrived where there are a lot of people who have a lot of questions. And we're there to answer those questions and at the same time, hopefully, sell them solutions to help them address those questions. So I think that's what's happening in some parts of our business, that we're just getting a lot more -- there's a lot more activity and a lot more at bats, and we're converting some of that, obviously, into new bookings and eventually into revenue. So I think it just provides a nice opportunity for us and for our direct sales force to go out and help our clients solve -- or address the uncertainties that they're facing.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Paul Thomas with Goldman Sachs.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It sounds like pays per control is still lagging in Europe. Is there any expectation that it will improve in the back half of fiscal '14?","Jan Siegmund","Paul, I've studied the pays per control metrics in detail for each of the European countries, and I wish I could report that I see an improvement. It is at the rounding error, a slight improvement, and you see a couple of countries slightly improving. Of course, Germany and France would be those. But overall, Europe is kind of flattish on the pays per control. I just -- as a point of clarification, that does not translate in declining revenue growth. Europe is still growing for us as a revenue contributor and, of course, nicely expanding also its margin. So while we see the economic environment impacting sales are difficult in some countries, but, overall, we continue to grow our revenues based on new business that we could do good retention rates and a little bit mitigated by these pays per control weakness.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just one more from my end. Could you talk about the increase in margin expectations from Employer Services, how much of the improvement was lower sales compensation versus specific actions you took in the quarter?","Jan Siegmund","It's not specific actions I would describe. I think you see some of the organic revenue growth acceleration is helping us on the margins. We have good control on our operating expenses. So we have FTE for employee growth is slower than revenue growth. So we're kind of carefully executing on the program of driving productivity in the business unit in an organic way that Carlos just described. And so there could be a little bit of improvement on the margin due to the sales expense, but it's a mix, as sales get more productive as we have achieved higher sales productivity and a little bit of slightly lower sales growth. But that's probably not even fully factored into our forecast. So it's kind of really mostly these operational efficiencies that we mentioned to you.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think just to be specific on the -- because we mentioned in the first quarter that we benefited from lower sales costs and that helps us a little bit in the margin. It is not the case in the second quarter because even though we do have good sales productivity still, as you know, our sales results were 7% increase in the second quarter versus the first quarter growth rate of 1%. And some portion of our sales cost is variable, obviously, related to commission expense. And so on a sequential basis, the second quarter compared to the first quarter, we did not have the kind of, I guess, wind at our back. In fact, sequentially, our sales cost not only increased in absolute terms, but increased in relative terms as a percent of revenue. So I just want to make sure that, that was clear. We are -- continue to invest in sales, we continue to add headcount and, obviously, we're also expecting, I think, some level of productivity. So I think the numbers that we shared with you in terms of the mix of headcount versus productivity, I think, still stands for the year and for our forecast. And this benefit that we had in the first quarter, which was an unfortunate benefit because of the low growth rate, we did not experience in the second quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Smitti with Morgan Stanley.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Danyal Hussain, calling in for Smitti. I just wanted to touch back on PEO. So as you guys raised growth expectations, is that a function of growing popularity of the PEO model as a whole, or is this something that's more TotalSource specific?","Jan Siegmund","If you look at the market and you have now a number of competitors public or going public, you see that ADP has the strongest organic growth number. And for a number of years, really, our business model, at least since its inception 13 years ago, 15 years ago, we have really grown exclusively through organic growth. So the ADP sales model and our success in distribution and executing well is the main source of our success. And I think, organic growth rates in our competitors are more muted, and that's certainly a standout for ADP's model.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think I would just add, again, since I came from that business, that the popularity of the PEO ebbs and flows for a variety of reasons, but ADP's PEO continues steadily along. I think it's 4x the size it was when ADP first started in the business through a couple of acquisitions and it's almost doubled just in the last 4 years. So it's really quite an impressive performance by that team. But it is fair to say that, that industry or that category does ebb and flow for a variety of reasons, depending on external factors around insurance markets. And -- but the business, it's in an industry we have to be cautious in terms of your expectations. We happen to be the beneficiaries of having a captive sales force that provides lead to our PEO sales organization, we have good leadership, we have good technology, so we, I think, are in a very good position.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then on international, I recognize Europe is still floating [ph], can you maybe talk about revenue growth in international as a whole, and maybe how it's different in your multinational clients versus the local international?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think our international business still has quite respectable growth, frankly because we have really great retention rates there. And so even though, as Jan said, sales are difficult or have been difficult in the first half, and I'd hasten to add that last year, we had actually pretty good sales, even in a very bad environment, we had good sales. But when you add all those ingredients together, the very strong retention rate with really a minor decrease in pays per control because it just not -- doesn't drive that much in terms of revenue drag, and then just the size of the sales not, if you will, as a total sales in relation to how much we lose because of retention being so strong, I think, leaves us with a very decent organic growth rate in international. And then we, on top of that, benefited a little bit from the acquisition that we made in South America to expand our presence in Latin America. That's giving us a little bit of a lift in our international business. But our organic growth rate there is still quite strong.","Jan Siegmund","Actually, in an interesting way, the organic growth rates between U.S. and international are about the same, and the weakness or softer revenue growth in Europe is offset by strength in Latin America and strength in our multinational business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Carlos, you talked a lot about Workforce Now and RUN, and it seems as though you're getting some benefit as clients are migrating, or at least that's what it looks like as your margins are improving in ES. But is there a way for you to size what the eventual benefit will be once you get all your clients migrated? Because I know you've also said there's some additional costs right now because you do have 2 platforms.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that it's a good question. And I think it's a risk of having you get out in front of us from a margin standpoint in the future. I think it's important -- more important for you to understand in the short run kind of what is happening. In the short run, I think Jan said it best that our margin improvement in Employer Services is not related to client migration. Our client migrations activities are putting pressure on our margins. We are investing very, very heavily both in our -- in all 3 of our segments, in the low end, on midmarket and our high-end, because it's a strategic imperative for us to get our clients on a new platforms. I was looking at some statistics over the quarter where the number of clients that are left on our nonstrategic platform on midmarket have declined fairly significantly and, simultaneously, our retention rate has improved quite a bit. So it just feels like the right thing to do to continue to spend at whatever level we need to spend in order to accelerate those client migrations. And by the way, that will not always be the case. We had one example in our time and attendance business where we shut down a platform, and so it was not an organized, orderly transition. And that had a negative impact on retention. So those -- it's really a mixed story. That's a long way of saying that you should not interpret our margin improvement as coming from already benefits of our client migration. The benefits of our client migrations are yet to occur.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just as a follow-up, and maybe there isn't a relationship, but we're seeing more clients migrate to these new platforms, more clients interested in mobile applications. As a result, on the small business side, have you seen any change at all in how your customers are buying your services, as in are more customers today than 2 years ago are using the Internet? So in relation, do you need to change maybe the way you sell your products?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It's absolutely changed. And again, visually, I'll give you one, and I'll give you a factual. Visual is our sales force are out doing demos with iPads now. Two years ago, they weren't doing that. Our old EasyPay platform, I don't believe we had a demo, forget about doing it on an iPad, it's just not -- it wasn't even a possibility. So the factual numbers are that 4, 5 years ago, the majority of our clients were on what we call either call-in or fax, so they would basically send us their information. They would call us in and tell us, \"This is how many hours for this person and this is how many hours for that.\" This is in small business is what I'm describing. That now with RUN, new sales in RUN has completely flipped over where more than 70% of our new sales are basically web-based sales, where they're using our -- where they're not calling in their payroll, they're not having any interaction other than service interactions if they have questions or if they have issues with their payroll. Obviously, that's what we are about, is a full-service outsourcing solutions. So we do take questions and phone calls or chats or emails. But the fact of the matter is there's been a tremendous change in the last 3 years in how we sell our business and how our clients receive the service that we provide or receive the technology, specifically in RUN, which I think was your question.","Jan Siegmund","If I may add on the distribution side, in a down market, we sell through our sales force. But we have also channel relationships in the bank and the accounting channel, and the good deal of our businesses are now also generated through certain marketing and web-based leads. The actual sale, I think, is still going mostly through either our inside sales force or field salespeople, but the lead generation through these channels all have changed and have contributed to the growth.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","So should that translate to lower selling costs as we move forward?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, it has. So I think our SBS sales force is one of the, I think, one of the highlights in terms of our sales productivity improvement over the last several years. And so I believe we have gotten, I think, some benefit from what you are describing.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Ryan Cary - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Ryan Cary, calling in for Jason. Just a quick one. Are you expecting acquisitions to contribute any material amount in near-term revenue growth? I know you mentioned in the past couple of quarters LatAm acquisition, but I just wasn't sure how big that's going to be, and maybe you'd give us some sort of idea on when we should see some benefit.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We continue to be out there looking at stuff, and we've recently looked at some things and, I mean, I think our normal practice, as you know, is we can't comment. So we can't really say specifically what we're looking at and what we are not looking at. But we are, contrary to popular belief, because I probably have developed a reputation, we are open, we have capital, and we are open to acquisitions if they fit our long-term strategy. And our long-term strategy has been laid out very clearly. And so we're not looking to just cobble things together and add additional platforms that are not going to be integrated into our strategic platform. But if we find things that either fit or can be fitted in relatively quickly that accelerate our sales growth and, hence, our revenue growth, we will use our capital to get that done.","Ryan Cary - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And forgive me if you already mentioned this, I might have just missed it. Did you announce the -- your expectation for the increase in the sales force headcount for the year? Is that still at about 4%?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes. And I think we are right now running 3%.","Jan Siegmund","3%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","HR analytics is a hot area right now, and I wanted to get your take on how you're positioned in it and what you think perhaps you're differentiating points are in the areas that you might want to focus on to add more?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","That's a good question because actually when Jan was answering the question about the 12% increase in our R&D expense, one of the things that I can mention about that is that analytics specifically is one of the categories where we are -- and I think Jan mentioned some exciting things that we're working on to enhance our current platform but also to provide kind of new solutions to our clients to help them more with their business needs. I think analytics is an area where we've been investing quite a lot of time and money, specifically our -- what we've been calling our innovation labs, the ADP Innovation Labs, which, by the way, we've now opened an office in Chelsea, New York, and we're really attracting some incredible talents. And so part of what those folks are doing is working on those types of solutions and specifically, some of the business intelligence and analytics solutions that we think are kind of the next step in helping businesses really manage their human capital assets better. So we are -- we've seen some previews. Jan and I, I think, have seen some examples of the things we're working on, and we're quite excited about what, hopefully, is to come here in the near future.","Jan Siegmund","Actually, we released in the second quarter and we talked in our last call, I think, about our HR analytics tool that's now in pilot with a number of clients. We have shown it at several industry fairs, received tremendous amount of feedback. And the fundamental differentiator is, of course, not only the functionality and the thought process that we engineered into the product, but it can rely and base its insight on an unparalleled amount of data, with 600,000 clients at our fingertips and information that is really deep and with a broad history of it, will allow clients really just better understand how to run the HR business and put ADP in a position to be truly a strategic partner for our clients. So it is really an opportunity that we are looking forward to fully leverage. And if you follow out national success of our national employment success -- National Employment Report, we anticipate similar type of credibility and power in our HR analytics product.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then as a follow-up, the focus on Vantage or the strategy so far has been more to sell to new clients as opposed to migrations. And I'm wondering if there is some point in the future when perhaps you'd consider turning more to trying to convert the existing client base.","Jan Siegmund","We migrated also clients in Vantage. But as -- you're right, as we scale and build our implementation organization and optimize the implementation processes of Vantage, we are focused on leveraging that capacity for market shares, competitive market, we like our product, and that's the focus, I think, what you see us more is open Vantage up to a variety of bundles, from standalone payroll Vantage to a full suite of Vantage as we build it out. But medium run, you should expect us to convert clients onto the Vantage platform. So it is just a matter of timing, and Vantage will be following a similar path over time as Workforce Now did.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes, and I think just to emphasize, I think Jan mentioned this, I think, especially earlier in the call in answer to a question, that we continue to invest in Vantage. So I just want to kind of reiterate that, that the days are over of us kind of building a platform and then spending the next 5 or 10 years, and it's not because that was the wrong thing to do, it's because times have changed. And so we -- you should hear that we are making -- continuing significant investments in our upmarket products, including Vantage, not just around analytics, but around usability, around the product itself, feature, functionality. And so we are making significant investments in Vantage and in the upmarket products as we speak.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin with JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-up questions to past questions. Just first on the upper end of the market and replenishing the pipeline, just curious how the visibility and predictability of the new sales look now versus, whatever, a quarter ago or a year ago. I caught some of the 3 deals you talked about. But just in general, the replenishing of the pipeline is what I was curious about.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think the place where we feel the most positive about the pipeline is the MNC business. But it also happens to be the most lumpy of our businesses. So I personally went on a sales call for a multinational client that was a $15 million annual deal, and so we feel pretty good that we're going to that deal, but whether we get it in February or we get in March, I think, is in the grand scheme of things, not the only important thing. And, hence, we have to be careful. So I think historically, our multinational business, I told you specifically, have been our most volatile and most lumpy business. But right now, it feels pretty good. This meeting in Paris, like we had the Who's Who of the Global 100. I mean, I'm not going to mention names, obviously, but these are all names that are household names, and these were prospects. Some clients, but many, many prospects, as well, and I think we even closed one right there at the meeting. So we're feeling pretty good about that pipeline. I think in our upmarket core national accounts business, by that I mean payroll, HR, kind of the core business, I think that pipeline also feels pretty good, and our January results, frankly, were good from a growth standpoint. And there's a couple of other categories in national accounts, frankly, that are not performing as well. And I mentioned some of the other categories that make up our upmarket. But in that core business, we're actually feeling pretty good, too, about what's happening with the pipeline and also the conversion of that pipeline into contracts.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood. So the upper, upper end, is really just the timing issue, you feel good about the pipeline?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Just on the -- just I know retention was asked about and I know we're nitpicking here about whether it's less than 50 bps. But any areas stand out in terms of surprising attrition, focused on major and national specifically?","Jan Siegmund","If you look at our losses, the second quarter losses on an absolute dollar value also are not that meaningful to us, so it's a lower-loss quarter. And we did see it's not focused on one business unit. We had, really, a number of business units coming a little bit down also. It may play, if you look a quarter, a year over back, we had a very strong retention quarter. So I wouldn't over read, again, the 30 bps or so into anything here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","With regards to the sales target for the year of 8% growth, given what the performance was in the first half, you do have some tough comps coming up in the second half, particularly fourth quarter of '13, how comfortable are you with that, with the 8% target? I mean, I know it's your best estimate, but...","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think it's a very fair question, I'll just use history as my -- to help me. Last year, I think we entered into the fourth quarter -- and I'm not sure this necessarily helps me or hurts me, because as you've said, in some ways a strong fourth quarter creates a tougher comparison. But last year, we entered the fourth quarter with 9% growth and we ended up with 11%. And so we do have the ability to execute in our sales force, and that's what we're going to do. And so I think we obviously are very -- we are constantly scrubbing our forecast, looking at our pipeline and, again, there are a few large deals that can go one way or the other, but we have 5 months to get those done and get the contracts signed. So again, our best information is that we feel pretty good about the 8%, and being the optimist, I always hope it could be 9%. And could it be also a little bit short of 8%? Yes, but I'm focused more on the 9% than I am on the 8%. So I think we're pretty comfortable, when we see the January results and we see the size of the January results and how much quota has been extended through the end of January, I think that our level of confidence is good.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And it also sounds like the pipeline on the upper end has been rebuilt since the changes that you put in place. Is that a correct read?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that it's a correct read, but you're maybe reading too much into it. Changes that are made in a large account mature sales force do not necessarily translate into results in 1 or 2 quarters. I think what you're seeing is just regular -- the cycle working its way through, which is the pipeline was drained in the fourth quarter and it's being rebuilt. So I don't think it's fair to attribute it to any specific actions we took, although we did take actions, and we think those actions will, over the course of multiple years, make them stronger and better national account. I don't think that we can take credit for the short-term results.","Jan Siegmund","Can I add one more comment to it while we're focusing a lot on the upmarket? It should not be underestimated that we have reported strength in our mid- and small-market segments and PEO separately. And as you might imagine, that's going to also add comfort to our full-year forecast. And that consistency has been strong for both quarters throughout this fiscal year. So I think it would be also important to look at the entirety of our new business bookings volume and not focus on just a segment in the marketplace.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And I think it's important, again, even though we don't disclose business by business, back to the diversification of our business, none of the categories that we are talking about or mentioned are disproportionately large. They are all large, and they all make up the $1.4 billion, is it, that we are forecasting for our sales for the year. And so, again, fortunately, we have the benefit of being in many categories and being global. And I think Jan is right that we clearly would like to have better results in the upper end in the first half of the year. But as you saw, we delivered 7% either in the face of what I would call historically unprecedented headwinds from an execution standpoint.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Fully appreciate the strength in both majors and SBS, and I was taking for granted that, that was going to continue to be strong. With regards to the nice performance, with regards to the margins on the ES side, you mentioned that you're actually spending as you're making the conversions going through. What would you attribute -- what would be the biggest single contribution to the really strong margin performance that we're seeing on an incremental basis, particularly when we strip out the interest impact?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think at the business segment level, again, we have this quirky issue with the way interest is calculated at the ADP level. It drags our revenue growth. You don't see the operating leverage as clearly, but when you look in the segments, I think Jan said it well, which is really operating leverage. So it's really growing our expenses slower than our revenues. And again, just because of the nature of our business model, this is not -- we don't have a business model where we go and cut $100 million in expense and then 2, 3 years later, we have to put back $300 million. The trick for us is to grow our expenses at half the rate of our revenue growth or slower. That means that our expenses are still growing, but they're growing at a slower rate. So that still allows us to invest in things. It allows us to more focus on migration, but it does create scarcity of resources because we have to decide where to put those resources. But we're not cutting cost. We're reducing the growth rate of cost and achieving operating scale and operating efficiency, which is a very organized and very methodical and very good way to run a business.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then last question. Since last time I saw you, rates have changed. How should we think about when we hit the inflection point as it relates to the float income, assuming that rates stabilize around these levels?","Jan Siegmund","We've just reconfirmed our guidance about the impact of our -- the net impact of the client funds strategy and the guidance stays impact -- in tact. So the forward rates move a little bit up and down, and I think we are speaking with Carlos' first quarter comment that in FY '15, we should see an even or slightly up on interest rate. We're going to give more visibility to all of that for you traditionally at third quarter. We're planning to do so also this year.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","But again, I think, I don't know if we mentioned the balances growth. So we had -- and, again, trying to focus on both the positive and the negative, so our balance growth was quite good. And I think some of it is a reflection of a decent economic backdrop. Some of that is also related to growth in units, starting new business, et cetera. But the overall balance growth is quite good and helps offset some of the negatives in terms of some of the interest rate drag. I think as Jan was alluding to, as we get to '15, '16 and beyond, when interest rates become -- if they become a positive, this balance growth combined with a better interest rate environment is something that we look forward to.","Operator","And we have 2 more questions in queue. Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","We talked a couple -- well, at an Analyst Day that you had obviously in the distant future -- or, I'm sorry, in the distant past, and you mentioned that as you continue to move to more of a technology platform, that the structure of the company may start to look a little bit different. I was wondering, is there any association here between some of the restructuring and what the new look ADP would look like now that it's more technology-focused? And maybe you can just give us an update on where we stand with that.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So based on your comment about the distant past, it sounds like you missed us and you want to have another Analyst Day.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Yes, sure, why not.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think on your comment -- I'll let Jan make a comment also, but I think we are -- the restructuring discussion, again, just to reemphasize, is not related to any broad strategic issue. It was housekeeping, if you will, in terms of the size of it. Having said that, over the last couple of years, and I think we continue -- it'll continue into the next few years. We are trying to invest more in R&D, and you see it creeping up, and creeping is the typical ADP way of doing things. It's not a dramatic change, but rather than R&D becoming a lower and lower percent of revenue, it's actually now reversed and has become -- it's actually grown as a percent of revenue, only slightly, but it has grown as a percent of revenue. And even if it grows at the same rate of revenue, that would be, in my estimation, an investment, because in other places, we're gaining operating efficiency. So there's no question that we are investing more in our R&D, and that changes the face of ADP, if you will. The opening of this office in Chelsea, New York is a fairly significant change for us in terms of our way of doing things, in terms of the types of people we're trying to attract and the place that we're doing business. And there's a few other examples of that as well. So there is change under way, but I think you would be -- it would not be right to read into these -- some of these numbers or try to find it in the numbers because we have, on an annualized basis, $12 billion of revenue and approximately $10 billion in expense. And the way we look at things is we've got a lot in that $10 billion that we can move around to really focus on our strategic priorities and imperatives without creating any big problems for you guys, for us or for our shareholders. And that's what we're doing.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then with the move to technology, I guess maybe my focus here, where I wanted to ask my question, was on the smaller business side. With the focus on technology there, are you seeing any change in any of the price points for any of your products? If you could talk about the small business or the medium to large. I'm just wondering if there's any kind of structural change in pricing.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think Jan was right that -- or correct in pointing out that we have different channels that we use that actually allow us to compete in different places from a price standpoint. For example, the banking channel would be slightly different from our traditional channel, and we have a few places but there's really nothing to report over the last 2 or 3 years. There's been no major shift in any of those channels or any of those price points. We do keep our eye on it because for the last 15 years, we've been told that the technology is going to replace -- technology by itself is going to replace ADP, frankly, in every one of our segment. And all we see is the opposite, because with the Affordable Care Act or more complexity in compliance or the trend towards outsourcing, whatever the factors are, they drive people towards our solutions, which are to have technology paired with compliance and service. And now with analytics and other tools, we're elevating our purpose to really helping our clients make their businesses successful. And I think when you package all of that together, I think we're pretty confident that we have a highly differentiated business model that continues to win and continues to win at the prices that we've been able to charge historically. So we have nothing to report other than, I think, the fact that things are all on track or in the same place from a pricing standpoint in all of our segments.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly for me, how do you feel -- have you seen any change in the competitive environment at the small business level? And maybe you could just talk about how you feel like you'd progressed on the technology front.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","In the small business level, again, you know some of our national competitors -- you might not know that we have hundreds of regional and local competitors everywhere. And so, again, my hats off to the field sales organization, to the field service organization, the people who run these businesses on the low-end because it is hand-to-hand combat and it's a fight every day. So they are just out-executing the competition in a lot of ways and a lot of respect. Some of it is product, some of it is technology and some of it is just good people and good execution and good focus. And so again, I wish I had a more exciting story, but I think it's just great people executing very well.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just one quick question. Just sort of looking at your new sort of sales growth expectation, the 8%, and I think you alluded to last year was 11%, and then sort of just coupling that with call retention, say, flat to maybe modestly down year-to-date, is it a reasonable inference to expect your revenue growth in '15 to decelerate relative to the '14 growth rate? Because I've always thought about sales growth and retention being the key factors driving your revenue growth.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","They are the key factors to driving revenue growth, and I would just tell you that, again, the retention rate is one quarter, and it's not our expectation for retention for the full year, and our retention results in January would give me a good degree of confidence that we can achieve our annual objective for retention. Caveat that by saying that things could change. We have an economic calamity, some sort of issue. But based on our year-to-date January results, we don't expect retention to be a drag on revenue growth in '15. The difference between 8% sales growth and 9% sales growth also is not a material impact on our revenue growth in '15. So I think it's hard to -- the math is the math. It has an impact. And you can the math yourself in terms of what 1% translates into of sales growth. And I believe it's somewhere around $13 million, $10 million or $13 million of revenue growth. But I would not call that a significant impact to ADP's revenue growth, and -- because we can all do the math ourselves. I don't know that, that has a material impact on our growth rate in '15.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you very much for joining us today. As you probably could tell from our tone, we're once again very pleased with our results for the quarter and appreciate the contributions from all our associates and our leaders globally. We continue to be, I think, committed to our shareholder-friendly actions around returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. And I think you are seeing that in our actions, and we, obviously, as you can tell, also remain very focused on delivering against the HCM strategy that we have laid out.","So I thank you again for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you for your participation.

My name is Crystal, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Christian Greyenbuhl","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining ADP\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call and webcast. With me today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer.","Earlier this morning, we released our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The earnings materials are available on the SEC\u2019s website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment.","During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description and the timing of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measure can be found in our earnings release.","Today\u2019s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","Before turning the call over to Carlos, you would have noticed in today\u2019s earnings that we made a correction this quarter to certain PEOs zero margin pass-through revenues that we have previously reported on a gross basis and which going forward will be reported on a net basis.","For consistency, we also revise prior periods and the total impact to fiscal 2019 revenues and operating expenses was $65 million. This does not materially impact our previously reported growth rates and does not impact consolidated earnings before income taxes, net earnings, consolidated financial condition or cash flows. To better assist you, we have also included the details of these adjustments in the appendix to the presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call. Our supplemental schedule of quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segments also reflects the impacts of these changes.","Accordingly, our reported results and full year outlook and the following commentary from both Carlos and Kathleen also fully reflect the impact of these adjustments. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos Rodriguez","Thank you, Christian. And thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning we reported our first quarter fiscal 2020 results with revenue of $3.5 billion for the quarter, up 6% reported and organic constant currency. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which despite some higher than expected unfavorability in FX was in line with our expectations.","Our efforts to enhance our operating efficiency along with your focus retention on transformation help us deliver 60 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion for this quarter. This margin expansion was in line with our expectations and we are happy to see the progress that our associates continue to make in helping to improve our productivity, while also improving client satisfaction, particularly given the difficult margin compare given our strong performance in the first half of fiscal 2019.","Together with share buybacks and a slightly lower than expected adjusted effective tax rate these results help us deliver 12% adjusted EPS growth this quarter, which was slightly ahead of our expectations.","Moving on to Employer Services new business bookings, this quarter we saw solid growth across our US markets, which helped drive 6% growth in the quarter. With regard to our international and multinational sales opportunities, we did see some impact from timing as certain deals that were expected to close this quarter are now expected to close slightly later in the fiscal year. Nevertheless, we are maintaining our full year Employer Services new business bookings guidance of 6% to 8%.","Now turning to Client Service. We continue to drive improvements in our client satisfaction scores across our businesses. And this quarter, we were especially pleased with our progress in the upmarket with improvements in both our implementation and overall client satisfaction scores.","We continue to take positive steps to transform our service organization and enhance the client experience, and with this continued progress in mind, we remain confident in our forecasted full year fiscal 2020 retention increase of 10 basis points to 20 basis points.","We are pleased with our start to fiscal 2020 and with the continued momentum in advancing our strategy to simplify how we do business, deliver innovative solutions for our clients and associates and drive sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders.","We understand that a key element of building our success in the market is in the capacity to be agile and to anticipate and adopt to change. Innovation is at the core of this need and it\u2019s a job that's never done. While we are incredibly excited about the solutions, we are delivering in the market today to help clients meet the needs of an evolving workforce, we're even more excited about the future. As the workforce continues to evolve, organizations are looking for ways to manage their entire workforce through a single user experience.","Today companies of all sizes are using a variety of applications to get work done. What they need is an open HCM platform that allows easy integration with third-party solutions and is also flexible enough to handle the increasingly dynamic nature of work, one where workers are organized around how work happens in teams, often with individuals working on multiple teams at the same time. Aided by insights from the ADP Research Institute, our Next Gen HCM platform is designed at the core to address these needs.","A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to attend the HR Technology conference in Las Vegas where our Next Gen HCM platform and used innovations took center stage. As I met with clients and HR professionals, I was incredibly proud of the reception and recognition that we received for delivering innovative solutions that address how and where work is done today.","I was especially proud when our Next Gen HCM platform won both the HR Executive Top HR Product of the year award and the Awesome New Technology award, a remarkable achievement and a testament to ADP's commitment to innovation.","Back in September, we also had the opportunity to showcase some of the differentiating features of ADP's Next Gen platform to HCM industry analysts when we hosted our 2019 Industry Analyst Day. At this event, we spent time sharing some of the more meaningful and differentiating elements of our technology, such as, the use of graph database technology that powers the unique ability to dynamically configure teams while enabling actionable data and insights around relationships or our meta data driven design approach that allows solutions to be tailored by the client via local rapid development through a drag-and-drop interface.","In addition, our solution was designed from the beginning to be public cloud native. This among other advantages helps improve resiliency and uptime.","Finally, our solution is designed to be global. Companies that are expanding globally, or that would like to more effectively manage their existing global workforce are an ideal target for ADP Next Gen HCM.","We were equally proud and excited to see, the recognition our efforts from industry experts, at this event. And while it is great to receive these awards and to recognized by industry experts.","It is even more rewarding when we see our efforts translate into recognition and acknowledgment from our clients and prospects. As we work to scale our solution and its capabilities, our Next Gen platform is also building momentum in the market and continues to progress in line with our expectations.","As an example, earlier this quarter, at our Industry Analyst Day, we shared details of a successful go live with a 6,000 employee U.S. company that chose ADP's Next Gen HCM platform for its talent capabilities. And the ease of the ease of integration with the client's own internally developed on-boarding tool.","At the same events, we were also pleased to share that we have recently signed a 65,000-employee global enterprise that was looking for an HCM platform, capable of handling its growing workforce.","With that said, our focus on innovation is not limited to our Next Gen HCM platform. We have also increasing the leverage, machine learning to enhance our core strategic advantages in payroll and big data. As an example, we simplified 21 million raw job titles from our unmatched data like, and normalized them down to 2,400 job categories, ultimately enhancing both this functionality and accuracy of our ADP data cloud benchmarking.","Customers are using our compensation and HR benchmark data to make substantial changes to their business. For example, one of our clients was able to leverage our turn over benchmark data, to identify opportunities for improvement, and ultimately to reduce their turnover by 20%.","While another saw its front line managers use our Executive and Manager Insight\u2019s mobile solution, to help reduce overtime cost by 6%. These equate to real multimillion dollar operational savings that are being enabled by ADP's data and products.","Also to enhance the efficiency of our implementation organization, we are designing our NEXT GEN payroll engine to automatically recognize, convert and classify different formats, an input, from prior payrolls and so payroll policies.","We believe that this will give us an advantage when we on board new clients, because it will enable the automation of various elements of the implementation process. And allow us to share best practices with our clients.","And finally, we also continue to drive innovation for our frontline associates, in an effort to transform how we work, by reducing low value, client contacts, while still delivering value-added service.","With this in mind, last year, our support organization and the downmarket rolled out expanded checkbox functionality, which today is capable of handling over 100 different inquiry types for our more than 640,000 small business clients.","ADP's unique ability to meet the needs of clients and their workers today while anticipating their needs in the future, have been hallmarks of our success over the past 70 years. And I believe will driver sustained growth in the years to come.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kathleen, for commentary on our results and fiscal 2020 outlook.","Kathleen Winters","Thank you, Carlos. And good morning, everyone. As Carlos mentioned, we're pleased in transforming our business, in order to simplify, innovate and grow. Our strategy is working, and we are off to a solid start to the year.","This morning, we reported first quarter revenue growth in line with our expectation, at 6% on a reported and organic constant currency basis, which includes a slightly greater amount of FX unfavorability than we previously anticipated.","Our adjusted EBIT increased 8%, also in line with expectations. And adjusted EBIT margin was up 60 basis points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We're pleased with this margin improvement, which benefited from cost savings related to our workforce optimization and procurement transformation initiative as well as continued efficiencies within our IT infrastructure.","These benefits were partially offset by incremental brand spend as well as selling, amortization and PEO pass-through expenses. This margin performance is particularly gratifying given the difficult margin compare that we faced in the first half of the year.","As a reminder, this resulted from the very strong performance in the first half of fiscal 2019, resulting from the outside benefits related to our voluntary early-retirement program due to slower than anticipated plan to backfill at that time.","Our adjusted effective tax rate decreased by 100 basis points to 21.2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease was mainly due to an increase in tax incentives related to lower R&D efforts and decreasing reserves from certain tax positions.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share were 12% to $1.34. And in addition to benefiting to our benefiting to our revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate was also aided by fewer shares outstanding compared to a year ago.","Let\u2019s move now to our Employer Services segment and interest in funds held for client. Employer Services revenues were in line with expectations and grew 4% reported and 5% organic constant currency.","Interest income on client funds grew 13% and benefited from a 10 basis point improvement in the average yield earned on our client fund investments to 2.3% and growth in average client fund balances of 7% to $23.7 billion.","This growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control partially offset by lower SUI collections. Our Employer Services same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.4% for the first quarter.","Employer Services margins saw an increase of 50 basis points from the quarter. The increase in margins this quarter which enabled by the same factors I mentioned earlier when discussing our consolidated results.","Our PEO segment revenues grew 8% for the quarter to $1.1 billion with average worksite employees growing 7% to 563,000. Revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass through grew 7% to $358 million and continued to include pressure from lower workers' compensation and SUI costs and related pricing.","Margins decreased about 70 basis points for the quarter largely due to changes in ADP Indemnity loss reserve estimates, which drove about 60 basis points of pressure resulting from a smaller benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.","As a reminder, with ADP Indemnity results not reported in the PEO, it is normal to expect some volatility in our quarterly PEO margins as a result of changes in our workers' compensation loss reserves.","Let's turn to the outlook for the full year and start with a consolidated view. We continued to anticipate total revenue growth of 6% to 7% in fiscal 2020. This revenue outlook assumes a more elevated level of FX on favorability for the remainder of fiscal 2020 relative to our previous expectations.","With the recent volatility and overlying fixed interest rates, we now assume interest income on client funds of $570 million to $580 million and interest income from our extended investment strategy is now expected to be $575 million to $585 million.","With the continued negative interest rate environment in the Eurozone, we made the decision this quarter to wind down our two Eurozone related client money moving activities in France and the Netherlands.","As a result, we have liquidated our Dutch client funds portfolio and we will be liquidating our French client portfolio by the end of fiscal year 2020. We therefore now anticipate our growth and average client funds balances to be about 4%, as compared to our previous forecast of 4% to 5%. This decision is excusive to France and the Netherlands.","We continue to anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to expand basis points 100 basis points to 125 basis points. And we now anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.3%. The rate includes this quarter's unplanned tax benefit from stock-based compensation related to stock option exercises.","It does not however include any further estimated tax benefit related to potential future stock option exercises given the dependency of that benefit on the timing of those exercises. With these slight adjustments to our outlook, we continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 14% in fiscal 2020.","Moving on to the segments, let's take a look at Employer Services. We continue to expect 4% to 5% revenue growth in our Employer Services segment. This outlook includes the anticipated impact from my previous remarks regarding changes in FX and adjustments to our interest income on client funds outlook. We continue to anticipate pays per control growth of about 2.5%.","We also continue to expect Employer Services new business bookings growth of 6% to 8% and for our Employer Services revenue retention to improve 10 basis points to 20 basis points. I'd like to remind you as I commented in the prior earnings call that there is volatility inherent in the quarterly Employer Services bookings metric from larger international and upmarket deals.","And I\u2019d also like to remind you the difficult compare in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 resulting from our strong performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 due in part to a client list acquisition.","Moving onto margins. We continue to expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to expand by 100 basis points to 125 basis points. As a reminder with a difficult compare resulting from our strong margin performance in the first half of fiscal 2019, we continue to expect a much stronger margin increase in the latter half of fiscal 2020.","Regarding our PEO segment, overall, our outlook remains unchanged. We continue to expect 9% to 11% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and 7% to 9% growth in PEO revenues excluding zero margin benefit pass-throughs, both driven by an anticipated growth of 7% to 9% in average worksite employees.","Because of the slower growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we continue to expect the growth in our average worksite employees to be at the lower end of our guidance range in the first half of the year with a gradual reacceleration of our growth rate as the year progresses.","As we also discussed last quarter, we continue to expect lower workers' compensation and SUI cost and related pricing to pressure our total PEO revenue growth. For PEO margin, we continue to anticipate margins to be flat to down 25 basis points in fiscal 2020, which continues to include approximately 50 basis points of pressure from smaller favorable reserve adjustments in ADP Indemnity in fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019.","Before I hand the call over for Q&A, I'd like to share that on February 11, we will be hosting an Innovation Day, focused on technology, strategy and showcasing some of her latest innovations.","A few of you have had the opportunity to see some of those developments during HR Tech. Others may have had a glimpse from some of the industry analyst notes, and tweets following our September Industry Analyst Day.","The February 11th event would be specifically for the investment community, to share our product and service innovation, and have a dialogue around the progress that we continue to make, including how these innovations help to differentiate ADP in the market.","We look forward to welcoming you then, and please be on the lookout, for further details in the near future.","With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. This is Damien on for Ramsey. I wanted to ask on the Employer Services bookings guidance. I know you both talked about it at lengths. But I just wanted to see if you could give anymore color on just the quarterly cadence.","I know Kathleen you mentioned difficult comps coming up in Q4. But maybe just any granularity that you could give would be great. And then, just overall level of confidence to kind of get to the midpoint of that 6% to 8% guidance?","Carlos Rodriguez","I'll let maybe Kathleen make a comment as well. But again, I think if you that last year's pattern, our second quarter last year was soft. So that would be the easier compare. And the fourth quarter because of the acquisition of the client base acquisition from Wells Fargo, I think, it'll be a little more difficult.","But we obviously try to apply some judgment on these things. And we obviously have information about individual unit performance and kind of what's happening across regions.","And I think what we try to provide in some of the color our comments is that this quarter we had very strong, what I would call strong results in our core US businesses, SBS, major accounts and national accounts. And we really had some weakness with international and multinational. And we\u2019ll look into the details of that. There were a few large deals in prior year, as well as some deals that didn't close in the first quarter as expected. So that would give us some confidence that I think, we\u2019re still on track for the year, despite these kind of quarterly fluctuations.","Because I think as Kathleen's said, and we said many times for us bookings is certainly more volatile than revenues. Obviously, we have the recurring revenue model. But on bookings the clock goes back to zero at the beginning of every quarter.","But we see some underlying strength that gives us some optimism. But we did have some weakness in the international multinational and that is something that we\u2019re looking at. I don't think that it's any major change in the economy, because it\u2019s been kind of a difficult in the economic climate for a while in Europe where we have a large business. So, again as I look at the detail, it just looks like, typical lumpiness in our bookings.","Kathleen Winters","Yeah. I mean just to follow-up on with that. Look you\u2019re always going to have some degree of lumpiness in your quarterly bookings number right, from at least a couple of things, right?","If you\u2019ve got larger multinational type deals, that's going to cost some lumpiness. And then you\u2019ve got the year-over-year comps issue and you\u2019ve got a tough comp or an easier comp. So you\u2019ll always have a little bit of that going on. And so importantly, while the quarterly numbers obviously important I think even more important to look at a longer term trend, right?","When you look at how we've been doing in particular with last year having a really strong and I think record, right, number of $1.6 billion for last year and then 8%. And then on top of that another what we think is a really solid number of 6% in Q1, when you look at that longer period of time, we\u2019re actually feeling pretty pleased with the start to the year.","Now there is of course always pockets that are stronger and others that are maybe a little slower out of the gate and Carlos mentioned on the outside of the US having a little bit of lumpiness there, but net-net we're pretty pleased with the start to the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah. That makes sense, and great. Then maybe I\u2019ll zoom out a little bit and ask on overall sort of product strategy at the large enterprise level. I just wanted to dig in and see how you see your products suite revolving there just sort of in the context of you continuing to invest advantage over time and then your strategy - your new strategy around the Lifion offering.","Carlos Rodriguez","Don't forget we also again one of the highlights for the quarter and frankly it's been a highlight in trying to kind of signal this. I am not sure how it has landed yet, but our decision to use Workforce Now with the lower end of the upmarket, so call it that 1,000 to 3,000 even though frankly it can go higher. We have a couple of clients that have 8, 9,000 employees that are on Workforce Now. But that decision has been great competitively in growth wise. So we are selling a lot of units in that kind of lower end of the upmarket.","So the ability to use Workforce Now for - and it fits certain types of profiles clients and you can probably imagine generally speaking they are large, but simpler and Vantage clients would be more complex and have more complex needs like complex benefits and talent requirements and so forth.","And Lifion it\u2019s still obviously an early adopter type of product, even though we're getting great traction and we told you what - how we've done in terms of new sales given the size of ADP, it\u2019s really Workforce Now and Vantage Now that are affecting the numbers in terms of the bookings and the revenue. And I think again in case I wasn't clear like that we had a good quarter even in national accounts in the upmarket primarily as a result of really good results from Workforce Now.","So the strategy is the same strategy we\u2019ve had all along, which is I think we\u2019ve figured out that we have a really great solution for a segment of the market. I think last quarter, I mentioned that we have an external third-party do some analysis for us and in terms of segmenting the market, and as usual one solution doesn't fit the entire market. And what we found was that a pretty good size percentage of the market can be addressed by our Workforce Now solutions and that's what we're doing.","And we were right. And the analysis was right. And we think the Vantage still addresses another segment of the market and Lifion is more kind of the emerging solution that we obviously have placed a lot of confidence and a lot of a - and a big bet on for the future. But as of today it's really not having a big impact on the numbers.","And I also just in terms of just your question about market dynamic when we had this meeting in Las Vegas at the HR Tech Conference that I mentioned in my comments again, early positive signs we had for anyone who was there, I think some of our \u2013 some industry analysts and some financial analysts were there, I think, it was pretty clear that we are making an impact in the market. So our lead flow was multiples of what it has been in the past in the upmarket because of the interest in Lifion.","But I just want to be cautious in terms of pace here because relative to our $15 billion in revenue, this is not next quarter or three quarters from now. But the signs are very, very positive in the long-term as Kathleen mentioned. If you focus on the long-term, I think, Lifion - the traction we're getting in Lifion is very, very encouraging.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah. That's, that's really good. We'll keep watching. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Kevin McVeigh","Great. Thank you. Hey, you\u2019re able to reaffirm the revenue despite the lower client interest on kind of funds and extended investment. Was there any kind of offset there particularly given the incremental headwinds and FX? It seems like you're able to reaffirm the guide despite those couple of headwinds.","Carlos Rodriguez","You know, I think, it goes back to what we're saying about the some of the underlying performance of the business. So as an example, even though we don't give quarterly guidance on retention, you could tell from our comments, I hope that we felt pretty good about it this quarter, so that you could probably read into that it improved prior to - compared to last year's prior first quarter.","And as I mentioned before retention if you do the math has a pretty outside impact on our business bookings in terms of revenue and frankly big impact on margin because for equal growth you don't have to implement as much business.","And so there's a lot of different moving parts that go into the pot here, but I would point that one out as an area of strength. I think we've talked about the strong performance in our core U.S. businesses.","So for the first quarter we had kind of our three core businesses performing very well in terms of bookings as well. So it's a process from the ground up of us building this forecast, first of plan and now the forecast and I think we have some optimism that we're still in that range.","And but I just want to point out the retention story because three or four years ago when it was going the other way, I pointed out that it takes four to five points of sales growth of new business bookings growth to offset one point of retention just because of the way the math works. And so - now as retention - as you get a little bit of improvement in retention that helps a lot in terms of our growth rate.","Kathleen Winters","Yes. So as Carlos mentioned there's a couple of things that obviously gave us some headwind or unfavorably versus what we would have been expecting particularly the FX and the interest from client funds. However, when you look at operationally the fundamentals things look really good.","As Carlos said retention is on a steady track upwards now gets harder and harder the higher up you go. But we're happy to see some level of increase in the first quarter here, and bookings were solid for the quarter.","Carlos Rodriguez","And I would just add on the client funds interest, we do have some of this - for the year it obviously has an impact as we guided - we gave you the information in terms of we are slightly below what we expected to be, but it's not a huge number for this fiscal year.","Kevin McVeigh","Great. And then just Carlos to highlight the retention a little bit more because obviously really nice progress there. Any sense of just the success across the enterprise versus the mid-market versus kind of downstream a little bit the range on those?","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes. I do have some sense. My sense is that, we're improving a lot. So we show some signs in terms of the win-loss, what we call balance of the trade, some encouraging signs particularly in our mid-market business.","So again the mid-market now is performing - you got to be cautious because there's definitely a forward-looking statement. But it's performing according to the script, in the sense if you remember we took a lot of pain and lot of effort to migrate all of our clients on to one single strategic platform which is Workforce Now.","And when you look at the history of what happened in our SBS downmarket business. When we did that, we were optimistic and hopeful that we would have the same kind of traction in our mid-market business. And it's beginning to show now.","So we have improving retention now for it feels like six or seven quarters somewhere in that range. I am being told more. So once we kind of finish the migration and got through that difficulty. I think we have steady improvements in retention.","This quarter was the second highest retention we've ever had, in our mid-market business. And in this quarter what was very encouraging is to see the level of activity in new business bookings. So, the combination of those two things gives us a feeling of optimism for what is - one of biggest and more profitable businesses.","Kevin McVeigh","Awesome, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Togut","Thank you. Good morning. Could you comment on, the drivers that you expect to move your PEO revenue growth up from 8% in the recent quarter to 9% to 11% which is your guide for this year?","And then, just as a follow-up at your Analyst Day last year you gave a multiyear guide of 12% to 14%, CAGR for your HRO business, and you're trending well below that now. Did you anticipate the time that the growth rates in the earlier year\u2019s double-digits effectively, would slow towards the end of that period? Let's say, mid- to high single digits?","Carlos Rodriguez","Well if I can start with the second one first, since I was there in the analysts and not fair to ask Kathleen. I think we have built the guidance for or I guess the estimates for are three years. We had as I think we've mentioned this couple of times, we had certain expectations around our pass through revenue and inflation of those numbers that had some historical precedent, both around workers compensation and health care.","And I think literally within two months of that, the picture changed, and we communicated that very clearly and very transparently and frankly, without any anxiety because it doesn't have any impact in our EPS. So if you remember the Investor Day, I think it June and I think when we had our August earnings call, I think, we brought down significantly for that year at least, the growth rate for the PEO mainly - primarily close to almost based on lower inflation.","Now on top of that, we have had some slowdown in worksite employee growth, which is the core driver underneath of the real growth of the business. But I think a main driver of this differential from what we communicated at our Investor Day has been has been the lower inflation of the pass-through, which again doesn't concern us, in a big way because it\u2019s zero margin and doesn't really affect our profitability in terms of in terms of dollars.","In terms of your question about the behavior of the quarters and so forth, probably beyond the scope of this call but, it's just kind of math in terms of when we have our open enrollment for healthcare in kind of May, June timeframe which we\u2019ve again communicated very transparently when that happens and what happens when that occurs, you tend to have some client churn.","So that drops your worksite employee growth and obviously revenue growth for the PEO. And then as bookings continue to - assuming they continue to be robust, you start to build that up again. And then at the end of the calendar year-end, you have another event at year end where you have some churn in the client base in terms of clients that choose to leave at the end of the calendar year because that's more natural, but we also have historically a lot of bookings in January as well.","So we've been doing this for 20 years and we see a difference or a change we would obviously communicate that. But I think we're just kind of dropping the numbers in as they are supposed to come in terms of -- based on historical trends.","And David I would just add, so last quarter we did say that we would expect to start a year from the lower end of the range and then grow into the range as the year progresses because obviously, we started with a somewhat of a weaker ending worksite employee number in the fourth quarter last year.","Christian Greyenbuhl","And I think it's probably worth asking I mean, adding just again in full transparency, I think we said it last quarter our health care renewal was slightly higher than the previous year. So I wouldn't - it wasn't anything out of norm in terms of historical, but it was higher than the previous year","And when that - when we have that happen you tend to get more shoppers and more -- health care cause is a large part of what a small business pays in their overall cost structure of their workforce. And so they tend to shop and look around and so forth, and so we have a little bit more churn than I think that we have had in the prior year.","The good news is for us is that we have that issue, but we've been dealing with that for 20 years, but we don\u2019t think any risk on health care. So whatever we get in terms of price increases through the carriers, we pass those through 100% which is why we call zero margin pass-through.","So that eliminates any risk or any surprises in the future, but it also means that you have to have frankly the courage to just pass those costs through and let the chips fall where they may.","And the chips fell and I think you can see from the numbers that the chips didn't fall off the table, because there wasn't a collapse in the because of a huge slowdown, but we definitely had our speed bump and now it's really through new business bookings that we have to regain the momentum and kind of have that ramp up again and reacceleration of the growth rate.","David Togut","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Your line is open.","Bryan Bergin","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Carlos, wanted to ask your macro outlook on the current employment market. It sounds encouraging based on the performance of the business, but I'm curious how much of that is due to the improved competitive product position versus the underlying demand you might be saying?","Carlos Rodriguez","It's a great question because it's an important one for us to keep kind of asking ourselves, we do have some things that you know if they turn on us would put pressure on us, interest rates obviously is one of them, pays per control, et cetera.","But we're also feeling pretty good about our product situation and I think our competitive situation in the marketplace going forward here. So it is -- that's going to be a very important question for us to stay focused on here for the next few quarters","But as of today, when you look at our lagging indicators so pays per control, it doesn't look like there's a slow down or a big issue, but if you look at the same things that everyone else would look at that we have access to and you have access to in terms of leading indicators like confidence indexes or NFIB\/ISM - those types of things Michigan confidence.","You know those, there\u2019s some concern there and some reason for caution. In our numbers, the only place where we have seen some little bit of softness and pace for control and it doesn't get reflected in our and what we report because as we've disclosed prior this is our Autopay base which is a very large base of both large employers, midsize employers and smaller employers.","But we have most of our employer in our run platform and there we've seen a slight down tick in pays per control growth over the prior year. It doesn't - when you look at over the 10-year history, I don't think it's anything to be alarmed by, but - when you look at other factors it certainly a cause for caution. I just happened to look I think, in the last couple of days at NFIB and that's softened significantly, but it's still well above recession levels.","And so I think we\u2019re all kind of trying to figure out the same thing here which is a soft patch or is it kind of a trend line. But with - the Fed easing and the consumer still strong like right now our plans are that we kind of work our way through this soft patch.","Bryan Bergin","Okay. That's helpful. And then Kathleen on just margin expansion progress, any further details you can share on the various transformation initiatives? And as you look across the various resources were you seeing the most yield, and anything surprising you as you've had just more time in the seat?","Kathleen Winters","Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, something that I'm really focused on in the organization is really very focused on as well. I mean just to kind of get some context and kind of big picture when you step back and take a look at what we've done in the last couple of years.","I mean remember back in 2018, we were at margin rate of 20.7%, with a small amount of margin expansion in that year and then in 2019 when -- fiscal 2019, when we were executing on some really big and meaningful transformation initiatives.","You saw that really outsized margin expansion of 160 basis points, and know -- as a reminder the guide for another 100 basis points to 125 basis points for fiscal 2020.","So a track record here really consistent margin expansion. And as we start in fiscal 2020 with Q1 that 60 basis points of margin expansion we're really happy to see that and very happy that we're on track with how we planned the year.","Now there's a lot of execution and a lot of work behind the scenes going on but I'd point out that number one as I started my comment there's a lot of energy around it and a lot of alignment. And that energy and alignment is around both executing what I call in-flight projects as well as developing the pipeline for the future. So that's really exciting.","I talked about on the previous call that most of the margin expansion from a transformation perspective this year is coming from what we're calling workforce optimization and procurement initiatives both are very much on track from a workforce optimization standpoint.","Think about that in terms of spans and layers exercise if you will and particularly targeted to management layers. So that's kind of on track and already executed with most of that benefit being in fiscal 2020 not much from that coming beyond fiscal 2020.","And then procurement transformation there's a lot of projects there as we look at - across all parts of the organization and spend as we look at volume and we look at policy and we look at our ability to negotiate smartly with vendors and suppliers. There is opportunity there and there is a lot of execution going on.","So a lot of work execution going on. So, a lot of work by the organization, we're happy with what the teams are currently doing and happy with the progress, but more to do.","Bryan Bergin","Thank you.","Carlos Rodriguez","Hi, Brian. I just - one thing just to add, as you think about the margin because your question I think was related to margins in particular. And obviously what's driving those. But last year, the first and second quarter but particularly the second quarter was a very strong growth in margin in that time.","And just a reminder, we also had pressure from M&A at that time. So, just layer that one on to it as well when you think about margin cadence last year versus this year.","Bryan Bergin","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Grossman from Stifel. Your line is open.","David Grossman","Thank you. Good morning. I wonder if I could just follow-up with a couple of questions on the PEO. Each of your kind of larger peers in that space have identified some type of incremental issue with their health insurance book in their most recent reports.","And I know you mentioned, just higher health premiums and obviously you pass everything through in your model. But is there anything else, you're seeing in the market place that may be impacting the cost of delivering health insurance in the PEO industry?","Carlos Rodriguez","No.","David Grossman","All right. So for you, it's just the straight higher premium and not seeing anything else? I guess, you don't really see the claim that is around in terms of how claims may be impacting on a cost?","Carlos Rodriguez","You will see individual employee, claims data but we of course very, very carefully looking at claims data to get some sense with our carriers and partnership with our carriers, what's happening in terms of trends.","Maybe I should be a little bit more, clear on this, premium increase issue. So, I'm not going to give you the exact numbers. I don't think we want to get down that rabbit hole. But the change from this renewal to the prior renewal was call it one to two percentage points higher, on average than the prior year. So if, the previous year the average renewal increase was 6% then the next year it was it was it was 7% or 8%.","And that increase that year that was slightly higher was completely in line with the prior six or seven years. So it wasn't -- so there are some ups and downs. But the prior year was one that was actually exceptional. I think we were very clear about that. I think we talked about that in our calls, that we had a really great renewal on our health care on average I remember this is not one carrier. These are multiple carriers.","We use a number of different carriers to make sure we have good coverage across the entire country. And so, that was unusual. And it helped us competitively. But I think this renewal was not out of line with historical norms and has nothing to do with any of that.","I think anything that's happening around health care this probably has to do with people's underwriting policies and their own approach to bringing in business and repricing business, because it's not just about the business you bring in.","But every year if you're self-insured or you're taking risk, you have the opportunity or the option of passing through or not passing through health care costs. And you actually have some judgment with your underwriters on what those costs are.","And so that's generally typically what could create a problem in health care. But it doesn't appear to us that there's really anything happening broadly in the health care industry around PEOs.","David Grossman","And then just on your, just based on your commentary on workers comp. I mean I think the whole industry had a tailwind. So, if you look at this year's health increase plus the workers comp at a more normalized level, this is really a more typical year for you then right, I mean in terms of the PEO, in terms of those two items?","Carlos Rodriguez","I think that's right. That's fair. And I think on the workers comp, just again to be clear was a -- I think we were clear, but why don\u2019t we say one more time, a smaller positive. So we're not having big surprises in terms of losses in workers comp or any kind of. And by the way we have very tight ship there in a sense that we have as we disclose in our 10-K, a collar that limits our risk in a fairly significant way. Caps are down side on workers comp. So we have reinsurance an individual claim and then we have a collar around overall loss estimates. So it's quite limited in terms of the volatility.","I think the other thing that I would mention is that our business mix hasn't changed, so we look at that very carefully as well. So we looked at the mix of we call it white collar versus gray collar, but within those categories you have a lot of different industries and a lot of different categories of people and we don't see any major change there as well.","David Grossman","Got it. And just as a follow-up, is kind of a bigger picture for you question Carlos is that given a relatively low penetration rates for the industry and that you get a lot of your new clients from a client that is already using you for payroll.","What are the major objections to somebody enrolling in the PEO particularly if they're an ADP payroll customer and you already have the payroll records so it kind of disruption and transition cost time and effort are substantially lower?","Carlos Rodriguez","I think it's - it goes back to like my first year marketing class in graduate school, which is high involvement decision, right. So the PEO to go to a small midsize business and tell them that you're going to create a co-employment relationship, you're taking over there healthcare plan, there\u2019s workers' compensation remember all along the way there are as an example that could be a relationship with insurance agent or a broker that's been providing to health care in the workers comp for the last 10 years that gets this intermediated.","You have to - payroll is hard enough to convince some of the payroll because people worry about \u2013 are you sure you are not going to make a mistake and make sure that it's going to go accurately, we obviously have an incredibly strong reputation on payroll that helps us.","But the traditional business is you\u2019re trying to convince someone to give you your payroll, now you're also trying to convince them to give you everything around their HR department.","And so it's with a higher level of trust and it's again what I remember being taught is called a high involvement decision, which takes longer to make and is more difficult to make.","So I honestly don't think that there is really anything that prevents clients from becoming PEO clients. And I think we've demonstrated over 20 years that we've convinced a lot of them.","And so our board asks the same question you're asking, which can't you convince even more. And we're trying. Like, we continue to add improvements in the product. We continue to provide better tools. We continue to enhance our product. We continue to do all the things we can to make it more compelling and easier to use.","As an example, I think we've kind of talked about this in the last 18 months, all new business now and the PEO starting in our Workforce Now platform which has higher functionality and provides the ability to satisfy slightly larger clients than we could before because it's a mid-market platform.","And so there is a lot of things that we're doing to try to convince as many clients to come over to our PEO solution as possible. I think it's good for them and it's good for them and it's good for us but there's really nothing that I can point to other than kind of the difficulties of the convincing of the sale.","David Grossman","I got it. Very helpful. Thank you for that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to pick-up on some of the margin commentary. I mean, as you rightfully pointed out the comparison there gets quite a bit harder actually in the second quarter. So just so that our expectations are properly calibrated. I mean do you expect margins to be up in the second quarter year-over-year?","Kathleen Winters","Yes. It's a really tough comp in Q2. Remember last fiscal year Q2, we had over 300 basis points of margin expansion. So it was going to be tough to expand in Q2. Maybe it's flat to slightly up slightly down. You know, hard to say exactly because there's so many moving parts.","But the way I would think about is that the bulk of the expansion to come this fiscal year will come in the second half of the year.","Jason Kupferberg","Yes. Okay. That's fair. I mean just on the bookings front somewhat similar question except in reverse right? Because you\u2019ve got the easy comp there in the second quarter. So do you need to be above the full year guidance range in the second quarter just to make sure that you stay on track to achieve the full year outlook? Because then obviously the comparisons here get a bit harder in the second half?","Kathleen Winters","Above the bookings guidance number in the second quarter?","Jason Kupferberg","You need to be above the full year range in Q2 just to keep yourself on track?","Kathleen Winters","Mathematically, yes. So you're absolutely right. I mean it\u2019s to stay on that for the full year you\u2019ll have more growth in the second quarter and then much less in Q4.","Jason Kupferberg","Right, right okay. And then just last quick one from me. What would be the drivers of the anticipated acceleration in the WSE growth during the balance of fiscal 2020?","Carlos Rodriguez","Selling more new clients than losing clients. It really goes back to the - I mean, I hate to I'm not trying to be a smart [indiscernible] but the it's really the pattern, I think, I talked about it a couple of questions ago that when we tell our open enrollment in May and June, we tend to experience some client turn. The sales don't accelerate necessarily at the same necessarily at the same time.","And so you have seen that phenomenon happens sometimes at the end of the calendar year where you may lose a group of clients and then you bring on new clients at the beginning of the year, but then you also bring on - so clients tend to not leave at other times of year other than calendar year end and open enrollment which is May and June.","That doesn't mean non leave, I'm just saying that the skewing is cued towards those two periods. And the sales are skewed differently. And the combination of those two things is what causes either growth or deceleration in worksite employee growth.","Kathleen Winters","Yes. Look on - any of the not any but like a lot of these metrics when you look at a very short period of time one quarter \u2013 you could have some one-off things happening. I saw - as I said earlier looking at these trends and a track record over time for things like bookings and worksite employee growth and even margin, right? Looking at the trend over time is helpful I find.","Carlos Rodriguez","But again in this case we also have - we have to hit our plan, obviously. I guess as usual when we have these calls, if we are giving you the numbers based on what we expect right now. So if we hit our new business bookings plans and retentions stays when we expected to stay then you would get the outcomes that we're talking about.","But as Kathleen said, there's a lot of moving parts if three to six months from now, the economies in the tank and pays per control is declining, it's going to in the PEO in addition to ES and it less than ADP and that would create a headwind. But in the absence of any new information I think, we feel pretty good about the forecast we have.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Wald from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steven Wald","Hey, good morning. Just maybe a follow-up a on the margin expansion path, looking beyond, sort of the next few quarters or even this year, I just wanted to talk about the messaging. And make sure we were getting a proper sense of the drivers there.","I think a lot of the talk has been around workforce optimization and procurement over the next 12 months or so. But I think, one of the things you guys try to talk about is the tech improvements or your investments.","As you build more this into your platform, as you're add even more into what you are doing on a day-to-day basis. Can you talk a little bit about, how that scale to you're adding or that scalable expense base that you're adding will show up in terms of cost reductions or margin improvement?","Carlos Rodriguez","Well, I think again back to like what Kathleen was talking about in terms of the math, some of it was really comparisons rather than anything that we're doing. And but we have to help people. We understand that it's important for you guys to understand that.","So, just as a reminder last year what happened was, we had with the voluntary early retirement program, we had a good number of people taking that. And then the back fills that we had planned which was all planned, certain percentage of back fills were delayed.","And so that impacted that year. We also got off to a very strong start for a couple of other reasons. We had other what we called quick wins at a time around transformation that help us get off to a strong start in the first half.","And I think Kathleen talked about -- we had for us, like incredibly strong margin improvement. And so it's just a very difficult compare mathematically. As we've been going along, regardless of how the math works, we continue to work on a number of initiatives.","And this year obviously we executed on this expand the layers initiative, and then we have a number of other projects around procurement is one of them but we also have a number kind of automation and digitization project that I think we're making some progress on. And when we have our industry - sorry our Analyst Day in February, we'll probably share a little bit more around some of those things that we're doing, because those are around transformation and innovation as well. So it's not just about innovating on the product side. But it's also innovating on the implementation and on the service side.","And we\u2019ve gotten some good traction in some of our businesses which are allows our productivity to improve while, still for our associates. While still improving our NPS scores and our client satisfaction which by the way were up again this quarter and no surprise the retention is improving.","It\u2019s usually a sign that client satisfaction is still high. So again trick here is you want to transform your cost structure, but you don't want to like lose all the clients in the meantime. And for now, we've been able to balance both of those and that's our plan here for the next year or two.","Steven Wald","Yes. Fair enough. And then, maybe just one quick follow-up, I noticed the buy back a little bit higher than we\u2019ve seen last year or so. Just could you provide any commentary on how you're thinking about the pace there going forward?","Kathleen Winters","Yes. So really no change in terms of how we're thinking about that. And our strategy we talked about the intent to buy back 1% of the share base. And we've been executing along those lines, so, really no change.","We look all the time at the market conditions and look if there is some opportunity where there is a big downturn in the market and we want to become more active. Maybe we'll do that, I don't know. But constantly we watch that, we look at it, we talked about it all the time, but as of now no particular change.","Carlos Rodriguez","Again, one little statistic, because we happen to notice these things when we prepare for these calls. Because now I get like seems like 20 years of information, so we\u2019ve reduced our share count by 30% since the early 2000\u2019s, and so we intend to continue to stay on that pace.","And so obviously it's a marathon for a company like we're kind of proud that it's a marathon we've been around for seven years. And at 1% per year it adds up. And it certainly has added up in the last 20 years to the tune of a 30% share reduction.","And I think that companies are in the different stage of development whether they're getting dilution and adding shares to their share count. We think we're going to win this marathon.","Steven Wald","All right. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our final question from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Just a quick - two quick clarifications. On the PEO margins it was below street, but it didn't sound like it was really below your expectations. And it sounds like there was a tougher comp to the ADP Indemnity. So could maybe just talk to that and how that looks going forward on the margin side?","Carlos Rodriguez","Yeah. No, I think that's a fair characterization. I think that as usual there\u2019s \u2013 and we try to obviously be as straight as we can be because sometimes there is a slight disconnect between what we\u2019re expecting versus since we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. But the results I think were on that specific topic, I think we're in line with our expectations.","Kathleen Winters","Yeah. It was definitely in line with how we expect to start the year.","Bryan Keane","And then just the cadence how we think about that going forward on the margin for PEO?","Carlos Rodriguez","That's a good question. I think that when you look at the annual guidance, I think it was down flat to 25 down\u2026","Kathleen Winters","Down 25 basis points.","Carlos Rodriguez","Down to 25 basis points. I think that was the guidance. If you take our first quarter number, I would for now assume ratably margin improvement over the course of the rest of the year because these quarterly fluctuations in ADP Indemnity are not something that is - something that we can have a - we don't have any real visibility into that.","And again, just as a reminder, part of why we've done this is, if you remember a couple of years ago, we had some criticism around our disclosures. So we had our client funds interest and Indemnity being handled in the kind of other category, which allowed us to not have these questions and not kind of makes up the results of those businesses.","But as usual, there are two sides to every story. And so I think the criticism was those things really belong and the results of the business unit. Fair enough. So we made that change and now we are saddled with every quarter having to explain any kind of fluctuations here, because what really matters is the underlying health of the business.","We don\u2019t take enough risk in that business for it to matter. But you can get because of the size of the business, if you get a $5 million fluctuation which is what we had this quarter up or down, it affects the numbers, but it doesn't really say anything about what's happening in the underlying business.","But it is what it is. We now report Indemnity in the PEO and we\u2019re going to have to every quarter be able to give you that kind of color. And likewise in Employer Services we now have client funds interest. And so now that creates some variability in that business as well.","Kathleen Winters","Yeah, so with the down - with the flat to down 25 basis points and down 70 in Q1 you'll see that just mathematically it ramps. But again it's going to depend on the ADP Indemnity and how that comes through during the balance of the year.","Carlos Rodriguez","It was certainly easier when we didn't have ADP Indemnity in the PEO. But because nothing -- we've been doing that for 20 years. We've handled it. We\u2019re not by the way we are handling exactly the same way we\u2019ve always handled it. It\u2019s just a different accounting report. That's all.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude our question-and-answer portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks.","Carlos Rodriguez","Well, thanks very much. You can tell we feel pretty good about the start to 2020. We're obviously trying to change a lot of things. We\u2019ve talked a lot about transformation. We'll share more with you when we have our Innovation Day here in February.","But we\u2019re focused on execution as I think Kathleen alluded to this there's still a lot of execution in front of us. But we still - we try continue to be focused on our clients and our associates. And our associates are doing a phenomenal job as evidenced by our continuing improvements in our NPS scores.","Obviously, we felt good about what happened with HR Tech, with our Lifion debut. So I think that gives us some optimism. We're very excited about what's happening in the mid-market business here in the first quarter.","So I - continue to be very proud of our organization and the resiliency of the organization and the transformation efforts that they continue to execute on. So we look forward to giving you more updates in the time to come. And we thank you for joining our call today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Elena Charles, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please, begin.","Elena Charles","Thank you. Good morning. I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call and Webcast.","Before discussing our financial results, Carlos and Jan will talk about the planned spinoff of Dealer Services announced on April 10 and our latest Human Capital Management technology innovations. Finally, after Jan discusses the quarterly results and the full year forecast, he will provide his thoughts about the expected impact of our client funds investment strategy for fiscal 2015.","I'd like to remind everyone that during today's conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such, involve some risks. And these are discussed in our earnings release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Elena. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As Elena mentioned, we have several exciting topics to cover on our call. I'll begin with our strategic decision to spin off the Dealer Services business, a decision which we believe will benefit ADP shareholders by allowing each management team to focus on its respective industry.","For ADP, this deepens our commitment to being a global leader in Human Capital Management and positions us well for future growth. For Dealer Services, it allows them to focus on expanding their leadership position in the global automotive retail industry.","You might ask, why spin off Dealer Services now? The global retail automotive market is evolving at a fast pace, fueled by digital marketing and other innovations where Dealer Services currently enjoys a market-leading position. In addition, this industry is the strongest it has been since 2007 with U.S. vehicle sales continuing to recover to pre-crisis levels.","In separating the 2 companies, we expect Dealer Services to be a strong, independent company with solid growth prospects, a strong competitive market position, an experienced management team, and an aligned capital structure. We fully believe that this is the right decision at the right time for both companies and for the shareholders.","And now I'll turn the call over to Jan for his comments regarding the transaction.","Jan Siegmund","Good morning, everyone. As Carlos mentioned, we believe this transaction will better enable both ADP and Dealer Services to pursue their respective growth strategies and drive long-term shareholder value.","The structure of the transaction will be a 100% spinoff of the Dealer Services business into a separate, independent publicly traded company. This will be a tax-free transaction for our shareholders, and we anticipate its completion in early October, subject, of course, to applicable regulatory requirements. We expect to file the initial Form 10 in early June, and plan to have an investor roadshow with the management team of the new Dealer Services company as we get closer to the spin date.","Additionally, we will be looking carefully at costs as we create the appropriate public company infrastructure for Dealer Services. Although we will offset some of these costs within ADP's existing infrastructure, we expect there will be a moderate increase in expenses when looking across both companies.","As previously disclosed, we anticipate that ADP will receive at least $700 million from the Dealer Services business at the completion of this transaction. And our intent is to use this cash to repurchase shares of ADP stock, subject to market conditions.","Regarding ADP's dividend, our intent following the spinoff is to increase the dividend annually subject to board approval, keeping intact our 39-year track record of dividend increases. However, we expect to grow the dividend at a slower rate than earnings to allow us to return to our pre-separation target dividend payout ratio of 55% to 60% in about 2 years. Any dividend to be paid by the new Dealer Services public company will be determined by the Dealer Services Board of Directors and will be incremental to the ADP dividend.","Another area I would like to discuss with you is ADP's credit ratings, which were updated as a result of the announcement to spin off Dealer Services. We anticipated this change in ADP's credit ratings and fully contemplated it as part of our analysis. We are proud of our exceptionally strong AA credit ratings with a stable outlook from both Moody's and Standard & Poor's. In fact, you should note our ratings are still the best in our industry. The changed ratings are not expected to have any direct financial impact on our business. In addition, neither the spinoff of Dealer Services nor our updated credit ratings will change our disciplined approach to how we move more than $1 trillion in client funds each year.","And I now will turn back the call over to Carlos.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Jan. We'll provide updates on future calls about the progress we're making towards separating the Dealer Services business from ADP. But once again, I believe that this is the right decision at the right time for both companies and for our shareholders.","I'm excited for the future of both companies and especially pleased about the investments we are making in Employer Services to further establish ourselves as a leading global provider of Human Capital Management solutions. So with that, let me share some highlights of how these investments are translating into our latest technology innovation.","Earlier this month, we held our annual ADP Meeting of the Minds conference for our upmarket clients. I'm pleased to say that we hosted more than 1,000 participants, where we previewed exciting works coming out of our ADP Innovation Labs. Our next-generation user experience will transform the way our clients' employees manage their work life through a host of new features that fully leverage tablet and smartphone capabilities.","Today's employees expect easy-to-use technology that is similar to how they bank, use social media, book travel, and so much more. As a result, ADP's new user experience will set the industry standard, enabling employees and their managers to collaborate, perform key business functions more effectively, and in short, fully utilize the power of our HCM solutions in an intuitive yet powerful way.","What we previewed at our Annual Meeting of the Minds provided a glimpse into innovations that increase the ability for employees to manage their work life, ranging from creating powerful pre- and onboarding solutions that welcome new employees and leverage social media to get them productive more quickly; to finding the healthcare plan that best fits themselves and their families; easily viewing and managing their schedules, including social shift swapping; and transforming the traditional paystub into a financial planning tool through realtime paycheck modeling that allows employees to immediately see how changes to withholdings impact their pay. Of course, all these offerings will be device agnostic and available on tablets, mobile devices, PCs, and so forth.","We built these innovations to be predictive by guiding employees through suggested HR selections based on choices made by similar employees from within ADP's data-rich ecosystem. And we view this as just the beginning of how we can use data to help our clients and their employees make better decisions. Our Meeting of the Minds participants were very excited about the product demos and also excited to know the first rollout of this next-generation experience will be available in the early fall.","And now, for some highlights on the quarter. ADP reported solid revenue growth of 7%. I'm especially pleased with the 14% growth in worldwide new business bookings for the quarter in Employer Services and PEO combined. This acceleration during the quarter was led by double-digit growth in the PEO, the mid-market and our multinational solutions.","We believe these results are evidence of our strong value proposition relating to ACA and compliance in the PEO as well as the competitive strength of our Workforce Now and multinational offerings. Our upmarket teams also experienced a good quarter with new business bookings improving sequentially through the first 3 quarters. Vantage sales were also good this quarter, and we also sold a good number of Workforce Now deals in the lower end of National Accounts.","We are on track to achieve our new business bookings growth forecast for Employer Services and PEO combined of approximately 8% for the year, but we do have hard work ahead of us due to a tough global comparison in the final quarter of the fiscal year.","Now moving on to PEO. As I mentioned a moment ago, new business bookings in the PEO were strong, and we continue to see positive momentum in this business. Growth in average worksite employees paid was a strong 18% for the quarter.","Moving on to Dealer Services, the global outlook for the automotive industry continues to be positive. Continental Europe is showing some signs of slow and gradual improvement, and the U.S. auto sales continue to advance towards pre-recessionary levels. Dealer Services performed well in the quarter as it continues to grow its client base with solid competitive win rates while also benefiting from increased digital advertising revenues.","And before I turn the call over to Jan, I want to update you on the progress we're making with migrating clients from our legacy platforms to our new cloud solution. I'm pleased to report that migrations to ADP RUN continue to progress quite well. We have migrated over 20,000 clients during the quarter, and now have almost 350,000 clients on this platform. We're on target to complete all small business migrations in fiscal 2015. We are also executing on our plan to move all of our mid-sized clients to ADP Workforce Now. We currently have more than 47,000 clients on this platform. We are on our way to complete these migrations in fiscal 2015 as well.","We've been pleased with the upsell opportunities as a result of these migrations. Many of the clients we migrate to Workforce Now from a legacy standalone payroll platform sign up for one or more additional solutions, such as time and attendance, HR and benefits administration, or talent. Additionally, we're seeing notable improvement in retention rates for our clients on our newest platforms.","And with that, I will now give the call back to Jan for a look at the quarter's financial highlights and the full year forecast.","Jan Siegmund","Thank you, Carlos. ADP reported 7% revenue growth for the quarter, which was nearly all organic. Focusing on continuing operations, we achieved 6% growth in both pretax and net earnings and 7% earnings per share growth on fewer shares outstanding compared with 1 year ago. The quarter's results were as anticipated, and each of our business segments performing well. Employer Services grew total revenue 6%, PEO grew 15%, and Dealer grew 7%.","In Employer Services, overall growth was good across-the-board. I do want to remind you that we anticipate a slower revenue growth in Employer Services as we entered into the second half of fiscal year, of this fiscal year, as a result of lower revenues from our tax credit services business that helps our clients receive certain employment-related tax credits. These revenues were lower than 1 year ago because a program that began in last year's third fiscal quarter has expired and has not been reviewed yet.","As many of you know, our third fiscal quarter is an important retention period in our business, and I'm pleased that Employer Services' worldwide client revenue retention increased 80 basis points, bringing us to a 10 basis points improvement on a year-to-date basis on top of historically high retention rates.","We are pleased to see continued strength in our same-store pays per control with Employer Services in the U.S., with an increase of 2.8%. However, in Europe, same-store pays per control declined 0.6% as anticipated. Although the decline has lessened throughout the fiscal year, the economy across Europe is still mixed.","Average client fund balances were stronger than anticipated during the quarter, increasing 9%. Lower state unemployment tax rates were offset by increases from wage growth, including bonus payments by our clients; standalone tax filing; new business growth, especially in the small and mid-sized markets; as well as pays per control.","The PEO had a strong quarter with 15% revenue growth, driven by 18% average worksite employee growth and strong revenue retention. Moving on to Dealer Services. Revenue growth was 7%, driven by new business installed and digital advertising revenues. Margin improvement benefited from nonrecurring items.","I would now like to take you through a few of the items that negatively impacted ADP's earnings growth and margin expansion in the quarter. The decrease in high-margin revenues I spoke about a moment ago relating to certain employment tax credit programs we administer for our clients -- for our Employer Services clients, also created a year-over-year margin pressures.","New bookings expense increased as anticipated from the strong bookings growth in the quarter. High-margin client fund interest revenues declined more than we anticipated due to lower interest rates, and the 10% increase in systems development and programming expense was higher than revenue growth and in line with our expectation. This increase is a result of our continued focus on innovation. Carlos gave some examples of these innovations in his opening remarks.","And before we leave the discussion on the quarter's results, I want to point out that the decline in client interest revenues resulting from low-interest rates continues to be the most significant drag on ADP's result. ADP's revenue growth was muted almost 0.5 percentage points as the lower yields more than offset the benefit from the 9% growth in balances.","Pretax margin was negatively impacted 60 basis points, and diluted earnings per share was lower by almost $0.02, or 2 percentage points, for the quarter Excluding this impact, it is evident that the leverage in ADP's business model is strong and intact.","Now I will give you our updated full year forecast, which excludes any onetime expenses in connection with the Dealer Services spinoff and the results of discontinued operations as shown in this morning's press release. We are now anticipating revenue growth of about 8% for total ADP.","We continue to anticipate slight pretax margin improvement for total ADP from 18.8% last year, which excludes the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. We expect the effective tax rate will be about flat with fiscal year 2013's effective tax rate of 33.9%.","We anticipate about 9% growth in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared with the $2.88 in fiscal year 2013, which excluded the goodwill impairment charge reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013.","As it is our normal practice, no further share buybacks are contemplated in the forecast beyond anticipated dilution related to employee equity comp plans, though it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders, depending on market conditions.","And for all segments, in Employer Services, we continue to forecast revenue growth of about 7%, with pretax margin expansion of about 100 basis points. Consistent with our prior forecast, we are still anticipating an increase in our pays per control metric in the U.S. between 2% and 3%.","For PEO Services, we are now forecasting about 14% revenue growth with slight pretax margin expansion. We continue to forecast about 8% growth in the dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new business bookings from the $1.35 billion sold in fiscal year 2013. And for Dealer Services, we continue to forecast about 8% revenue growth with about 100 basis points of pretax margin expansion.","We have narrowed our forecast for the client funds investment strategy, and the detail is available both in the press release and in the supplemental slides on our website, but I will provide the highlights. We anticipate client fund balances for fiscal year 2014 will be about $20.7 billion, which was -- represents about 8% growth.","We anticipate a yield on the client funds portfolio of about 1.8%, down about 40 basis points from fiscal year 2013. We anticipate a year-over-year decline in client funds interest of $45 million to $50 million, and a decline of $55 million to $60 million for the total impact of the client funds investment strategy.","And now, we also wanted to take a few minutes on the call today to talk with you about the expected impact of our client funds investment strategy on fiscal year 2015. Keeping in mind that we are still in our operating plan cycle and that these numbers are preliminary, our expectation is that the impact of the strategy to earnings will be about flat through fiscal year 2014, that is, these are adding to or subtracting from earnings.","Let me walk you through the slide to provide a way for you to think about this for the purposes of your model. The chart on the left side of the slide should be familiar to most of you. Here, we show the detail of our client funds available for sale portfolios as of March 31, 2014, including the balances and the embedded interest yields for the remainder of fiscal year '14 and beyond. We included full year fiscal year '14 on this chart to give you some perspective on the rate pressure we continued to experience this year with an average embedded yield of 4% for the maturing balances compared with this year's average reinvestment rate of about 1.8%.","For fiscal year 2015, based on current yield curves, we anticipate an average reinvestment rate of about 1.9%, which is still below the embedded rate of 2.7% for the securities that will mature during this fiscal year. This delta between the rates is not as wide as we have experienced over the past several years, and we believe that balance growth will help offset the rate pressure that we anticipate for fiscal year 2015.","For illustrative purposes, because our forecasts for next year are not yet completed, we are assuming an increase in average client fund balances of about 5%, which at this point, in our operating plan process, is reasonable. We therefore, anticipate that the overall year-over-year impact in fiscal year 2015 from the client funds investment strategy will be about flat compared to the $55 million to $60 million drag we expect to experience this year.","And remember, the interest earned in our investment portfolio flows into 2 separate lines of the earnings statement. The chart on the left represents ADP's client funds available for sale portfolio. The interest we earn on these portfolios is recorded as revenues on our earnings statement as interest on funds held for clients. With the exception of the interest earned from the extended portfolio on borrowing days, which is recorded as a portion of interest income on corporate funds within other income net. This is illustrated on the right-hand side of the slide. I hope this slide helps to make the point that both revenues and other income net are impacted by the client fund investment strategy for your modeling.","And before we take your questions, I want to state that although our share repurchases in the quarter were less then you may have anticipated, ADP remains committed to returning cash to shareholders. We repurchased 0.5 million ADP shares in the quarter for a total cost of $42 million because we did not repurchase shares for a period of time prior to the announcement of the Dealer Services spinoff. Our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders has not lessened as a result of the spinoff.","And I now turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question is from David Togut of Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","It looks like ADP had its best quarter in quite some time. If I look at all of the leading metrics combined between client retention, new sales in ES and PEO and pays per control growth in the U.S., and you also seemed to be on track for this transition to run for small business and Workforce Now for mid-market by year end '15. So my question is, putting all these factors together, are you setting the stage for meaningful acceleration in revenue growth in ES once we get beyond FY '14?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So I think that -- I think, first of all, the first part of your comments, I think, are correct. We -- when you look at all the key metrics of our business, we're pretty pleased with the performance in the quarter. We obviously had some noise around this tax credit business and a couple of other items. But when you really look at the key metrics around retention, sales and all the kind of leading indicators, they really are very positive. Having said that, in terms of acceleration of revenue growth, I will just remind -- and I think you know this well that in a recurring revenue model, our ability to accelerate is really driven by the size of our sales number, and when we're able to start from that sales number, we're then subtracting what we lost for the year. So this improvement in retention and the acceleration in sales certainly accelerates our revenue growth. But, person's definition of meaningful acceleration in one business model versus in ours might be different. So just put in perspective, if you look at all the components that drive our revenue growth over multiple years -- I think we've given you these charts before -- we have things like price increase, which is a small item around 1%; we have pays per control growth, which is between 0.5% and 1%; we'll have some other noise factors. But the real key metric is what we call net new business, which is the difference between sales\/starts and our losses. And we disclosed both of those numbers, so you can back into what our lost number is, and you can back into what our sales\/starts number is. And I think if you roll that sales number forward and apply a reasonable growth rate of, call it, 8% to 10%, which is what we've been guiding to over several years, then you assume that retention will improve slightly as it has been, which we're very happy with. You do see acceleration in revenue growth, but I just want to temper the, I guess, the expectations with the sense that, that math is very, very clear in terms of how it works. And what we've been doing for the last 3-or-so years is adding anywhere between $50 million to $100 million in incremental net new business. And so now, the difference between that start number and that loss number is somewhere around, let's just say, it's between $500 million and $600 million. Right now, it's hovering around $600 million. You assume a $10 billion business in Employer Services, post-Dealer spin, then that gives you a sense of what's been happening to our organic growth rate. So it's been accelerating by somewhere between 0.5% and 1% over the last 3 years. And I think if you roll through that math, I think it gives you some sense of the sensitivity around what we need to do in terms of sales results and loss results and retention in order to kind of maintain that momentum with accelerating revenue growth. I hope that helps because I think it should be a positive message that we have been accelerating revenue growth, we're bullish about continuing to do that based on what we're seeing around retention and sales, but I just want to make sure that we temper expectations.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That was very helpful. Just a quick follow-up on that point. Given your comment about rising client retention around the transition to RUN and Workforce Now and the message you had today on more innovation on the way, would you expect client retention to continue to increase over the next couple years and sort of bolster this gradual acceleration, if you will, in ES organic revenue growth?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I happen to take a look at a chart of our retention last night over the last 10 years. And you always have to have the caveat of the economy because, in our small business division in particular, it is -- the retention rate there is somewhat sensitive to economic changes. So I believe that during the last downturn, our retention rates decreased by about 1%, mostly driven by economic factors, by the economic cycle. And then those retention rates came back by roughly 1% -- 1%, 1.2%, but close enough. And then the last 2 or 3 years, we bounced around a little bit and now have had what appears to be 2 years of 10 to 20 basis point improvements. When you look at our historical retention rates and how high they are across all the individual businesses and collectively, I would not factor in more than those types of modest improvements in retention. Because, even though, as the clients have been migrated, we've shown very good improvements in retention rates on those clients, again, just the way the math works, in of itself isn't alone to generate a, call it, 50 basis points improvement in retention year-over-year. And some of that is just related to the fact that some of our businesses are more sensitive to economic conditions, as an example, and we can't change economic conditions. So we expect the retention improvements to continue to help in this growth rate and in our net new business. But I think prudence will dictate that we're very, very careful because these retention rates that we're at now are at record levels through multiple economic cycles, although, obviously, we're doing things through innovation, through migrations and other things to hopefully continue to strengthen that retention. So that is clearly our hope and our expectation, but I would not be modeling more than what I would consider to be modest improvements in retention rates.","Operator","The next question is from Smitti of Morgan Stanley.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Your SG&A looked very good this quarter, and looked like it actually declined sequentially and on an absolute basis. Does that have to do with this discontinued business that you sold off, or is there something else there?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, if you break down -- because we typically look at it in categories, so if you look at our sales expense, it was quite strong this quarter because of our good sales. But our sales results vary from quarter-to-quarter, where there's some seasonality in sales and sales results, and hence our sales expense will vary with that seasonality. If you look at our investments in R&D, as Jan mentioned, they were up about 10%. So that category was strong. So really, in our core, call it, overhead expenses, is I think where we have fairly good cost controls. But I think some of what you're seeing is really seasonality around sales expense and other factors. Because if you look at our expenses as a percent of revenue, they're pretty in line with what we've been trending at and we're happy with. So we're, to be clear, trying to get operating leverage on our business through a variety of ways, including the migrations of our clients, which hopefully eventually, will add operating leverage. We're adopting some continuous improvement initiatives to try to drive operating leverage as well. But our goal, I think, long term has been to grow our pretax operating earnings at a slightly faster rate, call it, 2 to 3 percentage points faster than our revenue growth, which I think reflects slower growth in an operating expense than in revenue. And that's, of course, holding all other things constant because the pressure that we've had from interest rate has made that difficult when you look at it at ADP's bottom line. But excluding the pressure from interest rates and other noise, that's really our objective. And I think the quarter is reflective of that.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And maybe just a quick follow-up regarding the 14% growth in new business bookings. Can you help us parse it out, the growth in upmarket versus down market?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So I think, as we mentioned in our opening comments, we had really good improvement sequentially in our -- in what we call our National Accounts biz, let's call it. Upmarket for us includes National Accounts but also include some of our multinational solutions that we consider in that bucket of MNC. But -- so the overall category has shown really good sequential improvement. But, unfortunately, as we've been very clear and transparent about, we had a very difficult first quarter on the heels of a blowout fourth quarter last fiscal year. And so we see improvement both in terms of units, in terms of dollars, against previous year and against plans. So on every metric, we see what we expected, which is a recovery as we rebuilt our pipelines and we resolved some of our execution issues in our upmarket business. Having said that, the reason we're being cautious is that -- I just mentioned that part of our problem in the first quarter was our blowout fourth quarter last year, particularly in National Accounts, that we're about -- we're now actually in the middle of the fourth quarter that now has to grow over that blowout fourth quarter. So we had a very, very difficult grow over, but on a normalized basis, we feel that we've recovered in our upmarket business and that the momentum is good. We mentioned in our comments that our Vantage sales were up over the previous year, and I think we're pleased with. We sold a number of Workforce Now deals in the low end of National Accounts, large increase over the previous year. That's a strong competitive offering against some competitors in the low end of our National Accounts business. So we think things are, I think, progressing as we expected and as we mentioned, which was a recovery that would take a couple of quarters as a result of rebuilding our pipelines and addressing our execution issues. But unfortunately, now we face this very difficult fourth quarter grow-over.","Operator","The next question is from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","You talked about how Dealer would be free to pursue their new strategies as a standalone company. How about core ADP? What new strategies might you be able to do now that -- once you're a separate company and just focused on employer-type services?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think that -- this was really not about changing ADP's strategy but about creating more focus on it. And so it really -- we don't really have any ulterior motives or any other secret weapons at our disposal, other than, obviously, we have now more financial flexibility post spinoff. But we -- our desire, I think, the board's view was that focusing my attention and my entire management team's attention on what we believe is a very large global opportunity in Human Capital Management was the appropriate thing to do. And by the way, they thought the same thing about Dealer because they have a very capable, very experienced team there that has the same views about the retail automotive market that we have about Human Capital Management. And so, I think, this is really about focus and about freeing up, I think, energy and attention of the 2 management teams. There really isn't any other -- we don't -- you shouldn't anticipate or expect a shift in direction here with the post-spin ADP. If anything, you're going to see a much more focused and, I think, determined competitor in the HCM world. Because this is -- ADP will be Employer Services, and we will be HCM.","James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And for my technical followup, PEO grew dramatically in the quarter, although it looks like you put on a lot of those employees late in the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about how that's panning out and if that had an impact on margins in the quarter, things like that?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It did have an impact on margins because the -- and I think the item you mentioned about the works [ph] employees coming on towards the end of the quarter, that happens every year, such a seasonal issue just because of what's called tax restarts and other factors in the PEO. So that a large number of the new starts, and sales of starts are actually equal to each other in the PEO business. That is very typical in that business. The margin impact on the business was as a result of the PEO having those strong sales results. Obviously, our commission expense and our sales expense increase when we have very strong sales results. And the sales results were, to say strong is an understatement in the quarter for the PEO. And, hence, our sales expense was quite strong as well or high, so that created a decrease in the PEO's margin versus the prior year, which obviously had some negative impacts on ADP's margins for the quarter as well overall. But we're happy with that. Just let me add, we love all of our businesses to have that much growth in sales because back to the very first question we got, it actually would accelerate this revenue growth.","Jan Siegmund","And just a friendly reminder, of course, the accelerated growth of the PEO has also growing at a good clip. Our pass-through revenues in the PEO that are part of this PO revenues and those on low-margin revenues that as a mechanical consequence, also, put margin pressure onto our overall ADP results.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","That's a great point. That's why, I think to Jan's point, we -- as you look at our 10-Q and you look at the comments we make to you, I think it's prudent to really look at the segment reporting as well as the overall ADP results for that very reason.","Operator","The next question is from Sara Gubins of Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you talk about how you're thinking about potential client migration for existing clients onto the Vantage platform? I know this hasn't been an area of focus, but I'm wondering if it might become more so?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So it's a great question because we were with 1,000 clients just a few weeks ago at our Meeting of the Minds event, and we had the same question from a number of clients. So we're doing 2 things to address that. One is we're increasing our investment to increase our capacity to be able to do migrations, and we've done a few already. But, clearly, in theory, we have probably demand for hundreds of those types of migration. So we're doing 2 things. One is investing in that capacity to make sure that we can do migrations at a pace that's responsive to our clients' needs or our clients' desires. And also to block competitors from trying to take business from us, which has been a very effective part of our migration strategy in the low end and in mid market. The second thing that we're doing besides adding capacity for migrations is we are making some, what I would call modest investments from a technology innovation standpoint on our existing enterprise platform, which we gave a preview of at ADP -- at the Meeting of the Minds gathering. That was extremely well received because, frankly, in the upmarket space, there are many clients who aren't necessarily -- there are some that are lining up to migrate, and there's many that aren't because transitions can be disruptive, expensive, et cetera, to their own business, and it may just not be one of their business priorities. So them seeing that we're willing to invest in the short to medium term in our enterprise platform to give them a lot of the same capabilities from a look and feel and experience standpoint that we're providing on Vantage, which is very, very well received. So we're, we're frankly excited about that, and we think that it -- I guess, to put it bluntly, buys us time to be able to execute on these migrations to Vantage over the next several years.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just as a follow-up, are you seeing any change in the pricing environment? And I'm wondering, when you lose clients to competitors, has pricing ever been given as the reason?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes. It definitely -- we track, obviously, our -- very carefully, where our clients go in terms of losses and then the reason codes, whether they're related to service or product issues in terms of feature functionality or price, et cetera. And again, we look at those numbers literally every month very, very carefully. And we really haven't seen other than right after the economic downturn -- so going into the economic downturn, was a very large increase in price reasons for clients terminating. And then once we came out of the economic downturn, that went down as a reason. And now it's been stable. We really don't see any major -- and part of this is probably just because of our size because it's a large sample. But there's really nothing exciting to report. We really don't -- and I don't know if Jan has anything to add, but it just doesn't seem like there's anything there in terms of changes.","Jan Siegmund","No. Carlos is exactly right. The mix of factors that clients indicate when they leave ADP has been stable, and also our discounting in new sales has been stable. So the pricing environment has been, overall, kind of stable for a number of quarters and a couple of years, I would even say. The net impact is that we are realizing about 1% of revenue growth for price increases on prices overall and new businesses coming in at bigger rates and really very stable pricing environment.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And part of our -- let me just add, a part of our approach around HCM is not necessarily to try to drive price at the individual payroll level, but it's really to add additional solutions that we think help our clients solve business problems and help them manage their people better, but also, frankly, create more revenue for us. So we gave you examples of, for example, as we migrate clients, and even as we sell new clients, the typical attach rates in terms of the number of modules that we sell is definitely higher than in our legacy client base. I think that helps us a lot from a \"pricing standpoint\" if you consider pricing to be unit based. But it's not really pricing, per se, and it's not a competitive issue in terms of making us uncompetitive because what we're doing is we're selling more things and more solutions and just getting higher dollars per client or per unit. So that's our preference from a pricing standpoint rather than trying to drive price increase, if you will.","Operator","And the next question is from Gary Bisbee of Royal Bank of Canada.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And I should say, congratulations on the decision to spin those -- the Dealer business. I guess, on that topic, can you give us an update within the Dealer business, what's the mix of the core DMS software offering versus digital marketing? And how should we think about what's been going on in terms of growth rates in those 2 parts of the business and how the profitability differs from one to the other?","Jan Siegmund","Yes. Gary, at this point in time, we're really not updating more and publicizing more detail about the revenue mix and growth rates. We leave that to the filing and then the roadshow as we prepare at Dealer Services. You're aware that Dealer Services has 3 components, or 2 components, really, of major businesses, that's the traditional dealer management systems business, that's the core Dealer Services. And we added, through the acquisition of Cobalt, a meaningful business to the Digital Marketing capabilities. Those are the 2 major businesses that one should think about Dealer Services. And you will see probably end of May, beginning of June, when we file, you will see the segment reporting.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And I think just to help a little bit, we -- I think there were some public comments or filings about the revenues of Cobalt at the time of the acquisition. I think if you apply a reasonable growth rate to those, you'll get close to what you're looking for in terms of the mix. But I think, as Jan said, we're obviously going to be providing a lot more detail.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","How about just sort of a higher-level commentary. When we try to think about the cash flow generation of the HR businesses relative to dealer capital spending levels or tax rate, but it's probably too early on that one. But can you give us just a high-level thought the business is similar, is one much better, one worse on capital efficiency, cash flow generation? Any other commentary, that would be great.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that those businesses are exceptional in terms of their profile around capital usage on a normal ongoing basis, if you will. So the only factor that would change that equation is really what I would call voluntary decisions about acquisitions. But if you look at the businesses in terms of their need for capital, they're very, very similar even though the Dealer Services business has some nuances in a couple of areas in terms of our international business having a little bit more licensing fees versus recurring revenues. But when you would put it all together, the businesses are very, very similar, which is why we held this business for so long and why it's been so good to us. It's -- we share a lot of DNA. This was not -- even though they're different industries and one is very focused on automotive retail and the other one is HCM, which is part of why we're making the separation, the separation is not because of the underlying dynamics or performance of either business because the Dealer business has been performing quite well. So to put it, I guess, in plain English, I think the cash flow generation capability of Dealer on a relative basis is almost the same as Employer Services: very low capital expenditure requirement; very good margin, which by the way is very similar to the ADP -- overall ADP margins. So if you start off with \"net income\" and you add back depreciation and amortization and you go through all the normal working capital changes, I know you're going to see, on a smaller scale obviously adjusted for size, a very, very similar picture in terms of cash flow generation capability. Then the decision comes down to, do you do other things like capital expenditures that can utilize, I think, capital, more or less. And again, over the years, we've had times where Dealer has been -- has made a number of acquisitions. There's other times where Employer Services have made a number of acquisitions. So that part is a little bit harder to pin down. But that's going to be up to the Dealer Services management team and their Board of Directors.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then the follow-up question, you talked an awful lot about the new platforms across RUN and Workforce Now and Vantage. You haven't talked a lot about changes in technology and platform within the PEO business. Obviously, that continues to be a terrific grower. But can you give us just sort of a high-level sense of how that's evolved over time, and if the offerings within the bundled solution there have changed a lot in recent years? And ultimately, I'm just trying to think through the continued competitiveness of that business?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Very good question that Jan asked me about a year ago about -- as we talked about modernizing and migrating and so forth, the PEO has really been using the same underlying platform for a while now. The difference with the PEO or perhaps why it may not be -- it's important, but why we are in a slightly different place is the co-employment model creates a much different level of touch point with the client in the sense that we're highly engaged in the clients' HR decisions. We're highly engaged in their benefits decisions, not just the technology, but in the decisions themselves. We actually provide them the insurance products around workers' compensation and healthcare. So it's just a much broader, bigger relationship. Having said all that, the employees of the clients in the PEO, which are now, obviously, over 300,000, have the same desire to have the same experience they had with their online banking. We mentioned that in our opening comments that the consumer experience at the employee level is still important and even at the practitioner level. So in response to that, even though we haven't change the fundamental underlying platform itself, we have made some fairly significant improvements and investments in the user experience, both at the employee level -- worksite employee level and at the practitioner level. And we saw a demo of that in one of my staff meetings just a few months ago, and it was quite impressive. And particularly around items related to healthcare reform and ACA, they're probably on a leading edge of providing tools to both the clients and to the employees to deal with kind of the new regulations and to actually comply with those regulations.","Operator","The next question is from David Grossman of Stifel Financial.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Carlos, if you look back over time, that AAA rating has been an important element, maybe important is an overstatement, but an element of ADP's branding. And I assume there were both advantages and constraints imposed on your business as a result of that. Can you help us better understand what the tradeoff, if any, as you move forward, as you think about the change in rating in terms of both positive and negative that may be an outcome of that?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I'll give you a couple of thoughts there, and I'll let Jan take a crack at it because he's done a very effective job in communicating with our external constituents about that topic, so he's given a lot of thought and talked to a lot of people about it as well. But to be clear, and I think Jan has made this clear as well, we were obviously -- we were aware that we were going to have a potential change in our rating as a result of what we consider to be a strategic decision. Over the years, we have come across other strategic opportunities, for example, whether they be acquisitions that -- and we've never looked at large multi-year dilutive acquisitions. But when you look at a larger acquisition, even if it's in the HCM space, if it requires taking on a modest amount of debt, that would've also led to a change in rating. So we've had those discussions over the course of several years and always came to the conclusion, and the board, I think, recommended that we not discard our credit rating for the sake of discarding it because we were proud of it, and we enjoyed the publicity, if you will, of being 1 of 4 AAA-rated companies. Having said that, the board and my predecessor and his predecessor were always very clear with you and with everyone that for the right strategic transaction, we didn't believe that it was worth not doing a strategic transaction in order to preserve AAA rating because it was largely a source of pride and not a source of financial advantage. So those there's no change in our -- we obviously don't have any debt, so it doesn't change our borrowing costs. And even if we do borrow at some point in the future, at least today, the debt cost of between AAA and AA is nonexistent. And so when you look at the full picture together, it was not a decision that we took lightly. It was a decision that we obviously thought about a lot, spoke with the board about, Jan and I spent a lot of time discussing, but this was the right thing to do because we think it's the right thing to do long term for ADP and for Dealer Services. And at least so far, our expectation has been proven out, which is that we're managing really a public relations issue rather than a financial or real issue because it has no impact on our business when you really get down to it other than potentially a positive impact of creating more financial flexibility for us down the road. So Jan, I don't know if you have any...","Jan Siegmund","I think you covered really the vast majority of it. After the spin, we did survey, of course, our sales force and inquired about the potential client reaction, the impact, and there was none. So really, even the public relations impact from being \"downgraded\" was nonexistent from what our sales force experienced. So I think, overall, the outcome for ADP is a better place, more financial flexibility for us strategically in the future and our business model being intact. But for all the things that we need to do relative to the client fund and Money Movement operations where credit rating does play a role and the AA is perfectly wonderful rating for that is we monetized our opportunities here I think in a good way.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And I think you also -- well, you should hear that -- as you have seen that our commitment to our fortress balance sheet has not changed. And so even though we have more financial flexibility going forward, part of what we represent in terms of our industry is really we're still highly differentiated in terms of our ability to move more than $1.4 trillion through our Money Movement systems. The importance of credibility, the importance of the relationships we have with tax agencies and with the IRS, these are all very, very important things to us that we're never going to compromise on. So the credit rating is one thing, but I think our commitment to our financial principles and how we run our company in order to be able to make good on all these commitments to both our clients and also to all the agencies that we work with has obviously not changed. And again, competitively, if I were one of our competitors, this would not be one of the items I would focus on in the sales call because, obviously, we would -- we welcome those discussions either in a AAA or a AA any day.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Understood. And I know that this has come up in a couple of other questions, but the PEO obviously saw significant growth in both revenue and worksite employees. And you've talked about the Affordable Care Act in the past and that potential impact on the business and weren't quite sure how that would exactly play out. But do you have any better insight into what are some of the specific drivers right now that are creating some acceleration in growth in that business?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","The PEO really acts as a -- and always has, so this is nothing different, acts as a large employer for the purposes of healthcare and workers' compensation, and that's part of the value proposition is that you create scale in purchasing, in distribution, in administration of a lot of services. So not just HR services and benefits administration payroll but also on the products themselves, the healthcare and the workers' compensation. So that has been the formula since ADP has been in the PEO business. So that has not changed. Acting as a large employer of providing healthcare benefits to what are really client employees, if you will, at a sub-level, we have thousands of clients, obviously, that are part of our PEO business, creates an advantage, if you will, from a purchasing standpoint because our cost of healthcare we're purchasing on a large scale. And as a large employer, these are the small businesses we're having to purchase individual small business policies. So there has always been some theoretical advantage because there's also other drivers that drive cost of healthcare like your experience. Like do you have high losses, do you have low losses, the demographics of the age and makeup of the workforce. So there are lots of other factors that drive the cost of healthcare as well. But this issue around buying either as a large employer or a small employer has always been a factor, but it's been magnified by healthcare reform as new regulations and new rules have been imposed and new price controls have been imposed on small business policies and small business pricing. So that's really where some of the competitive differentiation for the PEO, I think, has come from, where it has improved. But again, we're very proud and we're very happy with the acceleration. And there's no question it's an acceleration. But I just want to point out that this business has been performing well for a decade and has had double-digit worksite employee growth in the past as a result of the same factors that we're talking about today. But clearly, they've been amplified as a result of healthcare reform.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I see. And perhaps if I could just get one more in. You brought up this -- the idea that you were working on expanding capacity for conversions. Could you just, perhaps, elaborate on how that impacts the competitive dynamic in retention? I think you mentioned that. I was just hoping to clarify that quickly.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think I was speaking really about the upmarket space, and I think it was in reaction to a question about we're making progress on low end, on the mid market, and I think someone was asking about what about the upmarket since we were not talking about that a lot. And so as a reaction really to the question about the upmarket, we have very large investments in our upmarket migrations already as we've been for several years moving clients from one version of enterprise to our latest version of enterprise. And I was really only alluding to the fact that we, as a result of demand, that we've heard from clients, both at Meeting of Minds but otherwise, that we feel we need to expand that capacity to be able to migrate clients not just to new versions of enterprise but also to Vantage. So wish I had more detail to report on that, but there's really -- I don't think you should expect any -- this was not intended as a major announcement competitively. This was about just kind of moderate, modest increases that are already significant capacity to National Accounts to migrate clients, and we can also migrate some Vantage clients as well.","Operator","And the next question is from George Mihalos of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Carlos, you mentioned an opportunity to upsell or cross-sell clients as you convert them to the newer platforms and sort of increase the revenue per client. Is there a way we can sort of think about that across the different segments? Is it x number of modules that you generally have on the legacy platform and now with the transition it's increased by 2 or 3 modules or maybe a 3% or 4% or 5% increase in revenue per client. Any sort of color you can provide there?","Jan Siegmund","Yes, I'll answer this. The newest example we can give is for our mid-market migrations that clients migrating onto Workforce Now platform. And I think I talked about in prior calls about it. We have seen really 2 sources of improvements. Number one is clients buying in the process of converting and clients staying longer is the second source of improvement of lifetime value of the client, if you like. And the numbers have been now fairly stable over the last few quarters. So I think I can be pretty, pretty precise with you. Where about 30% of clients that convert buy additional modules, about 1\/3 of the clients, so to speak. And it happens within the timeframe of the migration plus\/minus a couple of months or so. And when they do so, the overall revenue base of our migrated clients is about 15% higher than it was before. And clients have several percentage points of retention improvement compared to the old platform that they were on, which is lower than the average of our clients. So you see really driving about 15% more revenue, 30% of the clients choose and -- retention improving.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Is it safe to assume that the impact from RUN is somewhat lower than that?","Jan Siegmund","Yes, it is because the most important loss driver for RUN is still downmarket, out of business and economic, general economic reasons. So you'll see, in retention, we have not seen -- we have seen retention improving in SBS gradually, and certainly RUN is contributing to that, but it's not as pronounced as we have seen it in the mid market. And we have a fairly stable mix of HR components that we cross-sell into the businesses. And I would more describe it that we had that for a while. You could buy EasyPay off a legacy platform in -- with richer HR bundles before, and you can do that on RUN, too. And I believe we have a mix of clients that is already optimally penetrated, so to speak, because not all clients need really more comprehensive HR solutions. If you're a 1- or 2-person company, you may not want to choose for that. So the mix and the downmarket, we feel, is already very good. So we didn't see missed upsell opportunities, so to speak. So we think of the RUN conversion is more revenue neutral.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just last question. You guys spoke about some more flexibility on the financial side post the Dealer spin. Does that change your attitude towards employing debt on the balance sheet? And does that change at all your thoughts around the pace of M&A or the size of potential M&A transactions?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I don't -- I think, again, given the discussions we've had with our board over the last several years, I think the answer to that has to be no because we've never felt constrained. But it is -- it's also not fair to say that it's a nonissue or nonevent because it was a distraction. So we had the AAA, if you will, monkey on our back, although we were very happy to have it, but it was a monkey on our back. And it was something that came up as a result of discussions around strategic transactions, be they slightly larger acquisitions that required employing [ph] a little bit of debt or just employing debt as a way of optimizing the capital structure of the company. So it's just not -- again, I'm obviously in those discussions, and it's just not -- it's never been a constraint. If we felt that there was something like we just did with Dealer Services that would add value long term to ADP, the board was always willing to do it. Having said all that, I think it's -- the reason I say more financial flexibility is, I don't know if it's a 5% or 10% increase in flexibility, but there's some improvement in flexibility because there's really going to not be that obstacle, if you will, of that monkey being on our back anymore.","Operator","And the next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Ryan Cary - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. Hate to beat a dead horse on the PEO growth but, obviously, it's accelerated the past 4 quarters. Just want to be clear, are you actually taking share, or is something really happening to the market that's just increasing the overall size of the pie?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","That industry is very difficult to get good, reliable data on because there are only -- I think now, there are a couple of public companies. There used to be only one. But it is difficult. There is an association that provides some data. I think based on what we see from the industry association and based on other information that we have, we believe we're gaining market share.","Ryan Cary - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And just quickly, I know we're running over here a little bit. I don't believe you have any exposure to Russia and Ukraine. I just wanted to doublecheck on that. And I'd also love just a little more commentary on Europe and the climate. I know it's been a drag the last couple of quarters. I believe it improved modestly this quarter, but just kind of your thoughts on the outlook.","Jan Siegmund","Yes, so we have no exposure to Russia and the Ukraine. And the European business environment has been more difficult for us compared to the U.S. Just a reminder, there is still revenue growth in Europe, it's just below the average of ADP's growth. So we have seen an ever-so-slight improvement in the pays per control metric quarter-over-quarter. And a couple of countries, and those are the countries that you hear in the press, are improving. We see that the same way. The Germany and U.K., and we're having a good year in -- better year in France. So we see slight improvements, but the pays per control are still declining. So it is a relative easing of the pressure that we see. We had -- we continue to enjoy good retention rates in this market. And so it is just that slow-growth environment. I would -- we anticipated the question around the international economic environment, and it's really just a gradual, ever-so-slight improvement that we wanted to communicate. I don't think it's a great change [indiscernible] change that we are seeing at this point in time.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew O'Neill of CLSA.","Matthew O'Neill - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I had a quick question, following up, I know we've talked a lot about retention this morning. I was curious, do you guys just look at retention or think about retention as having a theoretical maximum that's actually below 100%, which you sort of discussed this morning being attributable to the economy here, to the business consolidations or things like that, as far as a target that you work for or just getting your clients at 100% satisfaction and then what is unfortunately lost that's completely out of your control? Just wondering if you could discuss that.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Sure. The -- and we'll prepare for the next time to have more detail around actual numbers. But clearly, given everything we've said, the theoretical maximum is not 100%. So I'll use an example of this. In the downmarket, I think Jan alluded to it, in the low end, approximately half of our losses are really related to companies just going out of business. So you've seen all the stories and the publications about how the amount of turnover in small businesses is quite high, which is just part of the way America works. People start businesses and many of them fail and many of them are successful. And so there's a good close to 10 percentage points of losses in that low end -- between 8 and 10 percentage points of losses that are, what we call, uncontrollable, where either bankruptcy or they just stopped processing because they go out of business, they just close down. Some of these are not even formal bankruptcies because they're just sole proprietorships and they just stop doing whatever services they are doing. So that alone, the SBS theoretical maximum being somewhere in the low-90s at best, obviously, factors into ADP's overall ability to achieve 100%, and that, obviously, brings it down to somewhere lower than 100%. I don't know if it's 97% or 98%, but we'll do the math and get that for you. And then in the mid market, you have the same phenomenon, but in a much smaller scale, obviously. There are some number of companies in mid market that are uncontrollable losses, bankruptcy, out of business. But it's a smaller number because their business clients are between 50 and 1,000 employees. And the level of failure rate in that segment of the market is much, much lower than in the low end of the market. And you get into National Accounts, and there you have, obviously, almost no failures, but you still have things that we consider to be somewhat uncontrollable like, for example, a consolidation, so a large National Account client buys another National Account client. If that client that's the acquirer happens to be an ADP client, it's a happy day for us because we get a new client as a result of the acquisition. If it's not an ADP client, then we have to go into a sales cycle. We have to go convince the acquirer to give us both combined companies rather than just the company that's being acquired. And so we'll get more detail, more color for you. But clearly, the theoretical maximum is not 100%, and it varies between 8 to 10 percentage points of uncontrollable losses in Small Business to probably somewhere between 0% and 3% in our National Accounts business, and then mid market is obviously somewhere in between. But having said all that, it's very clear to us, as we see -- we look at this data very, very carefully, but without having done the math specifically for you, we have a lot of room to improve retention still that's controllable for us. The reason that we're cautious and careful about expectations is you have to do a lot as you have to improve your products that they be easier to use, you have to have better service, you have to be competitive on price. A lot of factors that go into driving that number up, and it's not one simple lever that also is going to generate another 100 basis point improvement in retention. The reason we say that with confidence is that we have, unfortunately, years and years of history that tells us to be careful and cautious about from here, today, how much room we have in terms of additional improvement in retention. But believe me, we're driving towards that. We're happy with the quarter. We're happy with the year. And we hope to keep getting it because it helps a lot with our growth rate.","Operator","The next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just I guess I wanted to ask on the -- maybe I'll start with the SaaS payroll question. A couple of new companies have come public. I know there's a lot of PEO questions, but just on SaaS, given how those stocks are trading, I'm curious if that changes your appetite to acquire similar players or similar technologies.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We're pretty happy with our own technologies, as you probably could tell, on our new -- certainly, on our new platforms. So no, it doesn't. I mean, we're -- again, we're always open to using our capital for the best interest of our shareholders, including acquisitions. But we don't feel -- we don't have a compelling need right now to buy technology or to buy platforms. We have a compelling need to accelerate our migrations and to sell more of what we already have.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I figured that was the case, just wanted to make sure, Carlos. And then just beyond -- I just want to clarify on the guidance, you muted the high end of the revenue range but to the midpoint of EPS. Is the difference just the discontinued operations, or is it also the slower buyback and the rate outlook change?","Jan Siegmund","No, the guidance does not contemplate the buybacks, the incremental buybacks above revenue dilution. And the guidance also excludes the disc ops as well as the onetime cost that we anticipate in the fourth quarter for the Dealer spin. So this is really the true continued operations number that we guide towards.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. So it's just -- you're just a little bit firmer, I guess, just on earnings...","Jan Siegmund","That's the rest of the year, and we have really only 1 quarter left. We felt it was -- versus the true disclosure, I narrowed our guidance to what we see, and that will be appropriate to help you guys a little bit.","Operator","The next question is from Mark Marcon of Robert W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was wondering if you could discuss a little bit more about what was truly exciting at the Meeting of the Minds conference in terms of future functionality with regards to the improvements in Vantage, and how quickly will those be available broadly?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We just recently had a recent release of Vantage that I think adds some great enhancement done [ph] up from a feature functionality standpoint. But the really exciting part at Meeting of the Minds was sharing the new user experience, which the ADP Innovation Labs folks that we now have working out of New York City, obviously, have made -- and also here in Roseland, New Jersey, have obviously contributed to that. And we did -- which is again different for us. We did an on-stage demo that Mike Capone and Mark Benjamin did for all of the clients and some prospects of what that new user experience was going to be. And as we mentioned in our comments, it's going to be available in the early fall. And that really was probably the most exciting part of the meeting because it showed not only our commitment to usability and user experience both at the practitioner level but also at the employee level because now we have more employees of our clients touching our products than we have clients and practitioners just because of the nature of how our business has changed. And so I think the clients and prospects see that as a huge positive because if we leave them the administrative work, people can easily and intuitively handle all of their HR administrative needs and, by the way, do some things that help them in terms of managing their own work life. For example, in the demo, it showed how someone can go through an open enrollment to choose their benefits and how, because we have payroll information and time information because we have the entire HCM platform, how on a single screen on one dashboard, the employee can see how a change in the healthcare choices affects their take-home pay, affects their taxes, affects all other aspects of their work life, if you will. And so I personally thought that, that was the most exciting moment and where I think we got the most buzz is when people saw that we're really committed to this technology innovation from a user experience standpoint because I believe that from a feature functionality standpoint that we already are pretty robust in terms of being able to deliver solutions around tax compliance and all the regulatory challenges that our clients experience. And we've been doing that for a very, very long time.","Jan Siegmund","I add one component to it that the user experience now includes also the leverage of our data. So not only the scope of the products that we are able to integrate into the user experience but also the size and number of companies that we can include and offer now a benchmark and advice to either employees or managers on how to make their decisions. So we're really leveraging our data analytics in a very practical and intuitive way to the benefit of the employees. So kind of trying to build really what we have been talking for the last couple of years, sources of data, our social capabilities, the source that we have so many employees on our platforms and translating it into very tangible values that you experience when you are on our platform.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It's a brighter visual since Jan only gets more excited about it. As I remember the moment, not only do -- does the employee see the impact on the change on their paycheck right away and can do what ifs, if you will, on the screen. But to Jan's point, as they're choosing the different healthcare plans, our data actually will recommend to them or will tell them, in fact, using social and using Amazon-like ratings, if you will, they will say, the majority of the employees in your situation at your pay level, with your number of dependents, pick this health plan. There are these other 2 or 3 choices, but this is the one that is most often chosen and, by the way, here are the ratings from other employees of multiple companies of these different healthcare plans. So it's very, very powerful, I think, use of data and analytics.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That sounds like a very material improvement. As we think about just the fourth quarter new sales and you have this big grow over target, is there a possibility that some clients will hold off on making any decisions and just wait until this is broadly available?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We -- that's really not our intention. And it's not what our -- what has been our historical experience. So our salespeople, we've obviously been through this before where we have new products roll out, and we have enhancements to our products, so in our large account business, these cycles are very long sales cycles. And so people typically don't stop making decisions or don't start making decisions because of specific product feature functionality or technology available. And it's not been, I think, our prior experience. So we're not -- we didn't see that in this quarter. Obviously, our sales were very strong. And we don't expect that to be the case because we have, I think, obviously, incentives in place, both for our sales folks but also for our clients because we want to get, obviously, them contracted as soon as possible. And when we implement them or when we start them, I mean, we, today, for example, would be happy to sell a National Account client for a fall implementation or even a January 1 implementation because that sale cycle takes that long. So frankly, given the timing of the announcement, I don't think it has any impact on our sales in terms of slowing our sales. That wasn't the intention. It was intended to actually accelerate our sales.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then with regards to the -- to Wati [ph], how much was that impact?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, the Wati [ph] impact is, I think it's a little, I would say, maybe half a basis -- 50 basis points or so, roughly.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","50 bps. Okay. Great. And then with regards to just the gaining share in the PEO side, what's the primary driver do you think that's driving the share gains?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I mean, frankly, based on the data that I see, excluding acquisitions, we've been gaining market share for 10 years.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I know. I'm one of the few people who follow that other competitor. But what do you think is driving it in an accelerating rate right now?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","All right, just to be clear, I'm not picking on one competitor because I wasn't referring to any one competitor. I'm talking about the entire -- because I look at the entire industry. There are plenty of other competitors, and there's a lot of acquisition activity and a lot of available data, even though most of them are private. And my comment was, I think, was across-the-board, not any specific competitor. But I wish I could tell you more other than, clearly, they're getting some help from the concern people have around ACA and healthcare reform. But also, again, my personal view is that the business is executing really well. I mean, they've done some really great and innovative things even on the sales side over the last 2 or 3 years. So again, unrelated necessarily to ACA and to healthcare reform, but just around the value proposition and how we sell and also how we get and generate leads from our partners in major accounts and in SBS. So I think we've had great sales leadership there for several years and I think great general management leadership, where these investments that they've made in the user experience and in technology without, again, changing the underlying platform, but I think the presentation of the experience to the employees and the clients has been enhanced significantly. And then there's been some good old-fashioned improvement, if you will, from a continuous improvement standpoint in just processes in terms how open enrollment is conducted, how new businesses -- how new clients are implemented. So I think they've just had great execution, and I think they have some help now from the market in terms of healthcare reform.","Operator","And the next question is from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets.","Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets Canada","This is actually Henry Chien calling on behalf of Jeff. Just a quick one from me. About margin guidance for ES, just want to doublecheck that nothing has changed. Does it continue to be driven by sales productivity in the migration clients?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I'm sorry, can you repeat that again? The margin question on ES was...","Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets Canada","In terms of your guidance for margin expansion to ES?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","No, I think if you see our -- I believe we included in the press release that our guidance is consistent with our prior guidance, if I'm not mistaken. So I'm just reading through...","Elena Charles","Yes, I think you were thinking that it was due to the migrations and sales efficiencies. There's also a lot of operating efficiencies going on. I wouldn't attribute it to migrations at this point.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So again, to be clear, our guidance, I think, what we stated in the press release, which was consistent from our guidance -- consistent with our guidance for the entire year is a pretax margin expansion of about 100 basis points. And so that would include both the negative impact of migration and sales costs but also positives of what Elena was referring to, as we're obviously doing a lot of things to try to get more efficient and better at what we do.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, thanks very much for joining us today. As you can tell, we're very pleased with our results for the quarter. You can also tell that we're obviously still very committed to our shareholder-friendly actions around dividends and share buybacks, notwithstanding the delay in buybacks as a result of the waiting for the announcement for Dealer Services.","Over the next couple months, we're obviously going to be working very diligently, and there's a lot of people putting a lot of effort, a lot of hard work to getting the spinoff of Dealer Services completed, and we're going to update you along the way about our progress. I hope you share my enthusiasm for Dealer's feature, as well as ADP's future, given that the transaction is going to free Dealer to focus on their own industry while, obviously, highlighting our commitment to being the global leader in human capital management. I think that the transaction is going to position both companies for great future and strong growth.","And again, we thank you for joining us this quarter. We look forward to seeing you -- talking to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to ADP's Fiscal 2015 Earnings Webcast. I'd like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Sara Grilliot, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sara Grilliot - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This a Sara Grilliot, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations, and I am here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our fiscal 2015 earnings call and webcast.","Carlos will begin today's call with some opening remarks and then Jan will take you through the fiscal 2015 financial results and our outlook for fiscal 2016. We will then take your questions. I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risks. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","With that, I will turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Sara. Good morning everyone. This morning, we reported fourth quarter and full fiscal 2015 results with revenue up 5% and 7%, respectively, despite continued pressure from foreign currency translation. Even more gratifying is our exceptionally strong performance on new business bookings, which grew considerably better than our expectations to 18% for the quarter and 13% for the year. Our strategy to drive sustainable growth at ADP is working, the result of which is strength across all three of our strategic pillars.","In particular, ADP Health Compliance product line has been particularly well received in the market, significantly outpacing our internal expectations. We have brought our technology and expertise together in a way that meets an acute client need at a time when businesses are racing to ensure compliance with the Affordable Care Act.","Our success here has resulted in higher than anticipated selling expenses ahead of related revenue and that has put significant but short-term pressure on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015 margins and earnings. In order to transition this strong performance in new business bookings to recurring revenue, we are making additional investments in operational resources that will begin in the first half of fiscal 2016 and remain throughout the year. These investments are not expected to contribute meaningfully to recurring revenue until the second half of the fiscal year.","Jan will further explain our expectations for fiscal 2016 later in the call. But before he does, let me give you other examples of how execution against our three strategic pillars is driving ADP's recent growth and future opportunities.","As we have told you, we are all-in on HCM. Overall, it was a successful quarter and year for ADP, as we continued to grow our complete suite of cloud-based HCM solutions, delivering customer solutions that work together seamlessly. This past quarter, we introduced a number of enhancements across our major platforms.","With RUN, we updated the entire user experience to simplify interaction with the platform for small business owners. We expanded the capabilities of Workforce Now, our HCM solution for midsized businesses, to include career and job portals as well as a consumer grade experience for employee benefit enrollment. And we delivered a new user experience for Vantage clients as well, which promise to be even more intuitive, engaging and contextual. And for certain clients on our strategic platforms, we were especially excited to introduce ADP DataCloud, which leverages ADP's unparalleled data and insight to deliver workforce analytics that can help boost productivity, help develop talent, increase retention and identify potential flight risks. About 1,000 ADP clients are already taking advantage of these analytical capabilities.","Not only have we been busy on the technology front, but we have also been busy building partners through the ADP Marketplace. We're excited to have about 60 partners providing solutions through our secure application programming interfaces, or APIs, and there are another 200 that have expressed interest in partnering with us. This is an exciting development for us. We are attracting established leaders like Concur and Cornerstone OnDemand, as well as exciting emerging technologies, such as OnePage, which provides clients an innovative platform for engaging passive job seekers. The ADP Marketplace is a great example of ADP taking a client-centric, outside-in view of enhancing our HCM capabilities and creating best-in-class solutions for our clients.","In fiscal 2015, we also continued to make progress in growing and scaling our market-leading HR BPO solutions by innovating our product offering and improving the experience for our clients and their employees. Helping our clients achieve success is at the core of what we do, so it's critical that we understand the business issues they're facing in the markets they serve. We recently hosted an Insights 2 Innovation forum for a number of our clients to help us look around the corner. These client insights provide a framework to enhance our innovation efforts to ensure we are consistently advancing our solutions to address their needs and help their businesses thrive.","To this point, in May we introduced a new program for ADP TotalSource focused on health, wealth, life and work, aiming to provide worksite employees with a suite of benefits and tools designed to support employee growth and development. Increasingly, employees are interested in tools and services to optimize productivity and wellness across the entirety of their lives, both at work and at home. We are continuously looking at ways to improve the health of worksite employees by offering new benefit solutions and partnering with clients to implement wellness programs.","We also continue to expand into new markets and grow globally with our clients. In the 104 countries that we now serve, we remain focused on broadening our service capabilities to ensure we are delivering consistent, scalable and valuable services. In fact, the Everest Group recently recognized ADP for the geographic scope, scalability and global expertise of our payroll offerings.","The success we've achieved requires that ADP continues to attract and keep great talent. We take great pride in creating an environment that attracts great people and I'm honored by some of the recent awards we've received recognizing ADP as an innovative company and a great place to work. Specifically, InformationWeek recently named ADP to their list of top business technology innovators and Computerworld listed ADP as a Top Place to Work in IT. And we are also pleased to have ranked number 20 on the 2015 DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity.","ADP is the only HCM company that serves clients across the globe, across the full HCM spectrum and across the full range of client sizes. We focus on our clients' biggest investment, challenge and opportunity: their people. And we have the resources, scale and expertise to meet the market needs. Our clients are responding. We now have 500,000 clients in the cloud, more than 5 million people are using our mobile app and client revenue retention remains at record levels.","In closing, fiscal 2015 was a successful year for ADP. We sharpened our focus on the HCM market through the spin-off of CDK Global. We expanded our suite of HCM solutions and our global presence and delivered solid revenue growth in spite of pressure from foreign currency translation. Consistent with our commitment to shareholder-friendly actions, we returned $2.5 billion in cash through dividends and share repurchases and during fiscal 2015 reached a milestone of 40 years of consecutive dividend increases.","As I look forward into fiscal 2016 and the opportunity we have to assist our clients with growing regulatory compliance associated with the Affordable Care Act, I'm excited about the challenge ahead. The success of our HCM solutions highlights the strength of our direct sales force and our history of assisting clients with navigating the challenges of ever-increasing regulatory complexity. Combine this with ADP's historical strength of expanding client relationships, and this is a challenge I would love to have every year. The higher selling expense we incurred in the fourth quarter is behind us.","To deliver on these commitments to clients, we will invest further in the first half of the fiscal year to convert these new sales to recurring revenues. We believe these investments will reward us with profitable revenue growth and even deeper client relationships over the longer term. I am confident that as we successfully execute against our strategy, we will continue to drive results for our clients, our associates and our shareholders.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jan to further review our fiscal 2015 financials and a discussion of our fiscal 2016 outlook.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you very much, Carlos. And good morning, everyone. As Carlos mentioned, fiscal year 2015 was a successful year for ADP. Revenues grew 7% to $10.9 billion for the year. This growth includes a negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points from the effects of foreign currency translation. Pre-tax earnings grew 10%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 1 percentage point from the effects of foreign currency translation. ADP's consolidated pre-tax margin improved by 60 points for the year. This included a drag of about 20 basis points from the slower growth of our high margin client funds interest revenues as these highly profitable revenues grew at a slower rate than overall revenues.","Diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $2.89 on a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. This growth included a negative impact of about $0.04 from the effects of foreign currency translation. And as Carlos mentioned, our new business bookings for the year exceeded our expectations, finishing at 18% growth for the quarter and 13% for the year compared with our April 30 forecast of about 10%. This outperformance resulted in higher selling expense than ADP anticipated and caused pre-tax margins and earnings results to come lower than our own prior expectations.","Overall, I'm pleased with ADP's solid performance, which yielded good growth despite the impacts from foreign currency translation and continued low interest rate environment, which puts pressure on the growth of ADP's high margin client fund interest revenues. I'm also pleased that we continued our shareholder-friendly actions, returning approximately $2.5 billion to shareholders during fiscal year 2015 through dividends and share repurchases.","So now for a discussion of our segments results. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 5% for the year and were negatively impacted by 2 percentage points from foreign currency translation. This revenue growth was driven primarily by additions of new recurring revenues across all of our HCM markets we serve. For the fiscal year, client revenue retention remains at a record high level of 91.4%. You have may noticed in this morning's press release that the fourth quarter -","that in the fourth quarter our revenue retention rate declined by approximately 30 basis points. And as we told you last quarter, we do experience variability in this metric from quarter to quarter and we continue to pay close attention to retention across all our areas of our business.","We are also pleased that same store pays per control in the U.S. remain strong with an increase of 3% for the year. Average client fund balances grew 5% compared with a year ago, including a negative impact of about 1% from foreign currency translation on balances held outside the U.S. The primary drivers of the client fund balance growth were additions from net new business and pays per control, moderated by decreased balances from lower state unemployment tax rates compared with the prior year as employment levels in the U.S. continue to improve. We remain pleased with the overall performance of our international business, which continues to see healthy growth from sales of our multinational solutions.","In Europe, the economic situation remains challenging and while we have seen growth in sales from our in-country solutions that are above Europe's overall GDP rate, the growth had been slower than our overall growth. Pre-tax margins in Employer Services \u2013 pre-tax margin in Employer Services was 70 basis points for the year, primarily from scale and productivity and reflects pressure from additional selling expense related to the fourth quarter outperformance in our new business bookings.","I'm very pleased with the performance of the PEO in fiscal year 2015. The business posted 17% revenue growth with average worksite employee growth of 14% for this year. And along with this growth, the PEO delivered exceptionally strong margin expansion through sales productivity and operating efficiencies, expanding margins by approximately 110 basis points for the year.","Before I take you through our fiscal 2016 outlook, I would like to point out that our client funds investment strategy had a positive year-over-year impact to our fiscal year 2015 revenue and pre-tax earnings for the first time since 2008. The benefit was slight, contributing about $7 million, driven by a balance growth that was offset by slightly lower average yield on the portfolio. However, we are pleased to have turned the corner in fiscal year 2015 after years of earnings pressure resulting from the continued low interest rate environment.","So now, I will take you through our updated fiscal 2016 outlook, which excludes the results of a discontinued operations from a small non-HCM related business we sold at the end of the fiscal year.","For fiscal year 2016, we are anticipating new business bookings growth of 8% to 10%. We expect this growth to be balanced across our three strategic pillars, with continued favorable performance from the sale of our ADP Health Compliance products. We anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the year, including an anticipated negative impact of 1 percentage point to 2 percentage points from unfavorable foreign currency translation. This forecast assumes 5% to 6% revenue growth in the Employer Services segment, including an anticipated drag of approximately 2 percentage points from foreign currency translation and growth in pays per control of 2% to 3%.","Revenue growth for the PEO is expected to be 15% to 17%. ADP's pre-tax margin is expected to expand about 50 basis points from 18.9% in fiscal year 2015. This forecast of pre-tax margin expansion is at the low-end of our goal of 50 basis points to 75 basis points of pre-tax margin expansion over the longer term.","We're still committed to this goal but we believe the opportunity to assist our clients with ACA compliance will contribute to ADP's strategy of driving higher penetration of our HCM product suite as well as continue revenue growth and profitability. So while we do not expect to achieve more than 50 basis points of pre-tax margin expansion in fiscal year 2016, we believe that the fiscal year 2016 investments we are making will contribute to ADP's growth and achievement of our longer term goals.","On a segment level, we anticipate pre-tax margin expansion of about 100 basis points for Employer Services and about 50 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO.","Diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 12% to 14% compared with $2.89 in fiscal year 2015, and includes an anticipated negative impact of about 1 percentage points from unfavorable foreign currency translation. This forecast does not contemplate further share buybacks beyond anticipated dilution related to employee benefit plans. Although as communicated at our March 3 Investor Conference, it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders, depending on market conditions. Our earnings per share forecast assumes an effective tax rate of 33.7%, compared with the 33.5% in fiscal year 2015.","Before I move to the forecast for the client funds extended investment strategy, I want to make a few comments about our expected quarterly growth rates for fiscal year 2016. As mentioned in this morning's press release, we expect that revenue growth in the first and second quarters of the fiscal year will be below our forecasted range of 7% to 9% for the year and above the forecasted range of 7% to 9% for the third and fourth quarters in that fiscal year.","This is due to two factors. First, we anticipate that the first and second quarters of the year will experience continued negative pressure from foreign currency translation until we anniversary the strengthening of the U.S. dollar that occurred during fiscal year 2015, assuming no material changes to current foreign exchange rate. Second, as Carlos mentioned, new business bookings sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 will take time to implement and, therefore, anticipate that the most of the incremental revenue from these solutions will not impact recurring revenue until the third fiscal quarter.","Because of the investment in operational resources to support these implementations and the anticipated lower revenue growth in the first half of the year, our quarterly earnings forecast assumes flat to slightly positive pre-tax earnings growth in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2016. As we have mentioned, we believe this investment will yield growth and longer term benefits to ADP, as well as deeper client relationships.","So with that, I will take you through our forecast of the client funds extended investment strategy. First, a reminder that the objectives of our investment strategies remain the safety, liquidity, and diversification of our assets. As of June 30, approximately 80% of our fixed income portfolio was invested in AAA and AA rated securities. In a typical year, our strategy results in about 15% to 20% (21:25) of our fixed income investments maturing, and this year, we expect the percentage of maturities will be closer to the higher end of this range.","We continue to base the interest rate assumptions in our forecast on the Fed Funds future contracts and the forward yield curve of the three-and-a-half and five year U.S. Government agencies, as we do not believe it is possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of these \u2013 the shape of the yield curve, or the new bond issuance behavior of corporate and other issuers. For fiscal year 2016, we anticipate average client fund balances in the range of $22.5 billion to $22.9 billion, which represents 3% to 5% growth, and includes an anticipated impact of about 1% from foreign currency translation, as almost 12% of our client fund balances anticipated to be outside the U.S. in fiscal year 2016. We anticipate that the yield on the client funds portfolio will remain about flat at 1.7% compared with fiscal year 2015.","These factors are expected to result in an increase of $5 million to $15 million to our client funds interest revenue and an increase of up to $10 million to pre-tax earnings from the client funds extended investment strategy, when compared to fiscal year 2015. The detail of this forecast is available in the supplemental slides on our website. And, finally, before I take \u2013 before we take your questions, we're anticipating capital expenditures of $225 million to $250 million in fiscal year 2016.","With that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Thank you. Good morning, Carlos and Jan.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Good morning.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Good morning, David.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Good morning. How do you think about balancing this well above trend growth in global new business bookings with the expense associated with implementations? And what I'm trying to understand is, if you have the opportunity, let's say, to meaningfully accelerate bookings growth above the historic target levels of 8% to 10%, would you do it in this environment?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. I mean, when you think about the way our business model works, and I think we've been saying this probably for multiple decades, it's an incredibly attractive business model because of the retention rates. So, if you're keeping clients 10 years to 12 years on average, and in some cases, with large clients, 20 years, and to spend the sales expense and the implementation expense in the first year to then have that cash flow stream for that long is just adds a tremendous amount of value in what we call lifetime client value. So, we've been saying this, I think, for decades. All of my predecessors have said it that this is really a great problem to have, is to have new business bookings accelerating the way they did this year, and in the last quarter. And, frankly, from a shareholder value creation standpoint, we would love for it to continue.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Understood. So as a follow up, that said, I'm trying to understand the 8% to 10% growth target for new business bookings given the 13% growth you put out for FY 2015, is that just a conservative outlook or is that realistic?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Well, we were taking bets on how long it would take someone to ask this question and so you get the prize. And the reality is, I think as we said over the last three years or four years, whenever we have the kind of strong finish that we just experienced, we have historically wanted to be cautious because \u2013 and we've had experiences in the past where, due to the way our incentive systems work and other factors in terms of how our sales force behaves, that a very, very strong finish in a fiscal year can sometimes lead to a slower start in the next fiscal year.","So, when we looked at that 8% to 10%, if you look at the five years on a compounded basis, we have had actually right around 10% growth. And so we've been in double-digits now for five years and we're definitely coming off of some very strong momentum. And I think the ACA boost that we're getting is certainly welcome. But I think when you look at it over a long period of time, I think we feel like 10% is a very, very strong number and that's at the top end of our range. So somewhere in that middle range of 8% to 10% feels like the right place for us to be planning our year.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Sara R. Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start by asking about the strength in the fourth quarter new bookings. Are these coming from larger clients? I'm wondering if that's why it's taking about six months for them to start to contribute. Is any coming from Vantage or much coming from Vantage? And are you expecting margins to be in the typical range?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So to be clear, I'll let maybe Jan add a little bit of color in terms of specific numbers, but the strength was really across the board in all of our segments. And to be clear, it was not only Affordable Care Act related business; it was also in some of our other HCM solutions, including our core strategic platforms.","And we just want to remind you also that ACA compliance is a requirement not just for large national account clients, but really effective next year for clients over 50 employees and currently at clients over 100 employees. And so we obviously experience some interest in our HCM products and ACA compliance products in our major accounts, mid-market business as well. So it wasn't contained really to national accounts.","And we also frankly experienced strong growth in our multinational products as well, which have nothing to do with ACA. So we really just had good across-the-board sales results. I don't know if, Jan, you want to add?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, I think one way to think is that ACA is triggering basically a broader HCM demand because the integrated bundle is very compelling to our clients. That's particularly relevant for the mid and up-market. But in addition to your final question is the margin (28:34) expectations for this ACA business and we have no reason to assume it would be any different from our average that we have in ADP. So this will be a good business for us in the long run.","Sara R. Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And then turning to the fourth quarter. Employer Services revenue growth of 2% was below what we've seen in a while. And I know that FX was an issue and the comparison was particularly tough. But I am wondering if this was a surprise for you. And if so, what led to it? Particularly because you have had strong new bookings for the last couple of quarters. Thank you.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think excluding the FX, it was not a surprise. I think that if you look at again over four quarters to six quarters, there's some variability sometimes in calendar and a few other odds and ends here. But, no, the answer is it is not out of line with what we would have expected based on our bookings and based on our retention rates and all of the kind of other things that go into that mix.","Sara R. Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks. Great bookings. I guess just a build-on question. I mean, can you just force-rank for us which markets were stronger than expected on the bookings front? And any change in duration of deals, thinking about how they cycle in?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Having looked at these numbers last night, I'm not sure that I can force-rank it because we really had strength across the entire portfolio, including global. Probably where we have the most variability is in the highest end of the business just because of the lumpiness and the size of those deals. And we did have particularly strong results in our multinational products. But when you look at the broader big business units where we have much bigger numbers and you don't have as much variability, they were all very, very strong and we were very pleased with the results.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","The second question was around duration. You mean in terms of how long it's taking to close deals? Or...","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, yeah, I was actually more thinking about the revenue realization or the bookings conversion and the terms of the deals (31:02)","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","There are two elements obviously as we deal now with a big backlog of implementations that just have to be naturally worked down. And secondly, the reporting requirements kick in really in earnest around the calendar end of the year. So I think the ACA product itself contributes a little bit to the back-endedness of our product. And then just regular work. So I wouldn't just put anything special into this revenue conversion of a half a year, I think it's just like how we're operationally going to implement the business. And then the ACA timing plays a little bit of a role of it, too.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","There are some important milestones that happen on January 1 with regards to reporting around the Affordable Care Act. And so that's six months from now, that happens to be the average guidance that we give in terms of converting new business bookings into revenues. But we just want to make sure that we maybe gave a little bit of color there that if people are wondering like why now and not three years ago, because the Affordable Care Act was passed quite a long time ago. Some of the requirements for ACA have been phased in over time and there happen to be some important reporting requirements that are kicking in January 1.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. That is very, very clear. Makes sense. So, just one quick follow up just on the buyback front, as we expected, it's not in guidance. But has your philosophy changed at all with respect to buybacks, including how you leverage your balance sheet and approach to debt, et cetera? Thanks.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","No, there is absolutely no change in our philosophy. I think it's actually typical that we would not guide to future share buybacks, so this is right in line with how we've ever done. You should not see any change in our attitude towards returning cash to shareholders.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Jan. Thanks, Carlos.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Thank you. So just another question on bookings. Generally speaking, the acceleration in new bookings that you're seeing, are you just generally seeing the markets that you are competing in growing faster than you were expecting, or do you think you're also taking share from some of your competitors?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think it's probably a little bit of both and it depends on which market. And probably not going to get into those specifics in terms of market by market. But I think it's a combination of both because we have heard anecdotal stories, we obviously don't meet with our competitors to talk about these things, but we have heard anecdotally that the Affordable Care Act compliance requirements, especially the reporting requirements that are kicking in on January 1, are creating a higher-than-normal level of activity in the marketplace in general. But I think when we look at our growth rates across overall ADP and compare them to the growth rate of industry, we believe we are, I think, winning some market share as well.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Got it. And then just a follow up on ADP Marketplace. It sounds like there's a lot of developer interest. Can you remind us whether this is more about giving customer choice for existing modules or whether it's about generating more revenues?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","That's a good debate that we've had I think a fair amount of here internally and I think we are leaning right now in the direction of being more open than not, which means, in some cases, there will be potentially some either perceived or real gaps that clients will be able to fill in through the ADP Marketplace, but we do fully expect this to be monetizable and I think a revenue generator for ADP. But I think as we've said for the last two quarters or three quarters as excited as we are because of the traction we're getting at $12 billion, this is really not going to have a meaningful impact anytime in the near future from a revenue standpoint.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess I'd ask another question about the ACA product. Obviously, that sounds like that's doing really well. How do you \u2013 two-part question. How do you think about how that trend in bookings trend, once we get into calendar 2016, and, theoretically, most companies are using this service, and can this continue to grow or is this more of like a one-time mad dash to get into compliance and then it's hard to keep growing that product? And the second part, as companies come to you looking for this product, are you seeing them take any other products? Or is that driving broader demand as they're thinking through these issues into the other parts of your portfolio? Thanks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","They are, in fact, taking broader sets of our product. And part of that is, just to refresh your memory, I think we've been talking about this for a few years that the Affordable Care Act really requires a core system of record for payroll, requires a good benefits administration system, and a good time and attendance system. I know you've probably heard the stories about the 30 hours requirement for eligibility and some of the other factors that go into complying with ACA. So, really, having a complete HCM bundle and suite is almost a necessity for ACA compliance.","Now, some, I think, competitors and, in some cases, we may choose to provide ACA solutions on a standalone basis, just like we do with standalone tax. But, clearly, with the very effective, direct sales force that we have, I think we are using this as an opportunity to really, as much as possible, encourage prospects and existing clients to really broaden their \u2013 what they're taking from us in terms of HCM solutions because it just makes it easier to report and comply with ACA. But it also, frankly, provides a lot of other benefits that we've been talking about for years, in terms of managing their workforce and optimizing their business.","So, the answer is yes, when you look at our sales results, our new business bookings results, the ACA products dragged along with them additional modules and bundles, particularly around benefits administration. We anticipate that time and attendance systems will also be something that will be of increasing interest here over the next couple of years, not just because of ACA but because of some of the recent proposals around new requirements for the measurement of overtime. So, I think that this all bodes well for additional penetration of our products and we did see that in the fourth quarter.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, and then the follow-up is, is there anything particular about these ACA solutions that's different and would require a significant level of resources \u2013 investment and resources to handle the onboarding? Or is it just that it's a fairly new product and so you didn't have those assets in place?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, it's a fairly complex compliance solution. And we developed it really with ADP's value proposition on mind, so it goes even further than recording and measurement eligibility. And in particular at the back end, which has a lot of the filing requirements that are due to the IRS and exchange of information with the public exchanges on penalties and rebates and so forth is fairly complex. And so that requires some time. I think the delay in implementation is not specifically caused by the (39:15) of the ACA product implementation, but more by the volume that we have to work through, and to some degree, if clients buy a full suite of HCM services, obviously, that is a complex implementation on its own. So, that combination of it.","So, don't think of the ACA product as particularly difficult to implement. It does require implementation resources, but it is more really that working through the backlog and implementing a large number of broader modules in parallel with the ACA that will cause a kind of that time delay that we give you. Also, the revenue disbursements, I'd just like to remind everybody, is also due to that strong FX pressure in the first two quarters and less FX pressure in the second half of the year, so it's a combination of that that helps with the guidance.","And even though you didn't ask the question, I just want to make sure I get the information out. In the first quarter, we anticipate FX pressure of approximately 3% and in the second quarter, revenue pressure of FX by approximately 2%. So you can \u2013 then it abides in the second half of the fiscal year. And on NOI, it's a little bit less pressure but kind of in that neighborhood and so you have really a strong component of this revenue guidance is aided also by the FX impact. So I don't want to have this ACA impact to be too overstated in your thinking.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from S.K. Prasad Borra of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","S.K.Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs International","Thanks for taking my question. A couple, if I may. Probably first one just on the operational costs. Can you elaborate on the operational costs associated with this new bookings? Is it just primarily going to be on services or are you expecting some investments in product offerings, especially for the up-market segment?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think just in terms of on the fourth quarter, I think we may have said in our comments, and if not, we should clarify that. We fully \u2013 even as of a few months ago, expected to \u2013 our own forecasts were to come in in line with the guidance that we had provided. And so the entire miss in the fourth quarter, if you want to call it a miss, I kind of call it good news, but if you want to call it a miss, was really due to selling expense. So we had approximately $40 million in incremental selling expense, which again as I said, we'll take all day long because that's now behind us. And again, given these lifetime client values, we're going to have these client for a long time. We're going to be collecting revenue and margin for them for a long time to come. So that's all good news.","In terms of what we are planning, in terms of additional resources for implementation, as Jan said, this is all due to volume. It's not related to complexity or other issues, which again, just to reiterate, is a good news story. So we were not anticipating 13% bookings growth, otherwise we would have \u2013 and 18% for the quarter, otherwise we would've told you that last quarter. And so that requires us to ramp up some of these implementation resources purely driven by volume. But again it's a good news story because once we get through that expenses well, then we will have the benefit of those revenues for many, many years to come.","And so in terms of quantifying those numbers, as Jan said, the first half of the year, it's mainly an FX story, but we do have probably 30 \u2013 around $30 million to $40 million of incremental operating expenses in order to implement all of these \u2013 all of this new \u2013 all of this incrementals. It's incremental on top of what we had already planned for in terms of implementation expense and that adds a little bit of additional pressure in the first half, but the FX is really the main story.","S.K.Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs International","That's great. On the competitive landscape, can you provide any color on the changing dynamics in various segments, up-market, mid-market, the SME market and also the PEO segment? A lot of noise in the market, but want to hear your perspective on your latest offerings and how the competitive there in the market?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I mean, that's a lot of ground to cover. I think the general answer is again as we prepare for these calls and we look at our win\/loss ratios and we look at growth rates of new business bookings, not just for ACA but also in our strategic platforms, we feel pretty good about our competitive position. We don't see any major changes in terms of pricing behavior out in the marketplace. We're steadily growing our sales force at the rates that we had planned and I think our productivity gains have exceeded our expectations, which I think are a sign of I think getting reasonably good traction in terms of our \u2013 the products in the marketplace. So we're \u2013 I think we're pleased with our competitive position but we acknowledge also that there is a lot of competition out there. And a number of new entrants and I'm sure there's plenty have also exit. But this is a vibrant, competitive market but we believe that we are doing a pretty effective job when you look at our new bookings results, which is the ultimate measure of whether or not we're winning against the competition or not.","S.K.Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs International","That's very helpful. Thanks, Carlos.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Hey, in the I guess 7% nominal and then 9% constant currency revenue growth from this year, it looked like pays per control came in around 3%. Can you kind of disaggregate the other 6 points of constant currency growth in there?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yes.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Client growth versus PEO-related revenue growth versus add-on modules into the base?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Sure. I mean, Jan can maybe add a little bit more detail, but I think as we went through in March Investor Conference, pays per control really adds less than 1% to our revenue growth. And we have a couple of other small items that, plus and minus, very, very small impact. The main impact of our revenue growth is the difference between our new business bookings, which then turn into starts, and then our losses. So, we refer to as starts, which is \u2013 the leading indicator of our starts is our new business bookings. And so that really is the bulk of the 6% that you're referring to.","And, by the way, that 6% was probably closer to 2% to 3% three years ago, because as the difference between our starts related to new business bookings and our losses has grown at a faster rate than our revenue growth, we've been able to kind of accelerate our revenue growth here. And that is with kind of a very similar pays per control number overall three or four of those years. And we've had around 2.5% to 3% pays per control growth here for a while. I want to add, also, that for two years or three years, we had about a 1% drag from client funds interest, because that was a revenue number that was under pressure. We had one year where we had $90 million decrease in interest income and in another one, I think we had $50 million.","So there are some moving parts where it's very, very hard in a call like this to get through every year, every detail. But, in general, our net new business \u2013 difference between starts and losses has been expanding and growing, and it will continue to, given these strong new business bookings we just reported, and that tends to accelerate our revenue growth.","Now, versus other business models that are not recurring revenue models, our revenue growth tends to accelerate at a slower rate because of just the dynamics of the existing base, which we also love. So, we love retaining 91% of our clients. But what that means is that to accelerate that revenue growth requires multiple years of new business bookings growth in 10% or more, which is exactly what we've accomplished in the last five years.","And so that's why you've seen this, I think it was probably around 2% coming from that net new business number four years or five years ago, to today more like 6% to 7%. And obviously, we think that by the second half of this fiscal year 2016, that revenue growth rate will be based on \u2013 to be fully \u2013 we were transparent in terms of providing the comments and the guidance that Jan gave, that we expect to be above our range in the second half of the year. I think that you can extrapolate from that that we will have robust revenue growth in the second half, exiting the second half of 2016 and hopefully entering into 2017.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Terrific. And the just \u2013 sorry, go ahead.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I was going to \u2013 I think your other question was about decomposing PEO impact versus (48:25) impact. And I believe that from a growth rate decomposition standpoint, I believe it's about half and half.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it, got it. Good, and then just one follow-up related to the competitive environment. How frequently are you the only \u2013 are you sole sourced, currently, like, in this most recent quarter, when you had really strong new bookings. Is it predominantly sole sourced? Or are they -","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Sole sourced you're defining as we're in a non-competitive situation basically?","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Exactly, yes.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We don't really have reliable statistics on it. And it switches, obviously, from \u2013 in the down market, more often than not, it is not a direct competitive situation, to up-market, it's always a competitive situation and a band in between. So, it switches to it. In the cross-selling of our additional modules and ACA products, it's more often than not, probably, that we ask our clients to expand our product offering.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I mean, this is a good opportunity, also, to put in a plug for our direct sales force. We have over 5,000 field salespeople. And I think that that, at various times, becomes a point of discussion externally and internally about the cost of that, because it's an investment. But obviously, this quarter and this year proved that, whether it's a competitive situation or not a competitive situation, having a sales force is an incredibly important competitive weapon for us that, again, we've been utilizing very effectively here for decades and it's a very well-honed machine. And they did an amazing job this year.","And I think, as Jan said, other than for small clients, where sometimes there's no competition, but even then there are many options nowadays, almost every situation is competitive. In the mid-market, the up-market and many times in the low end of the market, in the PEO and benefits, and across all of our products, and having a well-trained, well-incented direct sales force is an important competitive advantage for us.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Your line is now open.","James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Good morning, guys. I'd like to go back to the ACA product. Could you tell us how you're pricing it? Is it priced monthly? Is there an extra charge in January for the form that needs to be filled out, like a W-2? And how big is the market? I mean, how much is this adding to the market in terms of maybe dollars per worksite employee per year?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Good question. This is priced as a module, like our other HCM modules as a per-employee per month-type charge. For ACA compliance, you have to really work throughout the year and so the service is offered throughout the year. And the year-end filing requirements of the forms for the employee and the employer is included in that monthly charge. So once we are going, you should expect a steady recurring revenue stream integrated in our HCM solution. So, it's not like a W-2, for example. It's just an integrated price that we give to our clients.","And I'm sorry, the second part of the question was how big it is? It's a smaller-type module compared to our overall incremental revenue that we sell.","James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Okay. And maybe for a follow up. Normally, this time of the year, you tell us what your client count was at year end and client growth? I didn't see it in the release.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Jason, you're asking two good questions that we were waiting for and I appreciate them. We had another good year of client count growth accelerating and taking market share of 3.5% for the company.","James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ryan Allen Cary - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. This is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. First one just on the Employer Services side. I saw that the pre-tax margin is expected to be up 100 basis points and then looking at the PEO, which is expected to be up about 50 basis points, but overall pre-tax margins were only forecast to increase 50 basis points. So I was just curious what are the other pieces here? Is there something that maybe I'm missing?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","No, I think we have still a little bit of \u2013 number one, it's the balance of the growth. So you have 50 basis points of the PEO which weighs down the overall margin expansion and you have a very small drag from the client fund interest rate that depresses anything, but nothing else really that is that meaningful.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And if you remember that the way that we do our reporting is we provide Employer Services a 4.5%, which, again, this has been going on for years that we just fixed it at 4.5%. They get credit for the fund balances at 4.5% in Employer Services. And then we have in the other segment is where we do kind of the adjustment, if you will, for what the real rates are, which, as we just, said are 1.7%. So that accounts for some of that difference as well.","The missing link for you in terms of it's 150 basis points and then that other segment, at least today and into the foreseeable future, will be a drag on that overall margin just because of the math, because of the way we credit interest at 4.5%. So there's no economic difference to ADP overall. It's just that we, for management purposes so that Employer Services isn't focused on interest rates, we pass back to them a credit for interest rates at 4.5%. And that number, one would argue now with the benefit of hindsight that that number's too high. But it's been that way for many, many years. And for comparability purposes, we've chosen to just leave it the same.","Ryan Allen Cary - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks so much. And then on client retention, I saw it's down a little bit year-over-year for the second straight quarter, but it was flat at record levels for the full year. Can you just tell us what you're assuming for 2016 in regards to client retention?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We don't really guide to our client retention. But we have historically said that maintaining historic levels of retention is for sure a good goal to have.","Ryan Allen Cary - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. I'll just follow up on the retention. Obviously, two quarters isn't a trend, but we haven't seen two quarters consecutively down. Is there anything to call out there or maybe perhaps a lost client from a couple quarters that continues to drag?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think if you go back you \u2013 not that I'm trying to encourage you to look for bad news, but you will find that we definitely have had prior times in our history where we had two consecutive quarters of decline in retention. It's just the way \u2013 mathematically, it has to have happened just because of the fluctuations that we've had over the years in our client retention.","But the answer is, you see the tone of how seriously we take this. And we've said twice that we watch this very, very carefully and we're looking across all of our segments. Unfortunately, we just really don't have anything to report in terms of any patterns or any particular place of concern that we have right now. And we will definitely communicate that if we see any of that.","I did, as I prepared for the earnings call, notice that in our major accounts and our mid-market business, as we got off or in the process of getting off of two of our legacy platforms, we did have retention pressure on those platforms. And that doesn't account for the 30 basis point decline, but as we move from our small business migrations or upgrades where we move clients over onto RUN, where we had just frankly amazing results, where retention actually has improved and increased overall through those migrations. As we anticipated as we began this process of trying to accelerate the upgrades of our clients in our mid-market and up-market, I think it's safe to say that when we get to the end of the line on some of these platforms, that we do experience a little bit of pressure.","So we had a time and attendance system, for example, in our mid-market where we spent a couple of years getting all of the clients off of it. And then in the last six months, the last few hundred clients the retention rate was 50%. So good news is it was only a couple of hundred clients and so that 50% retention rate doesn't really have a major impact on overall ADP in terms of revenues or retention. But you combine that with another legacy payroll platform where we only have I believe now it's 300 clients left on our PCPW platform in our mid-market, that also experienced lower than historical retention rates as we get to the end of the line in terms of encouraging the last few clients to move off of that platform and to upgrade them.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then back to the bookings growth, the 18% in the quarter, I know there's been a lot of discussion regarding it, but I guess I'm a little still unclear what the upside was on the quarter. Was it specific to the ACA products? But it sounds to me like that's not a huge driver. Or was it just sort of broad based strength across the board that kind of surprised you to the upside?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","It was broad based strength across the board, but ACA was a significant part of it.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And just, Jan, to clarify, the $40 million incremental sales commission, by my math, that's like $0.05 or $0.06 for the quarter.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think that's fair. And so we had a little bit better performance and a few miscellaneous items, so we would have point landed (58:36) our 14% earnings growth without (58:39).","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. What was the expectation for new bookings? I knew it grew 18%, but I know it was over your expectation. But what was it going into the fourth quarter?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We had guided for 10% new business bookings growth on our last earnings call and so our true expectation was to grow 10% for the year and I'm looking at new business bookings for...","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Our sales plan had to be below...","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I don't have \u2013 it had to be below 10% because we exited around 11% year-to-date in third quarter. So we had planned slightly below 10% new business bookings growth. That is almost little bit too much detail here for our purposes, but 10% was our true forecast at the end of the forecast for the year.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, yeah, because I don't recall in ADP's history missing EPS due to selling expense. So I guess it sounds like the size of the direct sales force has increased as well? Maybe that has something to do with it, or just maybe the comp structure?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I contribute that to your young age, but we do had...","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","ADP has missed...","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We have missed the number of times actually due to good sales performance actually I think in my first year, three years ago, we did have such year also. So it does happen and as Carlos has alluded to, we have two things there, sales incentives that accumulate and accelerate performance in a good sales year for the sales force, so they have high incentives to book. And that causes it. And if you multiply out that incremental new business bookings relative to the NSE cost, (01:00:49) you see, really, that it's just a marginal cost that we pay out and have in our distribution channel.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Hey. Just because of the nature of our business model, really, the only \u2013 not the only, but one of the few places where we get variability in terms of our results is on bookings and sales expense. But, the good news is that having additional selling expense is usually related to having really great bookings result, which is what we had. And, as I said, like, when you look at our business model, that's a great \u2013 it's a great story and a great outcome. So \u2013 but it is the one place where \u2013 we don't, as you can imagine, you can just imagine how silly it would be for us to call our sales force in the middle of the quarter and tell them we would like you to stop selling, so that we don't miss our sales expense forecast. That's not what we do. We actually call them and go on sales calls to encourage them to close as much business as possible, because of what it does to the lifetime value of ADP.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No. Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, it doesn't make sense to not grow the business. It just doesn't happen that often. But then again, I guess an 18% bookings quarter obviously in the fourth quarter is \u2013 doesn't happen as often, historically. All right, just last question for me. I think you mentioned this, Carlos, but obviously, with the low revenue and profit in the first half of fiscal year 2016, and then an accelerated growth rate in the back half of fiscal year 2016, that I think we can assume, or should we assume then the first half of fiscal year 2017 will still have those benefits? So, we should have an outsized growth rate in both profit and revenue in the first half of fiscal year 2017 as well? Thanks so much.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Let me just answer your original question, which was back to \u2013 I did find some of these numbers here. So, the 18% in Q4 of 2015 was 110% of plan. So, you can assume that our growth rate expectation was around 7% or 8% for the fourth quarter. And we had 18%. And another piece of information is in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we had 4% growth. So just to give you a sense of kind of the grow over issue there.","And on the last question, we're not providing fiscal year 2017 guidance yet.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, I just thought you mentioned something about that it will continue into fiscal year 2017 because of that growth rate that's in the second half, which will be exponentially higher.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Well, I didn't say anything about \u2013 I think what I said was that we would be exiting \u2013 and I did get kicked under the table, by the way, for what I said. But what I said is that it's clear from what Jan said in his comments that we expect to have the second half of the year revenue growth to be above the guidance range and the first half to be below the guidance range. That would lead most people to conclude that, assuming the FX doesn't compress even more than it has, because, again, this assumes that we plan based on spot rates at the time that we're having this call, or at the time we actually prepare our operating plans. So, things can happen. That's why we don't provide fiscal year 2017 guidance.","But, assuming the FX rates stay where they are and at the pressure abates in the second half and that we have all of these new business bookings implemented and executed upon, then I think what we said was that, in the second half of the year, we would be above our guidance range. And then, for folks who follow ADP closely, they know that just because of the recurring revenue nature of the business, that if in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year, you have X revenue growth, that again, barring any changes in FX or other things, that, for the following first or second quarters of the next fiscal year, you should be somewhere in the same neighborhood. This is not trying to provide guidance. We're just trying to help, I guess, clarify what I think is already \u2013 should be obvious.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Super. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO. Your line is now open.","Henry Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning. It's Henry Chien calling in for Jeff. Just wanted to follow up a little bit about pricing. Could you talk a little bit about pricing trends you're seeing and how much, if any, that pricing was used to generate some of that new business bookings growth? Thanks.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. Two components to your pricing question. In the past fiscal year, we had price increases approximated a little bit less than 1% of revenue growth, right in line with our long-term expectations. And when \u2013 the best way to assess pricing competitiveness and pricing dynamics on the new business bookings is really a way to look at our discounting levels throughout the book of business as we sell and they are consistent with prior quarters, so we have not seen any changes in our \u2013 in the pricing environment that were meaningful to report.","Henry Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. Perfect, thank you. And just wanted to touch a little bit on the partnership with Cornerstone OnDemand. How are you thinking about \u2013 or if you have any updates on your thoughts on where it makes more sense to partner on certain areas of HR? Thanks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think we offered a couple of examples out of the set of 60 participants in the marketplace, picking a couple very well-known partners and market participants in the HCM market, just as examples that we have really \u2013 you shouldn't read more into it. We have larger and established companies in the marketplace and we have startups in the company place and we're really emphasizing the need to be part of an overall integrated environment that the utilization of this APIs will allow us to pursue, to better serve our clients.","Henry Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And again, ladies and gentlemen, in order to allow time for others, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Foresi of Janney Montgomery. Your line is now open.","Robert E. Simmons - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks. This is Robert Simmons on for Joe. So you called out that FX hit Employer Services by 4%. Can you say how much it hit the PEO line? And then how do each of those compare to your expectations?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","That's a good question. The PEO has no FX impact. They're a U.S. only business. So, yes.","Robert E. Simmons - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","And then, relative to expectations, were they 4% on FX for Employer Services?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","For Employer Services, it's kind of in line with what I gave you for the overall company. It's a little bit...","Sara Grilliot - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Sorry. You're asking...","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","It's a little bit more \u2013 I'm sorry, I misunderstood. So, the ES revenue \u2013 why not, it's a mathematic. It's about 4% in the first quarter for ES, and between 2% to 3% in the second quarter for next year.","Robert E. Simmons - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Sorry. I was asking, though, what actually happened in the fourth quarter compared to what you thought was going to happen, in terms of FX impact.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Oh, it was right in line. I'm sorry. I misunderstood.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","In line with 4%.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, it was 4% and...","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Just to be clear, it's 4%. Because it is greater than the overall ADP impact, because the PEO has none, and it's $2.5 billion of revenue. So, I think, by definition, the ES impact has to be a larger percent impact than the overall ADP impact.","Robert E. Simmons - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Definitely. Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Post the new sales that you had, what percentage of the client base that is required to file 1095s has actually signed up for the ACA compliance product?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I don't think we want to talk about it in detailed numbers, but your question, Mark, yields on are we anticipating future ACA sales in future years and the answer is yes, so it's not everybody has signed up. We still have opportunity in future years.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","It would be significant, wouldn't it?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, it would. Yes, we have a large portion of our clients signed up, but not all.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then with regards to nationals. What percentage of the clients are on Vantage at this point versus some of the older systems? And what's the plan in terms of the transition?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So Jan will probably get you the \u2013 we can come up with \u2013 I think I have it here somewhere in terms of how many clients we have live on Vantage.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","129 clients live.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I knew he had the numbers, so 129 live on Vantage. We did this year go through some migrations and so we have been \u2013 I guess, I would call it dabbling and working on some migration tools and moving some clients, but we have several thousand clients in our national accounts base so \u2013 and frankly we kind of like \u2013 we want to do both but we really like new share and incremental growth to the company, and so our focus for the last couple of years has been on kind of new logos, new share, but we realized that we also need to bring our existing clients along, just like we're saying we need to do that in the mid-market and then in the low end of the market. So I think you'll continue to see us do both, sell new share and also migrate clients \u2013 sorry, upgrade.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And just from a servicing perspective, is there any changes contemplated in terms of the service methodology going forward in any of the lines to even further strengthen the retention rate?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, we have a number of initiatives on continually enhancing our service and compliance offerings which are, as you know, an important part of the overall ADP value proposition. So, in addition to the technology of Vantage and Workforce Now on RUN, very important and so they are ongoing and incremental and they, in particular, focused on improving the overall client experience by offering a more integrated service offering that further strengthens like the togetherness of payroll, HR, talent and benefit. So that the client gets really the best of ADP from an integrated source of service. So it's an ongoing transition as we work on continually improve it. But in parallel with us becoming an integrated HCM technology platform provider, our services will \u2013 is migrating into that same method.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And we've I think invested more than the normal amount in user experience and usability over the last 12 months, and I think it's \u2013 it's I think getting us good traction in the marketplace because that is frankly, in today's world, the expectation is to have kind of a consumer grade experience both for the worksite employees or the employees of our clients and the worksite employees in the PEO as well as for the practitioners that use our products at the client site. And so, if you do market checks, you'll see that we have an updated \u2013 and we mentioned it in some of our comments, so I think that we've been investing quite a bit in usability and user experience.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. And one last question. What's the remaining authorization on the buyback?","Sara Grilliot - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I can get that for you, Mark. I can follow up with you.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Enough for now.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Enough for a good bit.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","You don't have to worry about it, but we're going to get that for you.","Sara Grilliot - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah.","Mark S.

Your line is now open.","Matt C. O'Neill - Autonomous Research US LP","Hey. Good morning. I was just curious if you, guys, could go back and discuss the DataCloud offering that you mentioned you now have 1,000 clients signed up for and maybe how the revenue model works for that business and if it's nice to have or a must have for the clients who have kind of given you feedback on it at this point?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I'm glad you're asking. So, DataCloud is the branded name for our data analytics and Big Data product that we're developing and it is our new market-leading comprehensive reporting and analytic solution that includes benchmarking and capabilities for it and it's sold in our mid-market as an incremental module, reporting \u2013 or analytics module, if you want, it's called DataCloud and you subscribe to it on a per employee per month basis. And it just launched and we have 1,000 clients mostly in the mid-market. Vantage has it built in and it's included and we're seeing good traction I think. This is going to \u2013 from my personal expectation, it should be a must have because it is truly unique the way you can now drill in and compare your performance to a level of detail of compare to benchmarks it's really not available elsewhere, and so we put big investments into our data analytics product development and DataCloud is really the first version of it and you should see continued expansion and broadening of the offering. So very exciting early stages and I think you will hear more from it over the next year for sure.","Matt C. O'Neill - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Sayeed, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Webcast. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Sara Grilliot, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Sara Grilliot","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Sara Grilliot, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations, and I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call and Webcast.","Before Carlos begins with a discussion of our achievements in the quarter, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such, involves some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","With that, I will turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported solid results for our third quarter of fiscal 2015, which included revenue growth of 7% despite increased pressure from foreign currency translation. Worldwide new business bookings grew 6% in the quarter compared with a third strong quarter last year.","I'm pleased that, fiscal year-to-date, our new business bookings growth is a solid 11%, putting us squarely on track to meet our full year forecast of about 10% growth. Our results are directly attributable to the continued focus and dedication of ADP teams across the world that are driving our HCM strategy. Recently, we had the opportunity to detail this strategy during our Investor Day, which was held on March 3. If you did not have a chance to attend or listen live to the webcast, a recording of the event continues to be available on our website.","During our Investor Day, we outlined our strategy, which consists of 3 pillars: first, to continue to innovate from our core platforms to grow a full suite of cloud-based HCM solutions that work together seamlessly; second, continue to scale our industry-leading outsourcing solutions; and third, to expand into global markets that can benefit from our HCM offering and grow globally with our clients. We see evidence of success in executing on all 3 pillars, which contributed to our performance in the quarter.","Our SaaS platforms continue to meet expectations, and fiscal year-to-date, our client revenue retention remains at record levels. We continue to expand the capabilities of these platforms to meet the demands of clients and to respond to their need to comply with an increasingly complex regulatory environment. One example of this is ADP Health Compliance, which helps clients manage the complexities of compliance with the Affordable Care Act. This product continues to receive significant interest from our upmarket clients and has recently been introduced to our mid-market clients.","Another opportunity for our clients and ADP is big data. Big data represents an opportunity for clients to make better HR decisions. We pay 1 in 6 private sector workers in the U.S. That's the biggest data set of its kind in HCM and affords us a unique opportunity to deliver insights that enable better HR decisions. For years, we've been bringing data-driven insights to the market through the ADP Research Institute, and we will soon be announcing new products which leverage our unique data to deliver insight across HR, wages, time, benefits and talent depending on the client's HCM platform.","We continue to be excited with the performance of RUN, our strategic platform targeted to small businesses, which continues to perform well. We now have all of our small-market clients using RUN, an important milestone for our business as we were able to sunset the legacy platform, EasyPay, during the quarter. This is a big achievement, not only because we completed the migrations and can sunset the platform, but also because the execution exceeded our expectations on several other fronts. Notably, we exceeded expectations in client retention during the transition. I believe the high level of retention we experienced is a testament to our product and our clients' confidence in ADP.","In addition, throughout the migration, we benefited from greater adoption of HCM modules -- greater adoption of HCM modules than anticipated. While this has not driven a significant amount of revenue for ADP, it is certainly a positive outcome. And while we do not -- while we do anticipate some level of cost savings associated with this platform shutdown, we plan to reinvest the savings to support further migration efforts of legacy systems to our cloud-based platforms. Again, I could not be more proud of our associates for successfully completing these small-market migrations, and this success reinforces our confidence as we push forward on this multiyear migration journey.","On the global front, we've continued to grow our capabilities outside North America and have now expanded our offerings of HCM solutions to 104 countries. For clients in these countries, we continue to expand our service capabilities to ensure we are delivering consistent, scalable and valuable services. In February, we announced the opening of a new Center of Excellence in Bucharest, Romania. This is a terrific team that will use standardized and automated systems to help our systems, our clients optimize HR and payroll operations to build great workforces. The services they are delivering start with implementation and migration and include fully managed outsourced services. Together with our operations in Prague and Barcelona, the Bucharest center enhances our capabilities in Europe.","And while we're excited about our progress, it's even more satisfying when our clients recognize it. Last month, I had the pleasure of participating in ADP's annual Meeting of the Minds event in Nashville. The buzz and positive feedback we received from customers and industry analysts validated for me that we are, indeed, on the right path. It was great to share the stage with clients willing to talk about their experiences in driving specific, tangible value from our solutions.","We're also proud of the recognition we continue to receive from third parties recognizing the value our solutions are delivering to the market. Most recently, NelsonHall, a global BPO analyst firm, named ADP a leader in recruitment process outsourcing. Their analysis recognizes our comprehensive recruitment service, which helps clients recruit high-quality talent at scale. This is a fantastic recognition as we continue to grow our BPO services.","So we are pleased with the progress we are making on our strategy and believe it's contributing meaningfully to our performance. In the end, ADP is the only company that serves clients across the globe, across the full spectrum of HCM and across the full range of client sizes, and we have the resources, scale and expertise to meet the market needs.","With this in mind, we are improving how we communicate the ADP brand to our clients and prospects. To better articulate what makes the ADP experience unique, we have developed a new tagline: ADP, a more human resource. We believe this tagline succinctly captures what sets us apart. We believe that software alone is not enough. To win in HCM requires deep expertise and outstanding service to help clients not just manage their employees, but build better workforces. We love this new tagline, which you'll start seeing in the market shortly.","Overall, we have great confidence in our team, our strategy, our ability to execute and our message to the market.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan to walk you through the third quarter results.","Jan Siegmund","Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. For the quarter, ADP's revenue grew 7% and pretax earnings grew 12%. This revenue and pretax earnings growth includes a negative impact of approximately 2 percentage points from the effects of foreign currency translation. Earnings per share grew 16% in the quarter on a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with the year ago and included a negative impact of about $0.02 from the effects of foreign currency translation.","I'm pleased with this solid performance despite the headwinds experienced from foreign currency. Our tax rate was lower than anticipated in the quarter as we were able to realize benefits from certain tax items that were not previously forecasted.","ADP remains committed to shareholder-friendly actions and has repurchased more than 13 million shares throughout the end of the third quarter at a cost of $1.1 billion. These share repurchases were partially funded by the dividend proceeds of $825 million ADP received from CDK as a result of the spin-off, which occurred on September 30.","Employer Services revenues grew 5% and were negatively impacted by 3 percentage points from foreign currency translation. This revenue growth was driven primarily by additions of our new recurring revenues from our HCM solutions as well as the benefit of revenues from certain tax credits filed on behalf of our clients that we received in the third quarter of this fiscal year. While our client revenue retention was down in the quarter compared with last year, and we are paying attention to this change, on a fiscal year-to-date basis, our retention remains at record levels.","Same-store pays per control in the U.S. remained strong with an increase of 3.1%. Average client fund balances grew 4%. This growth was driven by net new business and growth in pays per control, but was moderated by decreased balances from lower state unemployment tax rates compared with the prior year in the U.S. -- as U.S. employment continues to improve as well as the negative effects of foreign currency translation.","Our international business continues to perform well with growth coming from each major geographic region that we serve. Multinational solutions continue to perform very well with solid revenue and earnings growth. And while the economic situation in Europe is showing some signs of improvement, we are seeing some slowdown in our Latin American business.","Our pretax margin expansion in Employer Services was 190 basis points in the quarter, primarily from scale and productivity.","The PEO posted 15% revenue growth compared to last year's third quarter with growth in average worksite employees of 13%. And although this growth has slowed from the first half of the fiscal year because of a difficult compare, the business continues to perform well as more businesses seek to fully outsource their HCM needs. The PEO continues to deliver solid margin expansion through sales productivity and operating efficiencies, expanding margins by approximately 150 basis points in the quarter.","ADP's consolidated pretax margin improved by 110 basis points in the third quarter, which included a drag of about 20 points from the slower growth of our high-margin client funds interest revenues as these highly profitable revenues grew at a slower rate than overall revenues.","So now I will take you through our updated fiscal 2015 outlook. As Carlos mentioned earlier in the call, we are still anticipating worldwide new business bookings growth of about 10%. Because of the negative FX anticipated from foreign currency translation, we are now anticipating revenue growth for total ADP of about 7% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 8%.","Our revenue forecast for Employer Services still anticipates growth of about 5%. This forecast includes a negative drag of about 2 percentage points for the fiscal year due to foreign currency translation. However, the impact on the full year growth is expected to be more pronounced in the fourth fiscal quarter. This forecast assumes pays per control growth of about 3% compared with our prior forecast of 2% to 3% growth.","For the PEO, we are now anticipating revenue growth of about 16% compared with our prior forecast of 15% to 17%.","Our forecast anticipates pretax margin expansion for total ADP of at least 75 basis points from 18.4% at fiscal year 2014 compared with our prior forecasted range of 75 to 100 basis points of pretax margin expansion.","On a segment level, we are revising our fiscal year 2015 forecast for Employer Services pretax margin expansion to contemplate our year-to-date results and are now anticipating margin expansion of about 125 basis points compared with our prior forecast of about 100 basis points.","We are now anticipating about 100 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO.","We have narrowed our forecast for the client funds extended investment strategy. And primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation on interest earned outside of the U.S., we are now anticipating an increase of about $5 million over the last year. This compares with the prior forecast of an increase of $5 million to $15 million over last year. This forecast anticipates average client fund balances growth of about 5%, which is at the low end of our prior range of 5% to 7%. The detail of this forecast is available both in the press release and in the supplemental slides on our website.","The improvement in our effective tax rate is expected to continue for the balance of the fiscal year and we are updating our forecasted effective tax rate to reflect this improvement. We are now anticipating tax rate of 33.7% compared with our prior forecasted tax rate of 34.2%. This tax rate improvement, combined with the impact of share repurchases on our earnings per share growth, is expected to offset earnings pressure we anticipate from foreign currency translation.","And due to the solid performance of our business year-to-date, we are now anticipating growth in diluted earnings per share of approximately 14% compared with our prior forecast of 12% to 14%. This forecast does not contemplate any further share buybacks beyond the anticipated dilution related to equity comp plans. However, it remains our intent to continue to return excess cash to shareholders subject to market conditions.","With that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question on competition. I'm wondering if you could give us an update on the competitive environment around midsized clients for payroll services.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Our sales performance, I think, in the mid-market, I think was kind of in line with the overall results and maybe even a little bit stronger, but again we don't like to get into specific detail. That's really the only way -- we don't have a lot of other pieces of data or information that we can give you around -- specifics around competitors other than, for these quarterly calls, Jan and I both look at, in addition to the sales results, we look at win-losses against competitors whether it's in mid-market, upmarket or the low end of the market. And I would say that we're doing a little bit better from a sequential standpoint and executing really well, particularly in what we call the lower end of mid-market for us, which is we refer to it as core. We define mid-market as 50 to 1,000 employees and we define core as 50 to 150, and that's a place where I think our performance appears to have improved a little bit. But again, it's a limited amount of information, only 1 quarter's worth of data. But I think there's not much to report in terms of change there. I don't know if, Jan, you have anything?","Jan Siegmund","I would say there's a -- continue to be competitive in the marketplace, but unchanged compared to prior quarters. No major change.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And just as a quick follow-up, at your Investor Day you spoke about the potential for leverage capacity given the move to the AA credit rating. I know that there's no particular rush as you think through that, but I'm wondering if you could give us an update on how you and the board are thinking about over the longer term.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Sounds like a question for the CFO, but since you're asking me, I'll take a stab at it and then I'll let Jan also answer. So I think that, as we acknowledged at our Investor Day, I think we, like everyone else, could see that our -- from a capital structure standpoint, we could probably optimize our capital structure a bit more and stay within, I think, our strong credit rating that we have that is important to us for a variety of reasons around our money movement strategies and client investment funds. So I think that we -- as you can tell over the last quarter, we returned the entire amount that we received from CDK, $825 million and then some, in the form of share repurchases back to shareholders. That still leaves us with a, what I would call, a very comfortable amount of cash on the balance sheet. And as you know, we're not really market timers and so we believe in steady returns to our shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases without trying to actually time the market. So I think, today, as we sit here today, we're comfortable with where we are, but highly aware of the capacity that we have on our balance sheet. And again, that's a discussion that we've been actively engaged in with the board and I think as things develop and we have more to report, we will. But I think we don't want to be shy about making sure that it's clear that we are certainly considering the potential to optimize our capital structure and add some debt to the balance sheet. So Jan?","Jan Siegmund","I think that captures it. I think relative to the time line, Sara, it's kind of this year, we have been focused on returning the dividend to our shareholders. And as we evaluate that, we would update, of course, the investment community about the progress. But right now, there is no update, really.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smittipon Srethapramote from Morgan Stanley.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This Danyal Hussain calling for Smitti. Just wanted to touch on R&D in light of sunsetting EasyPay. Perhaps could you just give us an update on where you are in terms of R&D spend and how that's, right now, broken down between maintenance and new product development?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes, so we've actually set a goal 3 or 4 years ago, to try to move how much we were spending on maintenance versus -- and I think what we relayed to you was that about 40% of our R&D spend was on new and 60% was on maintenance. And so I think it's a couple of quarters ago that we actually switched that around and now we're spending 60% on new and 40% on old. I think as Jan likes to point out to the organization, some of that is because our total spend has gone up and most of that spend, the increased spend, is on new. And so we have not necessarily decreased dramatically our spend on some of our legacy platforms, but as you can tell from our financials over the last 2 or 3 years, we have been steadily increasing our R&D spend. In grand ADP fashion, it's not -- it may not jump out at you, it may not be dramatic, but it is for us because we've been growing our P&L view spend at the same rate as revenue growth, which means as we get margin improvement in other areas from service, operations, implementation and sales because this is a place where we've not been trying to get operating leverage is in R&D. And so as you see those increased spend levels -- which, by the way, don't reflect really the true picture of our gross spend, which includes capitalized software, which you could see through our balance sheet and through our 10-Qs and our other reporting. But I think the message you should take away is that we have been, in ADP terms, spending aggressively on R&D, we believe for the right reasons, and I think it will translate into a better competitive set of products for us as you've seen already happen here over the last 2 or 3 years with some of our strategic platforms that we already have in the market. But the bottom line is, I think as we've increased the spend overall and we've held or slightly decreased the spend on our legacy platforms, that mix has shifted over now to 60% on new products and services and 40% on old. So we're very, very happy about that because that was a goal that we set several years ago that, by the way, happened to be in my management MBOs and as well as my team's because we think it's the right thing to do to continue to invest more in product and technology.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And just looking at Employer Services growth, I guess, FX adjusted, it looks like it was about 8%. So you mentioned the tax credits, can you just talk a little bit about what else is driving the strength there and how much of that tax credit benefit is sort of onetime in nature?","Jan Siegmund","The Tax Credit Services business that we have as part of our Employer Services business is a long-running business. It suffered from the lack of renewal by Congress of certain return-to-work credits in the past years. So those tax credits have been reinstated and the business is in catch-up mode to collect those tax credits for our clients and receive the fees for it. So while the revenue is bumpy, I wouldn't describe it as onetime revenues because these are long-term processing contracts that we have with our clients. They are just dependent on the U.S. government and Congress to renew at certain time points for it. So they were suspended and we lacked the revenue throughout the last 4 quarters; and this quarter, the revenues started to kick in and they contribute a little bit more than a percentage point to the growth about. So it's just part of our business that now regains momentum as part of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The PEO, you've had at several quarters in a row really strong margin expansion after what has been more -- much more flattish, up a little, down a little over the last few years. What's really driven that this year? Is it a change in the pass-throughs? Or are you getting more leverage because of the faster growth you've been delivering? And how do we think about that going forward?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think first and foremost, you always have to give credit to the people on the ground running the business, so I think they -- that's number one. I think it's good execution and -- but I think you're right that it also, particularly in that business, the mathematics matter. And so the faster these pass-throughs grow, the harder it is to get margin expansion from a percentage standpoint. We try to focus more on dollars of profit per worksite employee or dollars of profit overall from that segment rather than margin percentage because of the pass-throughs. But you're correct that a slightly slower growth rate of pass-throughs mathematically helps in terms of achieving percentage margin improvement. But notwithstanding that, I think we have both things happening. We have slightly slower growth of pass-through, which helps make -- helps create the environment for potential margin improvement, and then they've just executed incredibly well. They've gotten good operating leverage, including on the distribution side, so the sales productivity there has been phenomenal as you've seen from the sales results over the last 2, 3, 4 quarters and that obviously helps quite a bit because sales costs tend to be relatively fixed, and if you get big improvements in sales results, you get nice productivity lift there. And that business tends to start relatively quickly as compared to some of our other businesses in the upmarket, so you get some of that margin help from distribution costs relatively quickly. The last thing that I'll mention is, just as a caution, is that's a 10 percentage -- around a 10% to 11% margin business right now in large part because of the pass-throughs. So in the end, because of the size of the pass-throughs and the level of the margin, that's a business that you should expect modest margin improvement from. So the results that you're seeing from a margin standpoint are terrific, frankly impressive, but not sustainable. So just to be clear. And part of that is because you never know what's going to happen with the pass-throughs and we have some visibility to that, so we would obviously give you guidance in the appropriate time frame in August around what's happening with pass-throughs. But in general, when you really run through -- if you take 5 minutes to run through the mathematics, it is a business that is inherently a lower margin than our other business, but we still love it because it's -- like our other businesses, it's not capital intensive, and every dollar of profit that we generate in that segment is a dollar of profit that goes to our shareholders, into our EPS. And so we love that business despite the fact that it requires some explanation around the percentage margin.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The point on profit per average worksite employees is a good one. I think I've got 10 years of data I'm looking at here, and it looks like you're trending towards, by far, the highest level that, that's ever been, up solid double digits this year. And so is it the sales leverage you mentioned and I guess just leverage of fixed cost with the business growing faster? But is there any reason that level of profits wouldn't be sustainable or be able to continue to trend somewhat higher?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","As in all businesses, that level of profitability is dependent on your differentiation and your competitive position in the market. In other words, how strong your value proposition is. We feel very, very bullish and very good about not only the execution of that business today, but also the value proposition in part because of how complex the environment has gotten because of ACA for all employers, not just for large employers. So this is just really creating, I think, a natural trend towards people looking for help. And you could get help in a variety of ways, and the good news is ADP has all types of ways we can help you, all the way from basic payroll to the PEO, which is the ultimate BPO bundle. And I think this kind of environment where you have increased regulatory compliance and complexity around health care is really a very, very favorable environment for the PEO. But on top of that, I think the PEO has not been, to their credit, over the last 5 years, has not just been sitting there kind of waiting for things to happen on the regulatory front. They've also made great strides in terms of the products and services that they deliver and the value that they add to the clients that they serve. And again, this is not the appropriate call to get into those details, but we feel very, very bullish about the value proposition that has emerged there over the last 3 to 5 years.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just a quick follow-up, Carlos, you said you didn't -- it's great that you're selling more HCM into RUN customers, but it doesn't impact revenue. Is that just a scale issue? Or is there some other reason that's not really benefiting?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It is a little bit of a scale issue that, obviously because this is the conundrum that we always have when we talk about ADP is, in some respect, it's a good thing that we serve all markets globally at all levels in all segments. That really means that any 1 segment in 1 country doesn't usually move the needle when it -- we need multiple parts of ADP moving in tandem to really move the needle. And so the SBS business, our downmarket business is a scaled business and it's a nice-sized business, but the amount of additional HCM penetration that you get as we migrated clients over in relation to the total size of that business and the total size of ADP just doesn't -- it doesn't register. So we appreciate it and it helps the overall cause, but we added that line in the script because we want you to understand that we're not getting $40 million, $50 million of lift in 1 year from that. Now over time, if we end up having a higher penetration rate of things like HR, and time and attendance, and insurance services, and 401(k) and other products because the RUN product itself is easier to use and more integrated, then that, over time, would help us. But just the nature of our business model, these are not big onetime lifts that we got, and we just want to make sure that, that was clear to all of you. But we're very happy about it, and it also was an indirect way of making sure that you understood that if we get similar, which we are, getting similar lift in mid-market and upmarket where you would assume and we are experiencing higher penetration rates of some of these other products, some of these other HCM products, that it bodes well for us as we continue these migrations and we complete some of the migrations in of some of our other segments. We think it could be a more significant lift than what we experienced already in our low end.","Operator","Our next question comes from S.K. Prasad Borra from Goldman Sachs.","Siva Krishna Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Probably just to start off, as you continue to increase your focus on expanding your HR suite, what are the metrics you are using internally to judge your success, both from an R&D and sales perspective? Is it the number of products you're offering? Is it attach rates? And if you could provide any update on attach rates post migration.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I know Jan has those attach rates at the tip of his tongue, and I think that's probably, besides our sales results and the attach rates in our upfront sales, I think the attach rates on our migrations, those 2 metrics are important metrics for us to judge our success of kind of our overall HCM strategy. So for example, in the upmarket, Jan has the exact numbers, but when you compare to kind of prior platforms that we had, the attach rates are much higher of the traditional HCM products around time and attendance, benefits, HR, talent, et cetera, and we're experiencing the same thing in mid-market where the concept of a seamless product that provides the entire solution in one-stop shopping, I think, is resonating in the marketplace. But what we needed to have is the products to actually reflect that, and I think we have that now in our strategic products and we're seeing it in the sales results. And now what you've been hearing us talk about over the last 2 or 3 years that we want to do that also with our client base by moving them on to our strategic products, which is what we just finished doing in Small Business and we're now trying to do in mid-market and also in national accounts. So I don't know, Jan, if you have the attach rates.","Jan Siegmund","Yes, we have. In the upmarket, there's really no change from what we have reported in prior quarters in the mid-70s to low 70s for some of these modules, but they remain high for Vantage. And in the mid-market for Workforce Now, we have seen actually some increase in the attach rate of our benefits bundle that we believe coincides with strong interest of our ACA offerings. So there's definitely something going on in the mid-market driving demand for a complete -- more complete bundle including benefits due to the insurance changes and things. So we're looking at these attach rates, which are important for new clients as well as for migrated clients and how they buy. And the trend has continued really in line with the numbers that we have previously disclosed. There's no big change.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think we should be clear that our sales force responds to product -- to good product and the market responds to good product. So for example, the release of our recent talent solutions, you could see, as I was going through some of the data for the call, you could see a fairly large jump, which we're not going to give the specific percentages, but a meaningful and significant jump in attach rates in new sales as -- since we released our new talent solutions. So I think we remain on the same track of being confident that, despite the fact that we want to continue to focus on our compliance, on our service, that product really matters and really drives our attach rates.","Siva Krishna Prasad Borra - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. Just following up on one of the earlier questions on the PEO business, taking into consideration the pass-through costs and the mechanics related to that, but are there any other levers for margin expansion? You alluded to expansion of your products and services in this business. So can those products and services provide some upside, more from a mid- to long-term perspective, but are we going to be just range stuck? Or do you think these newer products and services should just allow you to expand margins?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We're never going to be range stuck. So I believe that -- what I was trying to make sure that I communicated is that the improvements that you should expect are not along the lines of 10% going to 20% over 3 years. It's more in the line of 10.5% going to 10.8% or 10.9% and then 10.9% going to 11.2%. It's just a different situation. When you have more than half of your revenues, we treat more than half of those revenues as pass-through revenues, and they literally are pass-through in the sense that on the health care side, we take no risk and we basically pass through the costs that we pay for those health care plans to the employees of our clients and to the clients, depending on which percent the client pays versus the employees. That just mathematically creates a very different opportunity for margin expansion than in a business where you have 90% to 100% of the costs available for leverage. And so we just -- we have a -- the value proposition can get stronger. And the other half of our revenue, so the other products and services that we provide that we charge administrative fees for, are leverageable and we can get operating scale from. But it's just mathematically important for people to understand that in that business there is a limit because of the large pass-throughs. But we do not believe that we're range stuck, and what we don't want is to take advantage of the largest leverage opportunity, which is slower growth. And so in all of the ADP businesses including the PEO, the fact of the matter is that distribution costs, even though we're getting operating leverage from distribution costs in the PEO today, the fact of the matter is that the faster we grow because of the nature of the business, we book all of our distribution expense up front. And so fast growth puts very, very big pressure and it's really quite impressive the business is performing the way it is given the high sales growth and the high revenue growth. So we hope that, that doesn't happen any time in the near future, but that would be probably the largest single source of operating leverage and margin improvement someday down the road is slower growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. I was just wondering if you could provide some more color on [Audio Gap]. We saw that decline 50 basis points this quarter. Was there any large client? Or was it mostly in the small and medium businesses?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So as you know, we typically don't get into specifics around where our retention is going up or down. And so the good news is that for several quarters as retention went up, we didn't get into the details and didn't brag. And so we're going to take the same approach today, which is this has happened before. I think it was probably 4, 5 quarters ago where we do have variability and it does tend to happen more in the upmarket where, when transactions or deals are large enough, they can move the needle in any 1 quarter. But today, we have really nothing to report other than, on a year-to-date basis, we're still about 10 basis points above last year and still at record levels. And so I think Jan put it well, which is we're going to obviously watch this very, very carefully and we are obviously watching it and digging in and looking at to see if there's anything underneath the covers. But we spend a lot of time on this topic. And today, we really don't have anything to report other than the usual fluctuations in the business. I don't know if, Jan, you have...","Jan Siegmund","I think, in particular, between the second and the third quarter, you should be aware there can be timing of losses between those 2 quarters. So we -- the more reliable number is really the year-to-date number because we can have timing differences and prior year timing differences that make the quarterly number a little bit harder to interpret, so that I don't think we should put -- other than you pay attention to your retention, put -- read too much into it one way or the other.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And I think we said in prior calls that of all -- as people think about us going forward, including at Investor Day, this is not a place where we are making assumptions of 1 to 2 percentage points of retention improvement over the next 2 or 3 years. We've been in this business for so long that we know exactly what is realistic and reasonable and what isn't. And it's possible that as we go through these migrations, that we end up in a different place with a higher potential retention rate than what we've had historically because we'll be in a stronger competitive position. But from here to there, it's still multiyears, and from here to there, there's going to be turbulence as we go through some of these migrations. So we're not giving up and are not saying that there isn't a potential higher absolute retention rate that could be achievable, but we have enough experience and know enough to tell you that, and we've said it multiple times in prior calls, that when we are at record client retention levels, that is not the time to be factoring in big increases in retention going forward.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just quickly, on Europe, I was wondering if you could provide some more color on the European business and how do the people control trending in Europe?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So coincidentally, I happened to be in Europe last week and the environment in Europe is obviously, from an employment standpoint, not fabulous: slow GDP growth, high unemployment, and relatively, the labor markets experience enough friction that it's not a place where you have big fluctuations either up or down. So the good news is as the economy tends to weaken in Europe, you don't have the same level of decrease of employment and layoffs that you have -- it takes a little longer. Having said that, the absolute levels of unemployment and the absolute levels of GDP are not attractive backdrops for those markets for us. And for our total international business, Europe is the largest single segment of our international business by a long shot. So we do have a fair amount of exposure there as you've noticed from the FX pressure that we just experienced. But relative to other companies, it's relatively contained. We have less than 20% of our revenues coming from our international business and only a portion of that is from Europe. But having said that, my view of Europe is that -- and it's a big continent so it's hard to make a generalization. But overall, when you consider the backdrop and the macroeconomic environment, I would say it's been outstanding performance in the business in terms of new business sales, client retention and revenue growth. So as we've said in prior quarters, it's not necessarily additive. Europe has not been additive to our growth rate from a revenue standpoint, but it is positive. And relative to what you hear in terms of other stories, of other situations in other industries, we're very, very pleased with the performance of that business and the leadership there. So one of the interesting things that I saw when I was visiting Europe as I spent some time in the U.K., and the U.K. is actually a nice example of what might be achievable for us over the next 10 to 20 years. In the U.K., we have strong product from a technology standpoint. We have Money Movement operations that are generating float income. We have time and attendance systems that we have now added, along with HR, to our payroll to really create an HCM solution. And so it's really a great example of what I think might be achievable for us worldwide and creates some potential growth opportunity for us for many, many years to come because it's really a replication of a little bit of what we've done in the U.S. Obviously, every country and every situation is going to be different in terms of the product needs and the regulatory environment, but in general, I think it supports the notion that the ADP model is replicable in other parts of the world where we have very, very low market share today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from Robert W Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","With regards to international, just a little more color, if you could, with regards to what you're seeing in terms of the play or the strategy in terms of expanding globally. Can you give us some sense in terms of what sort of deals you're seeing? What the pipeline looks like? How quickly you think you may be able to expand and ramp that?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We appreciate all the questions about international because we do tend to be creatures of habit here and focus a lot on our U.S. business, which obviously is our most mature business, but our biggest opportunities undoubtedly from a growth standpoint are outside of the U.S., and I'm talking 5, 10, 20 years down the road. The biggest single positive thing that we're seeing right now is our multinational solutions. So I also spent some time when I was in Europe in Prague, where we have a high concentration of our multinational solutions folks working, providing service there and from a service -- from a Center of Excellence. And the performance of our multinational business is really quite phenomenal. And I remember 2 or 3 years ago, every quarter getting questions about whether GlobalView was going to be profitable or when it was going to break even and so forth, and I'm not going to get into the details of the profitability of GlobalView, but the way it always happens in business, once things get paused and no one stops -- no one continues to ask questions about it. But it was a very, very positive view in Prague because the NPS scores of that multinational business -- and we define multinational as not just GlobalView, but also our Streamline solutions because clients don't care whether it's GlobalView or Streamline. They see it as one integrated multinational solution. And the NPS scores there are, particularly on the GlobalView platform side, are up. Again, I'm not going to get into the specifics, but they're up a lot versus 3 or 4 years ago. Profitability, it's not just a break-even business anymore; it's a very profitable business. Growth, strong double-digit growth in that business. That's a business that, it's approaching, including its backlog, around $0.5 billion business still growing nicely and still every quarter generating new clients that are really the who's who of the Global 100. So it's just a phenomenal opportunity for us, the multinational opportunity overall. In addition to that, what we're doing to some of our platforms in North America and probably eventually we'll do some of the same things to some of our more in-country, best-of-breed solutions is allowing those platforms to also be global. So for example, being able to -- without having to move to necessarily a multinational solution, having Vantage or Workforce Now have global capabilities is something that we have now that we believe will drive some additional opportunity for us in North America. So the whole global landscape, I think, is an important one for ADP over the next X number of decades and we're still on it. Even though we tend to be creatures of habit and go back to talking about balances in the U.S. and growth of our sales in Employer Services domestically, it's a very, very important part of our future and we're still focused on it. Obviously, the fact that the European business, which is a significant part of our company -- I'm sorry, a significant part of our international results, has had the kind of economic backdrop that it has had, has probably caused us to be less talkative about our international business, but we're not any less excited about it. I think Latin America and Asia also continue to grow very rapidly. But again, they're so small still in relative terms to $11 billion as a total company that it's just going to take a while for us to be able to report that it's actually having a significant impact on the overall results. I don't know, Jan, if you have anything you want to add on the international front.","Jan Siegmund","No, I think that the multinational is the key driver for us, and ADP is the clear market leader in that space. And that drives that multinational business that is now close to $0.5 billion, so that's really what makes it successful.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's great to hear. And then just a follow-up, you mentioned Vantage and the potential to take that international. Can you just give us a progress report on Vantage? You've done such a great job on RUN and Workforce Now. Where do we stand with Vantage?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes, let me just clarify. It's really -- providing global capabilities to Vantage is different from taking it internationally, although I guess that's semantics, but I just want to make sure that I clarify that.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Understood.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that Vantage continues to perform well. We believe that for -- based on the track that we're on now in terms of sales year-to-date, that we will have good growth of Vantage over the prior year in terms of new business sales. We have a couple of hundred clients sold, I think over 100 now implemented. So we're very -- we continue to be very excited. That's our strategic platform in the upmarket, and we think it's continuing to perform well. I think Jan mentioned the attach rates. It's very, very exciting for us to see attach rates in the kind of 70 percentage range for, I believe that's for benefits -- sorry, for time and attendance. And then benefits and talent and HR are like -- HR is automatically part, it's 100% attached. But when you look at talent and benefits in the 60s, I think 60 percentage range, those are much higher attach rates than when we used to sell a separate payroll module with a separate benefits platform with a separate time and attendance system. So this seamless integration works and it's driving higher attach rates, and I think it's also driving stronger value proposition in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies.","Ryan Cary - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Ryan Cary for Jason. I was just hoping you could just speak to some of the trends in new business bookings. I know growth in the first half of the year came against a weaker comparison, at least compared to the 14% in third quarter of '14. Is the third quarter 6% due primarily to the tougher comp? Or is there something else? And just rough ask, it looks like the guidance suggests about 8% in the fourth quarter. How should we be thinking about this number trending as we, say, get beyond '15?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So it's a good question. This may help you, that the 6% was actually exactly 100% of our plan for sales for the third quarter. So I think that, that's probably an indication that it was in line with our expectations. We always like to be positively surprised, but we knew that we had a 14% growth rate last year in the third quarter -- is it -- was it 14%? 14% in the third quarter last year, which is, at our size -- again, we're selling $1.6 billion annually. So the quarter obviously is approximately 1\/4 of that. These are big numbers. And so when you have a 14% growth -- again, we've been doing this long enough that we know, as you can tell from the planning process, a planned 6% growth and so -- and I think we tried to telegraph that and signal it as best we could in the March Analyst Day and through other means. So I think we're exactly on plan. Very excited that we're 11% year-to-date compared to 8% last year, year-to-date. So we are nothing but positive and bullish on our sales force and our distribution, and I think the trends are positive. We're -- I don't know how else to, I guess, to put it. Like we're -- at this size, I'm just thrilled that we can get double-digit sales growth because that is exactly what we need to drive the financial results that we're trying to drive for our shareholders.","Ryan Cary - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. And just as a follow-up. At the recent Analyst Day, you spoke a lot about the new technology and offerings, particularly speaking about big data and analytics. When do you believe these could be needle-moving to results? Or do you see these offerings more along the lines of helping to win new clients?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think winning new clients would be needle-moving. I think that's what -- I think that it's a part of the ongoing, I think, desire to create a stronger value proposition and to differentiate ourselves. So I think that if you hear a slight change in our tone as we keep talking about HCM and about helping our clients build better workforces and also focusing on their business results, that's really where the big data comes into play. Like, we think that besides the traditional strength that we have around operating efficiencies and compliance, all the things that we're traditionally known for, for getting mission-critical employment-related tasks done, in addition to that, if we can help our clients do better by giving them more information to make better decisions around their people, we think that creates a stronger value proposition and should lead to more client wins and hopefully higher market share. Because at the end of the day, we talked about this at Analyst Day, there really is no company where the people are not the most important asset. Even if you employ a lot of equipment and you're a manufacturer, at the end of the day because of what's happening with technology, people are the difference maker. And so hiring the best people, keeping the best people and making sure that you are -- that they have the proper training and that you are tracking their performance and compensating them the right way through compensation systems and managing that talent, these are all crucial parts of our HCM strategy that we think are going to drive additional sales in the form of new client wins and hopefully a slightly better market share over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research","Jan, in your remarks, when you were talking about the funds-held balances, you mentioned something about lower balances because of SUI tax rates going down. I just want to confirm that, if you can give a little bit more color. And is this an issue that we need to think about in the upcoming quarters as well?","Jan Siegmund","Yes, I think we adjusted our forecast for the client-fund balances to the lower end. So the SUI impact is traditionally the biggest impact in the third quarter. These are the withholding rates for unemployment taxes, and if the economy improves, traditionally, SUI rate should go down because the high employment and unemployment funds are better funded as a consequence. So that was a large driver for the decline this quarter. And we have also actually measurable impact on the growth due to the currency translation that we have for our Canadian client fund balances that actually impacted the overall growth. So I think that's going to be to-be-continued for sure in the fourth quarter, and then we'll give guidance for '15 in August.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And I think one thing that I need just to add because I think a number of people here hate it when I do this, but I just can't resist. Reminding you that in fiscal year '08, we generated $691 million from the net client funds strategy on approximately $15 billion of balances. In fiscal year '15, we'll generate around $420 million on $22 billion of balances, and I think that just shows the magnitude of what's happened in terms of our yield going from 4.4% in fiscal year '08 to 1.89% today in fiscal year '15. And we have no expectations that we're going to achieve 4.4% any time in the near future, so we get that. But I just want to make sure that everyone understands the magnitude of the pressure that we've been able to get ourselves through here and the potential opportunity down the road because our balances obviously have grown despite this little hiccup with unemployment in the quarter, which, frankly, tends to happen every time there's an employment cycle that's improving, and it's just very hard to predict exactly where that state unemployment level is going to come down. But overall, our balances are still up from $15.7 billion to $22.1 billion, and unfortunately, interest rates have not cooperated with us during that period of time. But I think history tells us that we will have our day.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research","Okay, appreciate you pointing that out again. And actually, just shifting gears back to the discussion about your international business. If I remember correctly, you get about 11% or 12% of your total revenues from Europe. Is there a major difference between your Employer Services and your PEO Services in terms of the exposure there?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","The PEO has no exposure outside of the U.S. I don't know if that was the question, but the PEO is an only-U.S. business, not even North America. It's U.S.-only business. So there's no exposure internationally and we really don't break out -- Employer Services is reported as one segment from a segment reporting standpoint, but I think that you're generally correct or close in percentage that Europe would represent of our overall results.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research","Okay. I just wanted to make sure there weren't any other HCM businesses in the PEO segment. It doesn't sound like there is.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","No, it is an HCM business. There's no possible way because it does everything. It's already like a bundle from -- all the way from recruitment to retirement.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I like your new tagline, by the way. Can you give an idea of -- as you're driving these substantially increased attach rates, what type of revenue uplift you're looking for or aspiring for, like sort of in the ideal scenario where a client buys kind of like the full suite as you've got it defined today?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, obviously, it clearly depends on whether they buy 1, 2 or 3 additional modules in addition to kind of our core payroll. But again, just to put it into context so -- because, again, because of the way our business model works, these things take time and work slowly over time. But in -- as an example, the older platforms that we have where the clients have only payroll, when they migrate over to a new platform if they purchase a couple of additional modules, you can literally get, in some cases, up to 2x or 3x revenue multiple. Not every client that migrates does that. Some purchase one module, some purchase 2 models. But the numbers are fairly significant and we have not only kind of a traditional HCM modules that people can purchase and attach on to, but we are releasing obviously new products as things go forward like, for example, our Health Compliance solutions are an additional charge and they're not really in the category of benefits or time and attendance. They are an additional sale, if you will, that people can purchase that adds also to the overall revenue number. And I think if I'm not mistaken, Jan, maybe can help me, but I think -- I can't remember what the percentages of our new sales come from, I guess, additional attach rates versus -- but it's a fairly healthy number.","Jan Siegmund","It's a healthy number. I think we roughly say 50%-50% new clients versus incremental business to it, although the consideration has to be that in the lower end, it's clearly much higher on acquiring new clients; whereas on the upper end, as you know, we serve 90% of the Fortune 100 companies. So there's a -- naturally it will be almost all incremental and upsell. So it shifts fairly smoothly from small to low in how we distribute, but a very important component is selling incremental modules to our existing clients.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And I think that -- that was my recollection, is around 50-50. And just to be clear in terms of what our strategic objective is, which is not to have that number become 40-60 or 30-70. We want to grow both and so we are -- part of what we're driving around our technology solutions and our investments in product is that we want to win market share, and we want to win additional clients. We also want to benefit from these higher attach rates, which we are benefiting from. But one of the very, very important objectives that we have internally is to really be much more attentive to unit growth and to market share. And the good news is that, that's been a pretty good story here for the last few years, but we're going to still stay focused on that because we're not trying only to grow through higher attach rates.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Terrific. And then, you've been a little bit quiet so far on M&A. Can you just give us an update on if there's particular areas you're looking at for acquisitions either product or geography, I suppose?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Other than telling you we're not the ones buying Salesforce.com, I don't -- we really don't have much to add versus what we said at the March analyst meeting, which is we recognize, again, because of our capital situation, that we have capital, that we can deploy in a variety of ways in terms of returning cash to shareholders, but also reinvesting in the business organically and also potentially for M&A. But I think we've become -- I think we've put ourselves in a box, so to speak, because we have to be very, very careful and very, very disciplined because it's going to be hard for me to convince you that it made sense to buy another payroll platform or another benefit platform and that, that makes sense for us. And I'm making it even harder for myself now that I'm saying this on a call because it's not our strategy. Our strategy is to create seamless, integrated solutions that we build ourselves organically, right, and that have an incredible UI and an incredible experience from a user standpoint for the clients and for the employees of our clients. So creating more migration issues and more platform proliferation is not our #1 objective. Having said that, you should know that we are actively looking at things and actively in the market because you never say never and you have to be willing to accept the fact that we're not great at everything and so we know that. And so as long as something fits into our strategic direction and as long as it's on our terms, we're going to use our capital. But today, we have nothing to report.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt O'Neill from Autonomous Research.","Matthew O'Neill - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","You answered most of my questions already, but I figured just to round out the discussion on international, if you could just add a little bit more color to the LATAM discussion or the weakness there that you mentioned. Is that just macro FX based? Or is there anything else to think about there?","Jan Siegmund","I think we mentioned Latin America because, in prior calls, we talked about the success story that Brazil really was for us over the last few years with very high growth rates and great performance. And the current slowdown in Latin America, I think, particularly in Brazil, is mostly due to the softening of the economic environment in that country. So there's really not -- it's not that material actually to the overall result, but we felt it was consistent as we had bragged about it and talked about the success in prior quarters that we would update also when it's getting a little bit slower.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And if we brag about the progress of GlobalView or our multinational solutions over multiple years, we have to brag about Brazil as well. So there's no question that a good economic environment there, prior to this last year or 2, helped a little bit. But we have a great team there that's executing very well and has helped us expand into a few other countries in South America. And so we're still long term very bullish on the management team there and on the business there. But I think Jan is correct that I think we have to make sure that we help you understand kind of where things are going in terms of the different parts of our business. But we're still incredibly excited about what they've accomplished. Again, not for today, it's too much detail, but the last 5 years have been an amazing run for that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore ISI, Research Division","I apologize if this has been addressed since I did join a little late from another call, but I noticed, Jan, you raised your ES pretax margin expansion target to 125 basis points. And my question is, does this represent the beginning of a more aggressive margin expansion trajectory for this business longer term? And if so, what would be the underlying drivers behind that?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It probably depends on who you ask. So Jan is over here smiling, thinking, yes, it does and I'm over here saying, no, it doesn't. And I think the truth is somewhere in between. Clearly, this business is performing better than it was sometime back from a margin standpoint. Some of that, in all fairness, is that we've -- our organic growth strategy, I think, has helped a little bit in the sense that we were relatively acquisitive in Employer Services over the years and that generally added margin pressure to us year-to-year. And eventually, those acquisitions helped with scale and should have been helping to drive margin, but it's just hard with a lot of M&A activity and a lot of noise in the system and a lot of platforms to drive good margin improvements. So I think that we haven't necessarily made huge progress, with the exception of EasyPay and a few other places on the migration front, but we certainly slowed the proliferation and the increase of, which I think creates a better backdrop for Employer Services to drive margin improvement. I think the second thing like I did with the PEO or with Brazil or with GlobalView, you've got to give credit to the people running those businesses. So there's really, really good execution on the ground as well. So having said all that, I really appreciate the question because it's important for people to get the tone from us, and I think Jan and I are on the same page, which is that you should not expect this kind of margin improvement in the future because we like -- or I, like many of my predecessors, are incredibly sensitive to making sure that we manage this business for the long term. And the long term doesn't mean like the next quarter; it means 3, 5, 10, 20 years down the road. And if you extrapolate 125 basis point margin improvement over 20 years, it becomes very, very difficult to believe. And so we are very, very committed to reinvesting in our business and that would make me nervous about pushing too hard on the margin front. So I guess the best way to answer this is that we're very, very comfortable with the guidance that we gave in March, which I believe was 50 to 75 basis point margin improvement over multiple years, and we're also very comfortable with the guidance that we've given for this year and we would not encourage you to focus on 1 quarter.","David Togut - Evercore ISI, Research Division","That's very helpful. I asked the question, in part, given the increase in activism we're seeing in the sector, particularly among your former colleagues at Dealer Services.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on the retention side. Any change in -- I've been giving this question a lot, any change in level of competitiveness from your rivals? I know Ultimate highlighted its largest win in their quarter. So any thoughts there, pricing, et cetera?","Jan Siegmund","Well, look at the discount levels that we have in our sales, that's really unchanged year-over-year. So that substantiates our earlier comment that the competitive situation continues to be intense, but it has not dramatically changed over time. And we do focus on some of our key competitors, not naming any, and we have seen improvements for some of our competitors and we have improved our own performance, which we are very pleased with.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. So no real change then. It sounds like an intensity from the usual suspects. Is that fair?","Jan Siegmund","Overall, yes. But as the portfolio has many competitors, some that you might be interested, I think we are doing pretty well actually.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Yes, that's historically been the case. I figured I'd ask. Just as a follow-up then, any change in ADP's share of wins coming from your referral partners?","Jan Siegmund","Well, the referral partners are particularly important in our Small Business segment, and we're pleased with the channel -- the channels that we have built out. And they're wide ranging from banks over accountants to other referral channels, and they are an important source of our success in the downmarket.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And what the good news is, I think that some of that, as we've tried to become more \"One ADP\", some of the success I think is starting to move up into -- for example, the person who's running our Small Business division is now running our mid-market business. I think those types of things help in terms of spreading some of this knowledge of how much strong referral networks can help. So I think our mid-market business is -- now has a very robust referral network with insurance agents and brokers, in addition to traditional accountants that I think is helping that business as well. And in the upmarket, we have improved -- I think there's, again, nothing dramatic to report, but really improved the focus there with working with third parties as well including, for example, we created a little private equity group that works with private equity firms to help there as well.","Operator","And our final question comes from Mark Marcon from Robert W Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just wanted to come back to the retention question. A year ago, in the third quarter, you had an 80 bp increase in your client retention. So it seems like it's a pretty tough comp. I was just wondering if you could kind of frame on a dollar basis where your retention is currently running and what a reasonable expectation is from a longer-term perspective.","Jan Siegmund","Mark, I don't give you -- won't give you the dollar numbers, but maybe to help you, which I tried to explain earlier, this is -- what you're alluding in the compare to the third quarter prior year is definitely true. It's more difficult to compare with improvement of retention rate in the third quarter last year, and that retention rate may have been impacted if you look sequentially also. So you have to have a look sequential retention rates and year-over-year compare, which makes this a harder quarter to do so, but -- and you have natural variation in retention rates by quarter because some deals can move it. All these, together, make it risky, even if I were to give you these dollars to correctly interpret them. It's better to think about year-to-date in larger loss dollars aggregating to a total here for the good insight.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, I was just thinking about percentage -- overall percentage retention.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We don't give that quarterly. We only provide that once a year. But again, our forecast is -- again our internal forecast, we have 1 quarter left and so if we had something dramatic to report, we would. So I think that we expect to have retention be where we expected it to be for the year.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Which was?","Jan Siegmund","Which is I think we guided to prior year.","Sara Grilliot","We actually don't guide.","Jan Siegmund","We don't guide, but about record high.","Sara Grilliot","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program back over to Mr. Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So thank you for joining us today for the call. I think just a couple of points. One is, as you can tell, we continue to be very, very sensitive to making sure that we're treating our shareholders well. We said that we were going to return the $825 million dividend that we've received from CDK and we did that via the share repurchase that exceeded the $1.1 billion. And so I think you'll continue to see us focusing on returning capital to our shareholders. The other thing that I just wanted to mention is we really had the same kind of pressures that everyone else is having from foreign currency translation and we may not have focused as much as others, but very, very pleased that despite that pressure, which was significant both on the top line and on the bottom line, that our year-to-date performance was -- I'm sorry, that our quarter performance and our year-to-date performance are strong as they are. So I believe that, that is evidence that we continue to execute well against our HCM strategy. We appreciate the time today, and we look forward to having you join us again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program.

Please go ahead.","Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining ADP's first-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call and webcast. With me today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jan Siegmund, our Chief Financial Officer.","Earlier this morning we released our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. These materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find quarterly investor presentation that accompanies today's call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment.","During our call today we will reference non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items in the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2019 as well as the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2018.

Accordingly, we have provided you with additional slides in our accompanying investor presentation which we believe will help enhance the understanding of these new disclosures. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported our first quarter fiscal 2019 results with revenue of $3.3 billion, up 8% reported and 7% organic constant currency. We are pleased with this revenue growth which was above our expectations and which was aided in part by the better-than-expected performance of our PEO segment and continued strengthen our Employer Services downmarket offerings.","Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 28% to $1.20 per share and in addition to strong revenue and margin performance benefited from fewer shares outstanding as well as a lower effective tax rate.","We also so positive momentum in our Employer Services new business bookings which grew 8% in the first quarter, slightly ahead of our expectations. In addition while we no longer report consolidated bookings, we were especially pleased that the renewed momentum in our PEO from last quarter has continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with strong double digit bookings growth. In both Employer Services and the PEO, we once again saw improvements in our overall client satisfaction scores and we also continue to expect a 25 basis point to 50 basis point improvement in ES revenue retention for fiscal 2019.","Overall, we are pleased with our start to the fiscal year which supports our confidence in our long-term strategy and our efforts to accelerate our pace of change with care.","At our June Investor Day, we had the opportunity to discuss with you our efforts around innovation and we were excited to continue those discussions in September when we attended HR Tech in Las Vegas and the following week at our annual Industry Analyst Day at our Chelsea innovation Lab. At each of these events we discussed our transformation from a service company supported by technology, to a technology company that offers great service, one with a proven ability to anticipate the changing demands of employers from small businesses to global enterprises.","Our transformation is taking place in the midst of a rapidly evolving landscape. Quite literally, the evolution of work is redefining how work gets done. We believe in our innovation journey and in the opportunities it represents for our clients and our stakeholders. At ADP we embrace this kind of change and we are excited about what it means for our business and our growth. Change has always served as a driving force behind our innovative spirit and we were thrilled to take home this year's HR Tech Awesome New Tech award for Wisely by ADP, our unique way to help workers manage their financial wellness needs.","This is ADP's fourth consecutive year winning this category, an unparalleled accomplishment among HCM companies. Each year that we have earned this award, we find ourselves in the company of impressive tech start-ups, underscoring that while we are big we are also innovative and nimble.","At our Industry Analyst Day we hosted more than 20 HCM industry analysts and similar to what we shared with many of you at our Investor Day, we discussed with them our next-gen HCM solutions. We were pleased with the reception that we received as we firmly believe that our solutions are uniquely built to address the key challenges and needs of an increasingly complex and rapidly changing world of work. In fact, one well-respected analyst summarized this point after the event when he described our new platforms as the disruption that could change the entire HCM market.","We are excited to have several clients live on our new platforms and we continue to make good progress on our targets and our development efforts. As the traditional model of work continues to evolve, it is being augmented by new pay-on-demand model which is beginning to replace traditional weekly and biweekly payrolls. With this evolution in mind, we are excited about our development efforts to build and scale our new payroll and tax engines which are designed to provide full payroll calculations in real time at the individual worker level.","Taking this a step further with Wisely by ADP, employers of any size and industry can today have access to tools to better engage their workforce by providing attractive services such as instant pay, access to a digital wallet, and other financial management and wellness features.","In addition to leading with great technology, we are leveraging our unmatched data set to empower our clients, HR practitioners and business leaders with actionable insights. ADP pays one in six U.S. employees and this scale drives unmatched depth to the insights we can offer through our DataCloud and benchmarking solutions. One such solution which is already integrated into the ADP Mobile Solutions app is our executive and manager insights tool which leverages machine learning to continually sift through wage, time, location, industry and many other types of data to uncover insights that HR leaders can use to make better, faster and smarter decisions.","During the quarter we also completed our acquisition of Celergo, a provider of multicountry payroll management services. The acquisition further solidifies our global HCM leadership position and enhances our ability to deliver multicountry payroll solutions with a strong platform and new capabilities including cross-currency and ex-pat payment services. In addition to these new offerings, Celergo also extends our footprint to over 140 countries and brings with it a talented team with significant experience in multicountry payroll, which remains a key area of opportunity for ADP. We are incredibly excited about the potential of Celergo and other recent investments and acquisitions including Global Cash Card and WorkMarket which collectively expand our ability to address a changing workforce that is increasingly global, freelance and in demand of flexible payment solutions.","Now I'd like to touch on some of the key initiatives coming out of our transformation office which has been helping to formalize, structure and create the accountability needed to achieve our financial objectives. While our transformation continues to progress at a healthy pace, we are being careful to balance speed with care, underscoring our focus on the long-term and our commitment not to compromise quality for short-term gains.","Maintaining the highest standards for our clients, associates and shareholders is our utmost priority and we are pleased with our ability to execute on our transformation objectives while also driving improvements in client satisfaction, productivity and the associate experience. Our voluntary early retirement program is progressing as planned. We remain focused on managing this initiative in an orderly and timely manner. Additionally through our service alignment initiative, we continue to reduce our footprint in subscale locations and at our new strategic service locations, we are seeing greater efficiency and collaboration which is helping to enhance the level of service we provide our clients.","Before I turn the call over to Jan, I'd like to highlight that we were recently named 2018 Working Mother 100 Best Company. As a leader in the HR community, this is an especially great honor and I'm thrilled to see ADP receive the credit for creating an inclusive and diverse workplace where everyone can bring their best self to work each day. I am proud to lead a company that values the contribution of every individual and has a proven track record for attracting and retaining top talent. This allows us to remain competitive in a dynamic HCM market and has a profound impact on our continued growth and success. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for his commentary on our first quarter results and fiscal 2019 outlook.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Our consolidated revenue this quarter was $3.3 billion, up 8% reported and 7% organic constant currency, both above expectations. On a reported basis, earnings before income taxes increased 14% while our adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT increased 18%. Adjusted EBIT margin was slightly above our expectation and was up about 180 basis points compared to last year's fiscal quarter despite about 50 basis points of pressure from acquisitions and a $12 million charge related to the write-off of certain internally-developed software costs following our acquisition of Celergo.","Overall, our margin performance continues to benefit from improvements in our IT infrastructure spend, the lapping of dual operating costs related to our service alignment initiative and the successful execution of our broader transformation initiatives including our voluntary early retirement program. We were also particularly pleased with our international businesses where the results of our automation efforts continue to generate positive momentum. Clearly, our efforts to reduce our costs while also improving our service are beginning to pay off and we are pleased with the progress that we're making.","Our adjusted effective tax rate was positively impacted by unplanned stock compensation tax benefits which drove approximately 330 basis points of benefit for the quarter or $0.05 on our adjusted diluted earnings per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 28% to $1.20 and, in addition from benefiting from our margin performance and a lower effective tax rate, was also aided by fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. As you can tell from these overall results, we are off to a good start this year and we're progressing well as we execute on our strategic plans that we outlined at our June Investor Day.","Now let me take you through our segment results. For Employer Services, revenues grew 7% for the quarter, 6% organic constant currency, both ahead of our expectations. Interest from client funds grew 19% and benefited from a 30 basis points improvement in the average yield earned on our client fund investments and growth in average client fund balances of about 5% compared to a year ago. This growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control, offset by pressure from the corporate tax reform and lower state unemployment insurance collections. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.4% for the quarter.","Our international solutions continued to perform well supported by the continued strong double digit growth of our multinational offerings. Investing in our global solutions and leveraging our global presence to service our clients wherever they do business remains a key strategic pillar for us and we were especially pleased this quarter to be able to complete our recent strategic acquisition of Celergo to further complement our offerings in this space.","Moving on to Employer Services margin, we saw an increase of about 260 basis points in the quarter, which included approximately 90 basis points of pressure from the impact of acquisitions. As you will recall, our voluntary early retirement program is being managed over the course of multiple phases throughout this fiscal year. As we progress against our backfill targets for the year, this quarter we saw benefits from early exits which we do not anticipate to carry forward into the remainder of the fiscal year as we accelerate our targeted backfill hiring plans.","PEO revenue grew 10% for the quarter with average worksite employees growing 9% to 528,000. Following a difficult fiscal year 2018 in the 50-employee and above market, we were pleased to see signs of a continued recovery in our PEO new business bookings this quarter and also some early signs of improvements in our client retention. While we are pleased with this performance, it's also important to remember that we're nearing the calendar end when clients in our industries are more likely to reevaluate their provider.","The PEO segment's margins increased 110 basis points for the quarter and benefited from operating leverage and selling efficiencies, partially offset by the impact from changes in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity.","Now on to our fiscal year 2019 outlook. This quarter I would like to start first by talking about the segment outlook before we move on to our consolidated outlook. As a reminder, as of last quarter we are providing incremental guidance for our segment revenue in particular. We believe you will find this helpful and we encourage you to leverage this and the long-term revenue model that we shared at our Investor Day.","With that said, let's discuss our outlook. While our first quarter Employer Services revenue growth was ahead of our expectations, we now anticipate incremental pressure from FX as the year progresses. We also want to remind you that we are lapping our acquisition of Global Cash Card in the second quarter, and as such we continue to expect 4% to 6% revenue growth for the ES segment.","We still anticipate growth of 2.5% in our pays per control metric. There's no change in our forecasted growth of ES new business bookings of 6% to 8% and we continue to anticipate a more difficult grow-over in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Carlos mentioned, we also continue to anticipate an increase in ES retention of 25 basis points to 50 basis points for fiscal year 2019.","Finally while our ES margins were stronger than expected this quarter, we continue to anticipate a ramp-up in resources as we execute on our backfill hiring plans related to our voluntary early retirement program. As such, we do not anticipate as strong a margin expansion in the latter half of the fiscal year 2018 as we saw in the first quarter, and therefore we continue to anticipate full year margin expansion of about 150 basis points to 175 basis points inclusive of 50 basis points of acquisition drag.","With that said, let's now touch on the PEO. We now expect 8% to 9% PEO revenue growth in fiscal year 2019 driven by 8% to 9% growth in average worksite employees as compared to our prior forecasted increase of 7% to 9% for revenue and 7% to 8% for average worksite employees. As Carlos mentioned, we have seen some progress in our PEO bookings this quarter following some of our targeted adjustments that we made last year to our PEO distribution process. We now expect to see a slight improvement in our PEO performance relative to prior expectations. With that said, we had a fairly strong second quarter revenue growth last year driven in part by a combination of solid worksite employee growth and strong pass-throughs.","With these adjustments in mind, we now anticipate 6% to 7% growth in the PEO revenues excluding zero margin pass-throughs as compared to our prior forecast of 5% to 7%. As a reminder, the reason this growth is slightly below that of average worksite employees is due to the impact in fiscal year 2019 from the decline in our workers' compensation and SUI rates relative to fiscal year 2018. This does not affect the administrative services pricing environment which has remained a stable contributor to our overall revenue growth.","Last quarter we received a few questions regarding our new pass-through disclosures. With that in mind in our effort to help you better understand the dynamics that we anticipate experiencing this year, we have provided you with some additional details in the appendix of our quarterly investor presentation. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with these slides as they help to illustrate the impact from lower workers' compensation and SUI rates as well as other drivers in the business.","Moving on to PEO margins. With the better than expected performance in our PEO margin this quarter, we now expect 50 points to 25 points margin decrease as compared to our prior forecasted decrease of 75 basis points to 50 basis points.","For the reasons we mentioned before, we continue to anticipate our voluntary early retirement backfill hiring to accelerate over the next few months. Accordingly, we do not expect this quarter's margin overperformance to carry fully through for the remainder of the year.","Finally, I would like to remind you that the results of ADP Indemnity are now recorded within the PEO segment. This quarter, we had lower than anticipated grow-over pressure from adjustments to our loss reserve estimates, and as a result we now anticipate approximately 50 basis points of grow-over pressure on a full year basis as compared to our prior forecast of approximately 75 basis points.","Moving on to the consolidated outlook, we now anticipate total revenue growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2019 with the upper end of our forecast range dependent on the continued steady improvements in the performance of our PEO. We are now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to increase $90 million to $100 million compared to our prior forecasted increase of $80 million to $90 million. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is now expected to be up $70 million to $80 million compared to the prior forecasted increase of $60 million to $70 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides in our Investor Relations website.","We continue to anticipate that our adjusted EBIT margin to expand 100 basis points to 125 basis points including approximately 30 basis points of pressure from acquisitions. With the impact of the first quarter stock compensation related tax benefit, we now expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 24.5% in fiscal year 2019 as compared to our prior adjusted effective tax rate of 25.1%.","With these various adjustments to our outlook, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 15% to 17%.","Overall, I think you can tell we are happy with our start into the year and with the continued momentum that we're building from our investments in the business. We are executing well on our key initiatives and we were pleased to see a positive trend in our bookings this quarter. So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Please ask one question with a brief follow-up. We will take our first question from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Nice job here. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the bookings here. So you came in at the high end of the full year range in Q1, but based on the disclosures you gave us on ES bookings for last year, obviously the comps actually get a lot harder, especially in the back half, which you highlighted. It sounds like you've got a lot of confidence still in the 6% to 8%. Anything you'd highlight from a pipeline perspective, whether it's downmarket, mid-market, enterprise, et cetera? Just supporting that confidence in the full year number? Thanks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think our confidence is really driven by, I guess the information that we have around where we are around head count, where we are around kind of new product rollouts and where we are around productivity improvements, which are the three ways that we add up to the overall sales growth.","As you know, it can vary from quarter to quarter, but I think we have \u2013 we've built a great plan, I think with the right number of people, I think with the right products, and I think we've shown over the last probably three to four quarters, I think, really improvements in underlying productivity that then support that third pillar of what leads to the overall growth.","So I think we feel \u2013 I think you're right that the tone is probably one of confidence, but as always, for us, the sales number is the one that has the most variability and the most volatility because every sale is a new sale every quarter, whereas in \u2013 our revenue model is really a recurring revenue model. So there's always more variability in sales, but I would say nothing has changed in terms of the level of confidence that we have in our ability to reach our full year numbers.","We did have a very strong fourth quarter. Sometimes, historically, that has led to challenges in the first quarter just because of the way our incentives work. So in some respects, I would probably say that I was pleased with the fact that we were able to \u2013 even though we had an easier comparison to the prior year, the fact that we came off of a very strong fourth quarter, I think sometimes presents some headwinds. So the ability to kind of hit the numbers that we did this quarter, which as you're seeing obviously Employer Services number, but as Jan maybe alluded to, even though we're not giving specific guidance, our PEO results were also very strong.","So when you look at f new business bookings collectively, if you did it the way we used to do it, which we're not doing anymore, we would say that we were extremely pleased and it adds to our confidence for the full year.","Jason Kupferberg - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. And let me just \u2013 yes. Please, go ahead, Jan. Sorry.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","One comment is that the success was fairly broad-based and so when I look at the different components of our sales force, the different channels and the different market segments that we sell into, it was really a broad-based contribution of many. So it was not focused on a single segment at all actually and broad-based participation is always a good start into the year.","Jason Kupferberg - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","For sure. Let me just ask a follow-up on PEO since you highlighted that. And I know last quarter, there was a little bit of controversy or concern there. Clearly, a nice rebound so just wanted to test the sustainability of that. Maybe you can talk about some of the strategies that you've employed to actually drive the improved performance and the outlook there. I think last quarter you were talking about tweaking some incentive programs, but any other strategies you would highlight there?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, I think that Jan probably has a couple of comments as well, but I would say that we did tweak the incentives. I would say that that's beginning to roll its way through, but I wouldn't say \u2013 I wish I could say that it all was because of how smart we were in changing those incentives, but I think we see big improvements in pipeline in the upmarket as a result of some of those incentive changes, but not necessarily yet affecting the numbers.","So ironically, this was really kind of a rebound of what I would call core PEO performance. So again, that makes me, again, very optimistic about the next couple of quarters and the full year for PEO new business bookings, because we have yet to see \u2013 have the benefits of some of the incentive changes we made, which I think makes sense and I think are really just adjustments back to, frankly, prior. We didn't do anything artificial or aggressive to try to overcome some kind of externality. We were readjusting back to normal level some incentives that we had changed to other HR BPO products a couple of years ago.","So I think that when I add all the things together, it feels like just really \u2013 as usual, it comes back to great execution. I think there's just more focus and more attention on kind of the basics and the core of generating new leads by our sales force, as well as making sure that they are more effective in getting the leads from the other parts of our sales force in ADP. So I think it's just overall just much better execution.","And then, lastly, I would say that, again, here you have maybe the opposite effect of what I described about what usually happens when you have a strong finish, sometimes you get into a weaker start which didn't happen to us this first quarter.","But in the PEO, we did have a challenging year and sometimes in some parts of our organization when you come off of a challenging year, you have a \u2013 so last year may have been not as weak as maybe it looked, and this first quarter was \u2013 I think it's probably the strongest growth we've had I think ever in the PEO. Sorry. I'm being corrected here, since Q2 of fiscal year 2014, but the numbers were already big in 2014 and they're even bigger today. So I think to generate the kind of growth rate we generated this quarter is quite impressive I think. And it shows that the value proposition is still intact and that the sales leadership and sales execution still has the ability to take advantage, if you will, of that value proposition and get it to the market in a competitive way.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I just have a few data points that really support what Carlos said. We saw not only improvement in our deals over 50 which we accelerated, but we had overall for the PEO channel there brisk new logo growth in the high double digits, so a very, very impressive broad-base.","So it's not only a single thing, like a commission change for the mid-market or an incentive change in the mid-market, that drove this. It's a management focus and it created a broad-based acceleration of new business bookings that I think we've managed, also, to improve with very solid client satisfaction scores and great execution. So that created, then, our confidence to really up the guidance for that segment.","Jason Kupferberg - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. Well, great. That's nice color. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Ellis with MoffatNathanson. Your line is open.","Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. In fiscal 2018, I believe you grew client growth down in the lower end of the market in the 12% range, a really strong number. Can you give a little color as to whether that momentum and those share gains in the small and medium business market are continuing as you look into 2019?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. I think the first quarter was very consistent with the momentum and the trend we've had for \u2013 I don't think it was just fiscal year 2018. It probably wasn't quite as strong in 2017, but we've had good strong momentum I think in our downmarket business, and I think it continued into the first quarter.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","First quarter is right in line with the trend that we have seen in 2018, Lisa.","Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Great. And then I think the complementary question is just one around the mid-market, where I know as you were going through the Workforce Now transition, you were sort of hanging on to your client counts in that market which we know it's very competitive. Now that you're through the Workforce Now migrations, are you seeing some improvement there, some growth in the client base in that market, if nothing else, just driven by improvements in retention?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. So we have seen a very consistent improvement in our retention rates out of the \u2013 from the lows that we had about 2, 2.5 years ago, and so we're very pleased with the improvement that we have seen, A, through all the clients being now on a single platform, the stabilization and improvement in the new service models that we rolled out as part of the service alignment initiative, and very, very steady, retention has been improving.","And so the new sales success if I \u2013 in this market if I just take like an average for the last rolling 12 months or so, we have also seen much more stronger focus on the new logo execution that we reported to you on focusing on new distribution channels through partners as well as leveraging sales force adjustments to focus on this. And I think we're still in the early stages of seeing a full turnaround for that, but we're seeing very good signs that this new logos focus will pay off over time.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. And this quarter I would just add that this quarter, we actually happen to have good logo growth in the upper end of the mid-market which for us is, call it, 500 employees to 1000 employees or 150 employees to 500 employees in kind of that space there. And so again, quarter to quarter numbers is tricky in terms of the sales results. But I think there's definitely renewed focus and attention, and these are incentives that we adjusted different from what we were talking about in the PEO case. More, call it 18 to 24 months ago as we exited ACA, we tried to get our sales force more focused on core logo growth. And I would say that we feel like it's working and that we're making progress. And the combination of that along with improving retention, I think is, we still have work to do, but I think is getting our mid-market business into a stronger position, especially now that we're on one platform.","Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow-up to Lisa's question. I understand you're not giving explicit retention metrics on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but it sounds like on the basis of the consumer satisfaction scores you talked about improving that retention probably is just directionally up year-over-year. Can you confirm if that's the case or not, and maybe just kind of talk about whether there's any pockets of down, mid, or upmarket that are kind of falling above or below your expectations?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So I think, as you heard I think in the comments, we confirmed our forecast for increased retention of I believe it's 25 basis points to 50 basis points for the year. So you could probably interpret that as directionally up for the year. But given that we're not providing retention guidance as part of the package of \u2013 we added a lot of disclosures and I think if you look at the amount of stuff that we just put out, I think historically and in response to some extent to some of the feedback we got after the proxy contest, we're doing what we can to add additional disclosure. And I think that's one of the items that we're not going to be getting into on a quarterly basis. But I think that you should interpret our confidence and reaffirmation of our guidance as confidence that the trend of retention is up.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And then maybe kind of as a follow-up. With respect to your full year guidance, I know you talked about several grow-over issues with respect to acquisitions and a couple of other things that get harder in terms of comps for the year. But I think for the full year guidance it implies that growth slows down across almost every metric relative to what you already reported in Q1. So I'm just trying to understand whether there is anything that gives you pause about a potential slowdown in growth or whether there is some wiggle room potentially baked into the guidance? Thank you.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","As you can imagine, we spent some time talking about that to make sure you guys walked away with the right message which is one of confidence and optimism and pride in what really were good results. But there are some mathematical issues that I think are just important noting. So I think two that stand out for me are Global Cash Card was not quite a 1% impact but somewhere in the neighborhood of 1% impact on revenue growth. And that we lap, I believe it's in the middle of October. And then FX pressure, not just for us but for all companies, is picking up a little bit. It's not a huge headwind, but that obviously can change in either direction. But based on the information that we have today and the math, we kind of laid out what we thought was reasonable changes in guidance while trying to convey really our sense of optimism and confidence and positiveness in what the results were.","So it's hard to, given that it's the first quarter, it's also, frankly, hard for us to just come out and across the board change everything given that we still have three quarters ahead of us. But we wanted to make sure you got a message of confidence and optimism and pride in the first quarter. But we want to make sure that the math rolls through in the appropriate manner.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Received loud and clear. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning. Strong start to FY 2019. I'd like to ask about pricing trends as you head into the critical year-end selling season. What are you seeing in terms of kind of price net of discounting on a year-over-year basis?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Well funny you should mention that, because back to the previous question in terms of one thing that we just don't want to take one quarter and assume that it's going to continue on. But we have seen, I would say, a better environment in terms of overall discounting in pricing and so forth. And the issue is, there is no scientific way to know how much of that is \u2013 I don't think the competition is getting any easier. I think we're getting better and stronger, our value proposition and our client satisfaction scores. There's other things that probably work into that mix.","So in a very difficult environment where you have challenges like we had during ACA because of high volumes and caused some short-term deterioration in our service level, that probably leaves elevated concessions and pricing on pressure et cetera., the sales force starts to lose a little bit of its confidence. So I think we've regained a lot of that momentum, and it comes through, in part, it comes through in retention, it comes through in bookings, and it comes through in pricing and discounting. So I guess it's a long way of saying I can't answer your question because we don't know how much of what appears to be a better environment for us is related to economic versus issues around our own house being in better order versus the competition.","If I had to guess, I would say it has not to do with the competition because the competition is still very fierce and there's plenty of competitors. And we are always out there sharpening our pencils, especially when we're so focused on bringing in new logos. So I think it's just \u2013 we're just doing a better job and it's translating to overall a better level. And that translates into our revenue growth, translates into retention. It has a lot of positive impacts.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. And then as a follow-up, you seem very optimistic about Celergo and the potential for multicountry payroll. We haven't heard that much about international payroll processing in a while. Can you tell us how you're pulling together GlobalView, Vantage HCM and now Celergo to go to market internationally?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, David, two answers for that. Actually this quarter we had particularly strong performance of our international operations, which resulted in great new business bookings in that sector, great margin expansion. We had a very, very solid \u2013 good retention, very solid performance internationally.","When we talk internationally this extends in this quarter for both the best-of-breed countries where we serve local clients outside the U.S., as well as our strength in our multicountry and multinational solutions. And Celergo and our business that we call Streamline will be fully integrated and become our multicountry solution that services client needs with smaller employee populations in those countries. And GlobalView has always been targeted for our multinational clients that have large populations in each of these countries. But both product components or service components are basically sold together today as bundles in an integrated multicountry solution.","So we are so excited about it because we see that ADP is truly differentiated in our ability \u2013 basically, we would claim the only vendor who can offer multicountry solutions at this scale, at this consistency to that many clients of different needs. And we made an investment into Celergo to further expand that differentiation in the space which has been so successful for us. So view Celergo as a technology addition that will enhance our service ability for many of these clients big or small, and broaden our depth and in particular kind of enhances our differentiation versus our competitors in that space.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think the only thing I would add to that which is, I completely echo all those comments. I think in the prepared comments we made a comment that it still remains one of our biggest opportunities. So that's part of why we're excited. We're excited because of the quality of the acquisition and the team that we got and the product and the technology, but also because it's a large growth opportunity for us. So there's a large market out there, even though we are, I think, a market leader, there's still a lot more opportunity there. And obviously any time that we have the ability to go into and accelerate into markets that have big opportunities, that's exciting to us.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you very much. Hey, wonder if you could just give us a little more color on what allowed you to decrease the margin impact from the PEO on the ADP Indemnity side? It sounds like maybe it wasn't as bad as feared? Just a little more context on that.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Kevin, I appreciate the question. This has largely to do with our change in financial disclosures that we instituted for this fiscal year. Last year, and really in prior years, we undergo a process in which our workers' compensation indemnity evaluates the expected future losses that we have anticipated, and if there are changes to these expected future payments, we book adjustments. We historically have booked these adjustments in Other segment. And we changed now with our financial disclosures to include the results of indemnity into the PEO where they belong so that you have a true picture of the full performance of the PEO including these loss reserve adjustments that we book basically on a quarterly basis when warranted.","And we had last year, a meaningful benefit for these loss reserve adjustments that created for us a grow-over pressure of 75 basis points, which we have not forecasted for the PEO when we gave guidance in August. And so the first quarter is now over, and we booked a loss reserve adjustment that was favorable and enhanced the results of the PEO. We had not put that into our guidance and now the results are better. So we let that positive expected loss reserve adjustment flow through and that basically adds to profit in the PEO sector.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, so I think you made the comment that it wasn't as bad as you expected. To be clear what Jan is saying is, we had a big benefit in the first quarter of last year and we were worried about whether we would have that side \u2013 because you can't really forecast these things a year in advance which is why with good intentions, we used to have this in Other, to avoid exactly these discussions and these kind of ups and downs in the PEO segment. But I think we did come to the conclusion and we believe that it does belong in the PEO segment. We're putting it there. So now we have to, going forward, make sure we give you the appropriate amount of color so you understand what's happening. So this was in essence a large benefit and gain that we had through an adjustment of loss reserves in the first quarter of last year compared to a smaller gain this first quarter. But that smaller gain was bigger than what we anticipated, if that makes any sense.","Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","No, it does. I apologize for the verbiage, it was more just I guess relative to the initial expectations of 50 basis points to 75 basis points, 50 basis points to 25 basis points. Awesome. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Nandan Amladi with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.","Nandan G. Amladi - Guggenheim Securities","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So at the June Investor Day, you talked about the early retirement plan being more successful, I guess a higher uptake than you were initially expecting. You've touched a little bit on the backfill plans. Can you describe a little bit more what your plans are for the remainder of the year for total head count and what areas of the business you're hiring in?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. So I think one of the key words in some of the prepared comments we had, we used the word care in a few places and I just want to reemphasize that. That in June, if the implication that it was kind of more successful because it was more people. It's more successful from a financial standpoint, so on the spreadsheets it looks great. But we do have to execute on all these transformation efforts with care. We have to maintain high NPS scores and good execution. And so we, I think, adjusted our backfill plan based on the volume of uptake that we got. And also based on timing of the exits and which parts of the business were critical, it was critical for us to make sure that we had the right people in place to be able to handle the right volumes, especially at calendar year-end.","And so saying all that, I think we had a plan that, as you can imagine, we would never have a voluntary early retirement program and then plan to backfill every single position. That would've not been I think probably a good use of our capital. And that was not what our intention was.","So we thought that because of some of the work that we had been doing previously around transformation to take work out that we had an opportunity to, over the course of, call it 12 months, to offer this attractive package to some of our tenured associates. And it feels like it's working. And so if you think through what we've done is we hade three different waves of departures. And so they're scheduled to leave over different periods of time, over the 12 months since the date we announced the early retirement program. And we also had planned to backfill some of those positions over the same 12-month period of time. So what you're hearing in our comments is that that process, there was a plan around all that process and the one that we control the most is the departures. And that's exactly on track and on schedule. But in terms of the backfills, we were a little bit \"behind\" on the backfills which creates a short-term financial benefit that we saw in the first quarter.","But if you roll forward and you look at our original plans which we're sticking to for the rest of the year, it creates not as big a benefit in the first quarter. Having said all that, we feel that when you look at the momentum in the PEO and Employer Services and other parts of our business, it gives us confidence in the performance of the business overall. So the first quarter financial performance was not solely and only because of this issue around the timing of backfills. It was one part and I would say it was a relatively small part. So we don't want to give you the wrong impression about our confidence in the future going forward, but we just wanted to make sure we clarified that we do have more backfills in the next few quarters than we had in the first quarter, and we think some of that was due to timing.","If we feel like we've taken out more work than we thought we were able to take out, we might not have as many of the backfills as we had in the original plan. But for now, the most important thing for us to focus on is quality and year-end and NPS scores and client retention. And so we're not ready to come off of our original plans yet.","Nandan G. Amladi - Guggenheim Securities","Thank you. Very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on that. On Employer Services, besides hiring, is there any other additional reasons why the margins would drop back down to the fiscal year 2019 guidance range?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Again, another one we spent a lot of time talking about. I think that that's a fair question. One of the items is that one. I think that we have \u2013 the FX headwind is probably some part of it because we did have some FX benefit, just to clarify, even though we had a FX headwind on the revenue side, we had some FX benefit in the first quarter, as some of our costs that we have overseas went down faster than planned or more than what we had planned. Specifically, we have a large offshore operation in India, and I think that cost came in very favorable in the first quarter and well ahead of our plan.","So I think there's probably a number of things that when you roll them together, including the fact that it's only the first quarter and so we're just not prepared \u2013 for example the strength that I mentioned in terms of improvement in concessions and pricing and so forth, if you roll those things forward and you assume they're going to continue, than we would expect a better second, third and fourth quarter.","We're just not prepared this early in the year. And I think it's traditional for us. The fact that we raised our PEO guidance is unusual for us because \u2013 and I think it's prudent and I'm not sure what other companies do, but until we have more visibility and until we get to the calendar year-end \u2013 as a reminder, the next quarter, this quarter that we are in now today, is an important part of our new business bookings for the year and also December 31 represents an important measure of retention because clients tend to switch providers at that time of the year.","So I think you should expect us coming out of the second quarter to have a stronger view and position.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. No. That's helpful.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","If I could add...","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Go ahead, Jan. Yeah. Go ahead.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I'm sorry. To add a few more comments of insights about the drivers of our margin expansion that may help you to do. And so part is that we hire in anticipation for our work, but we are also \u2013 I think as it turns out, the second half is not as good as the first half. And I think there is a little bit of this left in our asymmetry of margin that compares to prior years.","So the second half is a little bit more difficult grow-over I think for us, and some of the success that we had with some of the initiatives that we initiated in the last half of the fiscal year. We had great scale, for example in our I&O organization. Our IT infrastructure is making progress and contributed. We had exceptional productivity improvements in our sales force for the start of the year, that would be not reasonable to assume that that type of level of productivity improvement is continuing throughout the year as we go through.","So there are like some just natural business reasons that make you think as early in this fiscal year to kind of keep the margin expectations as we had them.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Got it. And then I wanted to ask about the U.S. outlook. ADP has a great look at the U.S. economy and currently lots of concern in the market. Are you guys seeing any cracks in the U.S. economy at this point?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Zero.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. All right. Well, that's a good sign. All right. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is open.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.","Thank you. Good morning. Carlos, maybe you could spend a little bit more time just on the upmarket. Obviously, we've been making some product modifications and you talked a little bit about sale strategies in the upmarket. Could you give us a little more detail in terms of where we are, not necessarily focusing on the quarter, but just kind of how you feel about that business and the progress that you're making?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Feeling really good about the progress that we're making there. I think we talked about, several quarters ago, the fact that we kind of more institutionalized our ability to sell Workforce Now in the lower end of the upmarket. Think 1,000 worksite employees to 3,000 worksite employees or 3,000 worksite employees to 5,000 worksite employees where we think that Workforce Now can really compete very strongly with certain parts of that segment.","Whereas, Vantage can compete in that segment but competes even better in larger, more complex clients in the upmarket. So I think that adjustment in strategy has paid off. When you combine the new logo growth in the upmarket between Workforce Now and Vantage, I would say we're very pleased by the progress.","And I think new logo growth, as you can hear in our comments, we're constantly talking about that because we love additional revenue from other products, we love incremental sales to existing clients, but the heart and soul of the strength of the business is market share and new logo growth. And I think on that metric, we're feeling good about the progress that we're making in the upmarket.","It's still early days for some of the next-gen solutions that we're selling, but we're making some headway there also where we have a handful of clients. So clearly at our size and our scale, a handful of clients isn't making a difference on the numbers, but it's building confidence in both our sales force and in the marketplace. And so, by the way, we're also seeing really good progress in client satisfaction scores in the upmarket which I think are usually leading indicators of retention and also of new business bookings. And even if I look at the underlying revenue growth of that business, it's better than it was last year. We still have work to do, but we're feeling good about the progress.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.","And are there any milestone dates we should think about in terms of product enhancements or anything like that coming up?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Well not that we can share with you, because we've had some challenges with competitors saying things that are not accurate in the marketplace around our products and our strategy, which is a shame, because we usually try to take the high road. I won't mention who those competitors are, but I think it's not helpful for us to talk about specific dates, because we're trying to provide investors with transparency and clarity and so forth. And, unfortunately, some people take advantage of that situation.","But I think at Investor Day we gave you a decent amount of information around what we were doing around Vantage and then also what our plans were in terms of our next-gen product. And I think I would probably refer back to that.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And we're on plan and feeling good about those plans.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.","Okay. Got it. Thanks. And just one last one just in terms of you mentioned these changing employment models. And I know you've made some acquisitions there. But can you give us any sense of just how impactful, or the timing of when that really becomes an important competitive dynamic in the marketplace to have those capabilities? Or maybe it's happening right now, I don't know.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I mean I think that it's an important competitive dynamic right now. I think it helps our value proposition and our story which is part of the \u2013 what's important is the value proposition and the outcomes you deliver. I think on that front, given our scale and the size of these acquisitions, we haven't rolled these products out to 100% of our client base, or even to probably even 1% of our client base. But it does add to the strength of our sales force in terms of what they have as a value proposition in the marketplace. And medium to long term, I think we believe it's going to be a very significant enhancement.","So I'd say in the short term, the biggest short-term benefit has been and probably will continue to be Global Cash Card because it's such an in-demand product and it's such a strong and good value proposition. And they're executing so well. And they were already somewhat large in comparison to some of the other acquisitions that we've made that I would say that's the one that has the most immediate short-term impact. But I think Celergo, WorkMarket and I'll even go back to TMBC, The Marcus Buckingham Company, all these acquisitions are big strengtheners to our value proposition and our ability to win share in the marketplace.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good results here. On the PEO, the 8% to 9% worksite employee growth, I'm curious, how would you benchmark that against industry growth for PEO \u2013 because we've had mixed reviews or mixed numbers, figures from the peer group. So I thought I'd ask you.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I would say that if you take the two numbers that you have that you're referring to and you average them, ours is higher.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Yeah. Simple math.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","The PEO industry has long-term growth that we shared with you in the Investor Day. And we are obviously aiming to be and getting back to all double digits, which has been a big discussion for us, in particular since the last quarter. And we're well on our way. And that would help us to drive market \u2013 continue our long story of market share gains.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","It's impressive, like this is a big PEO now, with a lot of worksite employees. And the number of new worksite employees that we have to sell each month and each quarter to generate the kind of growth rate that we just generated this quarter is impressive.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. You're the biggest player; that's not lost on us. Thanks for that. On the bookings, just to clarify. I know you've noted the tougher second half comps. Just curious, can you replenish the backlog and produce enough new sales and still land in that 6% to 8% zone in the second half of the year? I suppose mathematically you can go to 5%, 6% and still be at the low end. But I'm curious because it's such a big comp as the year progresses.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, look, there's different selling seasons in our business, and different markets have different things. When I compare the first half of growth to our second half of growth, it looks pretty good. Not quite as good. We clearly recognize the fourth quarter is difficult, so we have a different thing, but the confidence in the sales force to achieve the overall plan, which has obviously helped us to establish our guidance, is high, so.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We're definitely not trying to manage to the full year number.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","No. We want to go as fast as we can.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I mean, our goal would be to do what you just described, which is we want to outperform and not just get what we need in order to meet the forecast.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks for the time.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from James Berkley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick follow-up on an earlier PEO question. Do you see any risk to your 11% to 14% medium term guidance? I assume there's no reason to back off of that given the strength you're seeing now. And could you quantify maybe in growth or basis point terms what the headwind is that you saw or are seeing still from some extent from the incentive changes and then the ACA related downgrades and other factors you mentioned on last quarter's call, just so we can get a feel?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. Let me tie this back to the long term outlook that we gave in our Investor Day. There are two main factors that I would think about this as related to achieving our revenue targets for the PEO in the longer term.","One is a thing that we don't control which is the growth of our zero margin pass-through revenue growth, which is actually the biggest factor. And so we have changes in healthcare inflation, changes in participation rates and the health insurance rate that are driven by industry dynamics that we don't control. And so that trend had shown some pressure in the last fiscal year and is ongoing really, if we think so.","So that will put pressure on that long term goal. It will have zero economic impact to ADP, but so from that I think that's a pressure that we would have acknowledged and that is there for the revenue number. But for the bottom line number, it would have no impact.","And then the second component is clearly what we have been focusing on in this call which is the drive of our worksite employee growth, which is of course a factor of our sales execution as well as our retention. And we feel optimistic that our sales force has enough potential to sell these new clients even though the scale is big and is hard work. But the increased momentum in the last two quarters of our sales gives us optimism that the model reacts to it.","And you saw that we are upticking our worksite employee and revenue growth already after couple of quarters of good sales success. So that works for us, and it has been aided also by very good retention particularly this quarter in the PEO.","So those factors drive the revenue growth more than anything that we control, and we have a lot of focus on the management team on it. So I think we, aside from that pass-through pressure that I really don't work to offset here in order to make the revenue number, we feel good about the strategic outlook of the PEO.","James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly, on the multinational side I think you said it grew low double digits in the quarter. I don't know if you possibly could just kind of size that and what you think maybe the TAM is for that? And talk about your recent acquisitions and the potential for that to maybe accelerate? And just kind of your plans in the international market or multinational space in general?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. For a very long time, our multinational solutions have really grown in the mid-teens very consistently, and those are our plans. We execute, and there's really no change in our outlook. I think the Celergo thing is just another component if you think in the longer term that drives our differentiation, will enhance our opportunities for an ambitious growth rate.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And I think the TAM is large. We have it somewhere in the data that I get, but I honestly can't remember offhand. But when you look at our market share and you look at the size of the market, I think we actually may have even had it in our Investor Day materials if you want to go back and refer to it.","But one of the things that Jan mentioned in his comments \u2013 he used the term multicountry payroll. So we have these multinational solutions which are \u2013 in some cases, we're referring to very large companies that are in 15, 20 countries, but there also are a lot of companies that are operating in two or three countries, maybe in France but you have two other countries in Europe or a couple countries in Asia and they may be midsize companies.","So the TAM is also something that is probably growing over time as people realize that the market is actually bigger than what we thought. So I think if you talk to our international leaders, they would say that this was very, very crucial because of the size of that multicountry payroll market that was underserved. So we're hoping that that opens up new opportunity as well.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And just to state the obvious, in this market our clients are not only HCM clients of ourself, but we partner a lot with ERP systems and large ERP vendors for clients who choose to partner with us on a multicountry payroll solution. So the market size that we address really spans a variety of client types which allows us really a longer sustained revenue growth.","James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks a lot. Great quarter.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude our Q&A portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So thank you very much for your questions today. As you probably could tell, we're off to a really good start. Even though we have a lot to accomplish still, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made. I also want to thank our associates because besides having our investors embrace change in our transformation, I think it can't happen without the support of our associates and our leaders. So I really appreciate the support we're getting internally as we drive our transformation so that we create, as Jan just referred to, a long and sustainable revenue growth for another 70 years.","So next \u2013 I believe it's next June, we actually reach our 70 birthday and we didn't get here by not making it through multiple changes in technology and economic cycles. And this transformation effort is intended to position us to be successful for another 70 years. So I think we're well on our way to doing that, at least positioning ourselves for the 70 years, not the actual 70 years, but we appreciate the support of all of our stakeholders including all of you but also our associates in what has obviously been a very fast-changing environment for us.","So with that, I will thank you once again and appreciate your continued interest in ADP.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

My name is Christie, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Webcast. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Elena Charles, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elena Charles","Thank you. I am here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Reidy, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Call and Webcast. Our slide presentation for today's call and webcast is available for you to print from the Investor Relations homepage of our website at adp.com.","As a reminder, the quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings for our reportable segments has also been posted to the IR section of our website. These schedules have been updated to include the third quarter of fiscal 2012. During today's conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risks. And these are discussed on Page 2 of the slide presentation and in our periodic filings with the SEC.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos for his opening remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Elena. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today's call with some opening remarks about our third quarter results. Then I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Chris Reidy, who will take you through the detailed results. After which, I'll return to provide you with our updated fiscal 2012 forecast. And before we take your questions, I'll provide some concluding remarks.","Now let's turn to Slide 4. As you read in this morning's press release, ADP reported solid results for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. Total revenues grew nicely at 7% for the quarter, and our key business metrics continued to be strong, starting with Employer Services and PEO Services new business sales. I'm pleased with our execution, which drove 12% new business sales growth in the quarter for Employer Services and PEO Services combined. Sales growth was strong for Small Business Services, the PEO and Added Value Services. And Major Accounts also posted good sales results. The high-end National Accounts market in the U.S. continues to be somewhat challenging, though we have seen good sales growth from the recruitment process outsourcing acquisition that we made to enhance our HR BPO solutions in this market.","Looking at sales in our Employer Services international space. ES international best-of-breed sales growth was strong in the quarter but mixed by country as the economic pressures continued, especially in Western Europe. Sales in both Canada and Brazil were strong. GlobalView sales were down year-over-year primarily due to a large sale in last year's third quarter.","Moving on from sales. The number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured by pays per control, client balances and revenue retention all increased during the quarter. As you know, the absolute value of our revenue retention is quite high, and I'm very pleased there was a 10 basis point improvement in this important metric during the fiscal third quarter, which is a particularly critical period.","On the acquisition front, we closed one transaction since our last update. We acquired the human resource solutions subsidiary of SHPS, a provider of benefits administration services for larger U.S. companies, including eligibility enrollment, spending accounts, COBRA, absence management solutions and benefits advocacy. This acquisition significantly expands our capabilities with the addition of Health Savings Account and Health Reimbursement Account administration.","Moving on to Dealer Services. The outlook for the automotive landscape in North America is good as the market forecast for calendar year 2012 vehicle sales continues to improve. Dealer Services sales growth was also solid. We're making market share gains, and worldwide revenue retention increased for the quarter. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Chris to provide the financial highlights and the updated full year forecast for our client funds investment strategy.","Christopher R. Reidy","Thanks, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Let's now turn to Slide 5. Total revenues grew 7% to $2.9 billion, 6% organic in the quarter. Revenue growth included a slight drag of about 0.5 percentage point from unfavorable foreign exchange rates. We continue to see a positive impact on revenues from strong new business sales growth and from acquisition activity that complements our solution set. ","Employer Services grew total revenues 7%, 6% organic. There was good revenue growth across several products, including running our Small Business Services marketplace, time and labor management, HR services in major accounts and ASO, which is our BPO for small- to mid-sized companies. Same-store pays per control in Employer Services in the U.S. was quite strong with an increase of 3.3%. However, same-store pays per control across Europe declined compared with a year ago due to the economic pressures Carlos mentioned earlier. ","Growth in average client fund balances increased 5% for the quarter, driven by new client growth especially in Small Business Services, growth in standalone tax filing and increased pays per control. This growth slowed from the 6% year-over-year growth in the second quarter primarily due to the expected smaller contribution from state unemployment insurance as the second quarter growth benefited from the 2011 calendar year increases.","The PEO strong revenue growth continued with 15% growth during the quarter, all organic. Average worksite employees grew 11% during the quarter to about 260,000. Dealer Services revenues also grew nicely in the quarter with a 7% growth, 6% organic. And Dealer Services is benefiting from strength in the North American automotive market, where we continue to benefit from increased transaction activity. Dealer Services win rates are solid. We are further penetrating our base with layered applications, and client revenue retention improved year-over-year. The continued weakness across Europe is something we are keeping an eye on for Dealer, but we are seeing continued strength in Asia's luxury brand market, which is where we primarily play in Asia.","Now let's turn to Slide 6 and continue with the highlights of the quarter. Pretax earnings increased 5%. And I'm sure you noticed in today's release that systems development and programming expenses are down as a percentage of revenues. The amount of expenses capitalized during the quarter increased as a result of increased spend on large projects related to product innovation. The quarter also included a charge of nearly $25 million in cost reduction initiatives to align our business structure with a softer business environment we are seeing in Europe.","Now looking at the pretax margin. ADP's pretax margin declined 40 basis points. Excluding a drag of about 40 basis points from acquisitions, pretax margin was about flat. And if you further exclude the 90 basis points from the decline in high-margin client fund interest, it was very positive margin expansion in the quarter in the core business.","Moving next to net earnings. We reported a 7% increase, which benefited from a lower effective tax rate in the quarter. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% and benefited from fewer shares outstanding compared to last year's third quarter. We repurchased 8.9 million ADP shares fiscal year-to-date for a total cost of about $445 million. Our cash and marketable securities position was strong at $1.8 billion at the end of the quarter.","Let's turn to Slide 7. And I'll take you through the updated forecast on the client funds investment strategy in support of the overall ADP forecast that Carlos will take you through in a few moments. Before I get into the details of the forecast, I'll point out that the objectives of our investment strategy remains safety, liquidity and diversification. Fully consistent with these objectives, we are again able to take advantage of the supply of new investment-grade corporate fixed-income securities and added more highly rated corporate bonds to our portfolio. ","At March 31, approximately 85% of our fixed-income portfolio was invested in AAA, AA-rated securities consistent with the past 8 quarters. In addition, as has been the case over the recent past, the yield curve continued to present greater opportunities at the longer end of the maturity curve in both the extended and long portfolios. As such, the duration of the portfolio increased slightly to 3.2 years at the end of the third quarter. We continue to base the interest of assumptions in our forecast on Fed Funds futures contracts and the forward yield curves of the 3.5- and 5-year U.S. government agencies as we do not believe it is possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the yield curve or the new bond issuance behavior of corporations. I'll also remind you that up to 15% to 20% of the investments are subject to reinvestment risk each year. ","Focusing now on the slide, you see a summary of the anticipated pretax earnings impact of the extended investment strategy for the client funds investment portfolio for fiscal 2012. We continue to anticipate average client fund balances for fiscal 2012 in the range of $17.9 billion to $18.1 billion, which represents 6% to 7% growth. It's also important to keep in mind that while average client balances have grown 7% year-to-date, I'll remind you as I did last quarter that growth was very strong in the last fiscal year's second half in large part due to the January 1, 2011, increases in state unemployment tax rates, which have not recurred to the same extent this year. Therefore, we anticipate a tough balance growth comparison in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. ","We continue to anticipate a yield on the client funds portfolio of 2.7% to 2.8%, down 40 to 50 basis points from the fiscal 2011. We anticipate a slightly smaller year-over-year decline in client fund interest of $45 million to $50 million. And as you can see at the lower right of the chart, in terms of the total pretax impact of the extended investment strategy, we anticipate a decline of $50 million to $55 million for fiscal 2012. We continue to anticipate the overall yields from the net impact of the strategy to decline about 50 basis points from fiscal 2011's overall yield of 3.6%.","Now I'll turn it back to Carlos to take you through the remainder of the forecast for fiscal 2012.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Chris. We're now on Slide 8. As you can see, our performance has been solid, but we do expect continued pressure on earnings and margins from a continued low-interest rate environment. We have been very active in executing against our M&A strategy, which will also continue to pressure margins near-term but we believe will enhance ADP's future organic revenue growth.","Now to the forecast. Our forecast continued to exclude the gain realized in the second quarter on the sale of assets, as well as the related loss revenue and profit streams, which were anticipated to be about $0.02 in lost earnings per share for the remainder of the year from the time of the sale. We continue to anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 9%. I also want to remind you that we anticipate that the impact on revenues from foreign exchange rates will be up to 1.5 points unfavorable during the fourth fiscal quarter but will be about neutral for the full year. The euro today is hovering around $1.30, whereas this time last year, the euro had started to increase and was over $1.40 by the end of last fiscal year. As you know, movement in FX rates is not as impactful to pretax earnings.","We continue to anticipate 8% to 9% growth in diluted earnings per share compared with $2.52 in fiscal 2011. We expect an effective tax rate of about 35% for the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate through March is about 34.5%. And we anticipate ending the year with an effective tax rate below 35%. However, our forecast also contemplates pressures in the fourth quarter related to the additional impact from the SHPS acquisition, which was completed after the third quarter closed as well as our sales overhires as we gear up for fiscal 2013.","We also anticipate a decline of $50 million to $55 million in pretax earnings related to the client funds investment strategy, as Chris just took you through. This translates to a drag of about 90 to 100 basis points on ADP's total pretax margin. Pretax earnings related to the client funds strategy are down about $35 million year-to-date. So another $15 million to $20 million decline is expected to occur in the fourth quarter and will be a significant drag on total pretax margin. As is our normal practice, no further share buybacks are contemplated in the forecast beyond anticipated dilution related to employee equity comp plans, though it is clearly is our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders depending obviously on market conditions.","Now let's turn to Slide 9 for the segment update. For Employer Services, we continue to anticipate revenue growth of about 7%. We are currently forecasting that the pretax margin will be flat with last year compared with our prior forecast of 30 basis points expansion primarily due to the impact of the acquisition closed since our last update. We anticipate an increase in our pays per control metric in the U.S. of 2.5% to 3% compared with our prior estimate of about 2.5% increase. We continue to anticipate about 17% revenue growth for PEO Services with a slight pretax margin expansion. We continue to anticipate about 12% growth in the annual dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new business sales from the nearly $1.1 billion sold in fiscal 2011. And for Dealer Services, we continue to anticipate 9% to 10% revenue growth with at least 50 basis points of pretax expansion.","Turning to Slide 10. I'd like to leave you with some closing remarks before we open it up to your questions. We're very pleased with ADP's third quarter results and are on track to achieve our full year forecast. Growing new business sales is the key to driving future organic revenue growth, and I am pleased with our execution in this area. We are investing in distribution by hiring additional sales associates going into next year. And as you've heard me say before that a top priority of mine is to get the best of innovative products to our excellent sales force. And we are focused on doing just that with innovative internal development and through acquisitions that complement our existing solutions. ADP's cash position is strong, and we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. I'm pleased that ADP continues to be rated AAA by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's, with Moody's reaffirming this past December and S&P reaffirming just over a month ago in March. ADP's AAA credit rating reflects the strength of our business model and of our balance sheet.","I believe we're doing the right things to grow the business long-term and I am proud of what the organization has been able to accomplish this year. And now I'll turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Could you provide a little bit more insight into new sales trends within National Accounts in the U.S.? And more specifically, what were bookings like for your new Vantage HCM product?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We have, right now, approximately a little under a dozen clients that we have on the books. We have less than half of that, that are actually in implementation. And we have a few that have actually started. And when you think about the timing of when Vantage was rolled out at the HR Tech Conference in October and you think about sales cycles in this space, we're pretty pleased with the progress so far.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then could you provide some insight into January sales trends in particular, which typically are critical for the sales season overall in the year ahead?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think as you saw from the sales results for the quarter, which would obviously include January, based on my remarks, we're pretty pleased with the outcomes. We've had good results in all of our core businesses. In fact, probably to quote the comments we made in the opening statement, they were strong results. The National Account space was the only place, excluding the sales that we got from the RightThing acquisition, was the only place where we saw, I think, continued softness, but very, very pleased with the results in our core businesses as well as some of the ancillary products that we saw that were additions to the payroll solutions.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just final question for me. Any competitive issues in National Accounts in the U.S. that you're focused on improving?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think Vantage is our response to what is obviously a changing landscape. So Vantage not only has a new and better user interface to make it easier to do business with ADP, but it really is a single database solution that integrates all of the core products. So I think our intention was to have Vantage really be our next-generation solution in the National Accounts space. And we're very optimistic about where that positions us in the marketplace, especially when you think about the breadth of the offering that we'll have now in comparison to our competition in that space. I think the new user experience along with true, unified integration or true unification, if you will, of the database, I think, will really create a real competitive differentiation for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Rozof with Morgan Stanley.","Nathan A. Rozof - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to dig in a little bit more to the pays per control numbers since that was obviously a key positive this quarter. Specifically, given the increased guidance, I was wondering if you can give us any differences in trend by customer segment or client size that may not be obvious from the top line number.","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes. There were all up, both industry-wide, all the industries continue to be positive with the exception of public administration, which is probably no big surprise. And geographically, all the geographies were up, some more than others. We saw Texas, Oklahoma, for example, growing particularly fast. That Eastern Seaboard is still a little bit slower, particularly down in that Philadelphia, South Jersey. But all very positive and as you say, the pays per control across the board were very strong for the quarter.","Nathan A. Rozof - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then for a follow-up question, I believe you mentioned that GlobalView sales would've been up, excluding the impact of a large sale last year. Can you provide us any more color there or what the growth rate would be x that large sale last year?","Christopher R. Reidy","Well, it would be strong. And we don't actually give the specific sales growth numbers. But we had a big sale in that prior quarter. I think we mentioned it. If you go back to the record for the third quarter of last year, it was a pretty good project. And it's still on track. So we were very pleased with the GlobalView sales results in the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Kissane with Credit Suisse.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question on the European sales. You said it was kind of weak, maybe a little more color. Was it weak across the board? And just a follow-up to that, maybe be a little bit more specific on the European pays per control.","Christopher R. Reidy","Actually on the sales, the overall international sales were strong. I think to the point we made is Canada and Brazil were particularly strong, and we saw some more softness in Europe proper, Central Europe, so to speak. The pays per control, while they were relatively flat in previous quarters, took a dip down a little bit in the third quarter, again probably no great surprise to anyone.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","But I think it's important to note that even though the sales in Europe were not as strong as other parts of our business, we don't want you to get the impression either that they were down significantly because they were not. So it's actually quite, I guess, comforting that so far, our sales execution in Europe has been very good under the circumstances and we're -- I would call it holding our own. So it's a very difficult situation obviously because of a lot of the uncertainty. So I think our sales organization is doing a terrific job of trying to hold on to what I would call decent sales results.","James F. Kissane - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And maybe can you give us an update on the pricing environment, generally across the different products as well as maybe more specifically in the Small Business arena?","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes. The critical new pricing time, as you know, Jim, in the beginning of our fiscal year. So that's well behind us. We've got what we traditionally have gotten over the last couple of years. And we had a net of about 1% to their balance increase. In terms of what we're seeing in the market, there's nothing remarkable to report in terms of pricing deal by deal. I don't think there's anything to point out there, nothing special.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to clarify, did you mention that there was a $25 million charge in the quarter for the European business? Did I catch that right?","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes, you did. We do take restructuring charges from time-to-time. It's really kind of just the pruning of the business that you would expect in order to drive efficiencies. And we did take that in the third quarter. But it's really a combination of a number of things. You're right that the bulk of it was international. It does include some M&A synergies. We've done a couple of acquisitions internationally. We've got some building consolidations and the like. But the real impact of that is going to be next year because of the long lead times when you take charges like that in Europe. But think about it as more charges to continuously improve process efficiency.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Can you give us a rough sense of what percent of your European headcount was affected?","Christopher R. Reidy","No. It was very, very small. I mean, this is small pruning.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Because of the way -- just to make sure that we don't alarm anyone. So based on the way the rules and laws work in Europe, this should be a relatively small number of people because the cost of restructuring in Europe is relatively very high on a per head basis, if you will. And so this is a relatively small group, and it's to again make, what I would call, a modest adjustment to our cost structure for was obviously a slower environment in Europe. And this is not -- our sales are still holding up in a decent way, so this is not a dramatic downsizing of any of our businesses in Europe.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's really helpful. And then can you just talk about how all the influx of all the new products that you've introduced over the past 12 to 24 months? Has that had a positive impact on your sales force turnover? Any metrics you can give us there?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think we'll let Chris kind of scramble for the  turnover figures. But I can tell you that to me, the most important metric is the sales results themselves. And clearly, turnover is a factor in that. We need to have stability and lower turnover in order to drive good sales results. But the sales results do speak for themselves in the sense that where we have rolled out new products, we are having better results. And of course, whether that's cause-and-effect, there's no scientific evidence. At least the sales force seems very excited and very positive about getting new products and new solutions. We're also doing other things to help our sales force, giving them new tools. Like for example, giving them the ability to use electronic sales order rather than paper, doing a number of things to make their jobs easier and to increase productivity. But I think the sales results themselves, I think, are the best indication of the soundness of the strategy of trying to drive additional productivity by focusing on product enhancements.","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes. I think I'd say a few things on that. Clearly, the new product innovation, such as RUN and Workforce Now, get the sales force jazzed up, and that helps significantly drive new sales. Some of our turnover is directed turnover, calling out the bottom performers and that thing. So when we look at the turnover of the headcount and sales, there's nothing really out of trend or nothing remarkable to point out. What I would point out, however, is that our headcount grew in the area of about 5% to 6% overall, which when you look at 12% kind of growth in sales says that there's 6% to 7% improvement in productivity, and that's particularly strong. So we're very, very pleased with that metric.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just last for me, I know longer-term, you guys have talked about the 5-year organic revenue growth CAGR of 8% to 10%. And I guess, technically, we're kind of finishing up year one of that. And you're sort of around maybe the lower end of that range. So maybe can you guys just comment on your comfort level with that 5-year outlook? Carlos, I know you technically inherited that from Gary, but I'm sure you're part of the process in setting that target, just as you look at the outlook for employment and rates and dealer because it does seem like the Fed is saying hikes are still a couple of years away. So anything you can share on that front?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think we are obviously intending in May to -- I guess, provide any updates. This is probably not the right forum to have that discussion. But in May, we'll be happy to have that discussion. I can say that clearly, I was part of that communication with Gary because I was part of the management team. And we do believe that, that is a long-term potential of the company. As you know and you just mentioned, when we made that, those statements, interest rates were in a very different place and the trend and the forecast from the futures market, if you will, and the forward curves were very different than it is today. It's hard to believe, but rates are significantly lower than they were. At least the rates that affect us, are significantly lower than they were in May of last year, which no one would've ever thought possible. That's exactly what happened. So clearly, in the short-term -- and I think Chris will probably provide more detail in May. In the short-term, that does put pressure on us not only on margins but also obviously on our revenue growth as well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you just quantify how big this SHPS acquisition was? And I know you've talked in the past as you've done these acquisitions in the HR area that scalability remains key. You want them to have the ability to scale and have a margin profile close to the core business. Does this acquisition fit that thought process?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that this acquisition -- I think, first of all, I believe it's about $80 million in annualized revenue. This was really what I would call -- I'm not sure if this is a term of art or not, but a product [ph] acquisition, in the sense that we had some gaps in our offering that we believe were important to fill in order to make us competitive in the benefits administration space, specifically I mentioned HSAs and HRAs but also absence management. So typical buyer today, whether it's in benefits or in HR payroll, is typically looking for a broader solution set than just a single solution. And what we were finding is that in the benefits administration space, we were having trouble winning deals in the core benefits admin business without really having a competitive spending accounts product or an absence management product. So this was really intended to further strengthen, if you will, our existing base. And we're going to take those 2 products, those 2 or 3 products from SHPS, and those will become the go-forward platform. And then the rest of the products will be consolidated into our existing portfolio, and we'll move forward with hopefully a broader, more competitive product set in benefits.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And a quick follow-up, can you give us a sense how much of the new sales growth in recent quarters is products that you've acquired in the last 2 to 3 years versus organically developed products or sort of more legacy products in the payroll and the tax side?","Christopher R. Reidy","Gary, if you look at the 12% that we're forecasting for the year, it's a couple of points.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A couple points is the acquisition.","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Ashish on for -- calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. I was wondering if you could give some more color on the Small Business trend. Have you seen any change in the business starts or any change in the competitive environment? And how do you continue to drive sales in that particular segment? Is it a combination of direct sales force channels? If you could just provide some more color on it.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So one of the -- when we mentioned that we're increasing our spend in the fourth quarter on what we call sales overhires for the next fiscal year, a good bit of that or a good portion of that is actually in the Small Business space, where we really drive a lot of our growth through both feet-on-the-street headcount as well as in telesales. And so in Small Business, it would seem to be intuitive, but it's important to remember that we have a very large sales force, so when we add salespeople, the total number of sales that we're adding, most of them would end up in the Small Business space. So we're obviously doing that because we're confident that there's demand in the marketplace and that we're able to execute with existing management infrastructure that we have. And so we're hopeful to be able to continue, I think, the positive trends we've had of being able to drive good sales in that space with our new RUN product, as well as some bank partnerships that we have been able to establish through, what's always been for us, a very strong channel, which is our bank partners.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And one quick follow-up on the PEO. The PEO guidance suggests that you'll see some acceleration in year-over-year growth for the PEO revenues in the fourth quarter. I was just wondering if you could give some more color on what will drive that improvement and year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter for PEO revenues.","Christopher R. Reidy","I'm sorry, Ashish. We were troubled with the question. Are you asking about PEO?","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, that's right.","Christopher R. Reidy","Okay, now. And just, could you just restate the question?","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. My question was that the PEO revenues were up 16% for the first 9 months and you've guided to 17%, which would indicate that you'll see some improvement in the year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter from 15% to maybe like 18% to 19%. And I was wondering if you could highlight the growth drivers for the PEO.","Christopher R. Reidy","Well, we have seen good, strong growth, as you said, throughout the year. Some of that has to do with -- when you look at where it would come out for the full year is some of the pass-through revenues. So what I would advise you to look at is more of the growth in our processing revenues or look at the proxy metric that we use with worksite employees. And if you look at that, that continues to be strong throughout. So this quarter, we're up 11% to about 260,000 worksite employees, so we're very happy with the continued strength in the PEO.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","But I think it is -- I think I would just point out that there's really nothing that is expected to happen in the fourth quarter to have a material change in the growth trajectory of the PEO. PEO is growing quite nicely right now, so there may be some issues in terms of cutoffs or pass-throughs. As Chris was saying, we tend to do in June our open enrollment for our benefits plan. So sometimes that leads to slightly higher rates for the clients and that's included as part of our billings so that may have a little bit to do with that number. But that doesn't really change pretax margin for us or drive any kind of profit. So I would tell you that it's steady as she goes in the PEO. And the nature of that business is such that there's really nothing happening in the fourth quarter, other than open enrollment, that would lead one to believe that there's a major change in the growth trajectory.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions left for me. But maybe a little bit of color on the retention trends by segment, in particular this Small Business. Sort of what are you seeing there in Small Business?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Retention is quite strong. And it's -- I don't know that I have the historicals by BU. But there are several business units, and I think SBS may be one of them where we are at a historical high in terms of our client retention. We're very pleased with that. It does ebb and flow, so it goes up and down. But on a year-to-date basis, we're quite happy with the progress. I think in Small Business, there's slight improvement over the previous year. And when you reach these levels of retention, any kind of improvement is quite satisfying because we're at pretty high levels right now.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Are you seeing an alleviation of sort of the bankruptcy headwind, which I know has been a problem for the last 2, 3 years?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes. But I don't know if that would be fair to say that, that happened in the last quarter. I think that there's some continuing improvements in some trends in Small Business. But that's kind of already, I think, behind us in terms of -- if you recall, and it's in our actual press release, the statistics and metrics that in last year, the year-over-year improvement in retention was significantly high. So I believe it was 190 basis points, if I'm not mistaken, for last year's third quarter over the previous year's third quarter. So that's really where you had the big improvements in terms of some of the economically driven factors that help drive improved retention. So most of that is really behind us now. And now it's -- you got to continue to improve service. You got to improve ease-of-use. You have to be competitive. It's just good, old, traditional, in-the-trenches competition.","Christopher R. Reidy","I said that the retention rate, as you know, is very high, all-time high across -- in total. And you see that pretty much across the boards, there's no one that was driving that any more than the others. They're all very strong, which is great.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","All right. Then Chris, I mean, I think I'll try this. On the sales side, not to get too specific, but any way to sort of frame the order of magnitude of the sales growth across segment, I mean, was small and majors kind of in the low double-digits and national close to flat? I mean, just trying to get some directional...","Christopher R. Reidy","I think we tried to give a little of that, SBS and our PEO and AVS were very strong for the quarter, so think double-digit kind of strength. Majors had a bit of a tough compare against the strong prior quarter and the prior year. But it's very strong year-to-date. And so we're very happy with majors over the course and the forecast would have them very strong as well. National Accounts again is getting some help from the recent acquisition of the RightThing, but as we said in our comments is not quite as strong. It's still growing but not quite as strong as the others.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And if I can add one thing, I think, obviously, Chris is right that we're very pleased with the performance across the board. But at the risk of playing favorites, I think it's important to note that our Major Account sales force is really performing very, very well this year. And we couldn't be happier because that is a core business for us, where it's important for us to drive new business in order to be able to grow what is obviously one of our more profitable businesses. It also happens to create an opportunity for us to sell additional products and services attached to that Workforce Now platform. So our ability to generate new unit growth in that Major Account space this year, I believe, is one of the highlights of the year for us from a sales standpoint.","Christopher R. Reidy","And although you haven't asked, I'm sure somebody will. I mean, we're at May 1 now, we have some preliminary view of our April sales results. And I would say -- reiterate the fact that majors was particularly strong in April as well. And what I would say is that the strong growth that we saw in Q3 coupled with what we see in April make us very confident in our full year guidance of about 12%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A couple of questions here. So is there any issue with pipeline drain? You had 2, I guess, what I would call, above-normal bookings growth quarters in a row. I'm encouraged, Chris, by your comments about what's happening with majors as you move into the month of April. But as you look forward and you enter next fiscal year, I mean, after these 2 strong bookings quarters, is there a bit of a bubble in the pipeline that will create some weakness? Or is the pipeline strong and steady?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","My experience, since I've been with ADP, is that when you're in a position that you're in at this point the year and the fiscal year ends, I'll remind you on June 30, it's very, very unlikely that we will experience any sort of drain or any sort of slowdown. It's possible obviously. There could be factors outside of our control to make that not the case. But we have very, very strong incentives in place for a very strong finish for the fiscal year. So frankly, I am right now, and my leadership team and our sales leader will be very focused on the first quarter of next year and making sure that we get off to a strong start to prevent exactly what you're describing, which is a drain of the pipeline in the fourth quarter going into the first quarter. But we're not -- I'm not overly concerned about the fourth quarter in part because of what Chris just said which is 1\/3 of our quarter, we have visibility to and it was quite strong in April.","Christopher R. Reidy","I'll also say a couple of things, Rod. Obviously, our long-term goal for sales growth is still in that 8% to 10% kind of range. So I think we exceeded that this year, and we did get a little bit of a lift from acquisitions, as I mentioned on a previous question. But particularly, I'm pleased with the products that we have. We'll talk a lot more about some of those innovations at the May conference. But across each of the major market segments, we've got new products. So RUN is still doing really well in the Small Business space, coupled with some of the mobile innovations that we're coming out with. And in the mid-market workforce, now is really taking hold. We'll have new versions of Workforce Now and they're coming out in July. We'll talk more about that and give some product demos in May, and then obviously Vantage in the National Account space. So I think that really helps drive the market as well and get the sales people excited. So I'm not particularly troubled by pipeline drain.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Excellent. And then just in keeping with that, are there any extra investments planned for your June quarter just to get you prepared for fiscal '13? Anything noteworthy in the sales force or either in the new product development area? I mean, as you stated, you have new products that you rolled out across all of your segments in recent history. And so I guess, the question there related to upcoming investments, are your technology investments going to subside? Or are you going to continue to go to the next level with those investments? So on the sales force and on the technology side, any thoughts on upcoming investments?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Our technology investments are not going to subside. I think when you look at the environment that we're operating in today, I think we not only continue to focus on new product development, but I think the speed with which we need to develop new products and the amount of time that is acceptable in between new product releases has shortened. And so I think one of the, again, changes in emphasis I think that you'll see that I think started really over the last couple of years is a greater focus by us on product development. And we don't intend to have that subside anytime in the near future because we believe that there's a new competitive basis out there. And I think product is now an important element of our differentiation, our ability to win business in the marketplace. Having said that, to your question about the fourth quarter, we are adding a couple of hundred additional sales people earlier than what would be in the plan right now. And that was mentioned in our comments, that's contemplated in our forecast for the fourth quarter. We're also, as part of our efforts around innovation, we also believe that innovation requires some rationalization and consolidation of our existing platforms. So we want to not only to give our sales force the best and most innovative products, we want to have all of our clients on our best and most innovative products. So we are in the process of pushing forward some migrations in a very careful and methodical way in several of our business units. And we've actually have some of that baked into our forecast for the fourth quarter. And we hope that, that will allow us eventually to shift more of our R&D and development expense into new product innovation other than into maintenance as a result proliferation of platforms or versions of products.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's wonderful. It seems like there's a big opportunity or at least a meaningful opportunity on the platform rationalization side. So good luck with that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I have a quick question, just going back to the acquisition activity. With that ramping up, can you give us some rough parameters on how you think about the impact on annual revenue growth going forward from acquisitions? And then perhaps secondly, help us understand the margin impact. Are you simply acquiring lower-margin businesses? Or is there a substantial investment process that's diluting the margin profile upfront?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It depends on the acquisition. We've actually -- a couple of our acquisitions have actually been very good margin businesses. And obviously, I'm not going to mention which one versus the others. But I think it really varies. What is almost always the case is as we acquire businesses that we \"tuck in\" to our existing infrastructure, we do typically have to make investments upfront in areas like infrastructure and security to bring them up to, I guess, what we would consider to be ADP standards. There's also typically some integration expenses that take place early in the timeframe of the acquisition after closing. But I wish I could give you -- we bought a business in the Dealer Services space, which is completely different from SHPS, which is completely different from the Indian payroll acquisition. So they're all quite different. But in most cases, they do require some upfront integration and investment expense. But some of these businesses have actually quite good margins.","Christopher R. Reidy","I think the experience I've had is the biggest mistake you can make is to acquire a company and not invest, to integrate and to bring that product up to where they need to be. And so we will do that, so that is a part of it. The biggest part -- typically, our acquisitions are a drain on margins, not necessarily on bottom line, and it's because of those investments. And some of them tend to be a little bit lower-margin businesses but still making money. Some of them, more recent ones as we implied for our -- the impact on the fourth quarter, for example, SHPS is both margin and NOI drag and it will continue to be. So for Q4, as well as into next year, you can see that we've had -- the drag this year from margin basis points, for example, on the third quarter to ES, it was a 90 basis point drag. Across ADP, it was about a 40 basis point drag. And that's a combination of a couple of things that obviously we had a lot of acquisitions last year, like $900 million worth of acquisitions. Typically, we only do $300 million to $400 million. You'll see this year, we are in that zone of $300 million to $400 million. So we're going back to a more normal acquisition level. We do have the impact of those prior year acquisitions, the full year impact this year hitting us. So now we're looking at next year, and you can expect to see the continued drag from the acquisitions that we did in fiscal year '12 going forward. But there is going to be some abatement from the fact that we did less acquisitions this year than we did the year before.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So do you have any data, Chris, perhaps that helps us understand a year later these acquisitions or these portfolios you're seeing accelerated revenue growth and higher margins so that as you buy more companies, what you bought in the prior year on a year-over-year basis at least offset some of that impact?","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes. I think what you -- you can see that in the difference between our internal growth and our total growth. And so we are getting some lift. Now that lapse after the 12 months, but we're particularly pleased with some of the recent acquisitions. For example, Cobalt in the Dealer Space gave us a nice lift in revenue growth. And the Workscape acquisition, for example, AdvancedMD, all of those are giving us some lift in revenue growth.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And I think one of the recent ES acquisition, the RightThing, which is the RPO business, is literally accelerating from what was already a very fast growth rate. So that was a fast-growing business when we acquired it. And that's an example of where true synergies are being, I think, realized from certainly from a distribution standpoint. So that business is not just adding to growth for the 12-month period after we blend it in, but I believe that, that's additive to the overall growth rate of ADP on a go-forward basis.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one other thing on the acquisitions, as you acquire products, as you mentioned earlier, are these products available on a stand-alone basis? Or are they being sold in conjunction with payroll primarily?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, again, it's unfortunate there's not a single answers. So as an example, the RPO business, we do sell that product on a stand-alone basis. The SHPS acquisition, where we have spending accounts, FSA products, we would tend to flex towards selling those products as part of a broad benefits offering. But in some cases, we will sell those products on a stand-alone basis. So we do have some salespeople dedicated to individual product lines. But it really varies in terms of how much focus and attention we put on a stand-alone product versus selling a bundled product.","David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And just one other question is just on the rates, Chris. If rates stayed flat from where we are today, do you have any sense for when the comparisons in client funds would flatten out or turn positive?","Christopher R. Reidy","Well, I'll go through that over the next couple of years, as I have in the past, at the May 25. So you know that's a long conversation. What I will tell you though is as we look at it, looking at the current forward yield curves, which as Carlos mentioned are significantly below where they were this time last year, we expect that the drain -- this year's drag is $50 million to $55 million, as you know. And so when we look at next year, we see at least as much pressure next year, if not a little bit more. Don't forget, you get the full year impact of the reinvestments at low new purchase rates this year and get the full impact of that next year and you get the full impact of everything next year hitting. So it's at least as much of a drag. And again, that's 90 to 100 basis points of drag, which is significant to overcome. So when we look at the margins, when you exclude the acquisitions, we're relatively flat at the ADP level. And that's overcoming 90 to 100 basis points of drag from interest rates. So that's stellar performance in our operating businesses, much higher than what we talk about as the long-term model of 50 basis points over the long-term. So we're pushing hard to drive margin improvement to offset some of that interest, but that interest is going to continue at least into next year. And we'll talk more about the impact on '14 and '15 in a couple of weeks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Chris, I just wanted to follow-up on your funds per client question. I'm just wondering as rates have stayed where they are and obviously, nobody knows what's going to happen over the next couple of years, have you given any thought to changing the strategy? Or are you fairly comfortable with the strategy you've taken and it's just a matter of time when things turn around and you start having a positive impact from rates?","Christopher R. Reidy","No. We're particularly comfortable with the approach. And the whole approach was to average your way through interest cycles. And obviously, nobody likes a long cycle of this extended low rates. But when you look at the ROE of this approach, it's very strong. We still have the long and the extended and the 2.8% to over 3%, and the yield is up over 3% in total. That's valuable from an ROE standpoint. It also matches our longer-term investors because it lessens the volatility, and that's a good thing. So we're very happy with the approach. In an extended period of low interest rates, it's going to be an extended period of drag year after year. But it's the right approach, it's the right strategy.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Then just one last question on acquisitions, Carlos. Has there been any change in acquisition pricing or opportunity because the economy is getting better? I know last year you did -- I think you indicated $900 million acquisition. This year, it's going be a lot less. Is that just a reflection of opportunity? Or is that a reflection of what might be happening, maybe in other parts especially pricing of acquisitions?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think it's really more opportunity. I think we have always been, I think, an opportunistic, disciplined acquisition company, if you will. And so we're, I think, looking for the right kinds of product to complement our existing product set. But we're also very disciplined in terms of what we're willing to pay. So I don't think that I would be able to say that there's been a dramatic change that I'm aware of. That's not what I'm hearing from our M&A folks. So they're out looking around and trying to, I think, find the right kinds of opportunities for us. It probably was a better environment in 1 year or 2 years ago. And some of our increased acquisition activity may be a reflection of that. But I'll just remind you that some of that is a reflection of one large acquisition, which was the Cobalt acquisition, that tended to drive that number up into that $800 million to $900 million range that Chris talked about. So I don't think our strategy has changed in terms of how we do acquisitions. And I don't believe that we've seen any kind of meaningful change in the environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Carlos, just one quick question on the higher-end clients and decision-making cycles, anything in particular just to go back to some of the comments you made at the beginning about the higher-end clients. Anything in particular about decisions, decision cycles as you get focused on in terms of length of these cycles right now?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So I think -- again, we don't have a lot of scientific evidence, but we do have a lot of anecdotal stories about cycle times and decision-making process. And so back to the question about draining of the pipeline, I'm hoping that we actually are having a building of the pipeline, particularly in the National Accounts space because when you look at CEO confidence indicators -- remember, these products are being sold typically to CEOs and CFOs. If you look at the BRT's confidence indexes, there has been some significant improvement in people's, I guess, willingness to say they're going hire and if they're going to make capital expenditures. And obviously in our case, it's neither of those, but it's a proxy, if you will, for spending. And so we believe that the environment has gotten better, but our results don't reflect that yet. So we're not ready to say that there's been a change yet, but I think the elements are in place, where hopefully our National Accounts business to have better results on a go-forward basis than what we have had over the last 2 or 3 years, which has been incredibly painful for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wonder if you could talk about the sales force, maybe you could put the hiring in some historical context. Any impact or potential impact to margins going forward? And if you could talk about any changes in the comp structure there.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I would love to talk about that because I'm incredibly proud of our sales organization and our sales leadership in the sense that they've been able to continue to grow our sales force. But more importantly now, they're getting productivity improvements. And what those productivity improvements lead to is it allows us to accelerate our growth rate either without impacting our margins or by actually helping our margins. And so we continue to add, as Chris said, new salespeople into our organization at a rate of around, I believe it was 7% year-to-date. The balance of obviously the 7% and the 12% sales results is productivity improvement, that 5% productivity. It's an incredibly important thing to our overall P&L and to our ability to accelerate our growth rate. So I would say that not only is our sales organization executing well in terms of delivering sales results, but they're able to continue to add people and also help us from a margin standpoint. So we're very, very proud of what they've been able to accomplish this year. And actually, we had some progress last year as well. But this year, it's particularly satisfying to see the productivity improvement.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just sort of switching gears here. Maybe you could talk about sales process and its evolution. Do you see a transition moving towards more for a technology-first offering versus a services? And how can that play out on the pricing front over the long-term?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, you're referring to from our distribution standpoint or just from an overall product standpoint?","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","From an overall product standpoint.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","From an overall product standpoint, we definitely believe that we need to have products that are more competitive from a \"technology standpoint\". In other words, usability, experience of the practitioner and also of the employees because one of the changes in our business over the last 10 years is we have millions of our clients' employees who actually interact with and use our products as well. And these are the same people who are going home and using iPads and iPhones. So that experience is becoming very important. But we still are a service business. And so we are still going to have our differentiation be based on service and also on the breadth of our offering. So it's really not our intention to be a software company or a company that competes solely based on product and on technology. I do want to elevate the competitive level of our products, but that doesn't change the fact that we are still committed to being a services and compliance company that will continue to really drive our results by solving our clients' problems, not just by providing them a software product and allowing them to go off and use it on their own.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So could that affect pricing over the long-term, I mean, just as you sort of shift that? Or is that just part of the regular sell?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, the reason we're doing this is my hope is that it will either enhance our pricing or at least allow us to maintain our pricing. We're not doing it to decrease pricing. So I believe that if we can differentiate in terms of the breadth of our offerings and really solve problems for our clients and add value to their business through analytics and other tools, we believe that we'll be able to hopefully increase our pricing, if not maintain our pricing. But we're not trying to come down to someone else's level from a pricing standpoint if the implication is are we looking to be a traditional software vendor, whether it's distributed as a SaaS model or not, that is not our intention.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Following up on a prior question on pricing, I wanted to ask about pricing in PEO specifically. Could you talk about the pricing environment there? And also what percent of your PEO sales are conversions versus competitive bids?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So I believe we have a significant amount of our PEO business that is referrals from our Small Business sales organization. We have a very large Small Business sales organization that is obviously selling payroll and other products. They provide leads to our PEO sales organization, which is a separate sales organization, but they work very, very closely and our intent is to share those leads. We've been as high as 50% of our business coming from either a combination of leads from our SBS sales force and\/or existing clients that already are on an ADP payroll platform. So the synergies there are quite good. And I think what your second questions was around pricing and PEO?","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So pricing in the PEO. Again, we really look at our sales results as kind of a leading indicator of where we are competitively. Clearly, execution is a factor in that. And I believe that our sales execution in the PEO has been particularly exceptional over the last couple of years. But I'm very comfortable with where we are price-wise because we're continuing to grow and we're continuing to grow our sales results in a very, very robust and positive way. So it feels to me like we're in a very good position in the marketplace. As you know in the PEO, it's not just about the pricing of our own service business, but it's also the pricing of our pass-throughs. And we believe that our workers' compensation and our benefit solutions, which are included in the bundle in PEO, that we are particularly competitive in those 2 areas when it comes to the outside market to our competition.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then separately, this may be a simplistic  question, but your guidance of pays per control for the full year of 2.5% to 3% versus what you've done in the first 3 quarters of the year, is there any reason to think that things should slow down in the fourth quarter based on the guidance?","Christopher R. Reidy","No. I think it's just the fact that we're starting to see that growth in the second half of last year, so it becomes a compare issue more than anything else. I think we're at about 2.9% year-to-date or thereabouts. So it's more of a compare issue than anything dramatic in terms of employee growth in our plans.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jim Macdonald with First Analysis.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","I just had 2 quick technical questions. The $25 million charge, was that in G&A? And can you tell me what the amount of capitalized software was?","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes. It is in G&A. And we don't normally disclose the amount of capitalization in that detail. But you can see it as a percentage.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think it's safe to say that our software and development expense would've gone up for the quarter instead of gone down. So I'm not sure that we can get exactly precise, but it probably would've been up $5 million to $10 million instead of down, I believe, it was $10 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Carlos, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what you think the impact of health reform has been on the business in case we do get a strike down of the law at the end of June.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think that our benefits administration business, I think, is in a very good position to, I guess, benefit from some of the changes in regulation. And actually a lot of parts of our business are in a very good position to take advantage. When you think about some of the upcoming changes as a result of the laws -- so as an example, one of the changes of the law is going to require, as part of the compliance, to be able to count the number at FTEs that you have. That's really going to require a time and attendance system, which we have. It's going to require having that time and attendance system be linked to your payroll system, which we have. And then it's going to require that both of those systems be linked to your benefits administration system, which we have in Workforce Now and in Vantage. So we believe that there's opportunities as a result of changes in regulation. That has really been ADP's, I guess, forte as responding to the compliance needs of our clients and to a changing regulatory landscape. And I think this is a big one. So these changes in law, I think, will create opportunities for us. So we are watching across the entire spectrum what the impact may be on our business. In the PEO, as an example, we need to make sure that our benefits offerings are competitive. If, in fact, the law isn't struck down and exchanges become a factor in the marketplace, we have to respond to that and make sure that the offerings that we provide are as competitive as the ones that are offered by the exchanges. But I think we see -- I'm not aware of any major downsides other than the competitiveness of our business in the PEO. But I'm not aware of any other major downside as a result of the law being struck down. And if the law isn't struck down, there are thousands and tens of thousands of pages of opportunity for ADP. By pages of opportunity, I mean, the complications of the regulation and the fact that large, medium and small companies are going to need help with that compliance. And that's where ADP performs the best.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.","Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked. But I was just going to ask on Europe. Can you give us a directional sense how the business progressed over the last -- if you look at over the last 4 or 5, 6 months, is it still getting worse? Or does it feel like you've hit a bottom at all during the last couple of months in terms of the demand trends and sales cycles throughout Europe?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think if you look at the pays per control figure in Europe, it's hard to tell because it has been up and down. But it's not up. It's worse than it was 6 months ago, but it hasn't kind of fallen precipitously either. So part of the issue in Europe that it's difficult. We talked about the restructuring charge, it's difficult to restructure and reduce costs in Europe. That also tends to cushion during these types of situations what happens with employment. In other words, you typically don't have mass layoffs and major decreases in employment. They tend to take longer to play themselves out. So it is possible that there is more to come in terms of pays per control situation in Europe. But what's still refreshing for me is the fact that our sales results are, I would call it, holding up, which is, I think, a good sign.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Two questions. First, can you talk a little bit about the plans for Vantage just in terms of what you would expect as the next fiscal year unrolls and unfolds, how many clients you would hope to get on it and what percentage of the national client base would transition?","Christopher R. Reidy","No, we're not going to track the number of clients on Vantage. Just think about it, Mark, as that is the platform going forward. So when we talk about human capital management, Vantage is the offering that is a complete package of human capital management offering, so payroll and time and labor management and benefits and HR and talent management, et cetera. So that is the bundled package. ","The best way to track Vantage is tracking National Account sales. And that would be the metric you want to watch. So as we get traction in Vantage, you'll see that just like you saw it with RUN in the Small Business space and Workforce Now in mid-market.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","This clearly takes longer, so we will clearly try to provide some color over the next couple of quarters. But I think in this business, it's particularly difficult to get into very specific comments about individual clients because it's very lumpy and it's very volatile.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Understood. Just wanted to get a sense for whether it was tracking along your expectations or there are things that you need to do to fine-tune it.","Christopher R. Reidy","And it is. It's just early in the process.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think it's fair to say it's tracking according to our expectations. And again, the good news about Vantage is, again, it is a true SaaS product, which is [indiscernible] and so we do have enhancements that, as we speak, I believe, are either being rolled out or will be rolled out shortly, which will enhance, I think, the offering even more. And you'll see more of that from us in the future, where we will have rapid releases every 3 or 6 months, not every several years.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then with regards to the margins for the ES segment, you basically indicated they're going be flattish for the entire year, which implies a fairly significant increase in Q4. Can you give a little bit of color with regards to the drivers particularly overcoming some of the drag from some of the acquisitions?","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes. As you said, there was a big drag from acquisitions of about 90 basis points in the quarter. But it's consistent with what we've been saying all year that we did have some spending in the latter half of last year that we would lap going into the fourth quarter. And that's the biggest driver. So it's now -- the compare is a little bit more on an apples-to-apples basis. And that's consistent with what we've been saying throughout the year. And I think I'd just reiterate that the fact that we're able to overcome that 90 basis points of drag in the acquisitions at the ES level shows that we're driving some stellar margin improvements for the year in ES. And that's a demonstration of the leverage that we've had. And again, it's more than what we traditionally are able to drive. We typically go for 50 basis points, and I think we're outperforming that. And I think that demonstrates a real focus on trying to get process efficiencies, et cetera.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Completely agree. Just I keep getting questions about it from various investors. Could you just remind for the people who are on the call, for their benefit, some of the increases in the investments that occurred last year in the fourth quarter?","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes. So I think we talked a little bit about that on the last quarter's call and specifically talked about some sales increases, some investment in R&D, service increases. So each one of those areas increased last year. And I think rightly so, we said we wanted to invest in the business and make sure that we had enough people to support the growth that we saw coming, and the growth has come.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Williams with UBS.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. Number one, just want to get an update on your thoughts surrounding the dividend payout ratio and maybe a little bit more on your capital allocation priorities as they stand now.","Christopher R. Reidy","Great. I think one of the things, if you look back over the years, our dividend payout ratio has gone up significantly. And 10 years ago or thereabouts, we were looking at mid-20s kind of payout ratio. And even 5 years ago, it was a whole 10 basis points lower than it is. We're now in the 55% payout ratio. And so that's been increasing every year. As you know, in November, we were happy with the increase of 10% that our board approved. So we've been creeping that up. I think we're right in the zone of a range that we're comfortable with. And I think it continues to be something that we do in terms of returning cash to shareholders, like the share buybacks, which have been very consistent over the last couple of years as a way to drive cash back to shareholders. Our target is to try to stay in that zone of $1.5 billion-ish kind of cash. And as you can see this quarter, we're a little bit higher than that. It can be lumpy depending on acquisitions, et cetera, but I think the way to think about the target is to continue to have that $1.5 billion and returning the rest through share buybacks and dividends.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","So all in all, it sounds like not much different from your prior.","Christopher R. Reidy","No. It is consistent with what we've said in the past.","James Macdonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay. One just other quick question, if I could. Just the interest on funds, I noticed you narrowed the guidance range there for the decline. Is that just a function of being late in the year? Or is there something we should read into that?","Christopher R. Reidy","Yes. I think it is later in the year. And we've got 2 months to go. So that's the primarily driver.","Operator","We have time for one more question. That question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just first on PEO. I thought I heard Carlos, he said that the outlook is still good there. I'm curious what's driving some of the sales, and geographically, any differences that we need to think about.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, one of the -- again, starting off with places we still need to watch, we, I think, mentioned in our comments that Dealer does have some exposure to Europe, as our Employer Services business does. So  we're keeping an eye on that. And I would say that the results there are not as robust as in North America and in our digital marketing businesses. But the fact of the matter is that it's a very good environment, so the backdrop is very positive. So car sales are back over 14 million on an annualized basis. I believe that's 10% or 11% growth over the prior year. We continue to see positive surprises through the vehicle growth. And even though a relatively small part of our business is directly linked to volume of car sales, clearly, the ability of our dealerships of our clients to generate additional revenue and to grow allows them to invest in hopefully products that will enhance their productivity on a go-forward basis. So it's just a much better, I think, backdrop and environment than it was obviously 2 or 3 years ago. And we really don't see anything on the horizon that would indicate any change in that. So that's why we continue to be positive, I think, and opportunistic about our Dealer business.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Good to know. And just quickly and just last one, just a clarification. The 3.3% of pays per control, obviously very good. Is that adjusted at all, Chris, for leap year? I'm just curious how clean it is.","Christopher R. Reidy","No, it would include -- I mean, it's same-store sales. So it's this same client this year versus last year. I don't think leap year would really have too much of an impact on that, so it's very positive.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I want to thank everyone for joining us today and for your questions. As you heard, we're overall very pleased with the third quarter results, and we're obviously on track to achieve our full year guidance. I hope that all of you will join us for the half-day conference the morning of May 24 at The Roosevelt Hotel in New York City. We've got some great feedback last year on the product demos, and we'll be showcasing our latest solutions again this year. So we hope that you'll all be able to join us. Obviously, the conference will be webcast for those of you who can't make it. But we hope you will be able to join us. And I thank you again for joining us today.","Christopher R.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call. Thank you. I will turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Christy, and good morning everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations, and I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call and webcast.","During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors, and that exclude the impact of certain items in the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2018 as well as the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2017. A description of these items and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","I would also like to note that as we outlined and during our recent Investor Day, beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we will be making some changes to our disclosures and reporting. You will find an explanation of the changes in the financial outlook and additional material sections of our Investor Day presentation. Accordingly, our fiscal 2019 outlook reflects these changes and to ensure comparability includes all the necessary adjustments to fiscal 2018 results.","For the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2018, our results and related discussion do not reflect these changes and are therefore on the same basis of presentation as our previous quarters. We recognize the complexity of this transition and therefore to bridge the two we have included select fiscal 2018 pro forma financials and metrics in the appendix to our earnings presentation found on our Investor Relations website. As always please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions regarding these new metrics and disclosures.","Now let me turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Christian. Good morning, everyone. This morning we reported our fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results with revenue of $3.3 billion, up 8% reported and 6% organic constant currency. We ended the year with total revenue of $13.3 billion, up 8% reported and 6% organic constant currency. We're very happy to report our new business bookings grew 18% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the year, both ahead of our expectations.","We saw strong performance across all of our businesses this quarter which we believe serves as further validation of the renewed momentum within our salesforce following fiscal 2017. We were also pleased to see our new logo strategy continue to show results with double digit new client growth this quarter and nearly double digit growth for the full year.","Now let me spend a few moments on the recent performance of our PEO. Revenues for the year grew 12%, in line with our expectations, while average worksite employees grew 9% to 504,000. After a softer third quarter bookings and retention performance, we took certain actions to address our internal lead flows that we believe will help drive the reacceleration next year and we are pleased to see positive signs of this working this quarter with double digit bookings growth and solid double digit new logo growth.","Similar to last quarter, our PEO bookings and retention were strong in the down market, while we continue to see some pressure from larger client losses in the mid market. However, our competitive position remains strong and the volatility in our mid market retention is not new and follows a record high retention in fiscal 2017.","We have previously outlined the volatility of retention within the PEO and particularly the impact of the timing of larger client losses. As we work to overcome some of these challenges from the second half of fiscal 2018, we continue to believe that the PEO represents a significant opportunity for us. With nearly $1 billion of revenues excluding pass-throughs and very healthy margins, we remain excited about the future of the PEO.","Now I'd like to focus on the strong progress of our investments to improve the client experience. With our mid market migrations behind us and our Service Alignment Initiative nearing completion, we are happy to see a continued overall improvement in our client satisfaction scores this quarter. In particular, we were very happy to see our mid market scores return back to levels last seen in early fiscal 2015 and we are confident our recent service initiatives will help drive continued improvements across our entire portfolio.","Our Employer Services revenue retention for the quarter and for the full year were both in line with expectations. As you know, on a quarterly basis this metric can be volatile and this quarter we saw a decline of 120 basis points. However, more importantly, for the full year, we were pleased to see continued positive year-over-year momentum as our overall annual retention increased by 50 basis points to 90.4% and continues to benefit from the improvements in client satisfaction that I just outlined. Going forward, we will be guiding to annual retention and Jan will take you through some of these changes later.","In early June, we hosted an Investor Day where we discussed in detail our strategic vision, transformation initiatives and financial outlook for the next three years. We received a lot of positive feedback. And for those of you who may have missed it or would like to revisit it, the materials and the video replay have been posted to our Investor Relations website.","Our goal for the event was to outline our plans for driving sustainable long-term profitable growth and provide a deep dive into our product strategy and the actions we have been taking to accelerate our transformation initiatives. Through our investments in products, service and distribution we will continue to build on our momentum. We are shaping the HCM industry through organic innovations such as our next-gen platforms as well as our strategic acquisitions, such as Global Cash Card and WorkMarket.","Our leading position in the global HCM market continues to represent a significant opportunity for us. And earlier today, we were proud to announce the acquisition Celergo a respected provider of international payroll management services. Celergo complements and augments our current multinational offerings through the combination of a proprietary cloud-based platform and a broad local partner network across 150 countries and we couldn't be more excited. With these investments, we are expanding on our position as the only global HCM provider that can help businesses address their full hire to retire needs across their entire workforce be that traditional or freelance.","We also continue to engage with a number of key partners including our recent partnership with Microsoft to bring together Workforce Now and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and innovators like Slack and ZipRecruiter. As the world of work continues to evolve rapidly, we continue to focus on staying ahead of the curve.","Last quarter, with the assistance of the Transformation Office, we finalized plans for our voluntary early retirement program. We were pleased to start fiscal 2019 through a successfully managed first wave of transitions and we remain focused on executing this initiative in an orderly and timely manner. As a result, we recognized a non-GAAP charge of $337 million in the fourth quarter and anticipate annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $150 million with about two-thirds of the anticipated benefit expected in fiscal 2019.","All this growth and success would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our associates, who continue to be an integral part of our efforts to drive change and ensure our successful transformation.","And with that, I'll turn over the call to Jan for his commentary on the fourth quarter results and fiscal 2019 outlook.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Carlos, and good morning everyone. As Carlos mentioned, we finished the year with solid momentum, driven by better than expected consolidated new business bookings growth of 8% to $1.8 billion for fiscal year 2018. ADP's reported revenues also continued to show improvements relative to our expectations and grew 8% in fiscal year 2018, or 6% organic constant currency, supported by our continued improvement in our Employer Services retention.","On a reported basis, earnings before income taxes decreased 14%, while our adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, increased 8% including approximately 1 point lift from FX and 1 point of pressure from the impact of our fiscal year 2018 acquisitions.","Adjusted EBIT margin was up about 10 basis points compared to fiscal year 2017 and was slightly above expectations covered at our Investor Day despite higher selling expenses due to the strong bookings performance. While we're also being well ahead of our original expectations set at the beginning of the year, our performance benefited from continued improvements in our infrastructure and sales spend and from the successful execution of certain transformation initiatives that we outlined during our Investor Day. We achieved all of this while also overcoming about 30 basis points of pressure from our fiscal year 2018 acquisitions.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 18% to $4.35. And in addition to our revenue and margin performance was aided by a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the year was 26.1% and benefited from corporate tax reform.","In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid about $1.1 billion in dividends and returned about $1 billion through share repurchases for fiscal year 2018.","Let me now take you through our segment results. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 5% for the year, 4% organic constant currency, in line with expectations. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.7% for the fiscal year. Average client fund balances grew 6% compared to a year ago. This growth was driven by a combination of wage inflation and growth in our pays per control offset by pressure from lower state unemployment insurance collections and corporate tax reform.","Outside North America, our solutions have continued to perform well, largely helped by the continued strong performance of our multinational solutions, which serve businesses of all sizes. Employer Services margin increased about 10 points for the fiscal year and included approximately 40 basis points of pressure from the impact of acquisitions.","PEO revenues grew 12% for the year with average worksite employees growing 9% to 504,000 employees. Following the slowdown last quarter in the 50 employee and above market, we were pleased to see some recovery in our PEO new business bookings as we started to take certain actions during the fourth quarter. The PEO segment margins increased 10 basis points for the year.","Overall, we generated significant momentum over the course of the year. The actions that we're taking have helped us to expand our margins, leading to better than expected performance in fiscal year 2018 despite some incremental pressure from our recent acquisitions. And more importantly, we continue to make important investments into our business to set us up for the future.","Let us now move to our fiscal year 2019 outlook. As a reminder, my discussions of our results for fiscal year 2018 was on the same basis of accounting as our previous quarters. In contrast, our fiscal year 2019 outlook includes the expected impacts of ASC 606 for both fiscal years 2019 and 2018 as well as the expected impact from certain other adjustments we outlined for you earlier. As you look to adjust your models, you should find all the necessary details in the appendix of our quarterly presentation and in our earnings release, which both are available on our Investor Relations website.","With that said, I'll first provide our consolidated fiscal year 2019 outlook and then focus on the segments with some added color on some of the more nuanced changes. We anticipate total revenue growth of 5% to 7% for fiscal year 2019. We expect adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 100 to 125 basis points including approximately 20 basis points of pressure from acquisitions.","And as you can see from this morning's press release and the appendix of our investor presentation, this margin expansion would have been about 30 basis points higher on an ASC 605 basis. We expect an effective tax rate, an adjusted effective tax rate of 25.1% in fiscal year 2019 as compared to our prior estimated adjusted effective tax rate of 25% to 26%. All of this drives anticipated growth of adjusted diluted earnings per share of 13% to 15% compared with the $4.53 in fiscal year 2018. Similar to our margin expansion, this growth would have been higher on an ASC 605 basis for about 2%. Regarding shareholders' distribution, as usual it remains our intent to continue our return of excess cash to shareholders subject to market conditions.","Now for some more detail in the segments. We expect 4% to 6% revenue growth in our Employer Services segment, which includes anticipated pays per control growth of about 2.5% and now benefits from growth in interest income at actual rates, reflecting one of the changes we made to our segment reporting.","We expect Employer Services new business bookings growth of 6% to 8% as we continue to build positive momentum from our investments and head count while driving improvements in productivity from our product and channel strategies. This new metric is specific to the Employer Services segment and we hope that as you also use the materials from our Investor Day, that will help you with your models.","You will recall that this is a shift from our prior worldwide new business bookings guidance which included sales for the PEO segment. To further help you with your model, we have given you some historical quarterly growth comparison within this morning's earnings schedules.","Let's now move to the Employer Services revenue retention. As Carlos mentioned, our Employer Services revenue retention for fiscal year 2019 was 90.4%. For fiscal year 2019, we are expecting our revenue retention to increase about 25 to 50 basis points compared to the 90.4%, driven in part by expected improvement in our mid and up market supported by the completion of our mid market migrations a few months ago.","Since this is the first time we are guiding to retention, I'll provide a little extra color. We generally have several months of visibilities for clients leaving in the mid and up market and less direct visibility in the down market as clients do not provide such much notice. In addition to this direct visibility, we look at trends in our NPS scores as a leading indicator. And that helps us directionally anticipate where retention is heading.","Also, because our service teams work closely with our clients, we monitor various other metrics and operating statistics that we try to leverage when forecasting our anticipated losses. Lastly, there is some mix impact to retention over time as our different products can have very different retention rates because of the market segment characteristics. And so we've taken into account our anticipated revenue growth in these various offerings.","All this is to say that we have generally some visibility on where retention will end up for the year. But given the breadth of markets and clients that we serve, certain factors can ultimately move the needle, particularly the timing of larger losses.","We expect margin in our ES segment to expand by 150 to 175 basis points inclusive of 30 basis points of acquisition drag. And by the way of comparison, the impact of adopting ASC 606 to our ES margin expansion exceeds the 30 basis points impact on the ADP's consolidated margin expansion.","Our margin continues to benefit from a combination of operating leverage as well as some of the discrete initiatives that we spoke about at our Investor Day. For example, our voluntary early retirement program will be a key contributor this year, and as we expect minimal dual operation expenses related to our Service Alignment Initiatives in fiscal year 2019.","With that said, let's now touch on the PEO, which also includes a number of moving pieces. We expect 7% to 9% PEO revenue growth in fiscal year 2019 driven by 7% to 8% growth in average worksite employees. As Carlos mentioned, we saw progress in our PEO bookings this quarter and we have continued to make certain additional targeted adjustments to our PEO distribution process. We believe this will help drive a gradual reacceleration in worksite employee growth.","We also anticipate 5% to 7% growth in PEO revenues excluding zero margin healthcare benefit pass-throughs. This too is a new revenue disclosure that we discussed at our Investor Day. And I want to remind you that it does include revenues from workers' compensation and state unemployment insurance premiums.","As you might infer from our guidance, we expect some drag next year from lower workers' compensation and SUI rates, which impacts our revenue, but it's ultimately positive development for our clients and for our PEO prospects.","For PEO margin, we expect 75 to 50 basis points of margin decrease. Among the changes we made to our segments is the inclusion of ADP Indemnity into the PEO segment earnings, which we believe enhances our disclosures. As a reminder, ADP indemnity is our captive workers' compensation insurer and there is also which used to be accounted for in the other segment.","Including Indemnity into the PEO segment adds no revenues, but does impact margins. ADP Indemnity uses a third-party actuary to assist with the loss reserve estimation process and changes in the assessment of workers' compensation loss reserves may at times introduce a little bit of noise to the PEO margins now that is included in our segment results.","More specifically, as we regularly adjust our loss revenue estimates, we have realized some P&L benefits over the last few years including fiscal year 2018. However, we typically do not forecast any material change to these reserves going into a fiscal year. And as a result for fiscal year 2019, this results in more than 75 basis points of anticipated grow over pressure for the PEO segment margins. Excluding this grow over pressure, we would have otherwise expect to our margins to be slightly positive.","Moving on to the remainder of our outlook. We expect interest on client funds to increase approximately $80 million to $90 million driven by higher rates and anticipated client fund balance growth of 3% to 4%. We expect our total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy to be up about $60 million to $70 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","Overall, I think you can tell we are happy with our performance and with the momentum that we are building from our investments in the business. At our Investor Day, we set margin and EPS target ranges throughout fiscal year 2021. And we will continue to execute towards these goals with fiscal year 2019 being a step in the right direction.","So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will take our first question from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the retention decline you saw in the quarter. Clearly, as you got to the end of the mid market transition, we would have expected some impact there. But can you maybe point out other areas of the business that might have seen a little bit of pressure there? Or was it purely in the mid market ES part?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We feel still pretty good about our momentum when you look across the different businesses with retention and you look at our client satisfaction scores. And as usual, there was some noise from a couple of large losses. So we did have in particular a large loss in what we call our comp solutions business which really provides standalone services. So there was a company that we were providing standalone services to that was a relatively large revenue loss. And that had an impact on the numbers. So I guess it's the old story, this happens every several quarters that we have one or two large losses that may move the needle and I think that's what happened this quarter. Because we still feel pretty good.","In full transparency, our mid market retention actually was pretty good. And it's because we did finish the migration. So even though we had some losses towards the end of the migrations there were still, in relation to the size of the business, there were few enough left that even though we lost some at the end, we still now are seeing what we were hoping to see, which is our strategic platform has higher retention rates and as the amount of business on the old platform goes to zero, you see the math just works in your favor. And so I think we have nothing but positive things to report about our mid market retention in the fourth quarter.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful color. Thank you. And then maybe looking forward in terms of the new business bookings outlook, can you maybe talk about some of the products where you're seeing the most traction? And specifically, as we think about the cadence of bookings through the year, is it fair to say there's a little bit more weighting in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year relative to your outlook? Or any color on that would be helpful.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I can take the sales outlook. As we indicated, the momentum that we experienced on new business bookings for the fourth quarter was very broad based really across all market segments and good momentum for a lot of products. So the overall forecast that we have for our salesforce continues to be that all business units will experience good growth, solid healthy growth. Maybe a little bit more strength in the down market, but overall I would say a very balanced portfolio.","And we do have a little bit of selling season but the quarters are actually fairly balanced. It's like different market segments have different selling seasons. And we experience at times at year-end a big push towards the end which has to do with our incentive systems I believe, but nothing unusual relative to our sales distribution effort. But we're feeling really good. Well staffed. Salesforce is excited about the core products and is excited about the product additions that we have brought through acquisitions to the table. So we're confident about sales.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. And adding just to Jan's comment, I always worry when we have the strong finish as Jan was alluding to. We typically have incentives that drive very strong performance towards the end. That tends to happen to be magnified when you already are having a very strong year. And I think we had definitely a good year. But as you know the first half was still a challenge for us and it was really in the third quarter where we really kind of picked up the momentum. And then in the fourth quarter that momentum accelerated. So we did have a strong finish. I think people were racing towards those accelerators. But again, this is more art than science in terms of trying to get a feel for kind of where we are. But I would echo Jan's comment that we're feeling pretty good at least for about the start. The momentum carrying into the first quarter is I think good.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Could you talk about some of the initiatives in the PEO business to accelerate lead flow and bookings growth? And then in connection with that, what do you see as the main drivers for the weakness in the first place? Is this more of a competitive issue, or are all these within your own control?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We looked at the balance of trade numbers to really see if there's any kind of competitive issues and we didn't see anything there throughout the whole year. So we then, I think it was probably after the first half I started looking back to see, is there something typically when you don't see any issues that are competitive or the economy or otherwise, there's usually, in my experience at ADP and taught to me by my predecessors is, there is usually something around our incentives internally. Because as you know, whether it's in the PEO or other parts of our business, our incentives are quite aligned to drive business to our most profitable, highest revenue sources which are the PEO. And we get I think it's about 50% of our business from internally generated leads. So that system of incentives and lead flow is very, very important.","And we did make some changes that, I'm ashamed to say I wasn't 100% aware of that I think created a distraction, let's just say, to lead flow particularly for mid market clients into the PEO. So we readjusted those incentives. I believe it was in the third quarter, towards the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year and we already saw in the fourth quarter double digit growth in bookings in the PEO. And we don't want to split it in terms of how much was up market and down market. But we had, suffice to say, we had strong double digit sales growth and bookings growth in the PEO and the mid market contributed to that without getting too specific.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Maybe, David, one other pointer is that the unit growth of new business bookings into the PEO actually accelerated meaningfully and it was in the high double digits, in the high teens, and which means we had really an overall acceleration of deal flow, which bodes well for competitiveness. It just happened to be that we had to fix this mid market situation. So that bodes I think overall well.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, I think Jan's comment about double digit unit growth is for the full year. It's in addition to my comment about the fourth quarter. I think it's another triangulation to get to the conclusion. Right now, our conclusion is that there is no competitive issue.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. What is your expectation for FY 2019 in the PEO for workers' compensation reserve treatment? I mean, would you expect reserves to go up, to go down? And what impact on earnings will that have versus what you saw in FY 2018?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So a couple of just points in terms from a historical perspective. We started using reinsurance. As you know, we disclose all of this in our 10-K. So the amount of reserves that we have is related to years back between, I believe it's 2004 and 2012, if I'm not mistaken, or 2013. From that point forward, we have less volatility even though there is some risk sharing collar, if you will, but it's very relatively limited. So this issue about reserves is historical. But we have seen fortunately overall positive development in the last several years.","And so this is not the first year, in 2018, where we've had a benefit from, or what we would call release of reserves if you will. Now some of that is related to possibly the economy. It could be related to healthcare. There is a lot of things that go in. Workers' compensation is a long-tail insurance. And so there is quite a bit of volatility in those numbers themselves. But we've consistently over the last four years had benefits if you will. In 2018, it was a particularly large benefit, which is why Jan was in his comments explaining that we have a grow over issue.","We don't, as you can imagine, we can't plan for the release of workers' compensation reserves, because that has to do with actuarial work that gets done. It actually gets done on a quarterly basis and we adjust those reserves on a quarterly basis. But if we continue to have favorable loss development, which is what causes the release of these reserves, we should have some benefit in 2019. We just don't believe that it could be as large as it was in 2019 and don't at least have that planned currently.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Just a quick final. What was the EPS benefit in 2018 from the reserve release?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","It's really not that \u2013 it's not significant enough to \u2013 we had lots of other things that were of similar size. Like for example, we, to go in the other direction. So we had acquisition drag. We had our migrations expense went up by almost $20 million for the year. So the issue is that since we have segment reporting, we're giving you margins at the segment level and we're increasing our disclosure. We're just giving you a lot of extra color. But we weren't trying to imply that we made our numbers or that our EPS was driven by the reserves. It just happens to be that because of the size of the PEO, when you exclude pass-throughs in the PEO and you look at that margin, it's a large business but the release of those reserves I think can impact those margins from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year. But you shouldn't read \u2013 don't read anything more into it other than at the segment level, which is what we're trying to give you color on.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks guys. Good morning. I just wanted to come back on PEO, because it seems like for fiscal 2019 that's where there's some delta between what the Street was looking for and what you're guiding to. So there's some deceleration baked in here obviously relative to fiscal 2018 growth levels. Can you just walk us through the pieces there? Because your qualitative commentary actually sounds more upbeat in terms of some of the newfound bookings momentum in PEO. But obviously the revenue guide to 7% to 9%. So just explain to us the pieces of deceleration that seem to be embedded in the guide there.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah well, I think there a couple of different pieces. One is the momentum in terms of underlying worksite employee growth which I think we've been talking about it for the last \u2013 we talked about it the last quarter. I think it was also a focus item. You guys had a question about it then and again, no different than the rest of our recurring revenue businesses. If we believe that, and we do believe that we're optimistic about next year around new business bookings and retention. It's not something that turns around in July or in August. It's a gradual lift back up over the course of the year.","So I think some of it is just the core slowdown in worksite employee growth which has gone from somewhere in the low teens to 9%, I think is what we just said when we ended the year. So that's one factor. And then the other factor, which is actually more significant if you're focused on top line growth, which I would be careful about doing in the PEO, is what happens with pass-throughs. And so as Jan was alluding to, we have an issue with workers' compensation and SUI rates coming down which is frankly a huge positive for us. From a selling standpoint, it's a positive for our clients. It's a positive for retention, but that puts pressure on revenues.","And then the biggest factor really is benefits. When you look at top line overall revenue in the PEO, we've had years, particularly as ACA was starting to kick in in the early years of the Affordable Care Act, we had higher participation rates in benefits. So you had not only inflation of benefit rates, but you had higher participation of benefits. And by participation, we mean the number of worksite employees, the percentage of worksite employees taking benefits.","So that was adding and actually putting downward pressure on margins, because it was putting upward pressure on revenue growth. We now have the opposite effect, which is lower participation on benefits plans. It's been a trend that's been in place for it feels like six or so quarters. We have been watching it quarterly. We think that it probably has something to do with ACA, because you had people kind of first gearing up for ACA and then you had implementation of ACA and although technically many of the rules haven't changed around ACA, it has been, some of it has been defanged and you're getting, I think the outcome that you would expect if you are taking away laws and rules that encourage or force people to have benefits coverage. And so we are seeing \u2013 again, this is not a dramatic drop in benefits participation. But it's enough to pressure the revenue component of overall PEO revenues which is the largest component of total revenue.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So that's helpful. Just to switch gears to the EPS growth outlook for fiscal 2019. So we're talking about 13% to 15%. It sounds like ASC 606 cost you 2 points. So we're really looking at 15% to 17% if we were in an ASC 605 world. And so I'm just looking at that 15% to 17% relative to the 16% to 19% CAGR from the Analyst Day. Do we need to kind of recast that 16% to 19% in an ASC 606 context? Because I think a lot of people are just trying to think about this apples-to-apples versus you were living in the 605 world at the time of the Analyst Day but now you're obviously living in the 606 world.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah let me \u2013 I'll have Jan touch on that in a second. But I should have finished my PEO thought because your \u2013 I don't think I completed the answer to your question. I think that the reason we remain bullish after everything I just said about benefits, I'm trying to give you color and explain kind of what's happening in the revenue growth numbers and in the noise. But in the PEO, the most important thing for us in the PEO is profit per employee. And that is something that we continue to see reasonable growth in. And so the noise around margins and around pass-through revenue growth is just not really the right way to look at value creation because as we now answer your question about EPS, the most important thing for us is contribution to EPS.","So the only place where we're unhappy about the PEO is that we had a slight deceleration in worksite employee growth, which obviously leads to slight decrease in overall growth of profit assuming all other things being equal. So that's a fair issue that's related really to our net new business, to bookings and retention, which we feel better about now going into the new year. But all the other stuff is just noise. And I think the real important thing is to remember that every time we move a client to the PEO or a worksite employee onto the PEO from a pay, it adds profit to the company. And so we have an incentive. We're highly incented to do that as much as possible.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So relative to the impact of 605 and 606 to our medium-term expectations regarding EPS, so as you can deduct from our disclosures, the impact of 606 in fiscal year 2018 was a little bit higher than we had initially anticipated and is a little bit higher also I think in 2019 actually. But we have no outlook relative to its impact that changed compared to our Investor Day schedule that we provided for the outer years. So what that means is we finished 2018 a little bit ahead of our own expectations. So we have really terrific momentum going on. And we feel 2019 is exactly is in line and contributing to our overall goals. So we're not really changing our expectations for the medium run.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. I would say, if anything we feel like the finish we had for 2018 gives us a lot of confidence about the momentum we have to be able to deliver on the commitments that we outlined at Investor Day. So I think the answer would be absolutely not, that I think we feel actually better. And I realize that the guidance and the discussions we had were about 2019 through 2021. But when you finish 2018 ahead of where you thought you were going to finish, we would like to get a little bit of credit for that because what we're trying to get to is higher overall margins, higher overall profit, higher overall EPS. And I think whether it happens in 2018 or 2019 or in 2020 or 2021, those are all good things for us.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, no, agreed. I mean clearly absolute levels of EPS are being guided above the Street. So kudos to you guys on that. Thanks for the color.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just wanted to ask a little bit about the top-line guidance. Employer Services at 4% to 6%, I know it's been running about \u2013 Employer Services has been running about 4% organic. What's the path there to push it up towards the higher end? I think acquisitions and FX probably cancel each other out. So just thinking about what would cause the push toward 6%?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So one of the things that is helping, which is obviously the positive is, we clearly see what appears to be, because of the recurring revenue nature of our business, when you have the challenges like we had with retention and new business bookings causes a lot of pressure on the core growth of an organic basis whether it's Employer Services or the PEO. We now, I would say that the middle of fiscal year 2018, it appears to be the trough. Certainly as of today it's the trough. You just, you don't know a year from now when you look back if that will be accurate. But today, it looks like the trough and so we see clear acceleration of the net of our new business, what we call our net new business which is the difference between our starts that result from sales and our losses.","And so part of the acceleration in Employer Services is about around 0.5 points if you will of acceleration, which is in our world is good. I mean, when I look back to 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 kind of shortly after I became CEO, we had really great momentum around bookings like we have now. We had good retention which we have now. And we added between 0.5 points to 1 point of core growth if you will to the business. So that's my hope now for the next two or three years. And I think 2019 is the first year where we have that baked into the plan because we have the good bookings and we have I think a small improvement in retention also planned as well.","I think Jan actually, when he talked about retention, he mentioned something about 2018 and 2019. So 2018 retention was 90.4%. And we're expecting a 20 to 25 basis point improvement over that in 2019. So I'm sorry, that's one of the factors. We also did include, we are including our interest income, our client funds interest income now as part of the Employer Services segment. And as you know, that's improving and growing. And so that's helping probably 0.5 points as well, 0.5% to 0.75 points, so I think that's how you get to the numbers you're asking about.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then on the PEO side. I know in the Analyst Day we talked about 11% to 14% kind of longer-term growth. Is there a path to get back to that as well or are some of these changes that we've talked about today for the lower growth more permanent in nature?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So it's a good question. We looked at that yesterday and it's a hard path for sure. But the question is, do we really, is that really, even though we provided the guidance and we don't like backing off of guidance, I just talked about previously, that top-line revenue growth from the PEO is not really the most important number to look at from a value creation standpoint, which is why we're providing other disclosures around the PEO now to help with that.","But clearly, it could happen because as we now, we're surprised by the deceleration in benefits revenue and the deceleration in workers' comp and SUI, you could have in 2020 or 2021 healthcare inflation which is not out of the realm of possibility that then gets us to that guidance. But frankly, if we got back into that range, it probably wouldn't change the EPS. And it would change the margins, but it wouldn't change EPS and it wouldn't change dollars of profit for the company. Because what that's driven by is the growth of worksite employees and by retention and new business bookings.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thank you. Just wanted to test your confidence in replenishing the backlog or the pipeline given the strong bookings in the fourth quarter. Any change in salesforce growth or productivity functions? How's the pricing situation looking? And maybe if you can comment on what segments might lead or present a challenge for you in fiscal 2019 bookings? Long question there, sorry.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We have strong confidence. I would say that our confidence is strong in continuing the momentum into the first quarter. I think it's probably, given the way new business bookings work, I think for us to sit here and say, we're obviously providing what we think are very confident numbers about the full year. But trying to look forward to the fourth quarter, you're hopefully not asking about that. So if you're just asking coming off of the first quarter, off of the fourth quarter, how do you feel going into the new year, I would reiterate strong. We feel very strong confidence in our momentum right now.","In terms of, I think Jan said in his comments, I think the strength we see is really across the board. So I think all of the business units frankly are performing well from a new business bookings standpoint. It took some time. Our salesforce, it's, I know it seems like a long time ago but three or four years ago everyone was talking about compliance for ACA and increased government regulation and new laws around overtime and so forth. And so there was a fairly large shift in climate that required a retooling of a salesforce that had been focused more on selling additional business and selling additional modules to one that was focused on selling logos. And to the credit of the salesforce, which is really the greatest salesforce in the world, it made a massive turnaround.","And now we have I think it's close to 60% of our new business bookings coming from new business and new logos versus probably 40% at the low point, when we had the Affordable Care Act giving us that tailwind. So it was a pretty massive retooling. And it took some time. We had to change incentives. We had to change focus and as usual they came through. And you can see the results now.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","All right.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","The good part of new logo growth acceleration, which I think is a good measure of the competitiveness in a new market, is that it was strong really across our segments. So we saw new logo growth really as we sold to new clients in all segments, which was particular focus, as we talked about that in the Investor Day. And those are playing off and that should give us a good run rate going forward.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","All right. Thanks for that. Just my quick follow-up, just on Global Cash Card and the Wisely app. Is the rollout there still on track? Can we still expect to see something in market by year-end? I ask because there seems like there's a lot of activity in that end market. Just wanted an update there.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Not to steal the thunder of the product teams, but Global Cash Card has a lot of momentum. We're selling already the Global Cash Card product, but also the new products are coming out and everything on both acquisitions are meeting their milestones. So we continue to be very excited about them.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Berkley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research, LLC","Thanks for the time. Just to start, just wondering, what were some of those incentive changes that hurt PEO growth that were referred to in your earlier remarks, Carlos? And if the rebound you saw in fiscal fourth quarter holds, would that not imply that your guidance for 2019 on the PEO side could be conservative?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Well, I mean, I don't think that's fair. I think we would have taken that into account. I mean it would be nice to think that we had \u2013 but we really try to be pretty transparent in terms of providing guidance. And we take all factors into consideration including momentum, including recent results. So there's some fairness to that in the sense that the PEO plan was built really during the fourth quarter, while we were experiencing some of this improvement. On the other hand, if you look at the trajectory which is now different, the trajectory was down if you looked at the second and third quarter. Like we would have had a hard time building a great plan.","So I think the good results in the fourth quarter just were added confidence if you will to a turnaround that we were planning for anyway, that we were trying to position ourselves for. So I think all things being equal, I think as with all of our other guidance, I think we're giving you what we really believe is achievable including in the PEO. And I'm sorry the first part of your question was?","James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just some of the inside changes that hurt PEO growth that you guys ended up reversing.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, I don't want to be mysterious or complicated. So we have other \u2013 our salesforces have incentives that we can vary at times. Like for example, our mid market salesforce has an incentive to provide leads to the PEO and they get a certain percentage sales credit which then drives commissions. And by the way, the sales credit is probably more important in some cases than the commission, but just because of the culture of our salesforce. But either way, we have these incentives in place. And if there are other products that salesforce we're trying to sell and we provide, we may not necessarily change the incentive to the PEO to drive leads to the PEO. But if we change an incentive to provide leads somewhere else, it may lead the salesforce somewhere else, which is what happened.","And I don't want to get into too many specifics, but we have other for example BPO solutions that are also mid market oriented, which have also grown at a very healthy rate. And I think we saw kind of a temporary shift, if you will. And we have much higher value, both businesses are great businesses. Both are growing very rapidly. Both have good profitability. But the PEO has a higher dollar profit per worksite employee. And so we went back and readjusted that incentive. So it's not anything complicated or mysterious. It's just that the leads started going to a different place than where they maybe had the highest value to ADP.","James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research, LLC","All right. Understood. Thanks a lot. And then just real quick, this is more of a higher level macro type question, but I figure it's kind of worth asking given the environment. And you know just given that both the labor participation rate and unemployment levels are at historical lows now. Also thinking about demographic trends and the impact of rates such as retiring baby boomers have on the business and those unemployment and labor participation trends. How do you view the health of the U.S. employment market and sustainability of payroll growth overall going forward like the next one, two, three years here?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Well it's a great question for the obvious reasons in terms of where the numbers are. But I think today we reported I think 200,000 \u2013 what was the number? 217,000 additional added to the payroll. So honestly, I think Jan and I have been cautioning and telling ourselves that as unemployment goes down and the labor market tightens that we should see some kind of slowdown there. But we haven't seen it. And it could be as a result of, if you look at labor force participation, and yes it's driven somewhat by demographics, but there's still, there are some arguments to be made that there could be 3 million to 3.5 million people that are still on the sidelines, right.","If you think you could get back to labor participation rates around I think 65%; I think we're at 64% going back to 65%. So again I'm not the macroeconomist. And we kind of try to plan based on the environment we have, the interest rates we have. And we try to be cautious about momentum. But right now, frankly the momentum is really good. So it would not have been prudent for us for 2019 to plan some large drop in employment or some, because it just doesn't feel like that's in the cards, because despite the tightness, apparent tightness of the labor market, you also have an economy that is incredibly strong and it's picked up momentum from a GDP standpoint.","That generally creates demand for labor. That'll also create demand for improvements in productivity which will help the economy. And so it feels to me like a pretty good environment right now, but something that we should definitely watch out for. So I'm not trying to dismiss your point, but not much I can do about it now because it's just too much good news.","James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research, LLC","No, that makes sense. That's all I was trying to get at. It seemed like the labor participation rate being so low that there could be some slack despite unemployment being low as well, so appreciate the commentary. Thanks for your time.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah and by the way, we're just getting now back to, I think it was in the Journal, today they talked. We've seeing the same thing with wage inflation starting to pick up. But it's just now getting back to where it was on average over, call it, I think it was 2001 to 2007 is what the Journal said. And I think it's 2.7%, 2.8%. We show the same kind of trends in our wage inflation. And so even though you're seeing wage inflation, that's a response to for sure tightness in the labor markets. It doesn't change the fact that it's still not running at 4%. So there's something happening. There must be slack in the labor market. There has to be something there.","James Robert Berkley - Wolfe Research, LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Your line is open.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.","Thank you. Good morning. So you laid out three broad drivers of growth at the Investor Day. I think it was sales head count, sales productivity and new products. Could you help us understand your expectation of relative contribution from these initiatives in fiscal 2019? And how that may evolve once we get past next year given the timing of the broader new product rollout?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I'm going to let Jan maybe go through the specifics. But I think what we intended to talk about at Investor Day was a formula going forward not just for 2019, but I think is the way we think about the business which is to have kind of generally speaking balanced growth around head count, productivity of our head count in sales and then from new products. So, if you look at our guidance, I think generally a good way to look at it would be about a third of that growth coming from head count, about a third coming from new products and a third of it coming from productivity. And I don't know if Jan if you want to add?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","That's what I would have said. And it may be gearing ever so slightly a little bit higher on the head count side, but, and productivity side, but in general, that's the mix. And I think the team is optimistic about 2019 to achieve it with some moderate head count growth for the carrier side and then with a bunch of these new products aided by additional acquisitions that come into the pipeline to drive then the overall productivity in addition to the head count growth for the overall result. So that's exactly what.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah and I think to the previous question, Global Cash Card would be in that category.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","That's for example Global Cash Card is a new product that's actually meaningfully adding to our sales growth in 2018.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.","Okay. I guess I was thinking of the new products more like some of the next generation (56:18).","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. So that's the separation (56:18), David. So next generation products will be a very small part only of our 2019 numbers. We accelerated, as we disclosed, a number of clients on the strategic platforms in order to scale and test. But Lifion, that number is not going to be impacting 2019. It will be more meaningful in 2020 and 2021.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, as you know, we're very bullish on our next gen platforms and what they're going to do long-term health of the business. But from a technically speaking standpoint, it's just we're such a big company, I think our bookings for next year are $1.8 billion or somewhere in that neighborhood.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Growth on top of $1.8 billion.","Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","$1.5 billion is the Employer Services bookings number and we're guiding (57:15).","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I'm sorry. Right. The Employer Services bookings number. But and the bottom line is the numbers are big enough now that as we roll out new products, you have to have a lot of them. So our salesforce, when we tell them the same thing about next gen should be really helping you, they focus on this gen. Like they want to know what's available to sell now and so the good news is we have things like our analytics products. We have the acquisitions we just talked about. So we do have a number of things that we've been working on over the prior several years that have now provided ammunition for them to be able to go out and have some portion of that sales guidance come from \"new products\", notwithstanding the fact that our next generation platforms are just not quite at the point where they're going to make a meaningful impact on sales in 2019.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.","Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then just two quick follow-ups. One is I didn't quite understand the unit growth comment maybe that Jan made about the high teens. Is that client growth versus WSE growth? Maybe I just missed that. If you could clarify that and just...","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And I was (58:26), so I apologize David for that. So just, because you're asking, our ADP client growth overall, number of clients that are with ADP grew by 6%. That's the entire base to the 740,000 clients or so. That's about 6%, which is very healthy growth. It's nice, and we're very proud of that. When I referred to our high teens in new logo growth, we refer about the number of new clients that we were able to sell to and compare that to the number of new clients that we sold last year. And that's a different number. That's kind of new logo growth number relative to our new business bookings number. And that really accelerated very nicely in the PEO last year. And so which means basically we had a reacceleration of new business bookings in the PEO, but a lot more smaller clients and the average deal size was a little smaller.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.","Okay.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah, that average deal size had actually grown, had gone up in the last several years. And I think some of it was again, I hate to keep going back, I think we drove some of that through our incentives because I think it's a product that fits both the down market and the mid market very well.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.","Okay got it. And just one last quick one. The acquisition, does that contribute? Could you just size that for us in terms of revenue and profit contribution in 2019?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","The acquisition of Celergo that we announced today is going to be not meaningful to the overall revenue growth.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.","Got it. All right guys, thanks very much.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Very meaningful strategically if I may add. Because again as Jan was alluding to, we're in this conundrum always where we talk about our size. We're $13.3 billion in revenue or whatever the number is for 2018 here that we finished. So when we make an acquisition that is meaningful and strategic and we're very excited about it, unfortunately, financially, it might not have a big impact. But we certainly expect it to have a big impact in our ability to continue selling and be successful in the multinational space which is a, again a mid teens growing business for us and this just extends that leadership and I think that success that we're having in that space.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp.","Okay, got it. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO. Your line is open.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey good morning guys. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Just wanted to shift over and ask about the margin outlook and where you're getting, or I guess where you're looking to drive margin expansion. Just curious if you could share a little bit more about what areas of the business you think you can get that expansion beyond the early retirement and if any color on how much of that is leverage versus some of the maybe more discrete items that you're doing to improve margins overall? Thanks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So I think we've been doing a lot of work. And I think Jan can probably add a couple of examples. But we've been doing a lot of work over the last year or two around what we call process improvement, in trying to really as an example reduce non-value contacts. So we want to make sure that the products themselves are intuitive, easy to use and that we build in solutions so that people don't have to seek out help.","Clearly we're a solutions provider, not just a software provider, so if someone wants help, we're there to help them, but we want to be value added. The non-value added interactions are dissatisfiers for the client and also increase costs for us. And so I think we've made progress in the last couple years in reducing what we refer to as our non-value contacts. So that's a source of margin improvement because it reduces the number of people we need to service X number of clients. And so it's really a productivity enhancement effort.","So I'd say most of the margin improvement that we expect to get, and I would say that the voluntarily retirement is wrapped up into that, because it has to be factored into the overall amount of labor you have is to increase productivity. So increase really revenue per associate or per employee while revenues continue to grow.","So as an example, I think in 2018 we finished with our growth in full-time employees being relatively flat, like compared to what we consider to be pretty good revenue growth. And I think for 2019, we would see kind of a similar picture, maybe slight increase. But we've kind of brought down the nose of the ship if you will in terms of the growth of the number of people we need in order to service X number of clients.","So we're trying to grow the business obviously faster, but we're trying to grow the expense and the number of people to service those clients at a slower rate than even we were growing before. And I think that's what leads to margin improvement. So that's a simplified way of describing dozens of things that we have underway to make ourselves better and more efficient.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","The part of the sources of the margin expansion for your benefit, the most important one as Carlos just described and they're driven then underlining with tools like the early retirement, like our Service Alignment Initiative and general business improvement initiatives to reduce the workload and make our workforce more effective. And so that's a very important part of this. But also our IT folks make meaningful progress to support our infrastructure, that we do see some benefits of reduced complexity because our product set is now simpler and they have really worked hard to drive and control our overall IT infrastructure costs.","So we have seen help from that in this fiscal year and I think we anticipate that going forward. And not to give when we talk about scale, scale doesn't happen on its own. And the most important driver to help with scale is improving retention and we have emphasized that I think throughout our communications that healthy revenue growth and improving retentions are very important to support sustained margin growth, because if you keep a client, obviously you don't have to sell it as a new client. And it's generally high margin business for those clients retained.","So we have other factors that also help in the margin expansion momentum. And I think in the Investor Day I mentioned other initiatives like focusing on our vendor spend for example and a broad range of other things that we are undergoing that will help. But it's not only one thing. It's a lot of initiatives.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","The bottom line is I think fewer platforms, a simplified environment, and then next generation solutions that are much more efficient to operate, more efficient to develop on and more efficient to maintain I think is really part of the formula.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up on the client migration split. What part, I guess what areas of the business is still remaining for migrations if there's any?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We're still focusing on our enterprise space where we have a bunch of legacy clients to migrate and there's also work for us to do in our international business. So we maintained our migration investment year-over-year and focus now a little bit more in the enterprise space.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird. Your line is open,","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering with regards to ES, on the service centers side, can you give us an update with regards to just the service centralization across the five big project centers and how that's progressing and what you're seeing in terms of client satisfaction scores?","And then the second part of the question is, as you look out towards ES for 2019, would you expect the strongest growth to be on SBS and majors relative to national or would you expect international to be one of the strongest growth areas or how would you characterize the strongest growth?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So let me give you a quick update on our Service Alignment Initiative which is really progressing very nicely. So we are very satisfied with the momentum that we have and the transition that worked out. So, we have about, we hired close to 3,000, 2,700 associates in these new service centers which were three new ones and two existing ones, all in about 6,000 associates now. And we have exited about 90% of all targeted locations really on schedule or slightly ahead of schedule.","So the program has been working and now we are rooting in. And as we have indicated the trend continues. We have great employment, employee engagement and excellent client satisfaction scores. That is now so meaningful because a large chunk of the business is in these service centers. So that helped to the improvement in our overall satisfaction. So this is going very well for 2019. We're at scale. So I don't anticipate any dual ops pressure. We had dual ops in 2018. So that's coming out. And we have expanded a few additional locations based on the success of those centers. So all in good light relative to service alignment and our business case. Relative to, Mark I apologize second question was?","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","It's just basically as we look at U.S. growth for the coming year.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Oh the growth, the growth rate in the year.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Like where we would expect the strongest growth versus more moderate growth.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","The question, the strong growth in the ES portfolio is a little more centered around the down market components and our HR BPO offerings throughout all segments actually. So we had good growth in the non-PEO HR BPO offerings and our multinational offerings. So the strength of the growth drivers that we have historically observed, I think we expect to continue. And then we see actually an acceleration of the revenue performance in the mid and the up markets. So it's accelerating and improving, so all segments are really improving in our 2019 plan.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our last question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Most of my questions have been answered. But one question I did want to ask was related to M&A. Should we anticipate that we may be entering into a period of elevated M&A activity or do you expect to maintain kind of the same pace you have over time? And can you just give a little bit of color on the conditions in the M&A market in terms of being able to find appropriate targets and valuation, et cetera? Thank you.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So it's a great question. I mean, I'm very pleased with what we've been able to do on the acquisition front over the last 12 to 18 months. And I think if we could continue to find things like we have found the last 18 months, we would do those all day long. The challenge of course for us as you know is we are in the process of simplifying, reducing platforms, focusing on our next generation platforms. And so that makes it hard to do what I would call traditional, make traditional acquisitions.","So we're not looking for example for the next benefits platform. We're not looking for the next payroll platform. We're building our own next generation payroll platform. We have a great one already that is serving us well and is a very, very profitable. And so it is challenging because when you look at the HCM space, we operate in really across almost every segment from hire to retire. And we feel great about the products and the platforms that we have. But as you saw over the last 18 months, there's always some stuff you can do that's new and can add to the portfolio.","So I think as long as it's additive and fits into our strategic roadmap, we are buyers. And we're on the lookout for those types of ways to use our capital, right, to add shareholder value. So it's kind of hard to give you a completely bullish answer, because we're trying to be very, very disciplined, but we've been very, very fortunate in the last 18 months. And I hope that our luck continues and that we find things that can really be difference makers for our clients, but and to our growth rates, but that also fit into our strategic roadmap and don't just add additional complexity.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thanks. Just quickly, obviously this year we spent a lot of time listening to our shareholders and to all of you as well. And I think our interactions this year, I think just I think reinforced our conviction in the strategy that we're pursuing. We got very positive feedback from our Investor Day about our plans and our strategy to create sustainable long-term value. So we're going to continue obviously on the path that we're on.","The results this year I think really set us up well for fiscal 2019. We feel like we've seen some acceleration, as I mentioned, I would call it a trough if you will in the middle of this last fiscal year. So I think heading into next year, we have really good momentum. So whether it's the next generation platforms that we just talked about, or the mid market migrations or the acquisitions that we just talked about or progress on the Service Alignment Initiative or the voluntary early retirement program, I think it's pretty clear that we are committed to accelerating the pace of change at ADP and that we're actually well underway.","I'm particularly pleased, I have to say this year, with the ability of the organization overall to overcome the pressures that we had from bookings and retention, call it a couple of years ago, that right in the middle of the perfect storm of the Affordable Care Act and some other things that distracted us. But we're past that. You can see that we had solid performance in 2018 and I'm really, that makes me very, very optimistic about the future for ADP.","So, and I think lastly, I have to as always say that when we reflect on all these accomplishments, which are many in 2018, I just want to thank all of our associates for their dedication to providing the best-in-class solutions to our clients, because our business is all about our clients and our clients are all about the associates that serve them.","So with that, I want to thank you for listening in today, and thank you for your continued interest in ADP."],"2633":["Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) Q2 2013 Earnings Call February  5, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Elena Charles","Carlos A.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Webcast. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Elena Charles, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elena Charles","Thank you. I am here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2013 earnings call and webcast. Our slide presentation for today's call and webcast is available for you to print from the Investor Relations home page of our website at adp.com.","As a reminder, the quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings for our reportable segments has also been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. These schedules have been updated to include the second quarter of fiscal 2013. The website schedules  also include a statement of consolidated earnings for fiscal 2012 and each quarter restated for discontinued operations.","During today's conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such, involve some risks. And these are discussed on Page 2 of the slide presentation and in our periodic filings with the SEC.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos for his opening remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Elena. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we get started on the earnings discussion for the second quarter, I'd like to welcome Jan to the call and to his new role as ADP's Chief Financial Officer.","Jan's already had the opportunity to meet with many of you over the last few months, and he'll continue to do so during the rest of the year. Now let's turn to the second quarter results.","I'll make some opening statements, and then I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will take you through the highlights of the quarter, after which I'll return to provide you with an update on our fiscal 2013 forecast. And before we take your questions, I'll provide a few concluding remarks.","Now let's turn to Slide 4. As you read in this morning's press release, ADP reported good results for fiscal 2013's second quarter. I'm pleased with ADP's total revenue growth of 7%, 6% organic, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 7%. Our business segments performed well during the quarter, and overall ADP results were good despite the negative impact from items that we previously communicated to you, which you read in this morning's press release.","I view this quarter revenue growth as quite solid, and is the result of our focus and investment in solutions as well as from our good sales execution over the last several quarters. We believe the uncertainty in the United States surrounding the fiscal cliff had a slight positive impact on revenues as payrolls and bonuses were accelerated into December in advance of expected tax increases.","However, the uncertainty may have also delayed decision making, negatively impacting new business bookings. For the second quarter, combined worldwide new business bookings for Employer Services and PEO grew 5%, but our bookings growth of 9% year-to-date is right in line with our full year forecast for 8% to 10% growth.","I'm pleased with -- that we continue to grow our RUN units and now have over 200,000 RUN clients. I'm also happy to report that interest in Vantage is high, and our sales pipeline is quite strong. In our Employer Services international organization, bookings of our best-of-breed solutions across Europe were again somewhat mixed, given the economic weakness in some of these markets.","Our multinational solutions continue to do well with strong bookings in GlobalView and Streamline.","Moving on from bookings to our other key business metrics. Client balances continued to grow, and the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured by same-store pays per control also increased.","Client revenue retention increased 80 basis points. If you recall, the prior year's second quarter included a large loss that impacted the year-ago results. So the year-over-year improvement is partially due to an easier comparison, but I'm  very happy to report that the quarter's retention still improved when you adjust for the prior year loss.","Moving on to Dealer Services. Dealer had a great quarter. You saw in the release that 2 points of growth came from last year's acquisition. Outside of acquisitions, digital marketing was the largest driver of growth with increased advertising revenue, which as you know, can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter.","In addition, the North American core business benefited from increased transactional revenues, which are tied to car sales volumes, which have seen a terrific return to growth in calendar year 2012.","Our international business in Dealer also contributed to revenue growth in the quarter on strength in China. As you know, the international market has a heavier weighting to onetime license fee revenues than the domestic market. While Dealer had a great quarter, the revenue growth and margin improvement was driven in large part by these transactional and nonrecurring revenues in addition to increased operating scale.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jan to provide the financial highlights and a look at this year's forecast for our client funds investment strategy.","Jan Siegmund","Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to participate in my first call after having responsibility to contribute to the strategic development of ADP.","I'm especially looking forward to translating our strategy into results. As Carlos said, I've had the chance to meet with many of you and look forward to continuing  that dialogue. And I'm also happy to have good results to start off on my first conference call.","Now let's turn to Slide 5. As you may recall, in last year's second quarter, ADP recorded a pretax gain on the sale of assets of $66 million, $41  million after tax and about $0.08 per share. We have treated this gain as a onetime item for comparative purposes. So although we have shown on this slide the year-over-year results, both including and excluding this gain, I'm only going to take you through the results excluding the gain.","Our revenue growth rate improved compared to the first quarter. For the second quarter, total revenues grew 7%, with acquisitions contributing approximately 1 point of growth. Pretax margins increased 4%, and ADP's pretax margin -- I'm sorry, pretax earnings increased 4%, and ADP's pretax margin declined 60 basis points, primarily as a result of continued low interest rates.","But I'm pleased that pretax margins in the business segments expanded nicely. We reported a 6% increase in net earnings from continuing operations on lower effective tax rate.","You may recall that the first quarter effective tax rate was higher than 1 year ago, but  through the first 6 months, the effective tax rate is 34.2%, right in line with our year-to-date expectations.","Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 7% and benefited from fewer shares outstanding compared to last year. We repurchased 5.9 million ADP shares fiscal year-to-date for a total cost of $341 million. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $1.5 billion.","Let's turn now to Slide 6. As you read in the earnings release, there were several items that impacted the year-over-year comparisons, and we have detailed these on Slide 6. As anticipated, revenue growth was negatively impacted by 2.5 percentage points by the following: 0.5 point from unfavorable foreign exchange rates, 1 point from lower client fund interest revenues due to lower market interest rates and 1 point from lost revenue related to last year's second quarter sale of assets and the expiration of certain employment tax credits in our Tax Credit Services business.","A couple of these items also negatively impacted pretax earnings and margins. Collectively, pretax earnings growth was negatively impacted 6 percentage points, and ADP pretax margin was negatively impacted 160 basis points by the following: fiscal 2012 acquisitions did not have a meaningful impact on pretax earnings but negatively impacted ADP pretax margin 20 basis points; the client fund extended investment strategy, which is driven primarily by interest on client funds, negatively impacted pretax earnings growth 4% and pretax margins 110 basis points; the impact from last year's sale of assets and the expiration of certain employment tax credits negatively impacted pretax earnings growth by 2% and pretax margin by 30 basis points.","These items also negatively impacted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations nearly $0.05 per share or 7 points of growth in the second quarter. So the point I'm making is that the underlying business momentum is solid, tempered by these above-mentioned items.","Let's move on to Slide 7 and talk about the business segment results. As I have stated, we are pleased with the performance of our business segments. Employer Services grew total revenues 7%. The PEO grew 13%, driven by 10% growth in the number of our average worksite employees. And Dealer Services grew 11%.","On an organic basis, Employer Services grew 6%, PEO was all organic 13%, and Dealer Services grew 9%. Combined, worldwide new business bookings for Employer Services and PEO grew 5%, and Carlos took you through those items a few moments ago.","Focusing on Employer Services. Of the items we called out that impacted total company results in the quarter, the foregone revenues related to last year's second quarter sale of assets and the expiration of certain tax credits negatively impacted our Employer Services segment revenue growth by nearly 1 percentage point.","Growth from our strategic platform RUN, retirement services and insurance services were the primary drivers of our healthy growth in the small business marketplace. In the mid-market, revenues from our platform Workforce Now are increasing, and so are HR services and comprehensive services revenues. And at the high end of the market, we are pleased with our Vantage new bookings. But the contribution of revenue growth is still small at this point. As you know, it is a new offering for us.","Particularly noteworthy are the attach rates for Vantage. Benefit solutions, Time & Labor Management are approximately 80% each and multi-product sales for Vantage. And the attach rate for Talent, which is a new ADP solution, is already approaching 70%.","Revenue growth in the quarter for multinational solutions was also solid. Same-store pays per control in Employer Services in the U.S. increased 2.6%. However, as Carlos mentioned, same-store pays per control in Europe declined during the quarter, but they were in line with our expectations.","We are pleased with -- that client revenue retention increased by 80 basis points in the quarter. And it also increased when you exclude that large client loss from prior year in the same quarter.","Average client balances increased by 9% in the quarter. We see continuing growth in balances driven by solid new client growth, especially in Small Business Services, wage growth and increased pays per control.","But also, and additionally, we saw an increase in bonus payrolls processed in December, and we believe that the decision for many of our clients to accelerate processing in December versus January was driven by the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. fiscal cliff and some anticipated changes in the tax policy.","Let's now turn to Slide 8. And I'll take you through the forecast for the client funds investment strategy in support of the overall ADP forecast that Carlos will take you through in a few moments.","Before I get into the details of the forecast, I'll point out that the primary objectives of our investment strategy remain safety, liquidity and diversification. At December 31, approximately 84% of our fixed-income portfolio was invested into either AAA- or AA-rated securities. We continue to base the interest assumptions in our forecast on the Fed Funds futures contract as well as the forward yield curves for the 3.5- and the 5-year U.S. government agencies.","We do not believe that it's possible to accurately predict future interest rates and the shape of the yield curve or the new bond issuance behavior of corporations. I will also remind you that up to 15% to 20% of the investments are subject to reinvestment risk each year.","Focusing for now on this slide, you see a summary of the anticipated pretax earnings impact of the extended investment strategy for the client funds investment portfolio for fiscal 2013. We continue to anticipate average client fund balances for fiscal year 2013 in the range of $18.8 billion to $19.1 billion, which represents 5% to 7% balanced growth. We anticipate a yield in the client funds portfolio of about 2.2%, down about 60 basis points from fiscal year 2012, resulting in an anticipated year-over-year decline in client funds interest of about $75 million, which is at the high end of our previously forecasted decline.","As you can see, at the lower right of the chart, in terms of the total pretax impact of the extended investment strategy, we anticipate a decline of $85 million to $90 million for fiscal year 2013, which reflects the $5 million deterioration in the client interest forecast.","Taking you back to our Analyst Conference at the end of May last year, and using the 5% balance growth scenario, we expected a $70 million to $80 million decline in fiscal year 2013.","Since the end of May, the 3.5- and 5-year agency forward curves have declined about 30 basis points on average. Combining the impact of the current lower expected rates, which our balance -- with our balance growth expectations of 5% to 7%, we now anticipate a year-over-year decline of $85 million to $90 million. Looking forward to fiscal year 2013, we still expect fiscal 2013 to be at the bottom of the cycle in terms of the size of our year-over-year decline.","I'll now turn it back to Carlos. He will take you through the remainder of the forecast for fiscal year 2013.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Thank you, Jan. We're now on Slide 9. Our forecasts are going to exclude discontinued operations. For total ADP, we continue to anticipate total revenue growth of 5% to 7%. We anticipate a decline in the total ADP pretax margin of 30 to 40 basis points from 19.2% in fiscal 2012, which excludes the gain on the sale of assets in last year's second quarter.  This compares with our previously forecasted decline of 30 basis points, impacted in part from the increased pressure from lower client funds interest revenue that Jan just took you through.","We expect the effective tax rate will be about 30 basis points below fiscal 2012's effective tax rate of 34.5%. We also continue to anticipate 5% to 7% growth in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations compared with $2.72 in fiscal 2012, which again excludes the gain on the sale of assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.","As is our normal practice, no further share buybacks are contemplated in the forecast beyond anticipated dilution related to employee equity comp plans, but it is clearly our intent to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders, depending obviously on market conditions.","And while we don't provide quarterly guidance, I do want to give you some insight into the year-over-year comparisons for the remainder of fiscal 2013.","Now let's turn to Slide 10.  We've prepared a table to provide a clear view of the year-over-year comparison, showing the impact through the first 6 months and what we anticipate for the third and fourth quarters. We anticipate that foreign exchange rates will negatively impact revenues up to 1 percentage point for the year but with minimal impact for the remainder of the fiscal year. As a reminder, movement in FX rates is not as impactful to pretax earnings.","In addition, as Jan took you through the forecast related to the client funds strategy, the interest revenue piece of this strategy is expected to decline about $75 million year-over-year. The negative impact from an expected lower average yield on the portfolio due to lower new purchase rates is expected to be a full percentage point of drag on ADP's revenues for the full year and in both the third and the fourth quarters, mitigated to a small degree by the anticipated growth in balances.","Including the corporate extended interest income and interest expense related to the strategy, we expect a decline of $85 million to $90 million in pretax earnings. This translates to a drag of about 110 basis points on ADP's pretax margin for the year. The negative impact by quarter is anticipated to be about 100 basis points in the third quarter and about 120 basis points in the fourth quarter.","Now taking it down to EPS, the $85 million to $90 million anticipated decline in pretax earnings equates to a drag of about $0.12 in earnings per share. We anticipate a decline of about $0.03 per share in both the third and the fourth quarter.","Fiscal 2012 acquisitions are forecasted to be earnings neutral in terms of dollars, but we continue to anticipate pressure on pretax margin in fiscal 2013. For the year, we expect about 20 basis points of negative impact from acquisitions, with 20 basis points negative impact in the third quarter and no impact in the fourth quarter as we fully lap the prior year acquisitions.","Finally on this schedule, the sale of assets during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and the end of certain employee tax credits within our Tax Credit Services business are expected to pressure revenue and earnings comparisons in fiscal 2013. And as you can see from this slide, all of the impact has already occurred.","As a reminder, for the full year, we anticipate nearly 0.5 percentage point negative impact on revenue growth and a negative impact on pretax margin of about 20 basis points and a $0.04 year-over-year decline in earnings per share for the sale of assets and the end of these certain tax credits.","I also want to point out that the acceleration of bonus payments into December as a result of the fiscal cliff, which Jan mentioned earlier, is expected to result in lower float related to bonuses in our third fiscal quarter.","Additionally, we anticipate a shift of about $10 million in revenues from fiscal 2013's third quarter to the fourth fiscal quarter. These revenues relate to employment tax credits that were retroactively extended as part of the January 2 U.S. fiscal cliff tax bill. However, the filing for these tax credits was delayed until late in the third fiscal quarter.","So the takeaway here is that we expect some pressures in year-over-year earnings and pretax margin comps for our third quarter, but we are reaffirming our full year guidance, which includes an easier comparison in the fourth quarter.","Now let's turn to Slide 11 for the segment update. The impacts from the expected drag from fiscal 2012 acquisitions as well as the negative year-over-year comparisons from the fiscal 2012 second quarter sale of assets and expiration of certain employment tax credits are reflected in these segment forecasts.","","For Employer Services, we are forecasting revenue growth of 6% to 7%, with pretax margin expansion of at least 50 basis points. We anticipate an increase in our pays per control metric in the U.S. of 2% to 3%.","We're forecasting 12% to 13% revenue growth for PEO Services, with slight pretax margin expansion. We're forecasting 8% to 10% growth in annual dollar value of ES and PEO worldwide new business bookings from the over $1.2 billion sold in fiscal 2012.","And for Dealer Services, we are forecasting 8% to 9% revenue growth, with over 100 basis points of pretax margin expansion.","Now turning to Slide 12. I'd like to leave you with some closing remarks before we open it up to your questions. Overall, I'm very pleased with the second quarter results. Our key business metrics are positive, though I'm still somewhat cautious given the uncertain global economy. Combined Employer Services and PEO Services business bookings and productivity are both good, and Dealer Services is performing well and gaining market share.","As anticipated, market interest rates continue to be very low, unfortunately. I believe that ADP is well positioned to leverage the opportunities of the large global HCM marketplace, and we're keenly focused on our 4 strategic pillars for growth, which include cloud-based HCM solutions, market-leading HR BPO solutions, leveraging our global presence and growing and deepening our key adjacencies.","We're focused on delivering stellar service to our clients and creating an environment that fosters innovation. ADP remains committed to shareholder-friendly actions and returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","As you know, the board approved a 10% increase in the annual cash dividend for calendar year 2013, our 38th consecutive year of dividend increases.","I'm pleased that ADP continues to be rated AAA by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's, reflecting the strength of our business model and of our balance sheet. To sum it up, I believe we're doing all the right things to grow the business and to enhance long-term shareholder value.","Before I turn the call back over to the operator, I just want to let you know that in an effort to adopt best practices and to use your time wisely, we're going to leverage multimedia technology for our Spring Analyst event. As a result, we will not be hosting an in-person event this year. We'll update you in the coming weeks as we solidify our plans. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question, regarding health care reform. Could you broadly talk about the expected impact? And specifically, I'm wondering if PEOs can continue to provide small businesses with lower health care costs in an environment where there are the state-run health care exchanges?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So I actually spent some time a few months ago at our -- with the folks from our PEO on exactly the question on health care reform and the impact on the PEO. And we're feeling pretty good about our ability to continue to deliver value to clients through our PEO even in the face of health care reform. The profile of our client tends to be slightly higher average wage and more white collar, which will probably have less impact, and the client average size in our PEO tends to be also slightly larger than the typical PEO. I believe the average client size is somewhere in the 30-employee range or 40-employee range, and that's the average. So we tend to not have a lot of clients in our PEO that are under 10. Generally speaking, where there would be the most potential for migration is clients that are very small and clients that have lower average wage in terms of their client base. But as you can imagine, we have -- we don't know for sure what the full impact will be of health care reform in the behavior of buyers and small clients or large clients. But I walked away from that meeting feeling pretty good that our value proposition was still quite strong and it was going to be able to hold up and, in fact, be able to provide value to our clients during health care reform. Because there are going to be a lot of compliance requirements and a lot of changes as a result of health care reform that I think small businesses will also need help with. But I think it's something that we are watching carefully. Our sales so far have been relatively stable in terms of -- on the PEO side. Our retention rates actually are quite strong on a year-to-date basis. So I think right now, I think it's just -- we're keeping an eye on it, and we'll continue to, I think, report back on a regular basis if we see anything different.","Jan Siegmund","And Carlos, if I might add, for one, mid- and up-market solutions, you will know that ADP has a strong market position in benefit administration services for our mid- and up-market clients, and we do see a healthy interest of those clients into our solutions, leveraging ADP strength in the compliance and overall understanding of the health care reform. So we think there could be a positive impact on our mid- and up-market business due to the health care reform and pending buying decisions.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes, we're quite excited. I think -- I'm glad Jan jumped in on the second half your question because we are in the mid and upper end of the market, quite excited about our opportunity to help our clients with health care reform. We think this is, as you can imagine, a daunting task for employers to be able to","[Audio Gap]","So obviously, in the upper end and the mid market, we have a lot of solutions that help in a coordinated fashion with compliance. We have time and attendance solutions that will help measure whether an employee is full-time or part-time, which is one of the determinants of eligibility for health care. We will be able to help clients with eligibility management in terms of sending out notices to employees, notifying them that they are eligible, which will be another requirement of health care reform. So there are a number of changes coming down the road that I think we're going to be able to help our clients with. So I think our benefits administration business is quite excited about the opportunity over the next year or 2.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just on a separate note, the pace of acquisitions has slowed a bit recently. Would you expect it to pick up? Are there particular areas that you're focused on expanding?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that our stance on acquisitions really hasn't changed. So we have some parts of our business that are lumpy. I would say acquisitions is the part of our business where you have the most lumpiness because we don't really force ourselves to make acquisitions at any particular time frame. We make them when, I think, they make sense and when the valuations are right and when there's a fit. So we continue to be actively looking. We've actually looked at quite a number of things. We've had a lot of discussions over the last 3 to 6 months. But we are where we are, and we would love to be able to find things that fit well into our product portfolio and help us with our growth plans. But we're also quite disciplined, which I think we've always been. But no change in our approach to acquisitions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Could you quantify new Employer Services and PEO global bookings growth by small, majors and nationals? And in connection with that, can you update us on the timeline for general release for Vantage HCM?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So in terms of the -- we don't give specific percentages by each segment. But I can give you just  tone. And tone-wise, as I think we tried to give you in our opening remarks, I think we did feel some of the uncertainty, if you will, about the fiscal cliff and the tax policy and so forth and people delaying decisions. Although as you can imagine,  very hard to quantify and assign any kind of percentage to it. But the reason we think that is that, we were on a pace of delivering double-digit sales growth for several quarters. And we slowed a little bit into the fourth. Now part of that -- I'm sorry, into this quarter -- part of that is the fact that last year's second quarter was already quite strong at 14% growth, but some of it was probably some of this uncertainty in the marketplace. So the -- I think the result -- these results were frankly consistent across the board, with the 1 exception being National Accounts, where we have  still quite robust sales results. And again, there -- this may be a rationalization, but momentum in the National Accounts sales process, once it gets going, it tends to carry through. And  we have definitely seen a pickup in momentum there in the last 2 or 3 quarters. And I think deals just continued to get done despite some of this uncertainty. But it does appear that in other parts of the business, that there was some delay in decision making and that the sales results were fairly pretty much in line with the overall results that we reported, which is 5% growth for the quarter. And I'm sorry, what was the second part, David?","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The second part was updated timeline for general availability of Vantage HCM and whether you had any granularity on Vantage HCM bookings in the quarter.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that the general release for Vantage is scheduled for September. And I think right now, we have 40 deals sold, so signed contracts. I believe we have just under 10 that are actually live, and we expect to have a little over 20 live by the end of our fiscal year. So it's still great progress, great momentum, a lot of excitement but very small impact to revenues for a business our size.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could  perhaps, similar to David's questions on sales, a little bit of commentary on sort of the pricing environment that you're seeing by subsegment. And then I'm kind of a particularly interested in kind of the rate of discounting that you're sort of -- that your sales force is sort of being afforded within this environment, has anything really changed?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I wish I had more color for you, but I'm not aware of anything changing. We haven't changed our policies and our -- we have -- I think, like most companies, we have policies around how much discounting is allowed at particular levels. So a field sales person has x percentage of discounting authority, and then the manager has a little bit more. And I think those policies have been pretty consistent for a long time. And honestly, we're not seeing any -- I can't think of any major changes or anything that we're seeing in the environment from a pricing standpoint, in really, in any of our segments, unless Jan, if you have...","Jan Siegmund","No, we have price increase in our revenue base consistent with prior years, so really no change dramatically in the pricing environment [ph].","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that would imply that competitively, the competitive environment, whether it's your major national competitors or other sort of SaaS providers, it's all pretty much status quo?","Jan Siegmund","Yes, if you would think about our client growth that we have across the enterprise, we continue to see at the same solid trend that we have reported in prior quarters and prior years. So we really continue to chug along to grow faster than overall enterprise numbers in the U.S. growth, so we are confident that we're gaining share really in most of our segments.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes. And I think that the -- the fact that we're gaining share is, I think, a sign not only that I think we're \"competitive\" from a price standpoint, but it's not just about price, it's also about, obviously, value and service. So I think that we feel like we have the right combination when you look at our sales results and our growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John T. Williams with UBS.","We'll go to the next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about the -- on the sales, I know there were some delays in decisions. And I know that we're now in the key selling season, so just curious to know if that has continued in January. Or have you seen, finally, some decisions being made?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","So let me first start off by saying that we, to be clear -- I think the evidence we have of any kind of delays in decision making are anecdotal and instinctive. It's also important to just remind you once again that we had a very strong second quarter last fiscal year, 14% sales growth. But having said that, we do think that there was a little bit of an impact. I think that -- I really don't know that there was really any more that we could add in terms of the picture in terms of the sales. We're hoping, obviously, that things will continue to be along the lines of what our year-to-date results are, which are right now 9%, which is still within the range of our 8% to 10% guidance. So I think we're still happy with our sales results. But the second quarter is what it is, it's 5% growth.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And have you seen anything to note in -- early in the sales season, maybe what you guys are doing or what competitors are doing or just anything happening? I know this is a critical period here, this first few months of the year.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I was trying to avoid your question, but the -- we do have our January results, and we obviously don't report by month, but I can tell you that our January sales results were in line with our full year forecast, so somewhere in that 8% to 10% range.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, no, that's helpful. And just wanted to get a little bit of color on Europe. Obviously, still a lot of concern there in the market. So can you just talk about how Europe looks and maybe the outlook in the European business for you guys?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Europe, I think I would describe it best as not helping in terms of our growth rate but could be a lot worse. So I have to say that I'm pleased with both Dealer Services and Employer Services international performance in Europe in view of the backdrop and in view of what we've just gone through. Our pays per control growth, for example, is slightly negative, just around 1% negative. And that, in our world, from what we know historically of what can happen in the U.S. and to the business overall, is a relatively modest decline. Some of that is related to, in an interesting way, the positive of the inflexibility of the labor markets in Europe, which I think helps us on the way down. But obviously, what we would like to see is a robust economy there, where employment starts to pick up again. But our sales results have been -- I would call them flattish, which I think in this environment is something to, I think, be happy about. Our retention rates are actually quite strong, which is -- actually makes sense. And we've seen this before in the U.S. and in Europe. When things get difficult, people tend to hunker down, so there's not a lot of change, so it makes sales a little bit harder, but it tends to help retention a bit, which is what we're seeing there. So retention is strong. Sales are kind of flattish. Revenue growth is single, low single digits. I think all -- I think, to be expected and frankly, better than what I would've thought if you'd asked me 1 year ago what would happen.","Jan Siegmund","If I add one component to this is just -- Carlos mentioned we had strong national account sales momentum in the quarter, and that extended actually into our multinational solutions. So our GlobalView and Streamline solutions were among the fastest growers for the quarter. And that, of course, has impact for our European operations because they benefit from some of those multinational deals that we record in the multinational. So continued success in the upmarket with our -- and with our GlobalView and Streamline solutions. That was a good quarter for that product set.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So  just wanted to ask a question on the margins. I know there've  been a lot of moving parts in the margin equation for the past year or so, and you guys did a really nice job of disclosing a lot of that. As you start to think about fiscal '14, and recognizing that we could see another year-over-year decline in float income, albeit not as steep as the decline we're experiencing this year, do you think we're going to see material expansion in overall ADP pretax margins next year?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I think the best way to characterize our situation is that -- is the way you described it, which is we expect a little bit less pressure. And I think we went through that in the Analyst Meeting, so I think you have that information. So we do expect a little bit less pressure in '14 from interest-rate drag, but we still expect some drag, so that will help a little bit. And we see pretty good margin expansion at the segment level, as we just reported for the second quarter, so I think it's safe to say that we're feeling pretty good about where we are in terms of our ability to deliver margin despite all of these moving parts. But as you can appreciate, we haven't given our guidance for '14 yet, and we're really not in a position yet in terms of our operating plan process to really get down to that level of detail. But I think that it's -- we feel better than we felt 1 year ago because the easing on the interest rate pressure does help a little bit, but it's not -- we're not going back to positive in '14, so I just want to make sure that, that expectation is out there.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right, right. And so I mean, if we go back to Slide 8 in today's deck, where you guys highlighted the $85 million to $90 million drag from the float income, and you guys pointed out that, that  number had changed a bit since the May Analyst Meeting when I think it had been $70 million to $80 million, if I'm not mistaken. In lockstep with that, have the fiscal '14 assumptions, working assumptions, back in May, have those also changed?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","They've changed a little bit, but I think they're pretty consistent. I mean -- again, I think we probably -- we feel better about waiting. When you look at what's happened to  interest rates, I think the 10-year went down to -- and obviously, the yield curve moves somewhat with the 10-year, but I think it bottomed at under 1.5%. Then it went above 2%. So this is a -- this is unfortunately also a situation where I'm not sure that there's  a huge amount of value in us giving you a number today because in 3 months, it's going to be a different number. I think what I would focus you on is in our core business. I know it's important for you to get this number right on the client interest pressure, but what I want to have people focus on is what's happening in the core business, what's happening with our core margins, what's happening with new business bookings, which is all quite positive. And this interest-rate picture, I'm not -- not to be cavalier about it, but it will take care of itself. And hopefully, it has begun the process of taking care of itself as we've now seen at least a slight turn in rates in the right direction from our perspective.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","No, that's all helpful and fair. Just a quick follow-up on the bookings, I mean, given where you are year-to-date, on the back of this Q2 number, I mean, are you any less confident in the full year target? And the only reason I ask is I know you've got a very difficult comparison in Q4, I believe 20% [ph], which is even a bit harder than what you just went through. So just wanted to test your confidence level there based on what you're seeing in the pipeline. Because clearly it seems like you've got some pretty good traction with some of your newer products.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes, I think if we weren't confident, we would've changed our guidance, I think, is the right thing to say. I'm very confident. But as you know, in our business, we can -- pretty much for the next 6 months, we have a very good view of what's going to happen with revenues, because we're a recurring revenue business. But new business bookings are something that is not quite as easy from a science standpoint to pin down, but we're feeling pretty confident and we don't really see any change. When we did some, I guess, some checking, if you will, and some asking, we didn't hear anything other than the anecdotal stories about a very, very difficult year-end process of trying to get people to make decisions in the face of this whole fiscal cliff and the uncertainty on the taxes and so forth. There might be something else going on that we just haven't been able to put our finger on, but we haven't been able to find anything.  And hence, we had tremendous momentum before that, we had good sales productivity, and I don't see any reason for us to back off of our confidence in our forecast for the full year.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So I just -- I wanted to sort of -- my first question is just maybe I could -- we could get a summation of sort of how the end of the year, calendar year, played out in the first quarter. It's fair to say that there were decision delays. And then you saw a pickup in January. And then, any color you can give on sort of that continuation of momentum, was that some pent-up demand? Or was that just sort of people easing into the year? Or is the economy getting slightly better?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, the only thing that I mentioned was bookings. So I don't really have any other data that I could share from January in terms of just the economy and other parts of our business. But January is our largest new bookings month, and so getting through January in a healthy way with good results is very, very important for both new bookings and for client retention. We still have 5 months, but if January is the biggest month in both new bookings and also client retention, then obviously, as you go further into the year, our confidence level grows higher and higher about our forecast. So that's really why you heard the comments the way that I made them. But it's not because I have any other specific information or data about January.","Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just maybe a follow-up. On the technology front, how do you feel you're competing at the larger account base? And maybe you could talk about any shifts in market share that you're seeing across the board.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I'm not -- I'll let Jan also add his two cents' worth, because he was involved in a lot of the product discussions in his prior role. But it feels like we have made really substantial improvements from a usability and kind of from a pure technology standpoint. So I think we have a greater focus on the product itself in addition to what we have always had a lot of focus on, which is the service. This is something that really started probably 2 or 3 years ago. We have examples of it in all of our different segments, in Small Business with RUN, in mid-market with Workforce Now and in the high end with Vantage. So I'm quite pleased with our progress. But I think if we look at ourselves in the mirror, we have to say that there's -- we still have to continue to move quickly and be more agile because that's what's happening in the world around us. So you'll see, for example, not a dramatic increase but a slight uptick in our spending on R&D and development when our Q comes out. And that's no coincidence because we do feel like we need to invest more on the product than on the technology side. But I think the best way to characterize it is I think we've made enormous progress. I'm very proud of what we've been able to deliver in really all of our major segments over the last 2 or 3 years. But the heat is still on in the kitchen because I'm pushing hard to not let up and to really kind of turn the speed up even higher on the product development side. I don't know if Jan has...","Jan Siegmund","Yes, I think, Carlos, you put it -- Vantage, our upmarket product, is performing to our expectations for the year. So we are satisfied with the win-loss rates that we have in competitive situations for that product set as well as with the overall volume that we are booking as of year-to-date, and that team is optimistic for the year. We could have -- we have a similar story, as you have followed for a long time, of course, for RUN and Workforce Now, really very big revenue carriers in ADP, which important for us and we can see -- we continue to see the competitive strength of those products in those markets. In addition to the focus on R&D in our strategic platforms, I think aided that success is our continued focus on migrating our clients onto those latest platforms. And it probably contributes as much to our competitiveness by having our clients on the latest platforms and particularly in our major accounts segment, we're making very good progress according -- compared to our expectations with our migrations also. So overall, more competitive product for more clients of ours would be my assessment.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think that's an excellent point, the migrations issue. When you look at us versus our competition, we're feeling pretty good about our technology and our products, but we do have some work to do on our installed base. Some of our newer competitors don't have, I think, the luxury because I think it's a luxury, because we have huge cash flows and great client retention from our installed base. But it is something that we have to contend with that some of our competitors don't have to contend with.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess I wanted to start with -- the point you made about the 4 strategic pillars of growth, cloud-based HCM, HR BPO, leveraging global presence.  Would seem to me that these are, at least in the initial phases, have to be sort of lower-margin  type of endeavors. Could you comment on the margin cash flow impact of these, if you could?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Sure. Well, I think that -- for starters, in Vantage, using Vantage as an example, which is -- I think fits into the category of our strategic pillars, the attach rate on Vantage for additional products is quite strong. So we're seeing, in addition to traditional ADP would be strong in selling just payroll. And then  we would try to add on other things like benefits administration, Time & Labor management, and HR, what we're seeing now is with this kind of HCM cloud-based solution, we're actually selling all of them together quite often. So our attach rates for benefits administration, I believe, are around -- and for Time & Labor Management are 80%. And our new Talent solutions, I think are attaching at around 70%. And so that -- those are meaningful increases, in some cases around twice the attach rate that we had before when we had our legacy platforms that were really standalone, where there was integration but they were not unified, and it wasn't one single database. They were not in every case tightly connected. So we believe that being able to sell those products together, being able to service those products together and delivering that kind of value proposition, I think will be an enhancer to margin and an enhancer to growth, not a detractor. And that same strategy, I think, is something that is a strategy that we're following in major accounts with our Workforce Now platform, where we also have benefits administration, Time & Labor Management and Talent solutions as part of a broad HCM package. And even in our small business market, in RUN, we've added HR solutions, lighter obviously, simpler HR solutions for our clients, and I think help increase the average value of a new business sale. So I -- our strategy is not to go after lower-margin businesses.  We, in fact, think that the strategy overall will help us from a margin standpoint going forward.","Jan Siegmund","And with respect to the margins of our cloud-based platforms that are already well penetrated in major accounts as well as in SBS, you see them in our today's margin. And compared to our existing platforms, they are high-margin  businesses for the strategic platforms. So I don't think it is a good assumption to systematically anticipate lower margin for our cloud-based solutions.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","The only place where I think it would be fair to assume margin pressure is the more successful some of these products are, the more sales cost pressure we have. But again, I think all of my predecessors have said this, this is a problem that I welcome, like we would welcome having such robust results from a new business booking standpoint that we run into a margin challenge as a result of sales cost. It's not happening now. I hope it happens at some point in the future. But GlobalView would be an example where I think the underlying margins are showing great improvement, the business is healthy, but we've had  very large sales expense in the past 3 or 4 years just because of the rapid growth of that business. But you're beginning to see it now actually turn -- I believe, it's going to be breakeven around the fourth quarter of this year. So you just have to look at the margins like we do, and separate out the sales and new business costs from the underlying core margins. And the core margins, we think, are quite positive.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay.  Couple of numbers questions that I seem to have missed.  Cash flow expectations for the year and impact of onetime licenses that you mentioned within Dealer?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","The onetime licenses in Dealer, I think was not a huge number. We're just trying to give you some color around creating expectations going forward. But as an example, revenues in our -- and that was mainly in the international part of Dealer Services.  Our core revenue there grew -- I think it was around 3%, while our license revenues grew 6% to 7%, or somewhere in that range. So they were just slightly higher but in the magnitude of -- on -- in terms of the impact on ADP, the overall ADP results, I would not change anything or modify anything in your models. I was just -- we're just trying to give you some color that there were a lot of things that helped Dealer -- they had a fantastic quarter even if you exclude some of these onetimes, but they got some help from some of these onetime licensing fees and some transactional volume increases. In terms of our cash flow for the year...","Jan Siegmund","Yes. So we expect cash flow to be just growing in line with the business, approximately between $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. In the first quarter, you saw a few onetime items flowing through that you should reconcile out of this. So $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for the year is probably a good estimate.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Paul Thomas with Goldman Sachs.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess not to beat up on the bookings too much, but was the pace in December any different compared with October or November? Did it sort of slow through the quarter, and now January is kind of back to normal?  Or any color on the pace sort of through the quarter would help.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","That's a -- I'm ashamed to say that I don't know that I have -- and maybe Jan has...","Jan Siegmund","December was a little bit slower. We saw a little bit slowing towards the end of the quarter here. I think that's a fair question, and which leads us also to this assessment of the impact of the fiscal cliff and the delayed buying decision.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I've learned my lesson. From now on, I will also have all the monthly growth rates so I can be prepared.","Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that. And I guess one more on Europe. You mentioned pays per control in Europe being down 1% in the quarter. How are you thinking about that in the second half of the year? Do you think it's going to stay in that range? Or is there any improvement anticipated?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I'm sorry, just to clarify, the 1%  is really the month of December. It wasn't that much different the other 2 months of the quarter. But I -- my number, we look at pays per control -- it's a point-to-point number, so we typically don't look at it as a quarterly number. We look at it as of a particular month. So it's just one of those internal metrics we use. But it has -- I guess to give you a history, it went negative during the financial crisis that hit the entire globe, and then it actually started trending back to flat and got to flat, and then started turning slightly negative again about 6 to 9 months ago and is now at about negative 1%. And that -- it was almost like a gradual decline to 1%. So you can imagine, it was probably -- it was around 0, 6 to 9 months ago, and now, it's at negative 1%. If you look at past patterns, if the crisis truly has now been -- this next -- this most recent crisis has been averted, it's likely, although it's dangerous to forecast pays per control, it's likely that it won't go much deeper in the negative range. It will begin again to slowly either flatten out or start gradually turning back close to 0 at some point. The labor markets in Europe tend to move much slower. It's very difficult to let people go, and hence, you don't have a precipitous drop in pays per control. But likewise, people are very hesitant to hire for that very reason because they know that it's difficult to let people go, so the pickup in employment also tends to move very gradually. So the bottom line is you shouldn't expect any major changes in that number in the next 2 quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You mentioned very healthy attach rates on your Vantage and Workforce Now products. Can you  give us a sense as to how much higher the revenue contribution is from a Vantage sale or Workforce Now sale compared to your legacy solutions in the past?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","As a matter of fact, I happened to get some information on that topic last week because we were having some discussions with our National Account sales force, and we wanted to kind of do a comparison of what we were getting in terms of not just total revenue but even on a per-employee basis, in terms of on a per-pay basis, what we were charging for the various components before versus now. Because one of the things we didn't want to do is the overall revenue dollars be higher for a client but be getting  smaller per-employee numbers for each individual product, i.e, benefits, payroll, HR, Time & Labor Management, et cetera. So the numbers  I saw gave me a lot of comfort that, that was not in fact happening, that we were in fact getting some pricing on a per-product basis that was as good as we were getting in the past, but now we're getting more total revenue because we're having a higher attach rate. So to put it in perspective, it could be anywhere in the 30% to 40% range in terms of additional revenue for a client that 4 or 5 years ago was sold only payroll versus today, they buy benefits and PLM in addition to their payroll.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And  just last question for me. Just sort of the conversion of the installed base to some of the new SaaS-based products, can you give us a sense where that stands in the majors and national segments?","Jan Siegmund","Yes, we are migrating our clients in major accounts which are on our legacy platforms in a very systematic manner to the Workforce Now platform. And we're meeting our plan or are slightly ahead of our plan and hoping that we'll complete that endeavor -- end of '14, beginning of '15 is kind of the overall migration plan. So we're making good progress, actually slightly faster than we expected it. Did I answer your question?","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, sorry.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess 2 questions. In the sales of the new platforms, RUN, Workforce Now, Vantage, how much of the volume or units that you've talked about is  upgrade of existing customers versus sales to new customers?","Jan Siegmund","Yes. As we report our new bookings number, they are either -- that reports only incremental revenue opportunity for ADP. So when we migrate a client from an old platform to a new platform and there's no revenue impact, we would not record this as new bookings in our number. So you'll see our new bookings number is a really pure number of additions to our recurring revenue base. That's how the system is designed. And we do see, as Carlos reports, that actually clients that migrate from legacy platform and major accounts up to the Workforce Now platform, that in a good number of 30%, 40% of the times, the clients actually expand the products that they buy with us because the new platforms offers this. And we would book the additional revenue as sales but not the existing revenue. So what you see is really all incremental to ADP, and no migration revenue is included in our net new bookings.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","That's a great point in terms of from a financial reporting standpoint, that you're getting a pure number that's affecting our revenue growth, not just simply rebooking something that we already had because we're migrating the client. But having said that, just to give you a little bit of color, in the Vantage situation, we believe only 2 of the clients that we've sold of the 40, maybe 3 and maybe 4, but it's a small, relatively small number, are actually existing ADP clients. Those are new logos. So part of that is exciting to me because it's market share, and it's wins in the marketplace. But frankly, we also need to build a lot of capacity.  Given how successful we are seeing the platform in the marketplace now, we are very busily trying to build capacity to be able to also migrate clients. Because if the clients that are out in the marketplace want this, our existing clients also want it. And so for the time being, it's a really positive story because it's new market share and it's new logos. But we have 2 move these clients over to this platform. We have to build that capacity. The same is true in major accounts, where there we have a bit more momentum in the sense that we have a very, I think, effective and large plan for migrations of clients onto Workforce Now. And they are, I think, moving along at a quite rapid pace in doing that. And that's also, I think, a great process because as Jan mentioned, it not only creates a stronger relationship with our clients because it's a better product, but it also presents a cross-selling opportunity for some of our additional products. By the way, not to leave -- sorry, not to leave out RUN, we have a very aggressive program to -- we now have 200,000, so more than half of our SBS, Small Business clients, are now on RUN. So this is the time now to step on the accelerator, and that's what we're doing. So our team in Small Business has put together a very, I think, good and aggressive plan for migrating our EasyPay clients over to our new RUN platform. It will still take several years to do it, but I think it's a new day for ADP on these migrations. And I feel -- I think the momentum that people are really, I think, taking it quite seriously. And we're really putting, I think, our money where our mouth is and making sure that we make these transitions happen.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then the follow-up question, you cited digital marketing as an area of strength in the Dealer business. I guess,  haven't really got an update on that since you did the big acquisition a couple of years ago. But could you just give us a sense, growth versus the core DMS product, how the margins are looking on that, how successful you've been with the story you told a couple of years ago about really focusing on up-sell and cross-sell this into the huge installed base, just how's  that going overall?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, I'll start with the -- only because I happened to  look at it last night, but the margin question, so we're making progress on the margin, so very happy to see the digital marketing group contributing not only positive margin but improving positive margin as well. So very happy about that. I think on -- and it was actually more than double in terms of the margin percent. Although still well below our core DMS margins, the margin more than doubled -- the pretax margin more than doubled versus the prior year, so very happy about that. In terms of growth, the business is growing faster than our core DMS, where I don't think we really want to get into specifics in terms of by how much or what the exact percentages are. But I think it's living up to, I think, our expectations from a growth standpoint. And I think the margins now are starting to get better. It's creating a stronger relationship with our clients, with our Dealer clients. So it's -- I think it's -- I think so far, I think we're very pleased with what's happening. The only caution, which I think we mentioned in our comments, is that, that  business, because it is a digital marketing business, tends to have volatility in terms of advertising revenue. So if a car maker is launching a new car, there could be a very large contract that may be only for a few months or for a quarter that generates a lot of revenues that are not necessarily recurring. So that's something that we will continue to try to give you more color about so that you have the proper, I think, ability to plan or to change your models in the future. But this quarter was unusually positive on the revenue side because of some of that lumpiness. But generally speaking, I think we're happy with the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I know it's late. I got a couple of quick questions, though. You mentioned the impact of the fiscal cliff, some of the benefits. I'm just wondering from a cost perspective since there was a delay in finalizing the exact rates for tax purposes, et cetera, are there any extra SG&A costs that might have been pushed over from the fiscal second quarter into the current quarter?","Jan Siegmund","No. I -- you should -- there is no impact on the late implementation. Actually, compliments to our teams out in the field and in the development. Within hours after the release of the IRS instructions on the new rates, we were processing the payrolls on the new rates. We have it quite pat down now to really anticipate late action by the legislative branch of the country. So it went very well, and I think our clients benefited from a very quick implementation of this. So there should be no impact on the cost side from that.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I think the performance of our organization, again, was -- I think last quarter, this -- when we were having this call, we had just gotten through the hurricane. And I talked about how impressive the -- I think the performance was of our organization and also of our associates all over the world, in that case, that helped us get through that. This was not necessarily on the same scale but certainly really an impressive, impressive performance by our organization to have all of these changes done within 48 hours of them being published. So our clients all had the correct tax tables and the correct withholdings and the correct payroll tax withheld. It's just really -- it's a testament to what ADP can deliver in an outsourced solution versus when you're doing it on your own or you're using  software, whether it's cloud-based or not.","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right, great. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned the positive of accelerating some bonuses and payroll in December. Did you quantify that for us?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","We didn't. That's because --","Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Is it possible to do that?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","No, I think it was -- I think it -- again, it was -- like the bookings discussion where we have some anecdotal evidence, because we can look at specific clients that last year paid their bonuses in January and this year paid them in December, but we didn't go -- we have 600,000 clients. And so our ability -- we didn't find a way, and we don't have a -- we don't think we have a way of going client by client and seeing which ones paid last year in January versus this year in December. We just took a sample, particularly the very large ones, and we know that some of them paid in December. So that's why we gave you that kind of sense. But we do have some sense of January balances, and I will tell you that it was -- January was still good. And so the shift was -- we clearly saw better results in December than we expected, but there wasn't a huge pullback from January from what we can see now.","Jan Siegmund","If I add  one comment to this, is the new tax laws, of course, changed the rates for some of our high-earning employees, and so there's an impact on the balances going forward that is small, though. But particularly the time between January and December is hence a little bit muddled. New rates coming in and pull-forward  of some of the payroll processing. So it's really probably not wise to give you precise numbers on it, more a direction.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","It was all part of the picture that the third -- I think it puts a little bit of pressure, again, it's probably a relatively small number, but we have a few other things that are still pressuring the third versus the fourth. We feel a lot better about the fourth than, I guess, the third, is part of why we're giving you some of this color.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Actually, my questions have been answered.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a question about the competitive landscape out there. Can you just give us an update on the competitive impact of emerging Software-as-a-Service players? And in particular, can you give us some thoughts on how players like Workday are affecting you in the Payroll business compared to the broader Human Capital Management business? In other words, it seems your win rate in Payroll against large-enterprise  SaaS players, your win rate is probably still quite high, but I'd also value any specificity you can provide on that. And then how that win rate is looking in the broader HR services market outside of Payroll.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","A great question. Let me just start off by saying that we are a SaaS player, too. And I know I say that every quarter and I say that every meeting, and I think people tend to forget it. Vantage is a SaaS-based, cloud-based, fully integrated, fully unified HCM solution. So having said that, I think you're still right that it's not just about the cloud. It's about functionality and it's about usability. And I think you have done your homework very well, where I think no matter how you deliver the product itself, whether it's on the cloud or not on the cloud, we are still quite successful in the Payroll side. And I'm talking now for this, for purposes of this question, the upper end of our market. So we're very, very successful still in the Payroll space, in part because we always have been, and our solutions, our cloud-based, no different than any other provider would have a cloud-based payroll solution. I think when you get the broader HCM and HR and specifically when you talk about Workday, I think what we've seen so far is I think an ability to win against Workday, certainly in payroll and HR but much harder on the HR side. So we would acknowledge that I think we have work to do I think on the HR side in terms of our competitiveness against specifically Workday. And so they have a great solution that is getting really great traction in the marketplace. As an important reminder, though, we do have a lot of clients who will purchase Workday's HR platform and utilize our payroll platform. So we have the ability to work with and integrate with Workday as we do with Oracle, SAP and others as well. And so we do have ambition of being an HCM player, so we are competitors to some extent with Workday, but we also cooperate and can be the payroll provider if a prospect or someone in the marketplace chooses Workday as their HR provider.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. And then in the HR side where you say Workday is much more competitive, I'm assuming even in that area of the world, the market is somewhat bifurcated. In other words, Workday seems very strong on talent management. My guess is you guys are probably strong on benefits administration and time and attendance-type  stuff. I mean, are you seeing a differential in your ability to win when it's focused on benefits admin versus talent management? Is that a way to think about it?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Well, let me just say that -- we'll have to play back the tape, but I don't think I said that they're much more competitive, but I'll have to go back and -- I say that I think that they're effective. And effectiveness, I think, means a lot of things. It means, I think, momentum, it means marketing, it means a lot of different things. But I think that they are particularly strong in the usability of their products. This is again going by what I would call anecdotal evidence, in terms of what I'm hearing in the marketplace. So I'm just acknowledging where I see their strength. But just to be clear, I think we are very competitive against them, and we are winning, in some cases, in the marketplace against them as well. So I think that our competitive position is quite good, I think, against them. But it doesn't have to always be a competitive situation because we can cooperate and we can work with Workday in situations where a client wants to have a Workday HR solution and wants to have ADP for payroll. And I just -- as again, as a reminder, that's the same -- that is also true for Oracle, SAP and other enterprise resource providers. And I'm sorry, Rod, you had a second part of your question. I'm -- what was it...","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Well, no. And I understand your point. I mean you're not saying they're more competitive than you. What you're saying is that they're more competitive on -- in the HR services market than they are in the payroll market. You clearly have a better win...","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes, I think that's a fair -- back -- I remember your question now. So the -- in terms of our -- I don't think it's the case that they have better talent solutions than we do. Again, I'm going by anecdotal evidence here, but we have a pretty strong talent portfolio or solution as part of Vantage. I think you heard that we have a 70% attach rate to it. So we feel pretty good about our ability to compete in talent with our products, with Workday and with others as well. I think the particular strength of Workday is in HR and it's in the usability of the product itself. But there is a lot more beneath the surface to a product than a solution. We believe that service is an important component. We believe that feature functionality is also important. So I think there are other places where we can differentiate ourselves and still be successful. And I think we're seeing that, I think, in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I know it's getting late, just 2 quick ones. Retention, that was better than we expected. How much of that is, how I should say, healthier clients versus less competitiveness versus some of the new products, and the halo effect that you might have on the new products?","Jan Siegmund","So I think for the quarter, we mentioned in our prepared remarks that the 80% improvement was partially aided by an easier grow-over compared to the prior year's quarter where we had a large client loss that we reported also separately. I think the range is probably 60% of the improvement was aided by this 1 client grow-over thing. And if you take that out, you would still see about a 20 basis points improvement for the year -- for this quarter. And I caution you to read too much in the 20% improvement. It's solid. We have solid client service and we see really no specific trends and changes in retention that would be worth reporting. And also the second quarter is not a very large loss quarter for us, so the volume, it tends to be a little bit lower. So my comment would be we'll continue on the steady path of delivering good service, and ever so much inching our retention up a little bit is probably a fair description.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And I think inching is a good -- is a very good description because when you look at our retention rates over the last 3 years, it's been between 91% and 91.2%, so you're talking about a 20 basis point swing, and all of that is in what I call record territory. So our retention, 91.1%, I believe, and 91%, somewhere in that range, was the highest we had been until 2 or 3 years ago when we got to 91.2%, then we went to 91%, now we're probably around 91.2% again. So substantial improvements from '08 and '09 and prior years, but we're at levels now that I think that we're certainly not giving up because we believe that there's still opportunity. But it's in tens of basis points, not in full percentage points from a guidance standpoint. I think that's something you should think about.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood. Yes, even the 20x, the easy comp, and we were looking for something smaller than that. So I was -- that's why I was surprised, but obviously good for you.  My follow-up is just on the expiration of the tax holiday. Forgive me for being obtuse here, I didn't quite understand exactly the moving pieces there. Simplistically, I thought the expiration of the holiday-related  fiscal cliff, net  should be an increase in balances, but it sounds like it's a lot more complex than that. So sort of  simplistically, what's sort of the takeaway related to that expiration?","Jan Siegmund","I do think you're exactly right. Obviously, we do collect now more taxes, but federal taxes have short withholding times. And also on the margin, the interest we earn for incremental balances is really very low. So the bottom line impact of the balance increase is really not material for our purposes of discussion.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","And I think that the -- and the complexity was really the fact  that -- the timing because we did have a little bit of a pull-forward because people were anticipating these changes, so that's why we gave you that color. But generally speaking, the payroll tax holiday expiration should -- increases our balances. It's just not a meaningful number in the grand scheme of things in terms of this holiday. Of course, [indiscernible] interest rates are low. If interest rates were at 6%, it might be a different story.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","In terms of the Vantage wins that you were discussing earlier, can you discuss where they were coming from, what types of alternatives were they using prior to coming onto Vantage?  Because it sounds like most of your efforts have been focused on new clients as opposed to converting existing clients.","Jan Siegmund","Yes. As we introduced the Vantage, we made that decision to focus on our competitiveness and new client wins, so that is a choice of ours. And we have seen a wide range of wins in clients that we booked from a couple of 10,000 large client to our standard National Accounts clients of -- I think, we're averaging now approximately 4,000-employee-size  clients. We see them in a variety of industries. So the part of our optimism, although the numbers are still small, is that we see an ability to win in a variety of industry segments as well as sizes, as well as different competitors. So when we look at this now, the numbers become very small, but we have wins against all the competitors you would be thinking of. We have wins in a variety of industries that are important to us strategically, and we are able to win very large clients and smaller type of clients. So the balance is kind of a part of the positive assessment.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then with regards to some of those wins against the variety of competitors, are some of those competitors in the -- what investors would think of as being in the SaaS space?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes.","Jan Siegmund","Yes, they are.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then with regards to the improvement -- and I know it's just a tiny improvement and probably in the least important quarter, but was some of that improvement in terms of retention also exclusive of that grow-over effect? Was that also in nationals?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","The improvement in retention was really frankly across the board. Nationals did have -- you have a very good memory, so nationals had some lumpy losses because it's the National Account business, in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, and we did see a big comeback. And so nationals helped a lot. But frankly, major accounts is a big part of our business, and if it's not doing well, it's hard to have a good retention rate. So Major Accounts was also solid. SBS also improved. I think we were happy across the board.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then an organizational question. Jan, you really helped to build out  the portfolio within HR and Employer Services in terms of the product suite.  Who is taking your spot? And how is that going, and what are the key areas of emphasis now in terms of what are the -- still the blank spots to fill in?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Before he answers that, I obviously have to say he's irreplaceable, but I'll let him...","Jan Siegmund","And I was saying it's  really not for me to answer, my boss should answer, but I'll give you an idea. With our focus on product and innovation that really Carlos with his strategic emphasis, but -- to focus for the company, I think we have a great setup now, really improved to where it was before, under my leadership. And that is our CIO, Mike Capone, now has full product responsibility including the product management and product feature  design as well as the R&D effort around it. So we have really a seasoned executive who is driving that success to the fullest. And then Carlos is in the process of filling my more strategic-oriented position, and that's -- that process is underway.","Operator","We have time for 1 more question from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","2 questions, hopefully just quick to answer. First is on the Dealer business. I didn't catch all the answer from a question several back, but do you feel like in sort of the core DMS business, where there are, I guess, basically 3 primary vendors in the United States, do you feel like you're gaining market share in that specific product against those competitors?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","Yes, we are.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question I had is just thinking about all the conversion discussion around the new products like Vantage, Workforce, et cetera. Conceptually, is there a scenario a couple of years out that once you have completed these conversions and moved everybody under 1 platform that there is a discussion about margins benefiting from the completion of that process, whether that's the '14, the '15, even in  '16,  is there  something there to think about as you complete that process?","Carlos A. Rodriguez","That would be my plan, yes. I think that it's very important, though, for people to have, I think, good information about just how much work there is to be done. There is a positive in the sense that as we make these changes, in many cases, our strategic platforms -- in fact, I think in all cases, our strategic platforms are version-less. So -- because one could argue that you will always have legacy platforms that you have to convert. But the world is fundamentally different in terms of the cost and the frictional cost, if you will, both to the client and to us, of moving clients to new platforms. And so I do think that the reason I'm so anxious about this transition and this movement, and  I think Jan said it well,  to me, it's a strategic issue. Because I think in 2, 3, 4 years, however long it takes us, we will be in a very different position competitively, margin-wise, new business-wise. We're just going to be a much stronger, much better company. We're well on our way already because we have the new products, and our migrations already are well underway because we've got a lot of momentum. But when we're done, it's going to be a much stronger company and I think in a better situation for us. And we're going to try to deliver examples of that over the next year or 2 in pockets, so that we can show to ourselves, to our own associates and also to the external world the power of simplicity and the power of having most of our clients on strategic platforms.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez","I just want to thank you again for joining us today. As you could tell from our tone, we're very pleased with our second quarter results. It's nice to see some of the underlying margin improvements at the segment level, and I think continued robust growth on the revenue line as well. Our business continues to perform well. As we mentioned in a couple of places, we're continuing to grow market share. We continue to be committed to our shareholders as you saw from our dividend increase. We continue to buy share repurchases when it makes sense. We continue to do everything we can to enhance shareholder value, which we believe is primarily driven by just growing our business. So growth is our focus. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter, and we thank you again for joining us today. Thanks.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

And all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I'll now turn the conference over to Ms Sara Grilliot, Vice President, and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sara Grilliot","Thank you. Good morning. This is Sara Grilliot, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations, and I am here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call and webcast.","Before we get started with Carlos's commentary on the quarter, I want to give you an update on our Investor Day. The event will be held on March 3rd in New York City and we have an exciting agenda plan that will showcase our new products and include an update on our business and strategic initiative. We look forward to seeing you there. ","I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such, involve some risks. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos Rodriguez","Thank you, Sara. And good morning, everyone. This morning we reported solid results for our second quarter of fiscal 2015 including revenue growth of 7% and worldwide new business growth of 15%. During the quarter, we increased the number of businesses in the cloud to 480,000 and migrated 22 million users to our new user experience, providing them with a new way to access the pay information. And since last year we have more than doubled a number of mobile users to 3.6 million. And we are on track with our client migrations. And are pleased that we have migrated almost all of our small business clients to ADP RUN. We now have fewer than 2,000 clients left on the legacy EasyPay platform. We are excited as we prepared to sunset this platform in the coming week.","A continued progress was made possible by our investments and innovations and our laser focus on leading in the Human Capital Management or HCM market. We remain optimistic as our strengthening portfolio of strategic platforms continued to experience success in recent months. The success is evidence by our year-to-date record client revenue retention in both the US and internationally. And our strong new bookings growth as clients of all sizes are seeing the value in ADP's integrated offerings and the value we provide and helping them manage their workforce. ","In the US, we continued to be focused on growing our suite of integrated cloud based HCM solutions and we are pleased with the number of new clients choosing our flagship platforms ADP RUN, Workforce Now and Vantage as well as the adoption rates of additional modules by our existing client base. Our HR business processing outsourcing solutions especially our PEO continue to perform quite well as businesses look to fully outsource increasingly complex HR processes to ADP. To further enhance our capabilities, during the quarter we launched ADP Health Compliance targeted primarily at larger enterprises. This new solution which ADP is uniquely positioned to deliver helps businesses navigate the challenging and complex landscape associated with ACA healthcare compliance. We are optimistic about the interest we've seen from clients and the opportunity this represent.","We are also keenly aware of our opportunity in the HCM space outside of the US. And although the European economic situation remains a challenge, ADP's strength global compliance and our presence in 100 countries has contributed to our success internationally. Not only have we seen solid execution in sales for multinational corporation, but we continue to enjoy a leading position abroad for our in country solution. Overall, we are pleased by the balanced success we are seeing across our portfolio. And we are constantly looking for ways to provide better, value added services for all of our clients whether they are small businesses or multinational corporation. We continue to sharpen our focus and evolve the end-to-end client journey leveraging our unique insights and expertise to create a more integrated and seamless client experience. ","We also understand that no two companies have the same need but the same way of doing business. So providing flexibility and adaptability of our market leading solutions is essential. For this reason we introduced the ADP market place earlier this fiscal year which is designed to help employers make the most of their workforce data by empowering partner companies and developers to deliver new and innovative applications that leverage and integrate with ADP's data. ","The openness of the ADP market place which is enabling to access to our Application Programming Interfaces or APIs, enables workforce data integration across multiple workforce management platform, provides client with a more seamless and efficient HR process and lets clients extend the value of their relationship with ADP. In the three months since launch, our development team has begun working with potential partners. We are excited about the opportunity it provides for ADP to collaborate with third party developers and providing solutions that help our client better manage their workforce. And as we leverage ADP's unique big data capability, we are delighted with the launch of our ADP Workforce Vitality Report this October. The new report from the ADP research institute is unique in its ability to provide insight into the health of the US labor market. Not just job numbers but the quality of job and the trends driving its momentum. When considered together with our well regarded national employment report, we are sending a clear message to the market that ADP is at the forefront of identifying, analyzing and driving actionable insight in the HCM's space.","In that regard we are also encouraged by the demand we are seeing for ADP's analytic solutions which are particularly strong among our up market client. We introduced these solutions just one year ago. And while the product is still in its early stages, we are enthusiastic about future opportunities for ADP to leverage our big data capability. In summary, we have entered the back half of our fiscal year on solid footing. While we certainly understand and are aware of the changing dynamics in the HCM's space, we are confident that our robust offerings and insightful expertise will enable to maintain and extend our leadership position. Again, thank you very much for your continued interest in ADP and I look forward to speaking with many of you at our Investor Day on March 3rd.","With that I'll turn the call over to Jan to walk you through our second quarter results. ","Jan Siegmund","Thank you very much, Carlos. And good morning, everyone. I am pleased with ADP's results for the quarter. Revenue grew 7%, nearly all organic. Pretax earnings grew 8%. The effects of foreign currency translation negatively impacted the quarter's revenue and pretax earnings growth by approximately one percentage point. As Carlos described, ADP's sales force executed well in the quarter, delivering combined worldwide new business bookings growth of 15% over last year's second quarter. And as expected investments in our products and sales force moderated earnings growth in the second quarter. Earnings per share grew 8% which included a negative impact of about 1% due to foreign currency translations. ","Our tax rate in the quarter was higher than last year's second quarter. However, better than we anticipated due to an expected one time tax benefit. ADP continued its shareholder friendly actions, repurchasing over 5 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $436 million. And as a reminder, ADP received $825 million in dividend proceeds from CDK as a result of the spin-off which occurred on September 30th, which were intended to fund share repurchases and accordance with the tax free nature of the spin.","We intend to complete this share repurchases by June 30, 2015 subject to market conditions. Employees Services revenue grew 4% from addition of new recurring revenues tool from our HCM solution. This growth rate was impacted by almost two percentage point from foreign currency translation. As well as higher revenues received in last year's second quarter from administering employment tax credit for our clients here in the US. And certain one time benefit we experience in last year's quarter which all resulted in a more difficult compare. Despite the more difficult compare and the growth headwinds we experience from foreign currency translation, we continue to be pleased with the fundamentals of our business model. Our client revenue retention which is at a year-to-date all time high and improved slightly over last year's second quarter. Same store pays per control in the US remain strong with an increase of 3% and client fund balances grew 7% driven by net new business growth as well as growth in pays per control. As a reminder, approximately 15% of our client fund balances are held outside the US, most notably in Canada, the UK and in the Netherlands, so although our year-to-date balance growth is at the high end of our forecasted range of 5% to 7% for the full year, we anticipate coming in closer to the mid point of the range due to expected pressure from foreign currency translation in the next two quarters. We continued to be pleased with the overall revenue growth in our international business. As the positive results in Asia Pacific and Latin America as well as the success of our multinational offerings have continued. And although the economic situation in Europe continues to be sluggish, same store pays per controls was flat over the last year's second quarter following several period of decline. Our pretax margin expansion Employees Services was 30 basis points in the quarter. Our business continues to perform well, however, anticipated higher selling expenses and planned investments into products cause margin pressure over last year's second quarter. The PEO continues to outperform posting another quarter of strong revenue growth of 18% compared to last year's second quarter. Average worksite employees grew 15% to $354,000. The solid execution of our sales force and the strength of our distribution model continued to be a key driver of our growth. ","We are also pleased that efficiencies in sales and operations continue to drive margin expansion in the PEO which delivered about 140 basis points of improvement in the quarter. ADP's consolidated pretax margin improved by 30 basis points in the second quarter, which included a drag of about 20 points from slower growth of our high margin client fund revenues as these highly profitable revenues grew at slower rate than overall revenue. ","So now I'll take you through our fiscal year 2015 outlook which has been updated to reflect the results we have seen in the first half of the year as well as the expected impact of foreign currency translation on our full year results. We've experienced a solid first half in the worldwide to bookings growth and although we have a tough compare in the third quarter compared with last year's third quarter growth of 14%, we now expect to achieve about 10% full year growth in new business bookings over the $1.4 billion sold in fiscal year 2014.","The fundamentals of our business are solid and for total ADP we still expect revenue growth of 7% to 8% despite the current environment surrounding foreign exchange rate. Although the overall forecast remains the same, we do expect changes on a segment level and Employees Services and the PEO. We are adjusting our forecast for Employees Services to reflect expected headwinds of about two percentage points from the impact of foreign currencies and translation and now expect about 5% growth compared to our prior forecast of 6% to 7%. And while once the employment tax program was extended through the end of calendar year 2014, it has not yet been renewed for calendar year 2015 and we therefore expect lower revenue than previously anticipated from these tax credits filed on behalf of our clients. For the PEO, we are increasing our revenue forecast to reflect solid performance during the first half of our fiscal year and we now expect the PEO to deliver 15% to 17% growth compared with our prior forecast of 13% to 15% growth. So the mix is changed but overall we expect to be on track for our full year revenue guidance even with the expected headwinds from foreign currency translation. Our pretax margin forecast for total ADP remains the same; we still expect 75 to 100 basis points of margin improvement from the 18.4% in fiscal year 2014. On a segment levels, we are modifying our margin expansion forecast for the PEO and now expect margin expansion of up to 100 basis points compared with our prior forecast of up to 50 basis points. Our forecast of margin expansion in the Employees Services remains unchanged. We still anticipate about a 100 basis points of margin expansion. We're updating our forecast with effective tax rate to reflect the one time benefit we've received in the second quarter and we now anticipate a tax rate of 34.2% compared with our prior forecast of 34.6%. Although we have changed our forecast of tax rate, we expect to have earnings pressure from the impact of the foreign currency translation in the second half of the fiscal year, so there is no change to our diluted earnings per share forecast. We still expect growth of 12% to 14% compared with a $2.58 in fiscal year 2014. And as a reminder, this forecast of 12% to 14% includes an anticipated $0.02 benefit resulting from share repurchases funded by the $825 million in dividend proceeds ADP received as a result of the spin-off of the CDK. However, the forecast does not contemplate further share buyback beyond the anticipated dilution related to equity comp plans and the dividend proceeds from CDK. There is no change to our previous forecast related to the client funds investment strategy. We could experience some pressure in client funds interest revenue in the second half of the year due to the changing interest rate environment and the impact of foreign currency translation on interest earned outside the US, however, we are maintaining our forecast and still anticipate an increase of $5 million to $15 million over last year from the client funds extended investments strategy. The detail of this forecast is available both in the press release and in the supplemental slides on our website. ","In closing, last week I had the opportunity to participate in ADP's annual ReThink Conference in London, this was our largest ever gathering of clients and prospect representing multinational corporations. HR finance and IT executive from some of the largest companies in the world joined us for two days of discussions about the future of HR and ADP's HCM's capability. In the many personal conversations I had with these leaders at ReThink, it is clear that our vision for HCM is resonating giving me confidence that we continue to be on the right path. ","With that I'll turn it over to the operator to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Sara Gubins of BofA Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Sara Gubins","Thank you, good morning. Great performance in the new business sales this quarter. Could you give us some details on where you saw most of the strength? ","Carlos Rodriguez","It was actually across the board. ","Sara Gubins","Okay, great. With the RUN migration now over can you talk about where you are shifting those resources? And also could you give us some client count for Workforce Now versus those still on the legacy platform and when you would expect to be able to shut legacy platforms down? ","Carlos Rodriguez","Well, Jan has the numbers in terms of -- on Workforce Now. In terms of our priorities, just again I want to reemphasize how proud we are of the organization and small business. It took on us very large task of moving several hundred thousands clients which is benefit of hindsight now seems like the right decision and we actually had our retention improve and our margin and cost structure improve in that business over the last two three years. But that wasn't -- it wasn't obvious that was going to be the outcome at the time. There was a lot of ","trepidation about losing clients and competitive issues and so forth and it just -- it turned out be very well executed migration that really enhance our competitiveness, our market position, our market share just really across the board. A great job by that organization and we are right at the end of the show here with only couple of thousands clients. So I just want give, praise to that organization in terms of the job they did because that was serve I think as an example for the rest of the organization as to what can be done and what the outcomes are when it is done in terms of migration because you can just feel simplification and the simplicity entering into that business as a result of having only platform, having to train only one set of implementation, associate, maintaining only one platform, it just got -- it is a real home run so obviously now we turn our sight to the mid market and to the up market. We have a lot of momentum and lot of progress already with Workforce Now in the mid market and really national accounts where the up market is where we are now training our sight to as quickly as possible began moving larger client. So right now the focus for us is doing what we can to use both internal resources and we are actually -- I think we mentioned in the last call actually also using some external resources to help with those migration in the up market to try to accelerate. So I guess the answer to the question is we are trying to move resources that were being focused on the migration to RUN and the small business market over national account. And I think in the mid market it is steady as you go, we are just continuing to plow away and moving as many clients as possible over to our strategic platforms. I think Jan has the numbers. ","Jan Siegmund ","Yes, Sara, So as Carlos mentioned of course RUN is huge success story so now with almost 425,000 clients on that platform is really a wonderful outcome. And we are making similar steady progress on the PCPW migration in major accounts and I think we have formally alluded that we would finish this by the end of fiscal year; we are still on track for that. We migrate in the first half of approximately 3,000 and we have about the same left, so we are really here in the final stages of also finishing that major migration project. ","Carlos Rodriguez","I think the other thing just to reiterate why we are doing this. I think there are a variety of reasons but clearly two of the most important reasons are as we use the number of legacy platforms we can reinvest those funds in our strategic go forward platforms. So that's exciting to be able to put even more resources into the new stuff. And second of all it is to improve our competitiveness in the market place because this older legacy platform sometimes creates an exposure from client retention standpoint. So I think we've so far, knock on wood, I think proven that we are getting a both of those things and done some from these migration strategy. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. ","David Togut","Thank you. And good morning. Carlos you highlighted increased competitiveness as you move up legacy platform and just some of the new platforms, could you perhaps share some insights in terms of direct competitive experience let say down market versus paychecks and perhaps in the mid market versus ultimate where you have almost completed the transition to Workforce Now.","Carlos Rodriguez","We try not to get into specific one by one competitors, I think overall in the categories that you described we have obviously a lot of data around win loss ratio and we have some data around market share and I think that's why we make the comments that we believe our competitiveness is improving because I think our metrics show that. And again these are incremental improvements but we are still happy with them and they are going in the right direction. I don't know if Jan has any additional color but we measured competitiveness really in terms of winning or losing in the market place. And we believe that our win rate curve improved as a result of not just our investments in new products but also these moves are putting our clients on a newest platform.","David Togut","This is the follow up to that you mentioned 15% global booking growth in Employees Services and strength across the board. Can you flush that out a little bit? Is some of the strengths driven by particularly new products? Is this tend to be more kind of down market with RUN? Is it up market with Vantage HCM?","Carlos Rodriguez","So I think as we mentioned in prior calls in terms of being consistent about giving the same answer when things are good versus when they are not so good. Sales for us are more variable than obviously our revenue is in other metrics in our business because the nature of the way our new business booking work. So there are lots of things that have an impact. Incentive has an impact and we talked about that in the past. Sometimes our incentives can hurt us and sometimes they can create more difficult compares. The economy clearly has something to do with it. Competitors obviously are a factor as well as the strength of our product and the timing of product releases. So there are just a lot of things that go into the mix. So it's very, very hard with a degree of I think objectivity to give you specific answers to what's driven the strength. But this is our second quarter of double digit sales growth and when I look at the trends over the last -- won't call the trend but we have now couple of decades of data around our quarterly sales results. And this feels like a very good situation for us because as you know last year we ended the year with 7% sales growth after several years of double digit sales growth. And I think we are on track this year obviously based on our revised guidance the double digit gains so it is incredibly pleasing because I think it appears that we've at a minimum broke-in kind of what I'd call the economic cycle issue which is -- we have tended in the past and strong economic cycles to go double digit and then we kind of trail off in terms of sales growth over time and then during recession we end up going negative. And so this time when I look at that chart and I look at that trend, this is -- this was an important year for us, important quarter and important six months in showing that we can continue to grow our sales at double digit, ex any factors in the economy or in this case we have some issues abroad and Europe and few other places. So I wish I can give you an objective answer other than it is a combination of a lot of things. I think our products are getting incrementally better. Our sales force is executing incredibly well. We've refined some of our incentives over the years to I think drive better sales results and we have also changed the mix of our sales headcount to have more components in our inside sales force to drive our sales expense to a better level. So it is just -- again I gave lot of praise to our small business division for the migrations over the RUN and also got given an enormous amount of praise to our sales force in terms of the way they executed this quarter and these six months because last year was not -- it was a tough year. And again just to reiterate it is across the board. I wasn't trying to be short in that end but it is just that that is the fact. Double digit sales growth across really all of ours sales segment, up market, mid market, low end, just really across the board. So I can't unfortunately provide you any more detail on that. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Georgios Mihalos of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open.","Georgios Mihalos","Great, thanks, good morning, guys. And congrats on another strong quarter and good momentum. Wanted to start off can you remind us how new sales breakdown throughout the fourth quarter? I don't think there is that much variability, but if you could address that and maybe related to that, January is a big month on a small business side. Maybe just your thoughts as we exit that month how the sales activity was there?","Carlos Rodriguez","Funny you should mention that because I asked Sara for that data couple of days ago just to -- we are obviously not going to talk about January because that's the -- it is next quarter's discussion but we do have the January results and I was curious to see how much of the year's quota has been expanded because we do have very strong sales in November. And very strong sales in January due to seasonality. But we also have as you have probably seen in the past, very, very strong June mainly driven because of yearend incentives which we've talked about I think quite a bit. Both the positives and the negative. So the long and short of it is that it actually works out the right about balance so in seven out of 12 months we have expanded about 7\/12th of our quote and I think in six months so there is probably a little bit less but it is really not -- it is not meaningful in terms of difference in terms of you being able to think through or me being able to think through, the odds of asking able to hit our forecast given what where we are in the year. We feel pretty good about hitting our forecast. ","Georgios Mihalos","It definitely sounds that way. And then just follow up to that the pays per control outlook 2% to 3%; you have been 3% now over the first half of the year. Is that just conservatism keeping the low end of the range here? What seem here that you are going to be able to do better than that? ","Jan Siegmund ","Yes. Maybe I'll answer that. Really we're for the first half of the year, and the number itself is not that impactful for our total results. So it is really depended of --if the economy going to change significant course we had, great employment growth of the country for now a number of years so we didn't feel we needed to updated it but it should be right around somewhere. ","Carlos Rodriguez","And as a reminder 1% change in pays per control is $8 million in annual revenue. So if that were to change by half of a percent for the rest of the year, it would be $2 million impact for revenue so I think as Jan said really not that impactful but more importantly we've seen this movie before where we are incredibly please that it is holding up at that level and it has been that way for a few years. But it will at some point come down to 2.5 or 2 or somewhere in that range but we hope it continues indefinitely but we are not planning on that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Smittipon Srethapramote from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Smittipon Srethapramote","Now that the January 1st deadline is passed can you just talk a little bit more about the new ACA product how did in the quarter and how it is done since beginning of the year? ","Carlos Rodriguez","We don't have any specific numbers that we can share but we are very, very pleased. Jan may want to add his own color. We had a business review with the folks running that business actually quite recently and the number of units that we've sold and the new business bookings, we have generated new business bookings from this product, and we have actually started a handful of clients, and we have a very large backlog, and we're very excited about it.","Jan Siegmund","I think may be a few the ACA product has a new direction serves, of course, as an example of ADP's strength of combining technology with compliance. And so we fun lighted [ph] of course it is one of the largest problem solve clients' space. This ACA product targeted for large clients of market product so the number of units that we will be selling and trying to achieve in the realm of a national account type product. And I think what yielded our positive outlook on the product is really started in earnest in the last quarter and second quarter to sell this product, and the pace of how the pipeline has built and our ability to close a number of much the same in that space caused basically optimism. I don't think it will augment clearly and will support the growth rate of new business bookings, but it would be also wrong to anticipate that this would have tonnage point difference in our sales growth rate going forward. But it is going to be an important product that rounds out our value proposition and combination with our core offerings is very powerful, but that's more the purpose of why we talk along bit more in detail about the ACA products.","Carlos Rodriguez","Thanks, Jan. Maybe my enthusiasm got ahead of me because our blessing and our curses that we have nearly $1.6 billion in new bookings, and $11 billion in revenue. So I think Jan is very correct that my enthusiasm wasn't intended to imply that this is going to add two to three points of either sales growth or a point of revenue growth. You can just do the math in terms of what that would imply. We hope that over the next two to three years it could be meaningful and significant, but clearly for this year it is not going to -- it's helping and rounding things out, but I should have probably been more careful in the choice of my words.","Smittipon Srethapramote","Thanks for the clarification. And maybe just a follow-up on the same topic. As the PEO business continues to do very well, can you talk about what you are seeing in terms of customer demand for your ASO type products?","Carlos Rodriguez","Sure. First of all, let me just say that I was actually in Atlanta, had a great visit to Atlanta in December and visited with a couple of the business units that operate mainly out of our Atlanta office, including the PEO, and folks who run the ASO. And that business just in general is executing incredibly well, both PEO and the ASO. So really all of our -- all of our BPO offerings, mid market, up market, and the ones that you're referring to, PEO and ASO, are all I think really resonating in the marketplace, probably driven in part by this increasing complexity around compliance. So some of it is ACA driven in terms of people just looking for alternative, that's creating more meetings and more discussions which leads to more opportunities, and then closing more business. Some of it may be what appears to be a growing need for focusing on talent as the unemployment rate begins to dip here and people start to focus more on attracting and retaining and managing their workforce well. So I think there are probably a number of reasons in terms of creating some tailwind. But the very -- a great discussion, and just business is really executing very, very well, both the ASO and the PEO, just across the board, great execution on the sales results but also in terms of the implementation of our business and the underlying metrics of the business in terms of pays per control there. They're all just -- they're all in very good shape. So great discussion that went","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","Hi, guys, good morning. Let me just first follow up on that last point. Is there -- PEO continues to be incredibly strong. Is there any way to know how long the momentum continues at this level? And I guess what I'm particularly interested in, are you seeing any -- now that a lot of businesses are in compliance with ACA, are you seeing any decline or is there any sense that maybe there was some pulled forward demand to get into compliance, or are those drivers of more people being interested and considering their options remaining strong in calendar 2015?","Carlos Rodriguez","And I think our plan is to have the momentum continue forever. That would be the way we are planning things because in part the market share of the PEO industry in general in relation to the total employment for small and midsized businesses is relatively low. This is a theme that I think has been true for a couple of decades. I think the backdrop in terms of the economy and the regulatory environment has some impact on whether clients are open to discussion or not. But the fact of the matter is you want to be in businesses preferably with lower penetration versus the higher penetration. I think the PEO is that kind of business where only a couple percentage points at most of employees -- the available market are actually using a PEO. So we believe that theoretically the opportunity is very large and then it becomes a question of execution. And as I mentioned, other factors that may or may not be tailwinds, like the regulatory environment which we think happens to be very favorable right now. We haven't seen any signs yet that everyone is all of a sudden in compliance, and that there's no more interest in the PEO because you saw the quarter results, and I think our forecast for sales results for the rest of the year for that business would not indicate any feeling or belief that interest is drying up. So I think that there is a need to be in compliance, but if you remember, ACA is mostly affecting over -- and clients with over 50 employees. What are causing some of the interest in PEO is the entire backdrop around ACA and the regulatory environment which is people scrambling to have competitive benefit plans that you can compete also with some of these exchanges. So it's not specifically clients that need it on a particular date to be in compliance. I think this is something that will continue for many years to come where small companies and midsize companies are going to be looking for alternatives to healthcare plans that they may have in the past, add on an individual plan basis, whether that be they look at our solutions through the PEO, or they look at exchanges. I think people are just looking for alternatives to be able to control healthcare cost to be competitive in their own business.","Gary Bisbee","Great. And then the follow-up, it seems like you're starting to get more, whether it's products or other from the innovation lab you set up a year or two ago, and I guess, can you give us a high-level sense, do you think those investments are going to lead to noticeable incremental revenue in the next few years, or is it more on the margin? And as part of that maybe could you just give us an example of what kind of thing the ADP marketplace offering might be able to lead to? What would be like a tangible example of a potential product there? Thank you.","Carlos Rodriguez","Just in terms of -- I'll let -- actually Jan can be talk about the examples in the ADP marketplace because he is equally excited about that. But in terms of your question about innovation driven products and growth coming from that, again, back to unfortunately you have to go back to the comment in terms of just keeping us all on the same page because of our size and our new business bookings, so our new business bookings per year are larger than most of our competitors combined. So we have a large path. I think the innovation lab and some of our focus on product is intended to as to use Jan's words to round out and ensure and hopefully improve a little bit on our growth rate in sales and revenue. So clearly we would be less than ambitious if we told you that we're just trying to stay in place. But we're clearly trying to accelerate our growth. Again the expectations that we create it is very important for us to be transparent, and I think for us to move our revenue growth up a couple percentage points is very difficult and requires a big increase in new business bookings and very, very good client retention. So having said all that, that's our plan, is to try to continue to drive and improve revenue growth through better net new business which is the difference between start or new business bookings and or loss. And our innovation investments are a large part of that. As we said multiple times. All of the products that we've discussed that have come out thus far, that are new out of either innovation lab or some of our other processes that we have internally in terms of new product launches are relatively small in comparison to the size of our new business bookings in total and to ADP overall. So it is very, very hard to say today that it is going to add x amount of incremental sales for revenue growth but that's our plan over multiple years is to really have a pipeline of organically built and organically developed products that are easier to use and provide better value to our clients and are better integrated to really drive more unit sales but also more sales of our additional modules around benefits, talent management, and other areas around HCM in addition to our traditional payroll. So I don't know, Jan, if you want to talk about the marketplace. ","Jan Siegmund","Absolutely. So of course the marketplace there is basically an offering that allows a third party software developer as well as clients to easily integrate with our core product offering. With ADP focusing on human capital management we realize that we're living in an integrated world, and I think we have the utmost flexibility for our clients to integrate our solutions into their overall businesses which is very important. So we expect for example, vertical-specific applications to be available maybe the restaurant industry or maybe the retail industry that would leverage employment data for additional value adds or components to it. But it could be also product like advanced management that we don't offer and have a close relationship to our core payroll offering that will benefit from tight integration into our core product set. I think the message we want to send primarily with this call is, our push for innovation and to be at the leading front of having flexible and easy to integrate technology that makes the value to our clients the highest is our intent. And that may be a different notion compared to the ADP that you would have known three, four, five years ago where we were a little bit more proprietary and harder to integrate maybe and today we really believe and through that integrated network of applications. So that's what the marketplace is really about. And it is kind of an outcome of our investments into innovation, yielding our ability to have these APIs, really accessing a whole bunch of our applications just through one API so I think a very good step forward for us illustrating I think the progress we're making on the back of our technology. ","Carlos Rodriguez","I think, in a nutshell, it's really asked for, and we already have an app there, and we intend to drive more partnerships. And we hope that it will not only make things better for our clients because of their ability to integrate, but we do have revenue share agreements like anyone else would have in their types of app scores, so the key question is what's going to be the degree of success? Because this literally brand new. So we'll obviously keep you informed because this could end up being a large opportunity, or it may not, from a revenue and sales standpoint.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from SK Prasad Borra of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","SK Prasad Borra","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First, on the PEO segment, can you provide any color on the mix of your customer base and what traction are you seeing more at the mid to low end? And what positive impact does it have on operating margin in the midterm? ","Carlos Rodriguez","In the PEO, the mix of business, our PEO tends to be more white and gray collar than I think the average of the US economy and some other PEOs. So that's number one. If our average client size I believe are around 40, if I'm not mistaken. Yes, I'm getting the confirmation it is around 40. So that tends to be probably slightly larger than maybe some other PEOs. But we still have a lot of small business clients. So it is obviously they're averages. We have large clients that improve the average but it's still largely an under 50 sweet spot business if you will. In terms of industries, tend to stay away from -- it doesn't mean we don't have any, we tend to stay away from very high-risk things like roofers and construction and so forth. In terms of the impact on the margins on the overall business, we segment report so it's mathematically it's a drag on our earnings when PEO is growing as robustly as it is. Having said that, the fact of the matter is, that on an earnings -- pure earnings growth standpoint, it is an incredibly accretive and profitable and attractive business on any measure, whether it's on an MPV basis, the business requires no investment per se. Whatever investment we make, most of them run through the P&L so there's no kind of outside capital investments that would drive kind of return other than what you are seeing which is a very, very high return business despite the fact that because of its profile it just happens to have a lower margin because of all the past. So we will grow the PEO as fast as we can, because it will add to EPS growth and shareholder value, and we will explain and manage through the margin compression if necessary.","SK Prasad Borra","I'm sorry, I also meant that just from a customer profile point of view as it changes over the next few years based on your investments and based on your sales and marketing push, what kind of a positive or negative impact does it have as your customer profile in the PEO segment changes? And probably just one other question is, more from a product portfolio perspective. Are there any obvious areas in your product portfolio where you want extra investment both organically and through M&A?","Carlos Rodriguez","Let me just clarify, you're expecting what kind of change in our client profile on the PEO?","SK Prasad Borra","I was saying that if your customer profile size probably decreases from base say 40 numbers to probably 20 or whatever that is, do you have more profitability as the size of your customer profile decreases?","Carlos Rodriguez","It's been very consistent for a long, long time, and I don't anticipate that it is going to change dramatically. When we had our business review in Atlanta, the profitability of our large clients versus our small clients, there's some differences, but it wasn't meaningful. So and again, we have 350,000 worksite employees now. To move that number from 40 to 20 is almost impossible in any kind of reasonable period of time. On your question about what things do we want to -- I think your question was what we want to make more investments in. ","SK Prasad Borra","From a product portfolio standpoint","Carlos Rodriguez","From a product portfolio standpoint, I think you are going to see us continuing to make the same kinds of investments that you have seen us do over the last two or three years which are really focused on creating a better integrated, easier to use experience for our clients. And so the work that we're doing in the up market and the work that you have seen us do in Workforce Now are all around all of that. So we have -- we believe we have already a very broad set of solutions in HCM all the way from recruitment to retirement. So what we're really trying to do is enhance the usability of our products and the integration of our products, and then obviously we mentioned in our talking points that we believe that data analytics is a huge source of potential competitive advantage and insight that we could provide for our clients, because now that we're all in on HCM what we really want to do is be known for helping our clients better manage their workforce. And that means going beyond just data processing and being efficient to really providing expertise and insight and data we have I think allows us to do that but that requires some investment as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.","Joseph Foresi ","Hi. I wonder on the new bookings growth can you give us some idea what of that is attributable to either change incentives versus the macro versus the new product you have in place. I'm just trying to get a sense of sort of how you can break that down. And I have one follow-up. ","Carlos Rodriguez","I may have confused the issue by bringing even the topic of incentive. There have been no changes in incentives. I just always mention that because it seems to rear its head sometimes in our fourth quarter, either positive or negative. And then it rears its head again in the first quarter because we have a lot of incentives that drive year end results. This is true in almost every company that has a sales force where you have accelerators or incentives towards the end of the year. So I think it happens a lot in software companies. And so we're no different. So this specific quarter, no changes in incentives, so there's really nothing to report there. I should have probably not brought it up. In terms of how much of it was new product versus sales force execution, I think the people from R&D would say that it was 100% product, and sales would say that it's 100% execution. So the truth is probably somewhere in between. ","Joseph Foresi ","Okay and then just -- ","Jan Siegmund ","Let me add, it would be, as you know, the sales model drives from adding heads to our sales force and overall drives productivity of our sales force with enhanced productivity of our product and better execution and it would be balanced growth profile add as well. [Technical Difficulty]","Carlos Rodriguez","And that productivity has really been phenomenal for multiple years now. And I'm sure that products are helping but clearly it's also really great execution and great leadership in that organization. They have proven once again this quarter that we have the best direct sales force in the world.","Joseph Foresi ","Got it. And then just on any color on win rate changes, if you want to be, either the company level and\/ or within the individual mid cap, large cap spaces that you are going after?","Carlos Rodriguez","We watch those numbers very carefully, and we're also very, very careful about how we talk about. I would just tell you the best way to describe it are a generalization. I think Jan can add, but I would say that we are very, very pleased with the focus that our business leaders have in improving our win rate, our win\/loss rate, not just at the retention level in terms of losing clients with but upfront in the sales process. And so I think we have leaders who understand the importance of winning in the marketplace and of increasing market share and metrics we have are very encouraging.","Joseph Foresi ","Thank you. ","Jan Siegmund ","As we have discussed over time, at the highest level improving sales, improving retention generally just has to be indicator about this business relative to prior periods, and that's really virtually the only number that you can draw from at the high level. At the detailed level, I think we shared with you that our losses are comprised not of a single poor lost competitor -- lost that was to a single competitor but to a whole range of 20, 30, 40 competitors that we all need to monitor. So I think it would be probably misleading to point out single ones, because -- and it's not a single competitor is immaterial, but the aggregate of the 30, 40 competitors that we monitor are very important to us. So that's why I think it's probably most fair to go with the directional comments that Carlos gave and round it out with the overall competitive of accelerating sales and together to form an overall picture.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank AG. Your line is open.","Ashish Chhabra","Hi, this is Ashish Chhabra calling in on behalf of Bryan Keane. Thanks for taking our question. Quickly on the PEO, a pretty solid growth there. And if you look at the average worksite employee paid growth over the last four quarters those have been trending in the mid-teens or even higher. And those have been significantly higher than what the normal growth has been over the last few years. So just looking forward, does this accelerated growth create tougher comps going forward? And also what would be the normalized growth in the worksite employees as we look forward on a more normalized basis? Thanks.","Carlos Rodriguez","I think it's a very good question, and again we would hope that the momentum continues indefinitely, but I would tell you that when you look at our operating plans and our forecasts, the compares do get more difficult. That business happens to have a great deal of lumpiness on January 1st because of the way taxes operate in the PEO environment. Ironically, it was a change in the law as part of the yearend Congressional law that were passed that are going to make that a little bit easier going forward and PEOs are not going to have to restart taxes. So that should smooth out the lumpiness of that business somewhat, and not have such a huge peak in January. But the reason I bring that up is because of that peak in January, the growth rate of that business, even though they tend to have another peak in June because of our fiscal yearend and the incentives that we always talk about in sales there, January has been a particularly important number for us in the PEO business because the difference between the new business bookings and the losses that take place in that December to January timeframe tend to drive the year-over-year growth rate on worksite employees for the next 12 months on a calendar year basis. And because of just the size of the business, which is 350,000 worksite employees, I think anyone can do the math and figure out how many new worksite employees we need to sell. We know what our retention rate or you can probably guess close to what our retention rate is, and you can figure out that, that the need to sell that many clients larger than probably all but two or three other competitors in the space. So it is - the compares are getting difficult to say the least. And we are entering the law of large numbers. So if it were me, I would probably be expecting moderation in the growth rate. It doesn't mean that it is going to happen next quarter or this fiscal year, but I think it is a good idea to moderate expected growth rate of that business. We've been incredibly pleased with it for the last two or three years, but I think we're just trying to be realistic here in terms of expectations.","Ashish Chhabra","Carlos thanks for that color. And a quick follow-up again on the PEO side. When I look at revenue for average worksite employee that has been trending more in the 3$ range in the first half of the year. Can you just talk about what are the drivers there? Is it more higher fees, more pass through? And as you look forward, how should we think about that particular metric? Thanks.","Carlos Rodriguez","Actually all of the above. So its additional fees as in fees that drive our kind of bottom line we call processing revenue and hence our profitability plus also the pass. So whenever you have inflation in either workers' compensation or in benefits cost, that will also drive growth obviously in revenue and also growth in revenue per worksite employee in that business. So we give you the worksite employee number, and we provide in the Q and in the 10-K pass through, and you can actually do the math and figure out how much of the growth is coming, as we're trying to be transparent, how much of the growth is coming from pass through, and that allows you to back into how much of the growth is coming from our fees, if you will, and again, back to my visit to Atlanta, I think they're both growing at reasonable rates. So there isn't -- and again, we would tell if you our fees were dropping and it were all because of pass through. The reason we haven't told you that is because it's not true and there's nothing to report. It's been consistent for many years now that the PEO has been growing its own internal fee income per worksite employee at a -- call it 2% to 3% rate and than the pass has been growing at varying rates, depending on what's happening with healthcare inflation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies LLC. Your line is open.","Ryan Cary","Hi, guys, this is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. I just wanted to dig deeper into FX. I was hoping you could give us a little more color on your assumption for the remainder of the year. So when we are looking at the 1% full year headwinds, does that assume the dollar trading at the current levels?","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes. That is the assumptions. ","Ryan Cary","Okay, great, thanks so much. And then now that the dealer service of business spun out, and really a pure play HCM company, is it plausible you might look to M&A a bit to extend your reach further into the market and kind of looking beyond that when looking at the market where do you see the most M&A opportunities? Is it more in the legacy core payroll processing side of the business or is it more along the PEO\/BPO side?","Carlos Rodriguez","We actually -- we do still do acquisitions in kind of our core payroll business as you have just described. They tend to be kind of tuck-in and they're just migrations. As you can tell from our theme, we're trying not to maintain and add additional platforms in our business for the time being. But we do those. Again because of our size, we don't talk about those a lot, but we are kind of actively using our capital to when we can grow market share as long as there's a good MVP associated with the acquisition. We tend to call those client based acquisitions where we are buying the clients and moving them on to our platform rather than buying the entire entity or the company. Outside of that space in terms of just the broad HCM market, again we think we have a broad solution from recruitment to retirement, but we absolutely understand and acknowledge that there are people that are stronger than we are in some parts of HCM, and it may be appropriate at some point and in some cases to enhance our capabilities through M&A activity or through acquisitions. So we are -- it may not feel like it or look like it to many people, but we do want to use our capital, but we want to use it wisely. And so it has to make sense in terms of the technology that we're getting, and it can't just be revenue and a new platform. That's not our strategy, and so there has to be on our terms and it has to fit into our strategic direction. But we believe that there are opportunities out there that would enhance our competitiveness and our ability to grow and add new business bookings, but we're being incredibly disciplined, and as you know, the valuation backdrop is not favorable in the HCM market right now. And I think the other big opportunity for us is geographic. You saw that we made an acquisition in Latin America last year. And this is a place where, again, back to the issues of market share, we talk about the PEO having very low penetration in general in our PEO specifically, geography is another place where you look at outside the US, ADP has really only scratched the surface of opportunities in many of the geographic opportunities that we serve. Not just multinationals but also in countries. So this is another place where it would be a safe assumption to plan on us using our capital to kind of expand our reach globally. It may be counterintuitive because today it feels like because of what's happened with FX, everyone is running from international but generally speaking that's exactly the time to look at something is when everyone else is running away. So we're, I think continuing to look at opportunities outside the US and trying to find ways of enhancing our competitive strength and our growth outside the US.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. I think we've seen an earnings season with a number of other companies is the impact of declining oil prices on their business. And I just was wonder if you have seen any of that either in a positive or negative way. On the negative side I would think would be if you have a lot of energy exposure, if you've seen some reduction in payroll from some of those customers. Thanks. ","Carlos Rodriguez","I think it's a good question. Just because of again of our size and our geographic spread and our industry spread, the answer would be no. Certainly not something that we've been able to identify. So we will look at it again to make sure that my answer is correct, but we really don't have that kind of concentration in our business. We're so big and so broad, both in the US and also globally, that the real impact is the FX impact which may or may not be connected to what's going on with oil, but it's certainly connected to what's happening in Europe and Japan and other parts of the world. And luckily for us, only 18%, in this case luckily for us, because it is something we've been trying to address, and I just mentioned in my previous comments, we're trying to become bigger internationally, but the fact is that today our revenues outside the US are only 18%. And as you know, some companies that are peers are in the S&P 500 have close to 50% of their operating earnings and their revenues outside the US. So we have relatively less exposure. And that happens to work out well right now. Our operating income I believe is only 15% exposed outside the US, and both the 18% and the 15% include Latin America, Brazil, and include some business in Asia. So our European exposure is even less than 18%. So again, it's a drag on our revenues and our operating income, but our relative basis, it's a smaller impact for us than it is for some of our other large cap brethren.","Ryan Cary","Great. And just a follow-up to that. Can you just remind us where your international exposure is the largest? ","Carlos Rodriguez","It is in Europe. ","Ryan Cary","In Europe. And how about Canada?","Carlos Rodriguez","I am sorry - -","Jan Siegmund ","Canada would be number two. ","Carlos Rodriguez","Canada would be number two. ","Ryan Cary","Yes, right, thank you so much.","Carlos Rodriguez","And Canada is -- it's actually a relevant good question because Canada is a relatively large business calls it between $300 million and $400 million, and it's quite profitable. So it's like a small version of the US, a very good business. I have been in Canada for decades and decades and the reason I mention that is clearly because of the profitability of that business and we have a very good float income business in Canada as well. The impact of the Canadian dollar move has a decent impact on our overall revenue growth in Canada and also our operating income growth in Canada when it gets translated to US dollars.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis Securities Corporation. Your line is open.","Jim MacDonald","Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the PEO, one more little thing. Anything of note during the critical year-end selling season?","Carlos Rodriguez","The only thing of note is it did a spectacular job.","Jim MacDonald","Okay. And you talked a lot about integrated solutions, and I suspect we will hear a lot about that at the Analyst Day, but how would you sort of view -- grade yourself in integrated solutions, and what areas are you looking to improve there?","Carlos Rodriguez","I don't think I'm going to take that bait. So I think it varies. I think our strategic platforms are actually quite well integrated and quite broad and have rich feature functionality. So we still have pockets. We haven't been able to migrate clients where competitors would point out lack of integration. And I think that's just lack of ability or termination to move those clients to our strategic platform. Because once we have those clients on our strategic platform, I think these issues of integration tend to fade into the background. So I think it's a legitimate criticism of us, but it's old news, and it's historical, and it won't be true in the near future. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you. Hey, guys. This may seem like a odd question but over the last few years, as you guys have progressively simplified the overall business, the talk that sort of comes up is what are the synergies, and are there synergies that you can point to why the Employer Services and PEO business should be under one roof, or can you take advantage of the excellent performance in PEO and the valuations in pure play PEO and shared that business and become really pure play ES?","Carlos Rodriguez","Frankly, the two businesses because of co-employment, because of pass through and a number of other issues, it's a separate segment. But the businesses have a lot of share a lot of things in common, including the sales forces work very, very close together. So our small business and midsize business sales forces of which you know we have thousands of people on the street, provide leads to our PEO sales force, which has its own sales force, but without their brothers and sisters in the rest of ADP, I don't believe that our PEO would have the kind of success that it has today. So the biggest synergy we believe that we have in distribution and in sales, and we believe it is large, and a very big move for our business has been historically and I think it will be going forward. I think there are other advantages. We have capital so when we run into issues around historically in the marketplace around workers' compensation, we've been able to do things that others eventually were able to do but we had more flexibility in terms of being able to use our capital and our strong credit rating. And so I think there are other advantages to having the PEO be part of ADP, but the most important one is the sales synergy. So I would say that I can't envision that business being a separate business.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Okay. Understood. I guess another question I have is and you mentioned this in the past, with regards to the platform -- the ongoing platform consolidation, as we think of the forward margin impact of that, and how much will you allow to flow through to the bottom line, versus investing in other things. Could you help clarify? I'm assuming it is primarily not so much a fiscal 2015, but more like a fiscal 2016, 2017 impact, but just trying to quantify if we are going to see potentially outsized margin improvement years. ","Carlos Rodriguez","Right. I think it depends on the competition. If we were able -- ever able to get into a situation where there were no competitors left, then we would not reinvest anything in the business. But we're trying to build, I think Jan and myself and the entire management team I think are keenly aware that today we have the opposite situation where we have a highly competitive environment and a lot of competitors, some of which have done a very nice job. And so our plan for the short term and medium term, and we'll go into a little bit more detail at the Investor Day, is to invest as much as we can in creating long-term value for this company. But we are a 65 year old company. We intend to be around for another 65 years. And the only way to do that is to be constantly reinventing yourself and reinvesting in the business. And so our strategies around migrations are in part to make sure that our stakeholders and our shareholders also get some return in the form of improved margin. But the main reason why we're doing the things we do is to create better competitiveness and to create long-term value for the company, so that we make sure this enterprise endures and continues to grow at a very good rate for a long time, not just for a year or two.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it, understood. You guys sure don't behave like 65 years old but yes it is a good thing. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon of Robert W. Baird & Co. Your line is open.","Mark Marcon","Good morning. Carlos so I was really encouraged by your comments with regards to international and investing there. Nice to see somebody take advantage of the strong dollar. Can you talk a little bit more about the opportunities that you see over there and what you are hearing Jan in London, in terms of the receptivity to ADP and how it is positioned vis-\u00e0-vis some of the competitive alternatives? ","Carlos Rodriguez","Yes. I think, Mark, thank you for the question. When we talk about ADP's global footprint just to level set, we have a physical presence of in country solutions in about 40 countries and we offer within a 100 countries now solution and some of these countries we serve through partners and our Latin American acquisition that we did little bit more than a year ago, was one of those partners that we worked with and they were great partners since the integration and ownership of certain technology assets allows us to improve the services to offer client a more integrated as we talk solutions, so when we evaluate where to expand and what country, it is really driven by the demand of our multinational clients and the ability to have partners that have good technology solutions and services that would help us further differentiate that solution. And today already a market leading solutions in the vast majority of the outsource global market is really captured by ADP. So we are very, very good on the multinational side. And we would continue to keep that said advantage that we have by investments. So I think it is really driven by where is the lot of demand and is in that country a good competitor or a good partner that we think is viable to be acquired and I think that will drive the expansion to moderate that expectations these tend to be now smaller countries or faster growing countries so the acquisitions are maybe a bit smaller in nature and more technology oriented but they will certainly then help us to just mend our leading position over time.","Mark Marcon","I appreciate that color. Carlos on the PEO side, can you talk a little bit about what your -- the declines that you are gaining, are they existing PEO clients and you are taking them from competitors or are they brand new to the PEO and it is a complete conversion? And which regions of the country are you seeing that stem from? In other words, is it the well penetrated markets like Florida and Texas or do you see a rapid expansion across the country?","Carlos Rodriguez","So again back to the visit n Atlanta, we've got some information on some of those questions and I think that we've actually consistently for many, many years had a mix of our clients that we get from other PEOs and again this very similar to the ADP business model and a fair amount that comes from we call in house so they are doing it themselves, they have an insurance broker for insurance and they do payroll with ADP or with someone else. And so I don't think there is really any meaningful change to report there. Clearly, there are no more competitors that have higher profile now in the PEO space and maybe two or three years ago but again this is a business where we clearly run into competition but because of penetration rates and market share for both us and our competitors, there are still a lot of open territory out there in terms of not on only geographically but I mean in terms of clients to sell that are not necessarily with a competitor. Having said that, we clearly take our fair share from competitors and some of them take their fair share from us. But there is really nothing meaningful to report there. And some of the geographic distribution of our success again because of the size of the business, we clearly have variability in terms of different regions in different parts of the country which are driven in some case by execution issues and other cases by past through costs like healthcare so a variety of reasons that might cause shift in one region versus other. But because of sheer size there really isn't anyone region who is performing very poorly because it would be impossible for us to generate the kind of results that we are delivering now if we had any one specific geographic region not performing. So they are really performing well in a fairly balanced way. There is really nothing significant to report there either. ","Mark Marcon","So from a longer-term perspective, do you believe that with the new legislative change that the penetration rate can become more even across the country relative to the way it is now?","Carlos Rodriguez","The changes in the law really affect the way taxes start at the federal level and so I don't think they really causes the change in geographic -- well it could be because higher wage client in California and New York for example, the tax restart issues was more pronounced in higher wage areas and higher wage state. So it might be some small impact from -- positive impact from the fact that the taxes won't have to restart again. But I think the biggest impact that we expect to see is more evenly distributed sales throughout the year. And clients not having to wait till January 1st start because of this negative impact from the tax restart. So that actually the most meaningful -- the most meaningful issue. And I think that helps a lot in terms of the execution of that business and it might actually help a little bit in terms of incremental sales because it is not always easy to talk to client in June and then convince them to sign but start in on January 1st. So the fact that the client can now sign up and start in June without any negative impacts on the tax restarts should be an enhancement to our competitiveness and to industry's competitiveness.","Mark Marcon","Great. And if I could squeeze one more in, just on the mid market space, what percentage I missed it, what percentage of your client base has been switched over to work place now?","Jan Siegmund ","Workforce Now?","Mark Marcon","Workforce Now","Jan Siegmund ","So we have now about 1,000, TCW clients meaning out of in the mid market ","Mark Marcon","Out of how many? ","Jan Siegmund ","We have about almost 55,000 clients on Workforce Now. So a very small number so we are kind of really on task to also finish as planned in fiscal year -- end of fiscal year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Your line is open.","Lisa Ellis ","Good morning, guys. Question on the PEO. I think when we've discussed it before you've indicated that small sized M&A in the PEO market like rolling up these 700-800 odd small PEOs out there is tricky because of the insurance, underlying insurance risk in those companies. Given the secular growth, accelerated secular growth we are seeing in that market, have you kind of revisited that or is that still kind of off the table in terms of accelerating the growth in the PEO?","Carlos Rodriguez","Well, I think the -- that the best way to answer that is that I think that the PEO general depending on how much risk you take and how -- I don't think the secular growth or tailwinds really impact the -- I guess our view of the world that way. In the sense that now insurance cycle tend to take place over long period of time. They don't take place in one quarter or one year. And whenever you take risks whether it is on healthcare or workers' compensation, the balance sheet reserve that you have are very, very important. Secondly, what you have been taking in terms of P&L expense to drive those reserves is incredibly important too because it is either accurately reflects or doesn't accurately reflect true profitability of those worksite employees for those client. So I guess that's go on and on but no it doesn't change our view that these businesses have underlying insurance risks and as long as PEO is taking risks, you have to then analyze it and look at it as an insurance risk rather than as a recurring revenue processing business which is the rest of our businesses are. So we treat the PEO as one of those ADP business and transfer the risk to either the carrier through healthcare or in case of workers' compensation to captive which is run by our corporate group at an arm's length and hence we believe that we run ours by isolating or limiting the insurance exposure and I think most of our competitors take a lot more risk than we do. Whether they are small or large and that's not of interest to us.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Tien tsin Huang of JP Morgan Chase & Co. Your line is open.","Tien tsin Huang","Thank you. I'll trying to be quick. Just following up on that, on all these PEO questions, just to clarify was the raise in the outlook driven by what we are seeing in January or something else? Just trying to get some understanding around the change there. ","Carlos Rodriguez","No. It was really based on the prior six months. ","Tien tsin Huang","Okay. And then have you -- ","Carlos Rodriguez","Is that answer on the PEO.","Tien tsin Huang","I guess I'll ask one more just on the sales headcount growth on PEO. Have you disclosed what that it is? Have you elevated that number in the last 12 months? ","Carlos Rodriguez","No. We don't really disclose sales headcount by business unit. But you can assume that it is growing at the same in line with kind of the overall sales headcount growth of plus or minus little bit but not as -- as Jan said we are trying to grow our sales headcounts call it between 2% and 4% and then try to achieve the rest of our sales results through productivity improvements. ","Tien tsin Huang","And then just quickly on the international pays per control. Did you -- can you give that by three regions, big regions and that's all I have. Thanks a lot, guys.","Jan Siegmund ","We disclosed the European thing and as I mentioned it was flat for the quarter and we have I guess 10 or 20 basis points decline in each of the quarters before so it really has flattened out in Europe, so a very casual utilization. ","Carlos Rodriguez","I think when we talked about the European performance and almost that backdrop is still sluggish as we would describe it but overall the performance actually of our national was quite good.","Operator","This concludes our Q&A session for today. I am please to hand the program back over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks. ","Carlos Rodriguez","So thank you all joining the call today. You probably could tell that we are very pleased with the fundamental performance of the business here in the first six months. Very, very happy with the record client retention and the very, very strong new business bookings growth. And I think both of those things reflect that we are winning our fair share in the market. And despite the economic headwinds from the foreign currency translation and some still ongoing pressure from interest rate, still on track to deliver our full year revenue and earnings guidance which is very satisfying for us. Hope to see you at our Investor Day on March the 3rd, New York City. And thank you again for joining us and have a nice day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You now disconnect.

My name is Crystal, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded, and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Crystal, and good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations. I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call and webcast.","During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current excitations.","Now, let me turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. Today, we released our third quarter fiscal 2017 results, with reported revenue growth of 5% to $3.4 billion. This revenue growth includes about 1 percentage point of pressure from the second quarter disposition of our spending accounts in COBRA businesses.","Our diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.31. Jan will take you through the key contributing factors to our performance in more detail shortly. Our new business bookings this quarter declined by 7%, as we continued to overcome the strong fiscal 2016 sales of solutions that assist our clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act.","I'd like to remind you that the Affordable Care Act factor was quite unique and that it helped accelerate various buying decisions across our mid- and upmarkets, both from new client share and our existing base. Nevertheless, our pipeline of HCM opportunities continues to be strong, as we leverage our investments in our strategic cloud platforms, Vantage and Workforce Now.","Now, let me discuss client retention. As we reported, retention declined 170 basis points for the quarter. The losses that contributed to this decline were concentrated on our legacy platforms, and we believe some of these losses were triggered by our upgrade activities in the mid- and upmarket.","We maintain our core belief that these migrations are the right thing to do for our clients as well as for ADP. Our midmarket migrations are anticipated to be completed by the end of this calendar year, while the migration efforts upmarket will be phased in over time in partnership with our clients.","Client satisfaction and retention remains high on our strategic platforms, and we are seeing that with our midmarket Workforce Now platform. The feedback from clients on this platform has been positive. In fact, a report from G2 Crowd, a leading business solutions review platform, recently added ADP Workforce Now to its Best Software 2017 list in the Core HR category. This list is based exclusively on feedback from users of the product. We ranked highest for ease-of-use, quality of support, which is especially gratifying given our focus on service and the user experience.","ADP's success over the past 68 years is tied to our ability to keep pace with our clients' evolving needs across economic cycles. As our recent workforce vitality report indicated, the labor market continues to be robust, and we see our clients becoming increasingly focused on talent, finding, retaining and engaging critical staff in a much more competitive environment.","Our recent acquisition of the Marcus Buckingham Company, which we completed in the third quarter, is an example of our commitment to assist clients in meeting their talent needs. When it comes to talent and performance management, we know the needs of each client and each team are unique. By adding TMBC's content, coaching and technology solutions to the ADP portfolio, we now offer a suite of proven products to help leaders unleash the talent of their teams and create value for our clients.","We've talked before about our focus on the user experience and delivering solutions that our clients and their employees find easier and more intuitive to use. We've applied that same thinking to our channel partners with the introduction of ADP Accountant Connect. We're particularly proud of the continued strength and robust growth of our downmarket, where we now have over 500,000 clients on our RUN platform. And this unique solution provides our accountant channel partners with a unified view of payroll as well as reporting and tax information for all our shared clients.","This solution was developed in collaboration with our accountant channel partners to meet their needs and has already been recognized by Accountant Today (sic) [Accounting Today] (5:41) as one its 2017 top new products in the accountant resources category. We believe solutions like ADP Accountant Connect will help further enhance our relationships with this important referral channel while creating a better experience for our shared clients.","We are also pleased to recently receive recognition from NelsonHall, a global BPO analyst firm, who identified ADP as a leader in payroll services for the fourth consecutive year. In naming us a leader, the NelsonHall report highlighted our global reach and the breadth of our service offering, allowing clients ranging from small businesses to global enterprises to choose how much expertise they wish to retain in-house or to outsource.","In its report, NelsonHall also recognized ADP's ability to help clients benchmark their workforce metrics against industry averages using the ADP data cloud. And they also recognize the ADP Marketplace, which helps clients access an ecosystem of enterprise applications from ADP and our partners to extend the value of their HCM solutions.","It's great to be recognized in the industry, but it's also great when we see our company recognized more broadly, which is why I was especially proud to see Fortune magazine name us to their Most Admired Companies' list for the 11th time and rank us number one in our category for the fifth straight time. I'm particularly proud of this because it's a testament to the confidence our stakeholders place in us and to the continued dedication of our 57,000 associates.","In closing, despite the pressure on new business bookings and retention, we remain confident in the enduring qualities of our business. We are pleased with the continued strong performance of our PEO and multinational solutions and with our improving service metrics within the midmarket.","We are especially pleased with our success in the downmarket, which continues to demonstrate the value of our strategy to deliver great technology and great service. We are confident that this strategy is the right one to help our clients succeed, which will in turn drive sustained growth for ADP.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for further review of our third quarter results and an update on the fiscal 2017 outlook.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. ADP revenues for the quarter grew 5% on a reported basis, 6% organic. Our revenue growth this quarter experienced pressure as we began to lap our fiscal year 2016 ACA-related revenues. Pre-tax earnings from continuing operations before taxes grew 4% on a reported basis to $828 million, despite almost 2 percentage points of combined pressure from our second quarter business disposition and our fiscal year 2017 acquisitions.","Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 4%. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 20 basis points, compared to 24.8% in last year's third quarter. Our margins this quarter were impacted by slower revenue growth as we maintain our investments and product sales and service, including dual operations cost related to our service alignment initiative.","Our net earnings grew 10% on a reported basis to $588 million and benefited from a lower effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate this quarter was aided by an incremental tax benefit related to prior period software development efforts, $0.04 of which was not previously anticipated and $0.02 tax benefit related to the adoption of new stock-based compensation accounting guidance.","Diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.31 and benefited from fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. Our new business bookings performance this quarter was disappointing. However, we have continued to make investments into our sales organization to better position us for growth. We're confident in the competitiveness of our portfolio and the strength of our distribution capabilities, and in turn, our ability to execute on our pipeline of market opportunities.","In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 2% on a reported basis for the quarter and included 1 percentage points of pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses earlier this fiscal year. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.5% in the third quarter. Average client fund balances grew 2% on a reported basis, or 3% on a constant dollar basis compared to a year ago.","As a result of improving employment, we have continued to see pressure from lower state unemployment insurance collections impact client fund balances. This pressure was offset by a combination of wage inflation and growth in our pays per control metric. Employer Services margin decreased about 40 basis points in the quarter. This decrease was driven by slower revenue growth as we maintain our investments and product sales and service, including dual operations related to our service alignment initiative.","PEO revenues grew 12% in the quarter with average worksite employees growing 12% to 471,000. The PEO continued to experience slowing growth in the benefit pass-through costs, resulting from lower health care renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation of our worksite employees during the quarter.","The PEO margins continued to expand through operational efficiencies, which helped drive approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. New business bookings this quarter were down 7%. And as a result, we now expect new business bookings for fiscal year 2017 to decline about 5% to 7% compared to the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016.","We have also updated certain other elements of our fiscal 2017 forecast, which I will now take you through. Despite our revised new business bookings guidance and this quarter's revenue retention decline, our revenue outlook remains unchanged at about 6%. This forecast continues to include 1 percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impacts from foreign currency.","While Employer Services segment consistent with our prior forecast, revenue growth is anticipated to be 3% to 4%, which continues to include 1 percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impacts from foreign currency.","For the PEO, ADP continues to anticipate revenue growth of 13%. We continue to expect our consolidated adjusted EBIT margin expansion to be about 50 basis points, which includes about 20 basis points of pressure from dual operations pertaining to our service alignment initiative, which was not part of our non-GAAP charges.","On a segment level, we continue to anticipate margin expansion in Employer Services of 25 basis points to 50 basis points. For the PEO, we expect continued operating efficiencies and slower growth in our pass-through revenues as compared to fiscal year 2016 to help drive margin expansion on a full year basis.","Accordingly, we continue to expect fiscal year 2017 PEO margin expansion of at least 100 basis points. We are also now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to increase to about $20 million compared with our prior forecasted increase of about $15 million.","The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is now expected to be up about $15 million compared to the prior forecast of about $10 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","As a result of the software development related tax benefit, some of which was not previously contemplated in our prior guidance and the additional benefit related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, we now estimate our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 to be 31.4% as compared to our prior forecasted rate of 32.4%.","Based upon our revision of our effective tax rate guidance; adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 13% to 14% compared to our prior forecast of 11% to 13%.","Our forecast also continues to contemplate a return of excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases of $1.2 billion to $1. 4 billion, subject to market conditions during fiscal year 2017. This forecast includes any repurchases required to offset dilution related to employee benefit plans.","So, with that, I will turn the call back to our operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will take our first question from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Good morning.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Last quarter \u2013 I'm thinking of it as the December quarter \u2013 you showed an improvement in client retention, I believe, 10 basis points; in this quarter, the March quarter, down 170 basis points. What was the major change between the December quarter and the March quarter that led to that decline in client revenue retention?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think as we mentioned, I think, in our opening comments, it was concentrated in our legacy platforms in the midmarket and in the upmarket. It was particularly skewed towards the upmarket this quarter.","Some of the losses, as you know, we don't provide guidance. And in the December quarter, we wouldn't have talked about forward-looking retention. But some of the deterioration that we experienced in the quarter was anticipated as a result of some known large losses.","We typically have reasonable amount of visibility, sometimes several quarters, if not a year or more, for very large clients when they are moving off of one of our solutions. But I guess the core message we are trying to deliver in our comments is that it continues to be concentrated in our legacy platforms.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. And just as a quick follow-up, it would seem that the decline in new bookings this year and some of the pressure on client revenue retention would be more consequential for fiscal 2018 given the way your revenue model works. Can you give us some preliminary thoughts about fiscal 2018 based on the retention trends and the booking trends you're seeing in FY 2017?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think you're right about the way the math works for our business. And I think that's why Jan was very clear in kind of reaffirming our guidance for, obviously, the rest of the year, because we're so far into the year that these variations and retention in sales have very low impact on the current next quarter and even maybe one quarter after that.","But clearly, going forward, for the next fiscal year, it does roll into the math in terms of that waterfall chart that we've shared with you. As you know, we don't provide guidance for fiscal year 2018 until our August call. So we're really in the middle of our operating plan process and we'll obviously have better information then in terms of how that waterfall chart exactly falls through in terms of the various factors that impact our revenue growth in fiscal year 2018.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think that's true. But, David, you're mathematically correct that our new business bookings get implemented and turn into revenue after six months approximately and so some of the impact of our lower retention and lower sales will be seen in the revenue growth next year, as you roll it forward.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just the first one, if I heard you correctly, it sounded like the midmarket client migrations have been pushed out by two quarters. The question, I guess, is why have you pushed that out?","And then expanding on that a little bit further, as you're starting, it sounds like with the upmarket \u2013 how has what you've seen in midmarket colored your expectations and how you are going to approach the upmarket? Thank you.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. I think, you're right about the timing that we were hoping that we would be done. I think our wording was that we would be done somewhere around the end of this fiscal year. And so, now we're saying by the end of the calendar year. Realistically, we really don't do migrations in November and December because we have year-end and a lot of activities going on. So it's really a few months and its a few clients or a few thousand clients, because in the midmarket, we're talking about clients in the thousands.","And just as a reminder, there were tens of thousands. I think the total number of client migrations was somewhere around 50,000 or 60,000 clients. And so what we're talking about is, I would say, a couple of thousand stragglers that we felt, in order to just meet an artificial deadline wasn't worth. We learned our lesson, I think, a year-and-a-half ago around when we had to accelerate, in some cases we were forced to accelerate migrations as a result of ACA to get clients on our new platform in order to be able to give them that solution.","We learned through that process that you want to really truly upgrade the clients and have them feel that it's an upgrade, not a forced march or a negative experience. And so we're just focused on making sure that it's the right kind of experience and we felt like a couple of thousand clients falling over from one fiscal year to the other is really not that big of a deal in our minds. And I think it's the right thing to do.","And I think, to answer your question about how that experience colors our approach in the upmarket, again, I think we learned some lessons in terms of making sure that we do things at the proper pace, and that we do it in partnership with our clients. And I think that becomes much more important in the upmarket where it's much more complex, and clients have, in many cases, provide a lot of their own internal resources in order to make a migration happen.","In the small market, when we did those migrations, there was very little effort and very little need for clients to be involved. In the midmarket, there was a little bit more effort and a little more involvement by the clients. And in the upmarket, there's quite a lot of involvement. And hence, it has to be much more carefully planned and, hence, you're probably hearing from us that it's going to be a longer process in terms of getting those upgrades completed.","Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Then just a follow-up, as you've had a little more time in the new service delivery geographies, how was the ability to find talent then? How is it compared to your expectations for shifting to those locations? Thanks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think it's fair to say that we are \u2013 and again, we're early in our goals here. But really, we're on track. So we're actually quite pleased. We've got several thousand people already hired in our new locations in Orlando, in Maitland, which is near Orlando; in Norfolk, Virginia; and we're already hiring also in Tempe. And it is in addition to Augusta and El Paso where we already had two strategic locations. And we have a couple of other key locations, but those are the ones that we've been talking the most about regarding our strategic alignment initiative.","So I'd say we're pleased with the talent, we're pleased with the pace. I think we're on plan in terms of the number of people we were intending to hire. We're on plan in terms of the wage levels and the quality of the talent. I have obviously visited, and I think Jan, we've all visited these locations. In fact, we had a very large associate town hall meeting in our Norfolk, Virginia location. And it may be a honeymoon phase but it's an incredibly energetic environment. People are very positive and very bullish on ADP. I think we're considered a great employer in the markets that we are entering. And we've got a lot of help from other parts of the organization getting these folks trained and ready to be able to actually deliver service, and in some cases they obviously already are.","And that's why we have some of these dual operations cost that Jan has referred to a couple of times, because we're trying to make sure that we do this in a very careful and methodical way.","Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks as always for all the disclosure. Just a couple of questions. Just on the pricing front, on successfully migrating clients to the new strategic platforms, any surprises there? Did that contribute at all to the bookings forecast?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Just to be clear, when we migrate our clients, the migration itself is not counting as a new business booking because business bookings account only incremental recurring revenue that we report. So the migration is generally cost-neutral to our clients, and they have enhanced feature functionality with a new product that they get.","In the process, clients continue to make buying decisions and buy incremental modules as they do, and we have seen that trend continue in particular in the midmarket. But the actual migration is revenue-neutral, as we approach it, and that will be the same for all upmarket clients.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks for that clarification. I wasn't sure if the change might get captured in the (24:26) business bookings.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. So the change \u2013 if a client buys more, I don't have the most recent statistics here, but I think the trends continue that a number of clients purchases incremental modules as they see the power of the integrated platform. And so there is some slight revenue uptick that we do see for the clients who choose it and only that incremental revenue would be reflected. But it would be immaterial for the new business bookings number in total.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. One more quick follow-up. I know Jan because you've been sort of, I guess, signaling or suggesting that some of these things could happen with ACA. But I'm just curious, just looking back now, is some of the reduction in this bookings outlook \u2013 is there a way to quantify how much might be related to the weak follow-through on ACA module sales and the related tough comp on ACA modules versus maybe a pull-forward of broader payroll HCM sales related to ACA? Do you follow my question?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I do. And I think that it is \u2013 as I think we've been trying to signal for, I think, probably three years if you go back to my notes, it's very hard because we're obviously in uncharted territories, because we were in something completely new. And it was a very comprehensive regulatory framework that required a lot of information from HR platforms, payroll platforms, benefit platforms, et cetera.","And when you look back, we had two years of more than 12% new business bookings growth. And this is why we were cautious all along because that is a little strong. We were happy with it and we take it. It's good for our shareholders. It's good for ADP. It's good for our revenues. But it definitely felt like a fairly significant tailwind. And I think, in hindsight, it was obviously a big tailwind.","Now, what has now added, I think, potentially to that pressure, which again we can't quantify scientifically is that we have, I think, a different environment politically that's creating some uncertainty, that certainly has impacted our new business bookings. We just can't put our finger on exactly to what extent.","So as an example, we knew we had a grow-over issue just for ACA itself because we had already sold 50% of our addressable client base. But we did have some planned sales of ACA this year. And even though we've gotten some, it's significantly lower than plan, which is not surprising given the headlines and the frequent votes on repeal and replace of ACA. And so I think that's a second factor that I think was not certainly anticipated as we entered into this fiscal year in terms of our planning process.","We knew we had to grow over the mathematical grow-over issue. Now we have what I would call the political issue. And then the third one that you mentioned, which again, is very hard for us to put our finger on, but I think you're onto something because we experienced the same thing back when we had the Y2K phenomenon in year 2000, where you do have some amount of pull forward, if you will, of business because we've seen this particularly on some of our wins last year from ERPs were quite high and elevated.","And I think some of that, it appears, with the benefit of hindsight is, people on kind of older legacy technology trying to find a new solution for ACA. And by the way, some of that happened to us. So as we mentioned, before we think some of our retention issues last year may have been related to the same factor of people kind of just out looking for new solutions as a result of what I would call an event, which is a significant event called ACA. So I think all three things are a factor. We really wish we could put our finger on exactly how much each one is accountable. But unfortunately, we can't.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks so much for the insights. It's helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to follow-up on the prior question. On the new bookings weakness you're seeing and specifically the revision to guidance. Obviously, going from flat to down 5% for the full year. I think you had talked the last quarter about seeing confidence in improving bookings rates as you head through the end of the year.","I guess, maybe you could talk anecdotally about what changed from three months ago to today in terms of specific client conversations you're having, is it simply the regulatory environment, uncertainty, seizing things up in terms of purchasing decisions? And then if you got any color on what clients are telling you about what they have to see to get more confidence to book?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. I think that a couple of comments and maybe Jan can add in terms of his observations. We've obviously been meeting frequently with our sales leaders, and I've been going around sales meetings trying to get to put my finger on the pulse. And it doesn't appear that it's the economy, because we have very robust and strong results in our downmarket. Our PEO is still doing well. Our MNC business had a great quarter. A lot of the channels that we sell through small business like our Insurance Services products and our Retirement Services products are also doing quite well.","So it's really not an across-the-board weakness. It does appear to be concentrated in places where we had the ACA phenomenon, if you will. And then how much of it is related to just the grow-over itself versus uncertainty about the political environment, and the fact that the people maybe are sitting and waiting. We do have some information around our pipeline, which is not the same as bookings. So bookings are bookings, and we are very clear about how we count revenues. And I think Jan just went through the math. But we do have pipeline reports like any sales force would have pipeline reports. And in our midmarket and our upmarket, we feel pretty good like we did last quarter about our pipeline. So if we say we feel pretty good and the sales are not materializing, that can only lead to only one conclusion, which is the decision-making is getting elongated or slowing. And we can't quite put our finger on why, but that's exactly the math is showing versus our pipeline right now.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think the only thing, Jim, just keep in mind our new guidance is down 5% to 7%, is our expected new business bookings guidance and I think Carlos captured it.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understand. And then maybe as a follow-up. Can you maybe just talk about the regulatory environment changes and what impact that could have on the PEO business? And specifically, what's your confidence level in that PEO business kind of sustaining double-digit growth for the foreseeable future?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Good question. Actually, let me finish also. I think you mentioned about like tone in the sales force. And one of the kind of surprising things for me at least is the tone in the sales force is still very positive. Like, we've done some things to try to \"encourage people not to throw in the towel\" because this is another factor that I have to worry about, right, that we are close to our end of our fiscal year, and the way our incentive systems work, there's a big incentive when you're exceeding plan to over exceed it. And, likewise, there's a bit of an incentive to throw in the towel, if you will, if you're having a bad year. So we've done some things to try to \u2013 and that may be why the sales forces still remains upbeat, or maybe because they think these issues are transitory. It's very, again, hard to put a scientific answer on it. But it feels positive in terms of the tone in the sales force.","On the question about PEO and the regulatory environment, I think I mentioned multiple times also in the PEO over the last couple of years that it felt like we were getting some tailwind as a result of ACA, if for no other reason because it was creating conversation opportunities, right. Because people are looking for a solution and they're looking at maybe different alternatives and someone is able to talk to them about the PEO, and I think it's compelling value proposition they're able to close the business.","So I would put the PEO in the same category that we were watching, if you will. It's not quite the same in the sense that many of the clients in the PEO are not necessarily buying only ACA. And we're not rushing to make a decision of that magnitude only because of ACA. So I think there's a subtle but important difference. So I'm not convinced and we certainly aren't seeing it in the numbers yet that the PEO will have the same kind of difficulties, if you will, growing over. But it's definitely a more difficult sales environment for the PEO.","But having said that, just again we've said this multiple times that the PEO has grown double-digits for, I think, its 17 years now. And so it's just a very compelling value proposition. And if, for example, there are changes in the regulatory landscape, some parts of our business may be affected like our direct ACA product, if the entire thing gets repealed and the whole thing goes away, that would not be good news for that part of the business.","But, as we know now from what we're hearing of what's growing through Congress, there's not going to be a complete repeal. There's going to be some kind of new framework. Those types of new frameworks are always good for the PEO because they intend to be more state-based regulation, which is what the PEO is really good at and what small companies are not very good at in having to deal with. And so I think that I would remain generally optimistic and positive \u2013 more optimistic and more positive about the PEO.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is open.","James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first, just wanted to start off, I know you just touched on this a little bit, but a little more color would be helpful. I mean, I understand why businesses are holding off with regards to ACA solutions, just given the uncertainties that you mentioned around healthcare in the U.S. as a whole. But at the end of the day, the law is the law, right. So kind of like at what point, if reform keeps being delayed, do you think employers will start to demand the solutions you're offering around ACA and just make other buying decisions in general that they may have been holding off because of the uncertainty?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We were hoping that that would happen two weeks ago or three weeks ago when President said that he was done with it and that we're moving on to tax reform. And unfortunately, that was not \u2013 it appears not to have been the case. So I think we're watching the same news you're watching. We do have obviously some access to and some information that we get from people in Washington about what's happening on the Hill and the regulation and so forth.","But we have kind of similar information to what everyone else has. And these things always, when you're in the middle of them, feel like your feet are in cement. And that's how it feels like to us right now. It's very frustrating but these things pass. We will look back a year or two from now and there will either be the existing ACA or some other version or some more complicated state regime or complex regulatory framework at the state level. And we'll hopefully be looking back and seeing this as yet another opportunity for ADP to shine and to help our clients. But right now, it is what it is, and it doesn't feel great.","James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then just to follow up, when you think about the slide that you guys put out, just your long-term growth driver, the 7% to 9% that you think of the longer term and I think you have like a 14% to 15% new business bookings and 7% to 8% reduction from client losses. Just how does that math change given the bookings guidance that you're seeing right now? And I know 2018 is a little early, but just any color you can give us on how to think about how that 7% to 9% growth might be impacted for fiscal 2018?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. Our longer-term expectations for organic growth is 7% to 9%, as you correctly quoted. And it's driven by growth of new business bookings in the range of 8% to 10% growth. And it always was meant to cover multiple year type of cycle elongated and it was not a commitment obviously, as you see realistically \u2013 not a commitment to perform every single fiscal year. So we are not updating our long-term growth outlook at this point in time. But, clearly, our new business bookings have fallen a little bit behind, but relative to a three- or four-year cycle of new business bookings, we still feel good about our growth opportunities.","James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I just want to understand the bookings a little bit more. So a two-part question, part math, part more subjective. So the math is just to get the full-year guidance. Seems like you're implying potentially further deterioration in the fourth quarter, unless maybe the weighting from the third quarter is disproportionate, so maybe some clarification there. And then the second part of that is maybe you can just talk about the cadence exiting the selling season and into April? Carlos, you already talked a little bit about hoping to see some change as of two weeks ago but not seeing it but maybe just a little bit more color. Thanks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. I think you're right that the third quarter is disproportionate. So we have a lot of \u2013 disproportionate number of dollar sales in the third quarter compared to the entire year. And that's just the way the seasonality has always worked. So the fourth quarter would not be materially different in terms of the momentum or this kind of the 5% to 7% down range. It's in that ballpark. So there is really no real news I think there. I think the cadence in terms of the exit for the \u2013 the one thing that we're grappling with is, obviously, we have the realities, right, of the political environment and we're hoping that there will be resolution here relatively soon.","Our fiscal year, obviously, starts on July 1. We're hoping to have some kind of \u2013 we thought two, three weeks ago, we had clarity. So we're hoping that we get that behind us and we get some clarity, because we have lots of other products. We have lots of other parts of our business that are performing well. And we just want to get on with it, right, and be able to continue to sell the other suite of products that we have available both in the midmarket and also in the upmarket.","So I think, as I mentioned before, it feels like exiting the year, our pipelines are robust. It feels like the tone and the confidence in the sales force is high. But the results are the results. And I think Jan and I live in a world of reality, not in the world of make-believe. And so we're being cautious and careful, but it's hard not to be optimistic because the economy is picking up it feels like. The labor markets are tightening. And we have some very compelling value propositions in that kind of environment where employers now are going to be \"engaging\" in a war for talent again, which we haven't seen.","We forget that 10 years ago there was real issue in terms of finding people. And we benefited back then from that kind of environment in terms of our HCM solutions, and we're hoping that we're entering a period here where all of our solutions, the entire suite becomes very compelling as clients become focused on attracting people and holding onto the people that they have. And we see all kinds of metrics in our own numbers and in the government data around higher voluntary turnover, higher wage growth, lots of signals that the labor markets are tightening. And I think our value propositions are very compelling in that kind of environment. So we just want to get this uncertainty and these delays and this slow decision-making behind us so that we can get on to the business.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And maybe just...","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","...a little comment to this on the outlook, which Carlos described correctly kind of roughly in line with fourth quarter and the full-year guidance. But we'll also continue to put our dollars where our statements are and the investments into the sales force, the incentives that we're bringing out to get the sales force ready, and the hiring and preparing for growth in the next year are actually fully underway and have actually to some degree impacted our third quarter and fourth quarter results because we believe we have that opportunity going forward. So we're preparing for growth in the future.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then just a question on retention. I just wanted to clarify. So it sounded like some of the higher attrition was in the upmarket and was partly related to migration. But at the same time, you're taking a more measured pace with your migration relative to what you do with Workforce Now. So just trying to square that and see maybe where any surprises came versus expectations? Thanks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Maybe one is connected to the other and maybe not. Because I think the reality is that the variability and I think we're very sensitive now obviously to retention for all the right reasons because we went through a really difficult last year, but we've had variability in our retention forever at ADP because it's a different metric than our other metrics and it can be volatile. And as an example, in the upmarket, you can have one or two large clients that can actually move that number \u2013 one or two clients in the upmarket that can move the number for the upmarket and for ADP. And you saw a little bit of that in the first quarter where we lost that large government contract and the business that we ended up selling or were in the process of selling that had a material impact on our overall retention for the first quarter. So this wasn't one large client like that, but it was a handful of clients.","And so our upmarket business is a little less than 20% of our overall revenue, so just to kind of put things in context and it's 2,000 to 3,000 clients. And a couple, literally, three, four client losses in a particular quarter can really move the number. So I was just trying to help kind of frame the discussion because at least for now I'm not ready to conceive that we have a permanent \u2013 we don't talk about forward guidance on retention, but this is a third quarter issue for now.","Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. All right. One more on the topic of the day, retention. So the upmarket dynamic you're describing, I guess, does feel like it's a little bit new. Is there a change in the competitive landscape in the upmarket? Or is there anything you can identify that triggered I guess this handful of clients this quarter? Or is it just somewhat anomalous?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","It's a good question. And I think that you'd be generally I think right that despite the fact that we do have volatility across quarters, we have generally not paid a lot of attention to it because over the course of kind of rolling 12 months or even in terms of years, calendar years or even fiscal years, our retention in the upmarket has been pretty stable. I mean it's a sticky business. It doesn't change a whole lot. So I'd say this quarter was \u2013 I'd say it's fair that it's a little bit anomalous. And I think the answer to your other part of question; we don't see it as being related to any change in the competitive environment.","Now, as always, in two to three years or in two to three quarters, I may be singing a different tune, but we have a lot of data around the reasons for the losses, what platform the losses were on, were they new technology, old technology, and what types of product the client had. And I think when we put all that information together, which Jan and I, obviously, spent a lot of time anticipating this being one of the topics of the day, we've spent a lot of time on this issue and looked at the names of the clients, who they are, what platforms they were on, and we don't see any change in the competitive environment.","I think we've said before that there isn't any one competitor that causes us a majority of our losses, and likewise there isn't any one competitor where we take the majority of our business from. It's spread out all over the landscape and it remains that way. For some of our competitors that might be different because of their size where they may have a heavy concentration of taking clients from one particular company. In our case, that is not the case.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And maybe a tiny bit of further detail, Lisa, is when we look at our competitive position against this multitude of competitors in the quarter, some competitive positions have improved and some have not. And that is a fairly typical thing we see each of these competitors evolving quarter-by-quarter up and down. So when we say the general competitive dynamic we feel has not changed, it's rooted in this analysis, and we see in some cases we have improved and some cases we have not. So it's a mixed bag obviously, but we believe it hasn't changed.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. I think I didn't maybe answer directly your question about how does this square with our upgrade or migrations strategy. And I think the things really are somewhat connected in maybe an odd way that we think that because we know what clients we lost and what platforms they were on that it makes it even more compelling for us to move our clients onto our newer technologies.","On the other hand, we know that these movements are complex and that the clients need to help us and they need to be involved, they need to cooperate. And so finding the right clients in the right place at the right time is just different than it was in the midmarket and in the down market. But it think it heightens our confidence that it's the right thing to do over time.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then I guess the follow-up, as we've been living with you through the Workforce Now migrations in the midmarket, I know you've consistently said that the retention levels are higher on the migrated clients and so there's sort of this nirvana we are going to get to when the migrations are done where retention should naturally go back up. Are we though now facing a more protracted period in the upmarket kind of going to the same thing?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So I think the nirvana, it does from what Jan and I were looking at just over the last couple of days, their retention rates on our current version Workforce Now strategic platform are extremely high, and we're very happy with them and we have a lot of volume on it already. So that feels like it worked out the way we had hoped and we had anticipated.","And with now the down-market on our new strategic platform with potential rates that frankly have improved dramatically over the last couple years and with our Workforce Now migrations being completed by the end of this calendar year and with 20% of our base remaining in the upmarket, we're feeling good about where we are. But the answer to your question is, yes, we have a protracted migration effort in the upmarket. It's the right thing to do. We're going to do it, and we're going to do it as well as we can and as quickly as we can without causing damage and disruption to our clients. But we're in a very different position from where we were four or five years ago when we had 10% of our clients on our strategic platforms that are version-less in cloud where there is no further migration and there is no further disruption. So it's a very, very different place and it hasn't felt good getting here but it feels pretty good now.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Maybe quickly just on a more positive note. I know you've had the reporting and benchmarking modules out in the market now at least for a few months. How are they doing? How is the uptake?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","It's going well. Again, that's another one back to the discussion about what's happening with the labor markets and the economy in general. Those are products that are useful no matter what, but in the kind of environment that we're entering into like helping people make sure that they're paying people the right amounts, that they know where their turnover is in comparison to benchmarks, that type of information is very, very useful to an HR leader or to a CEO in making good people decisions on a go-forward basis.","So that's another example of something that the conversations for the last two or three years were about ACA. I think the conversations for the next two or three years are going to be about what's happening with your workforce, what's the turnover rate, how are you paying people. And I think these benchmark and analytics tools are going to facilitate those discussions, and hopefully, those sales because those are conversation openers or starters in order to convince clients to come to our product suite, which is I think unique in a sense that it has these data and analytics benchmarks.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thank you. Thanks for all the transparency as usual.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you so much. A few times you mentioned the uncertainty and you thought it might have dissipated a few weeks ago when we had a little bit more clarity on ACA. Is the client uncertainty and the elongated decision-making you think it's solely related to ACA issues? Are there just other things going on in the current environment that clients are worried about?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Again, I'll just say one more time. It's impossible for us. We don't really have like a chart that kind of follows that. So this is really more on intuition, and I'll let Jan comment as well. But it's not just ACA that's creating uncertainty. I think the administration has asked the Labor Department to review the overtime rules, for example, that were about to be issued. I think there were pay equity rules that were coming out around EEOC reporting that are now under review as well. The fiduciary rule, which was intended to go through the \u2013 which would have affected our Retirement Services business has also been put under review.","And so I think there are pockets of uncertainty in addition to ACA. And some of them happened to be related to our core business, which is HCM. And so if you're selling, for example, an ERP suite, some of that uncertainty may not really affect that decision-making. But if we were involved in a sales process where you had a large hourly workforce and many of them \u2013 sorry, a large salaried workforce because of the new rules was going to now be hourly and those hours needed to be tracked and you needed to be in compliance with the FLSA, that sales cycle has probably been elongated as a client stops and goes back to focusing on whatever they were focusing on before that trigger event. So I think there are a few other things that are probably not helpful, but again, it's hard for us to put a specific measure on each one of them.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. I understand and I appreciate the color. And then just one, I guess, numbers or model-related question. When do we anniversary the bump in bookings from all the ACA-driven business?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Well, next fiscal year, we are clearly half \u2013 still a little bit of grow-over but not that material. So next year should be a clean year relative to the ACA-related grow-over. Just a further clarification, we have tried to illustrate this a few times. With the ACA core module that we have sold came off an incremental fuller bundled sales that particularly included benefit administration module. So the impact of the Affordable Care Act have been broader than the direct impact of the ACA-related sales, which makes it a little bit harder to predict.","And as a consequence, our clients (54:35) typically provides ADP-wide about 50% of our incremental new business bookings, however, come from selling more to existing clients. And that dynamic has now changed because we have fuller bundles now in particular in the midmarket. And so we started to transition to drive new logo growth in the midmarket and those channels have to readjust a little bit as a consequence of the ACA surge that has driven a more complete bundle in particular in the midmarket.","So that transition is still present obviously next year, but we feel that we have great strategies in place to replace basically that up-sell strategy with a more aggressive new logo sales. And as we have clarified, it is a disappointing quarter, but despite our down guidance for new business booking sale, it will still be our second highest sales year ever for ADP. So keep that in mind.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. This is actually Jay Hanna on for Gary today. Kind of going off that last comment, going forward, given the struggles with the client retention this quarter and the now expected decline in bookings, should we expect an even greater spend on sales force additions going forward?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Well, it's funny you should mention that, because I think Jan I think did address and I'll let him if he wants to give more detail, which we probably don't because we're not giving FY 2018 guidance yet. But we're definitely not taking our foot off of the accelerator. So we obviously could change our minds a quarter or two from now, but our position right now is I think we mentioned it in Jan's comments, we're maintaining our investments in service, implementation, et cetera. And in some cases we've actually accelerated or increased some of our investments. And I think in the sales organization is a place where I would say we've added expense. And the irony is that the underlying sales expense gets helped by weaker sales because our commissions are lower and so forth, but there's a lot of things that go into that sales expense bucket, including head count cost and commissions.","And so it's safe to say that our commission expense and our variable expense is helping us from a cost standpoint. But instead of taking that all to the bottom line, we have chosen to invest because, again, we believe our story which is that nothing fundamentally has changed in the economy, which is typically what really affects ADP, which by the way affects us less than most because of the nature of our business model. But if we saw a recession coming or a slowdown coming, we would have to start thinking hard about our expense levels. And that's not where we are right now.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Just a quick reminder, as one of the advantages of ADP is that we serve such a broad range of segments and markets in the U.S. and globally and multinational, and so as we had our challenges in the mid and upmarket, we continue to perform tremendously in the down-market, in the PEO, multinational. So there's a broad range of products that are gaining share and really driving success. So obviously, in that balance, our investments into sales signal our confidence for ultimate success in distribution.","Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Couple of product-related questions. With regards to the higher ratings in terms of the G2 for Workforce Now, at what point do you start pivoting from migration of existing clients to proactively selling Workforce Now to clients that aren't currently utilizing ADP at all in the midmarket? That's the first question. And then secondly, can you tell us where we are with regards to Vantage in terms of the optimization of that solution, and when you would feel really good about pushing that?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So I think the answer on the Workforce Now question is, about three or four months ago because I think Jan just alluded to that that we've kind of tilted our focus now more towards new logo growth and new share from kind of the traditional approach of \u2013 doesn't mean we won't take additional modules and incremental business. But this is a fairly significant change from a sales force mentality standpoint where we were for several years focused on upgrades and on incremental sales of other modules to the existing client base as we upgraded them combined with selling something called ACA, which to some extent was a significant tailwind.","So we're moving into a different environment. Luckily, we have other tailwinds like great products like you just mentioned with Workforce Now, and we can see, for example, our client satisfaction scores improving. We can see our client retention scores on our strategic platform being very, very high, higher than we've had overall for the midmarket historically.","So there's a lot of positive signs that we want to step on the accelerator and proactively sell our solution just as you mentioned. And I think we kind of got that religion, if you will, I don't know four to six months ago. And we've been retooling, right, in terms of \u2013 I think Jan alluded to channels.","I think if we're going to go after incremental new logos, not just add-on business that requires channel partnerships. And I think there's a lot of effort underway to build the same kind of success we have in our downmarket now with our midmarket channel partners. And so, the answer is, we're on that and we believe that, that will get traction over time.","On the question about Vantage, Vantage continues to do quite well. And there, again, our satisfaction scores, for implementation have improved dramatically over the last several quarters as we invested in that process of the implementation process. I think we have like almost 350 live clients, versus I think we were at 220 at the beginning of the fiscal year. We have I think 500 sold, so we have a decent pipeline that needs to be implemented. And I don't mean pipeline. Those are actually signed contracts, 500 signed contracts. And so, we feel pretty good about our Vantage platform. I think it compares really well and competes very well with our upmarket competitors. But you all see the same thing we see. It's a very competitive environment in the upmarket and there are a lot of solutions. But we like what we have, and I think we're competing very effectively.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. And next a quick follow-up. With regards to the dual service platforms, do you still think that by the end of calendar 2018 you'll have completed that transition to the new service platforms?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. You're never complete on operations, Mark, but the majority of our work is actually this fiscal year and next fiscal year. So in next fiscal year I'd still anticipate some dual ops. We haven't determined what that will be specifically, but there is still transitioning happening, but the vast majority relative to those three new locations and the two existing ones should be completed in 2018. But our service strategy is obviously organic and evolving and we're going to continue to drive improvements, but 2018 is a big year still for us.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just two quick clarifications. Just on the retention. Do we know where these clients are going? Are they bringing it in-house, the service? Just curious.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. The sources of our business and the sources of our losses is something that we track. And both have very similar dynamics. It's a fragmented and there's no clear trend to it, and so they go to a variety of different targets. Some in the ERP space, some to our traditional competitors, some to other solutions, so it is a wide range. Some is driven by their M&A activity, moving to on (1:03:41). So the loss reasons and their targets is varied as the sources of our businesses are varied and as a consequence we feel the competitive dynamic has not fundamentally changed as we observe it.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And we did look at that. I happened to look at it last night. I asked for a little more detail in terms of our upmarket losses and unfortunately I didn't compare the same \"top losses\" to last year third quarter top losses, but when we looked at this year's third quarter losses, there were a couple that went back in-house. That we're using, for example, our COS solution, which is our BPO solution upmarket, and I guess they decided to go back and rebuild internal capabilities and use their internal technology.","But I think Jan described it well, because I mean we sound elusive when we give you that answer, but it's really all over the board. And maybe that's because of our size because again, and just to continue to emphasize some of our competitors would have a different story just because of the differences potentially in terms of size.","But in our case, it would almost be easier if we had one specific place or one specific reason, but it's not that way, neither in the upmarket nor for ADP overall. So there's no discernible pattern across \u2013 even in the place where we had the concentration of losses this quarter, we can't see discernible pattern.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No, that's helpful. And then, the other clarification is just on an environment where you guys are, let's say, seeing slower revenue growth. Can you still get operating leverage and increase operating margins?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Well, yes. And that's fully our intention. So obviously, it's much easier to get operating leverage and margin improvement when you're growing revenues faster. But we are who we are. So we know ourselves very well, and we know that we're a $12 billion-plus company. And so we are happy with 7% to 9% revenue growth.","And it's easier to get margin when you're at 9%. Like when you back out disposition that we had with that AdvancedMD business, we were almost getting close to 10% revenue growth at one point. Now we're excluding, again, the dispositions this year, we're probably closer to 7% or so in terms of our revenue growth.","And the reality is that it's harder. But we're a very disciplined company. And so, for example, you can see our head count growth for our own internal resources slowing down slightly, despite the fact that we're still investing in our sales organization, because we have lower volumes. And so we know that, we get that. We've been doing this for 68 years. And so we will adjust appropriately because we still want to deliver great service.","Retention is the most important thing for us. And so we don't want to cut too much or we're not cut because this is a matter of slowing the growth of expense, not cutting expense. But we are slowing the growth of expense in certain areas as our revenue growth slows in order to be able to continue to drive operating efficiencies because we believe there's still opportunity for that.","We have a lot of process improvement initiatives underway across the company because we believe that the complexity that we have historically had, the number of platforms, all the things that we've been telling you about that we're trying to simplify, all those things are margin opportunity for us without affecting our associates and without affecting our clients.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Helpful. Thanks so much for the details.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one final question. And our last question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Hi, Carlos. Hi, Jan. I guess the first question is, if bookings growth recovers or as bookings growth recovers either because of easier comps or other factors, what is the relationship, the impact on the margins I would imagine would be negative. If you can talk about the specific quantification of that relationship, that would be helpful. And the other modeling question I have is with regards to the go forward tax rate?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So I wish there was an easy answer to the question about margin and sales because back to, again, we want to be intellectually honest here. We had two or three years of very robust plus 12% sales growth, new business bookings growth and we drove margin improvement. So we clearly have the capability to drive margin. And some of that depends on the timing of when the investments and the expense go in.","So as I think we've mentioned, we've I would say invested a little bit ahead of 2018 from a sales standpoint. If we had strong new bookings growth next year, there might be some incremental variable cost around commissions and so forth. But I'm not saying it doesn't matter. It clearly matters. The math is very straightforward.","But we have a lot of levers in our business and we make choices every day in order to balance our objectives, right? And one of our objectives continues to be margin improvement. But we also have an objective around growth. We have an objective around capital return. And we balance all of those things and I think try to do the right thing for our shareholders and our stakeholders. So I guess, the short answer is, we have the ability, I think, to drive margin when new bookings recover.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And on the tax rate, Ashwin, this quarter was onetime unanticipated strong outcome relative to our tax strategies of the R&D credits. So this quarter is not a regular quarter, it was a onetime effect and so we're going to be returning to our \u2013 well, that said, we're not giving guidance for next year. But it's certainly not going to be at the level that you saw in the third quarter.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And the third question I have for you Carlos and Jan is really, as you reflect back on how this year sort of transpired and you think about the operating plan for next year, which you're in the process of doing. How does that affect, how you go about doing the operating plan, the fact that you're considering and so on? If you can kind of walk through the process, what changes, what doesn't change?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think that, frankly, the things that we look at and the things we do, many of them, we learn every day. Like, Jan and I are learning every year and every day in our current jobs, and we've learned from our predecessors for many years, and I think this company has a lot of deep experience and knowledge about economic cycles and about how we manage our sales force, et cetera. So we, frankly, would make changes around the edges. But we're very consistent in terms of the way we approach things.","And so one of our objectives for 2018 is this is the kind of experience and environment that would lead you to be overly conservative. And we want to be very careful about that. And that's why we haven't \"slashed\" expenses or sales investment because we just don't see the sign that that is the appropriate move right now. And so in a strange way, part of our challenge for 2018 will be to not allow ourselves to become overly conservative because we want to take advantage of the market opportunity that we have in front of us.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","The tenets translate into what you have heard. Our belief that our core strategic platforms need to be funded and need to be innovative. So we have a belief in our core capability to develop those products. And we continue as we had in a prior question, our belief that the service alignment initiative is fundamentally positive for our business outlook going forward. So we need to continue to drive the execution of those core strategic initiatives, and we continue to believe that our sales force has opportunity to execute and we will be funding those appropriately. So those may be the core tenets kind of really executing around the strategy that we have laid out for the last few years, also on 2018 is a fair assumption to make.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you guys.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Just a couple of quick closing remarks. Obviously, we acknowledge we had a very challenging quarter. But I think you can also tell from our tone that we still have a lot of confidence in our business model and in our continued ability, not just to grow our business but also to drive operational efficiencies. You probably also can tell that, in particular, I'm hopeful and optimistic that the continuing labor markets are going to continue to drive value in our HCM solutions for the market. So I think the economic cycle and the tightened labor markets I'm hoping will help us as we try to reengage our sales growth and our revenue growth.","And I think as Jan just mentioned, we're going to continue to make the investments in our innovation and simplification efforts because we believe they're yielding the right kinds of results. We're going to continue to align our service model, so the strategic alignment initiative I think continues to move forward and I think is on plan. And as you also heard, we're going to continue to expand our distribution channels because we've shown a historical ability to create opportunities and use our distribution channel to grow the company, which is ultimately our objective.","And so with that, I thank you for joining the call and I thank you for your interest in ADP.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call. I would like to inform you that this call is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP's Vice President, Investor Relations, and I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call and webcast.","Before I hand the call over to Carlos, I want to give you a brief reminder about our upcoming Investor Day. The event will be held on June 12th in New York City, and we have an exciting agenda planned that will showcase our new products, and include an update on our business and transformation initiatives. We look forward to seeing you there.","Moving on to the quarter, I'd like to remind you that during our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors, and that include the impact of certain items in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as well as the third quarter of 2017. A description of these items and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.","Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.","Now, let me turn the call over to Carlos.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported our third quarter fiscal 2018 results with reported revenue up 8% to $3.7 billion, 6% on an organic constant currency basis. We are pleased with the strong revenue growth for the quarter and we are especially pleased with our quarterly Employer Services revenue retention, which increased 170 basis points. In our PEO segment, average worksite employee growth was 9% for the quarter, slightly below our expectations, though we continue to see strong demand particularly in the down-market.","Our solid 9% new business bookings growth this quarter was in line with expectations as we continue to see improving demand for our HCM solutions. Our down-market and international businesses continued to perform well, and we were also encouraged by the performance of our up-market offerings compared to a difficult third quarter in fiscal 2017. As you can see from our reported results, we continue to see broad-based progress from investments we made in our sales force, and are therefore, increasing our fiscal 2018 new business bookings guidance growth to 6% to 7% from 5% to 7%.","Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 16% to $1.52 per share as we delivered improving adjusted EBIT performance and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. Overall, our earnings growth in the quarter exceeded our expectations and we're happy with our strong performance, which Jan will walk you through in more detail shortly.","Now, I'd like to discuss our innovation efforts and how they remain at the core of our strategy. We're continuing to invest in a new breed of HCM solutions that we anticipate will address the evolving needs of millions of workers every day and we're proud to be recognized for it. Most recently, Constellation Research recognized our suite of HCM solutions as a leader in helping enterprises navigate the barriers in doing business in today's global economy. They further noted that we have turned the Innovation Corner and described ADP as an innovative next-gen HCM vendor and a leader in big data, machine learning, and user experience.","Additionally, earlier this week at Facebook's F8 conference, we launched an integration with Facebook's enterprise solution, Workplace. Now, clients using ADP for HR and payroll solutions and Workplace by Facebook for employee collaboration can offer teams access to pay and time-off information within Facebook's enterprise environment through an ADP virtual assistant that utilizes chat. This application is available now in our ADP Marketplace.","As we continue to invest around our core strengths, we also remain strategic in the acquisitions we make. Last quarter, we discussed Global Cash Card, an acquisition that enables us to broaden engagement with our clients' workforce with compelling flexible payments, and WorkMarket which established ADP as the first HCM provider with freelance worker management and payment functionality. These acquisitions will enable us to drive higher market share across the entire labor pool, while we help our clients keep pace with change and manage the increasing demand for flexibility.","We remain committed to supporting these investments and innovation with our business transformation efforts, and with our mid-market migrations now behind us, we continue to make good progress on transforming our organization with the client service experience top of mind. This quarter, we launched a voluntary early retirement program, we believe, will help us streamline our operations and help us drive incremental margin expansion in fiscal 2019 and beyond. In addition, we have accelerated the execution of some incremental strategic initiatives this quarter, which we believe will continue to help us enhance our productivity and efficiency. Jan will take you through some of the details of these initiatives shortly.","We believe that our focused initiatives will help us continue to deliver long-term value for ADP, our associates, and our investors. As we have mentioned before, it takes time and attention to detail to drive successful change and avoid major disruptions. Since embarking on our Service Alignment Initiative almost two years ago, our associates have worked tirelessly to meet and exceed our targets, while simultaneously increasing client satisfaction. I'm proud of our progress and I'm happy to tell you that as of this month, we exceeded our fiscal 2018 exit target and have now closed approximately 90% of our 68 targeted subscale service locations.","We have done all this and more while undergoing a large multiyear client migration in the mid-market, which I'm proud to announce we have now completed. We continue to extend our efforts to simplify our organization and service tools, and are pleased with the progress we are making, and in particular, with the 170 basis point increase in retention this quarter, which was slightly ahead of our expectations. We look forward to discussing our strategy and the strength of our business at our upcoming Investor Day in June. We continue to believe that our unique ability to meet the needs of our clients today while anticipating their needs tomorrow will drive our sustained growth.","Before I turn the call over to Jan, I want to take a moment to acknowledge how proud I am of our talented and dedicated associates. I would also like to recognize the contributions and accomplishments of our associates who have decided to participate in our voluntary early retirement program. These tenured associates have helped shape ADP into who we are today, and we look forward to working with them through the upcoming transition period. The transition will be thoughtfully managed and reflective of our deep appreciation of their service to ADP.","We also continue to focus our efforts on attracting, training, and retaining top talent. In fact, this quarter, we were honored to be included among LinkedIn's 2018 Top Companies. This award highlighted the top 50 companies that were most in demand by jobseekers. This recognition along with our other achievements affirms our strategy, enhances our value proposition, and lays the groundwork for long-term growth. I continue to be impressed and proud of the unwavering commitment of our associates. Our stakeholders place the utmost confidence in us because of the tireless efforts of our associates in providing our clients the best solutions for today and tomorrow.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for further review of our third quarter results.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you, Carlos, and hello, everyone. Before I proceed with a deeper dive on our financial results, I would like to talk a little bit about our transformation initiatives. As Carlos highlighted, we continue to execute on our transformation initiatives, and this quarter, we recognized approximately $40 million of charges which are excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Some of the anticipated benefits from these investments were already contemplated in our September 2017 investor presentation, while other incremental investments made this quarter are focused on expanding our productivity improvement initiatives to further drive our transformation efforts. We believe the benefits from these investments will continue to help us deliver against our long-term financial objectives. I also want to be clear that the $40 million of charges are not related to our previously announced voluntary early retirement program. We expect the benefit of this program to begin help reduce our pre-operating expenses starting early fiscal year 2019.","With that said, let us now dive into the financial update. As Carlos mentioned, ADP reported revenues grew 8% in the quarter to $3.7 billion, and we now fully lapped the pressure from the fiscal year 2017 sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses. We are happy with this revenue growth and with the performance of our recent strategic acquisitions as we continue to work towards fully integrating them into our suite of offerings. On a reported basis, earnings before income taxes increased 3%. Our adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT increased 8%, and included approximately one combined point of lift from FX and the impact from our fiscal year 2018 acquisitions.","Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 20 basis points compared to 24.6% in last year's third quarter and was better than our expectations. We were pleased with our margin performance as we continued to overcome pressure from acquisitions and growth in our PEO pass-through revenues, and benefited from operating efficiencies, largely driven by improvements in our infrastructure spend as well as incremental sales efficiencies.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 16% to $1.52, and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with the year ago. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter of 24.3% was aided by the release of reserves related to uncertain tax positions and the benefit of a tax accounting change which resulted in certain assets of investments being eligible for accelerated expensing. We continue to expect an effective tax rate, excluding any possible onetime items, of 25% to 26% beyond fiscal year 2018.","Additionally, in April, our board of directors approved a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.69 per share. This increase will be funded by a portion of the benefits we received from the Tax Cuts and Job Act (sic) [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] in the U.S. Our board expects to consider another dividend increase in November 2018 consistent with ADP's 43-year track record of annual dividend increases and our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. As a reminder, ADP has historically targeted a 55% to 60% dividend payout ratio.","Overall, we have continued to make good progress this quarter. Let me now take you through our segment results before moving on to our fiscal year 2018 outlook. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 7% in the quarter, 4% organic constant currency. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.9% in the third quarter. Average client fund balances grew 6% or 5% on a constant dollar compared with a year ago. This growth was driven by a combination of wage inflation and growth in our pays per control, offset by about 3% of combined pressure from lower state unemployment insurance collections as well as corporate tax reform.","Outside the U.S., we continued to see solid performance from our multinational businesses with double-digit revenue growth. Employer Services margin decreased about 20 basis points in the quarter and continued to include approximately 70 basis points of combined impact from acquisitions and FX. PEO revenues were 10% in the quarter with average worksite employees growing 9% to 512,000. This worksite employee growth was slightly below our expectations due to, in part, a softer growth in the 50 employee and above market. The PEO segment's margins this quarter increased 40 basis points which was largely a function of lower selling expenses.","I will now take a moment to walk through our revised outlook with you. First, as Carlos mentioned earlier, we are raising our full year new business bookings guidance to 6% to 7% growth from our previous guidance of 5% to 7%, and we are reaffirming our consolidated revenue growth forecast of 7% to 8%. For the Employer Services segment, we now anticipate revenue growth of about 5% as compared to our previous guidance of 4% to 5%. While for the PEO, we are revising our revenue guidance to growth of about 12% as compared to our previous guidance of 12% to 13%.","We are also now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to increase approximately $65 million compared with our prior forecasted increase to $55 million to $65 million. The total impact from client funds extended investment strategy is now expected to be up about $50 million compared to the prior forecasted increase of $65 million (sic) [$45 million] to $55 million. The details of this forecast can be found on slide 8 in our investor presentation which is available in our Investor Relations website.","As we continue to see some of the benefits from the acceleration of our transformation initiatives, we now anticipate our consolidated adjusted EBIT margin to be about flat compared to our previously forecasted contraction of 50 basis points from 19.8% in fiscal year 2017. Overall, as you can tell from our guidance adjustment, our accelerated investments begin to make an impact. As we have easier compares in the fourth quarter, we continue to anticipate a strong finish for the year.","At a segment level, most of this incremental margin performance is coming from Employer Services segment, where we now expect margins to be about flat compared to our previously forecasted contraction of 50 to 75 basis points. This revised ES guidance continues to anticipate approximately 60 basis points of pressure from acquisitions cost and FX.","For the PEO, we now anticipate margins to be about flat compared to our previously forecasted flat to down 25 basis points. As a result of the incremental benefits of our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate, we now anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 of 26.2% compared to our previously forecasted 26.9%.","We were pleased with our performance this quarter and with the momentum of our transformation initiatives. Accordingly, we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 16% to 17% compared to our prior forecast of 12% to 13%. This forecast does not contemplate any further share buybacks beyond anticipated dilution related to equity compensation plans. However, it remains our intent to continue to return excess cash to shareholders, subject to market conditions.","So, with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will take our first question from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, guys, and nice set of results. I just wanted to start on margins, obviously, good to see the guidance increase there. So, you're now looking at flat year-over-year, which I think implies that your June quarter will be up almost 300 basis points. I know that benefits from an easy comp, but nonetheless much better than previously envisioned. So, given that the benefits of the early retirement program won't even start kicking in until next fiscal year, how should we start thinking about the potential margin expansion trajectory for fiscal 2019 relative to the multiyear outlook you had given last-September?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Jason, thank you. As you know, we will give guidance later in the year for 2019. But in addition to having completed our migrations, making progress on our Service Alignment Initiatives, and an easier compare relative to investments that we made last fourth quarter, in particular into our sales force, we have a number of sources that will drive the margin expansion in the fourth quarter that we anticipate. The early retirement initiative is really going to be kicking in in 2019 as we then work on the transition of those workers who have chosen \u2013 employees that have chosen the early retirement in 2019. I hope that's helpful.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. I'm sure we'll get more color at the Analyst Day. Just for my follow-up, any callouts on the strong retention result as well as the strong bookings growth? I mean, I know the bookings forecast change isn't big, but nonetheless you are nudging it up. So, I was just curious if there was any parts of the end market there that have improved more notably than others? And then, along the same line, as it relates to retention, does it seem like these underlying trends are sustainable now that the mid-market migrations are complete?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So, I think on the sales \u2013 on the new business bookings growth, given the absolute size of our new business bookings, the change in guidance for us \u2013 you're right, it's relatively modest in percentage terms, but I think the sales force would say that's pretty meaningful, because it's a lot of additional dollars in new business bookings. On the retention side, we did have an easier compare versus last year. If you remember, we \u2013 I think every call, I think I just caution everyone that because of the way we calculate revenue retention on a quarterly basis, if you have one or two large losses, it can really impact the numbers, even given ADP's size, it can have an impact...","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","...on the retention. And I think last year in the third quarter was one of those quarters. And then, again, here now I have to say the opposite, which is when you have a great quarter and you don't have a lot of large losses, which we didn't have this quarter, it helps. And so, I think that was part of it. But I would say that the improvement was broad-based, so you can obviously by my comments see that a lot of that improvement was in the up-market and some of that is an easier compare.","But we also have had really good results in our mid-market, which as you know, it's been a multiyear effort to kind of climb back in terms of the retention pressure that we felt a few years back as a result of ACA activity, and also as a result of the migrations that we've undergone there. So, I'm very proud of the mid-market retention results as well, but I think other places also \u2013 so, I guess as usual at ADP, since we are so diversified in terms of segment and geography, for us to have a large improvement in retention of that magnitude it has to be somewhat broad-based and I think it was.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Maybe I'll add two components to your answer, Carlos. Number one, the positive trend in retention is supported by continued improvement of our client satisfaction scores, also a broad-based improvement, which means our investments that we undertook last year into our service components are really taking root, and as a consequence, our service operations are also very good at this point in time. So, I think those investments have translated then broad-based into and supported some of the retention improvement that we saw on the quarter.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. I actually received a note last night from one of our business unit leaders with an update on our client satisfaction scores. We measure NPS and the trend there is incredibly positive. They even used the term service renaissance because we did have some struggles and stumbles a couple years ago, and I think our client satisfaction stores now have been on a multi-quarter kind of upward trajectory, admittedly from some difficult compares, but doing really quite well.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Nice job. Thanks for the comments.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And sorry, last comment on that, on the other \u2013 on the client satisfaction side is that, one of the things that we were careful about in terms of our Strategic Alignment Initiative is making sure that it didn't disrupt our \u2013 we had, I think our number one objective was to improve client satisfaction and NPS scores, and things like Strategic Alignment Initiative and early retirement have the potential to disrupt that. But the good news is, obviously, early retirement, we still have to execute on, but the Strategic Alignment Initiative, I'm happy to report our leaders have executed flawlessly there and actually have gotten great client satisfaction in those new strategic locations, which is not easy to do because we have a lot of new associates in those locations.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Hi, Carlos. How are you? So, I want to go back to the topic of retention. Obviously, it's a volatile metric as you mentioned, but assuming that the high attrition is also linked with the new service delivery, I guess the question is, do have to maintain the level of spend on service delivery or is there more of a \u2013 or was that more of a technology spend that you can now scale up on, if that makes sense?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Well, to be \u2013 I mean, Jan could probably add a couple of comments, but to be clear, like we \u2013 in some of our businesses where we've had large increases in client satisfaction and large increases in NPS and large increases in retention, our service spend has actually declined. So, we're \u2013 obviously, part of our business transformation efforts are to get better at \u2013 as you know, one of our key objectives in our initiatives is to reduce the number of, what we call, non-value-added contacts which drive costs, but don't drive value for our clients.","So, there are places where we've invested more in service, and as you can see, we've also invested in sales. But there are places where we have done both improved productivity, improved efficiency, and actually, better results from a retention and a client satisfaction standpoint. And that's obviously our hope for the next X-number of years for us to be able to drive operating leverage and improve margin, that's kind of an important thing for us to be able to accomplish.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. I've only two additional details to add. The investments that we made into service augmented, in particular in the mid- and up-market, our capabilities to service our larger clients better, in particular with dedicated service reps. But then we have a whole slew of productivity initiatives that Carlos mentioned that will drive efficiency and effectiveness of our service cost. And the most obvious one is, obviously, our new strategic service locations are labor cost advantaged and we have now a simpler operating environment, a single platform. We finished our migrations in the mid-market that will allow to implement faster productivity improvements and optimization of our operations. So, with that combination, higher service levels and through strategic changes to our service model, paired with efficiency and effectiveness initiatives, and so I think we will be able to achieve both.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And as much as it might not be directly related to our new business bookings growth, I would say that I think these efforts around simplification, improved client satisfaction and some of the other things that Jan mentioned, I think really should help our sales force as well. I mean, when we went through some challenges a couple of years ago, there was just a lot of distraction, not to mention a very difficult grow over. Obviously, the number one issue was just the grow over around ACA, but some of the service challenges we had were also a distraction to our sales force. So, I think getting that behind us, I think, should help as well. Because, again, despite the fact that it was a modest improvement in new business bookings growth guidance, it was an increase, and this quarter, we're pretty proud of 9% bookings growth after really suffering for several quarters here with very, very difficult grow overs and compares.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Those are good points. So, but then \u2013 I guess the follow-up question becomes, it sounds from your comments, there is a margin benefit coming from the combination of retention and maybe the spend on service delivery going down over time as you scale that margin benefit from voluntary termination. So, would you \u2013 is your preference to reinvest those savings and to what degree, and how much might flow to the bottom line becomes the obvious question? And then, the other part of it is, in general, are there other explicit things other than the voluntary termination program that you're planning, if you could talk about that? Thanks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","You came to the right place for the answer to that question. Jan wants it all the flow to the bottom line and I want to reinvest some of it. So, the truth will be somewhere in between, and you'll know more when we give our guidance for 2019 and also when we, in Investor Day, give you kind of a longer-term I guess objective view of what we think margins will do over the ensuing couple of years.","So, I think unfortunately we're just a little premature in being able to get out in front of talking about kind of multiyear margin improvement, but I just want to add that foundationally, all the things you said are dead-on in terms of there is the possibility and the capability for us to drive improved margin. This is what we've been trying to talk about. For the last two or three years, we've been laying the groundwork with all of these initiatives, Strategic Alignment Initiative, completing the migrations, voluntary early retirement, these are all intended to help us be a stronger, more profitable company. But stronger is the first word and that means that sometimes you have to invest some.","I will add that there is no question that the underlying margin trend is positive for us, so we feel very good about that. But again, I think it's just a little premature to get too far out in front of ourselves here in terms of what exactly the numbers are going to be.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning. Could you comment on pricing net of discounting? We're picking up some modest improvement in price increases of 1.5% in our payroll manager surveys, at least from your clients, and I'm curious whether you're seeing that from your broader base of clients as well?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So, the targeted impact of price increases net of any immediate concessions or discounts that we would receive is about 0.5% of our revenue growth and we've that stable for a number of quarters now.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. I think, our \u2013 obviously, we have a much broader dataset than I think maybe the sampling that some folks might do out in the marketplace. But the fact of the matter is I think we have seen really no change in the kind of the environment from a pricing standpoint. I think our intent is to remain consistent which is to remain competitive. As you can see, the underlying inflationary trends with labor costs accelerating a little bit are on an upward trajectory. But these things, they play themselves out over multiple quarters and multiple years. It's not like overnight, all of a sudden the pricing environment changes. But I would say that there's probably \u2013 the future appears to have more pricing power than the past in terms of the last decade. But right now, I think no news to report and we would obviously give you kind of a sense if that's beginning to change.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. And then as a follow-up, also in our surveys, we asked your clients about any timeline they've heard of where you're replacing your backend payroll processing and tax filing engine, something you talked about last fall. Only 5% were aware of it. I'm curious if you have a timeline to introduce the new backend payroll and tax filing engines, and if so what is that?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So, the good news is that both of those are actually in production and have pilot clients on them. As we've said I think on a number of occasions, these are back-office systems that are relatively transparent to our clients. In fact, today, our clients don't really have direct contact with our gross-to-net calculation engine and we don't expect them to have that in the future. Now, there will be \u2013 the reason we're doing it is, besides the obvious reasons of modern technology being easier to develop on, faster to develop and cheaper to maintain, there will be some enhancements from a client-facing perspective and from an associate service client perspective.","But largely, you should think of these as back-office infrastructure that is really not \u2013 when someone is trying to hire someone or manage their human capital at their company, typically this is not something that they would be exposed to or that would be transparent to them. Certainly, the employees of our clients won't see any change at all. Our Mobile Solutions are frontend solutions that will be connected back to our new gross-to-net engines. So, I would say, it's mostly positive and we don't expect \u2013 I guess, the key is that there's really no, I guess, migration, if you will. We're not going to be sitting here talking about \u2013 there will be efforts and costs around the connections to our frontend HCM systems, but there really is no \"client migration\" that you should be anticipating.","And I think I would also add that despite what you might hear from competitors, almost everyone operates with a gross-to-net calc engine that is even if it's in a single-stack technology, it is almost always separate from the frontend HCM platforms as well. So, it's really not \u2013 what we're doing is no different than what anybody else would have out there, it's just more on modern stack technology. I think I don't know if you mentioned Lifion, but our kind of low-code platform that we're developing that we've talked about now publicly, that is not a back-office system, that is definitely a front-office facing system, and we do have a number of pilot clients on that as well. And we'll talk more about all of these platforms in the future and their impact on the organization in a positive way at our Investor Day in June.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks so much. I wanted to ask on the mid-market conversion being done, is it reasonable to expect an improvement in retention from here in your mid-market segment? And I'm curious, does completing the migration also trigger a measurable cost savings from retiring the old platforms?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","We are hoping for a continued improvement of retention as there has been clearly impact for clients that had to be migrated, and made choices and decisions to either follow us on that path or not. And so, there should be continued improvement. I don't know if the trend will change in a huge way because we had now, I would say, probably six or seven quarters of improving retention in the mid-market. And so, it should be in the long-term continued improvement because the newer strategic platforms had higher retention rates, and so our plans call for it. But the migration-related impact for \u2013 now behind us, long-term, yes. In the short-term, there's no immediate major cost savings for shutting down here and there system, but everything is kind of more a smooth path of continued progress.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. I think cost \u2013 we said this before, when we shut down our down-market platform, this was several years ago, we migrated all of our clients on to RUN. The cost savings from a technical standpoint were in the, call it, sub-$10 million range from a pure platform support standpoint, et cetera. But as you can see from the performance of that business, we haven't talked about the down-market yet, but the down-market just continues to be incredibly successful and a great story for us. And the reality is that the direct cost focus is really not where the money is. The money is in improved client satisfaction, improved retention, accelerated new business bookings, and then just frictional cost in the organization around implementation and service.","And so, having said all that, we expect a similar story in the mid-market, but obviously, we just finished like the last client I think last week. And so, it'll probably take \u2013 in the down-market as an example, we kind of laid the foundation like we've just laid in the mid-market and it took several quarters if not a year or two before we got real traction, and it was a really great story. And we really hope that we have a repeat of that story, but as Jan said, we have to be cautious because we have to go execute. But this quarter, like all other \u2013 like the last several quarters, the retention of our strategic platform in mid-market was higher than the legacy platform that was being retired.","But I think what Jan is alluding to is you had two competing forces. One is we had fewer and fewer migrations which was helping the retention rate, but they just also were executing better. They've had many, many quarters in the last \u2013 I think in six or seven quarters where retention was moving in the right direction, despite six quarters ago or five quarters ago still very, very heavy migrations in the mid-market. So, hard to tell here exactly what's going to happen, but we're very optimistic.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Now, we'll consider all that. And then just my quick follow-up on the PEO side with the unit growth breaking below double-digit, is this a sales issue or a secular issue in the 50 and up market for PEO?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think in the short-term, it's fair to say that it's probably a sales issue, a new business bookings issue. So, I don't think there's really any kind of secular trend. As I think Jan mentioned, we had very, very strong growth and demand still in the down-market under 50, and then this quarter we struggled a little bit in terms of particularly in new business bookings in the mid-market of PEO, if you will. And we're kind of watching that closely. We're kind of looking back at our incentives because, as you know, a lot of the business that we have in our PEO is driven from referrals of our other business units. And so, we have ways of tweaking and adjusting incentives and so forth.","But we're frankly pretty \u2013 we're never thrilled with a deceleration, we always prefer acceleration. But our PEO is very large, it's the second employer in the United States now, and I think this growth I think is still \u2013 in terms of absolute worksite employee growth in dollars still more than any of our competitors. And so, we feel pretty proud of that. And I think the percentage is obviously one way to look at it, but when you look at absolute size in dollars, we feel like we have a really good strong business here and it's performing very well.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Agreed. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman of Stifel. Your line is open.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. So, Carlos, I think even with the very strong 3Q bookings result, you still need an uptick in 4Q to hit the target for the year. And I think you mentioned the investment and sales head count in the fourth quarter last year is another favorable comp. But is there any way to parse out those factors that you can share? Any other metrics that can help us understand the underlying momentum in the core business? I'm just trying to kind of parse out the impact of sales execution versus product and service.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think as you're alluding to I think they all have an impact, so it's hard scientifically to kind point to any one single item. But for sure the investments and sales that we made, call it last year, as time goes on those could become more and more productive. Every quarter our sales force is \u2013 when we add new people in a step change fashion, become more and more productive. So, I think that's helpful.","I think our products are stronger and I think that is helping as well. The comparisons always help, because we're very large and we have a very large new business bookings number. And so, I think the compares have an impact as well. So, I don't know if Jan has any other color, but I think it's probably a number of things, but we're very happy that our productivity as we expected from some of the sales force investments is driving frankly a good portion of our new business bookings growth which is very nice to see.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I can add maybe a number to it David that might help you a little bit. Last year, we grew our head count in our sales force 9% and we are currently at about 3%. So, a large chunk of the growth that Carlos refers to is driven by productivity or new product, productivity being the largest one. We have talked in our last year's investor presentations about our sales channel, sales strategies that we are expanding which are strong focus on expanding our channel strategy. And so, we continue to see, for example, great success with our accountant channel strategy in the mid-market. We are building out an continued success in our inside sales strategy that sells supplemental products to our clients, and that's where we have very predictable and very pleasing results relative to productivity improvement. Those were new associates that came on last year and now they're gaining productivity, and it's a law of large numbers that really executed well.","In addition, a component that we haven't talked on a regular basis and doing our investor presentations is our target to drive accelerated new logo growth versus AB (00:41:41). So, historically, we have kind of a balanced mix between 50%\/50% relative to new business bookings comprised of being new business bookings driven by new clients, about half of them, and 50% by selling additional product to existing clients. And we have seen now, in addition to this growth that we experienced also a shift to more new logo sales. And it's now more than 60% of our new business bookings have come from new logos, which is a really great complement to the sales force, because we believe being competitive and winning new clients to ADP is a great testament to the competitive of our product set and the capability of the sales force.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for that. Very helpful. And just one quick follow-up just on the question about the new products that are being developed, the low code platform and the next-gen processing engine. I know you said you're going to give more at the Investor Day, however can you give us a quick update on what are the key problems that the new platforms solve? And that's whether it's more cost to maintain internally or they're competitive kind of holes that it drills, just trying to get a sense on how to frame kind of the new product introductions and the impact on the business.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Again, we can obviously talk for a long time about that, but I'll just give you two broad themes. One is, I think you ended your question on is it partly competitive and the beginning of your question was really around does it address kind of cost of development and maintenance and so forth, I think those are the two broad categories. In each of these cases with the exception of maybe the tax at the backend, the tax engine, but certainly our new gross-to-net processing engine and our low code platform are all intended to leapfrog the competition in terms of capabilities and flexibility for clients, in terms of how people get managed and how people get paid. And then besides that obviously our business case had very strong expectations around efficiency, I think productivity, and just removing frictional costs that exist as a result of some legacy technology. And obviously, I think you said it also the speed of development, the speed of deployment, and ability to implement changes in a version-less environment is also incredibly powerful.","David Michael Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot. I wanted to go back on kind of the bookings and you've highlighted new drivers, including sales force and that kind of thing. I'm wondering if you can rank order kind of what you think are the contributors from directly where ADP has control on things like sales force versus what's happening perhaps in the economy or in the market as a whole. And it seems like you've talked about retention as being separate factors, but are there any common threads maybe that we can draw between the strong bookings and better retention?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think that you're onto something that most of us and most people are not onto, which is there's a belief among some of us who have been around for a while that they are very, very closely linked. The momentum, when you have strong momentum in the business, improving satisfaction, improving NPS, improving retention, it has to \u2013 the thing is we just don't have any empirical way of drawing the connection, but experience and intuition I think would tell you that there's no question, because we've seen it go the other way as well.","So, I think that the company is just experiencing strong momentum on a number of fronts around execution, client service, client satisfaction, et cetera, and that's probably creating a little bit of a halo effect. But from a practical standpoint, if you rank order the sales execution issues, I think the item that Jan brought up is probably the most important one. We talked about, I'd say, probably six quarters ago or four quarters ago when we ran into the very difficult compares of ACA and a new administration that was at least less openly focused on regulation. We talked about having to really refocus our sales force on new logos and on really selling what is now obviously an incredible opportunity to help people manage a very difficult labor environment with tightened labor markets.","You saw our National Employment Report today, and it's obviously consistent with the government reports that it's getting hard, so definitely a war for talent on again. So, we were optimistic and hopeful that there was really good opportunity for our sales force to retool and drive new business bookings in a different way, and that's exactly what they've done. Some of it has been through training, some of it has been through product, and some of it has been through incentives.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And then just a quick question is, as you've had a chance to digest the change in tax law, et cetera, should we expect there \u2013 what should we expect for opportunities for further improvement in tax rate, et cetera, going forward? Thanks.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. The outlook that I gave of 26% to \u2013 what did I say, 25% to 26% beyond 2018, that excludes the onetime items that we typically hunt in our tax reduction efforts, and those opportunities have gotten a little bit fewer as the overall rates have come down and we have less differential between international and the U.S. So, I think the 25% to 26% is a good number. We'll clearly work as good as we can, but that's really an honest forecast of what we're anticipating.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you our next question is from Jeff Silber of BMO. Your line is open.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning. It's Henry Chien calling in for Jeff. Just wanted to follow-up on the bookings question and sort of the improvement that you're seeing in sales and bookings, can you comment a little bit on how much of that you could say is related to competition versus some of the cloud software providers, and if \u2013 are those kind of players still having an impact?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Well, we have a lot of competitors in every segment. When we look at the kind of net win\/loss ratios, if you will, how many clients we take away from competitors versus how many they take from us, we've seen some improvement in some areas, and then there's a couple that are still difficult. I think that's \u2013 those are figures that are also that are somewhat not volatile quarter to quarter, but it changes depending on how strong we are in a particular segment versus one of our competitors. But I'd say, we're overall pretty happy about our competitive position, and it seems obvious that it feels like it's improving, but I think that's about as much color as I can give or should give without crossing the line, because we try to be diplomatic about our comments around our competitors.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Maybe it's fair to say that the competitive environment in this quarter has not meaningfully changed to other quarters. It remains highly competitive.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And on the down-market and some of the improvement that you're seeing there, is that mostly from a product standpoint or some of the sales efforts that you mentioned with new logos? Just trying to think of how should we think about that. Thanks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","The performance in our down-market is probably the best execution in performance I've seen in my career at ADP, and it's back to an earlier question about connecting it to client retention and other things, there are just so many things that are creating the positive momentum that it's hard to really focus on one specific one. So, as an example, we consider our down-market business to be not just our payroll and HR services for smaller companies, but we also have a Retirement Services business and we have an Insurance Services business that are just really across the board just executing incredibly well, strong double-digit new business bookings growth, strong retention.","Our retention in our down-market, for example, is up several hundred basis points over where it was several years ago on a consistent quarter to quarter basis. And of course that helps with the growth, because you don't have to sell as much in order to drive the top line revenue growth, because you're losing less clients. And so, the continuing strength of the new business bookings with the improving fundamentals of that business are just driving really great results, and I think it's just across the board just outstanding execution by all the leaders in those businesses.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. That's great to hear. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe return to the new bookings detail that you provided earlier. I think you called out strengths in the down-market and also some strength in international. Can you maybe talk about what was driving that, but also touch on what you saw in the mid-market bookings? And whether you think that after the platform transition \u2013 with that now complete, whether that can improve in the coming quarters?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. I can give Carlos a little break here. Part of the good news about the new business bookings is that we saw really meaningful improvement across all channels across the board. So, it was not focused only on the down-market. The down-market had a good performance and continue to do it, but it was really mid-market, up-market, international, they all contributed to growth in the new business bookings quarter if you look by each of the channels basically that we have.","So, the broad-based, and in the mid-market, there's really on the sales process not a change, and the migrations haven't really affected in a sense the product offering in the mid-market. We have been selling Workforce Now current version, our cloud-based leading product, and that has been very competitive and continues to do well in the mid-market. So, it's hard to point really in the quarter a particular stand out, because the performance was really solid across all segments, Jim.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I will say that in the mid-market as an example, this happened a little bit in the down-market also when we were doing the migrations of our legacy technology, our sales force does sometimes get distracted when an existing client still has a relationship with a sales rep and they call the sales rep, because they're being told they have to migrate to a new platform, and there's that distraction. Now, sometimes that historically provided opportunities also for our sales force to sell additional products as a client was migrating to the new platform. So, there's puts and takes, but it's going to be a lot less distraction, that's for sure.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful color. And then maybe just as a follow-up to the point you just made, Carlos, I would have normally expected that there could have been a little bit of a risk to the retention metrics in the mid-market as you complete that transition. Obviously, that didn't happen. So, can you maybe give us a sense about like what tactics you may have used to kind of keep those retention numbers up in the mid-market? And whether you think those can be kind of more broadly applicable across the board? Is it service continuity, realignment or something else?","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","I think the tactic was smart, dedicated people who were very creative. And so, as we kind of came out of some of the big challenges we had when we had to accelerate in a very large and meaningful way our migrations due to ACA, because our ACA products were only available on our new platform, I think what that taught us was when you think about the lifetime value of these clients using what they called a white-glove service approach to the migrations really made the difference in terms of not having the losses be as big as they could've been.","We clearly experienced heavier losses in the legacy platform because I just mentioned that our retention rates are higher in our current version platform than in our legacy platform, but they could've been a lot worse. And so, I think it was just great execution, great commitment, and good creativity around frankly just swarming those transitioning clients with a white-glove service in order to try to minimize the negative impact of the migrations and it really did work. So, hats off to the leaders there.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good to hear. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color with regards to the source of the new logos? Specifically what I'm wondering is, are you seeing an expansion of new logos that maybe coming not necessarily from traditional competitors, but maybe some other players that are out there? How would you characterize some of the new logos? And then I have a follow-up.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Again, just because I hate to be a broken record, but when we look at both our losses and also our new logos, we are so broad-based and we have so many competitors that \u2013 I think I've said this before that there's really a couple competitors, for example, who in the up-market come close to maybe 10% of our losses, but nobody is really kind of that meaningful, and I think it's even more true in the mid-market that there isn't one specific competitor that accounts for a great deal of our losses. And then, it's the same thing with new business bookings. But I think it's safe to say that some of that stuff is related to market share. And so, our biggest competitors generally speaking would be ones where we would lose the most clients to, but also we have a lot of success in pulling clients. That obviously varies by segment, but I think directionally that's true, and the difference maker in each case is really the execution of the sales force.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then with regards to nationals, there have been some discussion about expanding your push with Workforce Now up there. Can you talk a little bit about that and what you're seeing on Workforce Now internationals versus Vantage?","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Yeah. We had the Workforce Now product being offered I think for the last two years now in the up-market, and the new logo growth that Workforce Now for clients above 1,000 is incremental to new logo growth that Vantage continues to achieve. So, the combination of both of them has helped our broad-based acceleration of new logo growth.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","And we definitely \u2013 I think it has been something that we had available and it's helped us compete in kind of the low end of the up-market for a few years. But I think it's safe to say in the last year or so, we kind of doubled-down a little bit, and put more focus and more emphasis, and I think it's having the desired impact. Like our \u2013 and there are a few competitors in particular where Workforce Now lines up very, very strongly in the lower end of the up-market and I think that strategy is working.","Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Matt C. O'Neill - Autonomous Research US LP","Yes. Thank you. All my questions have been asked and answered.","Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the program over to Mr. Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.","Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","So, just a couple of final comments, I terms of looking at the \u2013 obviously, we've had a lot of achievements this year and we're pretty happy about the momentum we have, and I think it demonstrates the strong culture that we have at ADP and it's one that we're not afraid to change, but we want to do so in a thoughtful, orderly and balanced way.","With these migrations done in the mid-market and the progress we're making with our Service Alignment initiatives and the early retirement program, among some of the other initiatives that you'll hear more about at the June Investor Day, I just want to again reemphasize how proud I am of our associates and all of these efforts of the things they're doing to really protect and enhance the value of ADP.","I also want to make sure I mention that besides the dividend increase, which I think is great news for shareholders from a governance standpoint, we did add two new board members who bring a lot of experience, both operationally and transformationally to our board. And I look forward and I know the rest of the board looks forward to working with them as we build a brighter future for ADP.","And with that, I'll thank you for joining us and we look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day in June.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."]}}
