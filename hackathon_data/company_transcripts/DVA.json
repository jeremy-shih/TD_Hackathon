(Broker)","Patrick Wood - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Operator","Welcome, and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference.","And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Gustafson. Sir, you may now begin.","Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Joseph, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of the DaVita Kidney Care; Vijay Kotte, Chief Financial Officer of DaVita Medical Group; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer and Interim CFO; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statement. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.","For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Jim, and thank you, everyone, for joining on our call. We will start as we always do with our clinical performance, and then I will return before Q&A. Within the DaVita Medical Group, we mentioned during our Q2 call that we outperformed in clinical quality compared to the same period in the prior year. Our strong performance has continued and we remain on track to achieve four stars or greater for our patients within each of our major health plan relationships.","Within Kidney Care, we continue to focus on vascular access, where strong performance significantly improved survival and prevents unnecessary hospitalizations. The publically reported government data released just this October shows that we've significantly outperformed the industry in this important clinical area.","Lets now move on to the non-clinical subjects, and I'll turn it over to Javier Rodriguez.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. Since we spoke last, a lot has happened. I will cover three topics. Number one, Monday's announcement; number two, our Q3 Kidney Care performance; and number three, our outlook. So let's get started.","We hope that the release on Monday was helpful. I won't be repetitive here, but we've had a lot of questions. So let me take some. And if I miss them, please bring them up in Q&A. As a forewarning, I'll go into some technical detail because the subject matter requires it.","First, why did we announce the decision on Monday, only two days before our earning call? It's a simple answer. This is open enrollment. It started yesterday, and we needed to provide clarity to our patients and our teammates.","Second, is this is a permanent change in policy? No, we have only temporarily suspended support for applications to the American Kidney Fund for patients enrolled in minimum essential Medicaid coverage. When CMS provides guidance, which we expect will be within a couple of weeks, we will evaluate our future policy.","Third, does our announcement signify a concern over our historical practices? No. Our historical practices were legal and compliant. That said, the language in the RFI may confuse some. So I thought it would be useful to clarify further.","The RFI had primarily three concerns. One, whether patients enrolled in Medicare purchased an ACA plan that was duplicative in coverage. None of our patients who were enrolled in Medicare enrolled in the ACA plan. The regulation cited in the RFI, which referred to Medicare Supplemental Plan, is not germane to the ACA plan.","Number two, whether patients lost their Medicaid coverage as a result of purchasing an ACA plan and, therefore, were exposed to additional costs. Our patients did not lose their Medicaid coverage as a result of purchasing an ACA plan and, as a result, were not exposed to additional costs.","Consistent with CMS own education materials, we educated our patients on the ability to purchase an ACA plan while retaining Medicaid coverage as a secondary. These patients did not apply for tax credits and subsidies.","And three, whether patients experienced a disruption in continuative care as a result of purchasing an ACA plan. Just a small portion of our Medicaid patients made the choice to purchase an ACA plan. And they did so for their own personal reasons, such as to have access to specialists who do not accept Medicaid, or increased chance of qualifying for transplantation or other reasons. We're not aware of any patient experiencing a disruption in care, likely because those patients who would have had such a disruption made the choice not to enroll in an ACA plan.","Lastly, there have been some questions around comparing our disclosure of 5,000 patients versus public information from other providers. I believe that the confusion is around some definitions. When we refer to individual market plans, or ACA plans, we refer to the full universe of individual plans, whether they're sold on or off the government-run exchanges.","A distinction between these types of plans is not relevant, because both affect the same risk pools and are generally subject to the same regulations. If you're trying to compare to other providers, it is important to clarify definitions to ensure that the comparison is an apple-to-apples one.","Now, let's discuss our Q3 performance. Overall, DaVita Kidney Care had a solid quarter. We delivered adjusted operating income of $439 million. For U.S. dialysis, our normalized non-acquired growth for quarter was 4.4%, which falls within our long-term target range of 3.5% to 4.5%.","While we're on the topic of volume, we want to share that we signed an amendment to the agreement of Renal Ventures to acquire 100% interest in their dialysis centers for $360 million, which is $55 million less than previously announced purchase price. We expect the transaction will close in the first quarter of 2017.","Our revenue per treatment was up sequentially by $1.72 per treatment, primarily driven by an increase in seasonal administration of flu vaccine. Our patient care cost per treatment were up versus Q2 by $2.41 per treatment, driven by two primary factors: approximately 60% by an increase in labor and benefits costs; and 40% by an increase in facility cost.","We've seen a tightening in labor markets leading to some increase in our labor costs. In the near term, we may see these labor costs remain at higher levels. We expect that our facility cost to come down over the next couple of quarters.","Now, on to our outlook. Since we have now visibility to the end of the year, we're updating our 2016 adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.695 billion to $1.725 billion. We'll provide you with 2017 guidance on our Q4 earnings call, when we expect to have additional clarity on several variables, including open enrollment and policy changes from CMS.","Now, I'll turn the call to Vijay Kotte for DMG.","Vijay Kotte - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Javier. First, financial performance. We noted on the Q2 call that we would see accelerated non-cash amortization expense for the HCP brand during the transition to DMG, which would impact our reported operating income. This will run for 30 months at an incremental rate of slightly more than $2 million per month or $26 million on an annualized basis, beginning September 2016.","Including the impact of this accelerated amortization, operating income for the quarter was $33 million. As we look at the full year, we're narrowing our 2016 adjusted operating income guidance to a range of $115 million to $145 million. This is effectively a slight increase, as our guidance now includes the impact of the $9 million in accelerated brand amortization that was previously excluded.","A natural question is how to think about 2017. We're still in the midst of our budget process and open enrollment plays a big part in our outlook. That being said, there are some things we know. First, $40 million in rate cuts, which includes $30 million related to the Medicare model change and $10 million for Medicaid. Second, we have the $26 million of accelerated brand amortization. And third, we're continuing to make incremental investments in the business.","Despite these headwinds, the odds are that we'll be roughly flat year-over-year, but there are reasonable probabilities on either side of that. We will go into further detail regarding our expectation for 2017 on the Q4 earnings call. As we continue to look towards our long-term OI, our 2019 target remain $250 million.","Finally, I want to provide a few highlights on the operating progress we're making at DMG. With regard to claims process, without the need for manual intervention: 2015 we're 26%; and in 2016 79%. With regard to services getting electronic authorizations: 2015 was 24%; 2016 is 47%. And finally, with regard to new tuck-in clinicians: in 2015 we had 18; and in 2016 we're at 44.","Now, to Jim Hilger for some financial details on the quarter.","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Vijay. I'll first address our international operations. Our international operating income was $368 million in the quarter, which includes the gain on the deconsolidation of the APAC JV of $374 million. We're on track to meet our guidance for approximately $40 million in adjusted losses for 2016.","Our JV transaction with Khazanah and Mitsui closed on August 1st. As you will recall, Khazanah and Mitsui have each subscribed to acquire 20% share of ownership of the joint venture. At closing, each partner made their first investment tranche of $50 million in return for a 6.7% ownership in the joint venture. This joint venture has been deconsolidated from our financials. Going forward, our pro rata share of its operating income will run through equity investment income in our income statement.","As a result of this deconsolidation, we recorded a one-time non-cash gain of $374 million. We are excluding this gain when reporting our adjusted non-GAAP financial results and excluding it from our adjusted operating guidance for 2016. We look forward to continuing our growth in Asia Pacific dialysis with the help of our new partners.","Next, I'd like to talk about a few tax items. In the third quarter, we recorded an adjustment related to tax assets created through the DMG acquisition escrow provisions. This adjustment resulted in a $27 million increase in corporate G&A expense that was offset by an equal reduction in income tax expense, and thus created no change in net earnings or earnings per share. We do not expect any ongoing impact from this adjustment.","Excluding this escrow provision tax adjustment and excluding the gain from the formation of the APAC dialysis joint venture, our tax rate attributable to DaVita was 40% in the quarter and 39% year-to-date. We expect our full-year tax rate attributable to DaVita to be approximately 39% when excluding all non-GAAP items.","Next, our interest expense increased slightly in the quarter to $105 million due to an increase in the interest rate cap amortization, as well as the impact of the deconsolidation of the APAC joint venture. This higher level of interest expense reflects our go-forward run rate.","And finally, turning to our continued strong and consistent cash generation. Operating cash flow was $536 million in the third quarter and $1.92 billion for the last 12 months. We expect full-year 2016 operating cash flow to be between $1.75 billion and $1.85 billion.","Since, our last earnings release, we've repurchased 9.6 million shares for approximately $619 million. And through October, we have repurchased 13.3 million DaVita shares for approximately $868 million, which represents about 6.3% of the outstanding shares at the beginning of the year.","Approximately $881 million remains outstanding under our board repurchase authorizations.","We continue to have a strong cash balance with nearly $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments as of September 30th. While $212 million was used in October to repurchase stock and additional $360 million will be used in the coming months for the completion of the Renal Ventures acquisition, that still leaves us with over $1 billion of cash available before considering our continued strong cash generating capabilities.","As discussed at our Capital Markets Day earlier this year, we expect to generate well over $5 billion in free cash flow to use for growth and share repurchases from 2016 to 2019. Even assuming a reasonable baseline of $1.5 billion in growth spending for development CapEx and acquisitions, this leaves over $3 billion for additional growth or share repurchase.","And now, I'd like to turn it back to Kent for a few closing comments.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Jim. And I'd actually like to make several additional comments. Some will be a little bit redundant to what JR said, but it's such an important topic we think it's worthwhile in order to achieve good clarity.","Allow me eight different points, please. Number one, we fulfilled our regulatory responsibility to provide comprehensive education to our patients. This has been an industry requirement for the last 15 years to 20 years; and then, ACA was added onto that standard in longstanding process and practice.","Number two, a very small percentage of our Medicaid patients determined that an ACA plan was better for them. And Javier mentioned some of the very significant reasons why some of those plans were way better for them and\/or their families. I won't repeat the examples, but important and often beautiful improvements in care.","Number three, nonetheless, if you look at the benchmark plan, an EGHP plan, you see that total ESRD costs \u2013 meaning, dialysis and hospital-related costs, et cetera \u2013 was about 1.3% of the total medical cost. That again is, total ESRD costs in the numerator and then total medical costs for the plan in the denominator. In the ACA plans, we estimate right now that that percentage is only up to about 1.6%. And so, it is a low absolute number and it's a low increase number.","Number four, we were very sensitive to the fact that some of these patients choosing an ACA plan meant that we would be paid higher rates \u2013 commercial rates versus Medicaid rates. And, therefore, we created a very intense oversight process to make sure that we did everything possible to live up to the CMS standards around objective presentation of information and absolutely letting the patient choose.","Number five, we, nonetheless, got swept up in the current huge controversies around the sustainability of the exchanges; and you're all sensitive to the huge political forces in play on that subject.","Number six, why did dialysis and in part DaVita become a visible part of that controversy? Well, A, \u2013 letter A \u2013 we're national and so our numbers get added up nationally unlike a lot of health systems which are regional or local; B, our patients stick out. They're very high cost, very easy to identify, very discrete; C, there have been abuses by providers in other segments and perhaps some abuses even in ESRD. And so upfront, we started to be painted with that brush by some without data to support.","D, some payers did have very large year-over-year increases in dialysis expense, and it was originally assumed that this must be from the process that I described earlier. But in fact, in many, probably most instances, it was driven by other factors. For example, sometimes a plan had a differentially attractive product and would gain significant market share, literally moving from having 50% of the ESRD patients in the market to 80%, thereby guaranteeing at least a 60% increase in your cost having nothing to do with anything else other than product design.","As we all know, this has been a very dynamic period, probably the most dynamic period ever in terms of alternative product design for insurance plans; and also, people have been struck by how smart the consumers are and how much shopping and switching they do.","A second explainer in several markets is when there was a bad actor in the payer world; meaning, someone who did inappropriate steering of patients away from themselves, leaving one of their competitors with a disproportionate percentage. And, again, we're talking about 30%, 40% shifts in market share in some instances.","A third driver \u2013 out of probably a potential list of seven or eight, but I'll stop after three \u2013 is areas with relatively poor Medicaid coverage, because that would naturally mean that there is a higher probability that a Medicaid patient would find an ACA plan more attractive.","This is just to give you a sense of what kind of things actually drove a lot of those year-over-year increases for particular plans. Because, as we mentioned earlier, the aggregate reality only moved from 1.3% to 1.6%. But letter E, those high examples were taken to CMS and positioned as being reasonably representative of a broader movement. And at that point, CMS did not have the data of the 1.3% and the 1.6%.","On to number seven, of eight. CMS is now starting to realize, contrary to initial impressions, that, A, some of the numbers were misleading. That's not to say they were inaccurate if they were from a particular plan. They were just misleading. And as you start to stare at a number like a 0.3% increase \u2013 and again, this is our estimate \u2013 but as you compare that to 22% rate increases on average, you can see that we were not a material source of the problem, nor are we a material source of the solution.","Letter B, our patients made sensible choices, and we've provided lots of examples to CMS as have other providers; C, the fact that enrollment of dialysis patients within the ACA plans looks to be flat or down, even without any change in Medicaid access in 2017 and 2018 and, of course, would be down even more with any restriction on the Medicaid front.","Letter D, CMS now is starting to see some of the reasons for the dramatic disparities in year-over-year dialysis expense increases, and seeing how they have to do with product design, competition, et cetera. And lastly, E, they also have a better sense of how charitable premium assistance has been embedded in the ESRD economic and clinical ecosystem for 20 years, with a lot of guardrails and with the OIG's blessing, including blessing the aspect of provider funding.","So number eight, and final comment is, of course, the big question on everyone's mind including ours is what exactly is CMS going to decide with respect to this portfolio of decisions. And we don't know. No one knows. I think to their credit, they don't know right now, because they're continuing to absorb information; and we are incredibly grateful and respectful that they are doing that.","Moving onto DMG, just one happy announcement, and that is that Chuck Berg is joining our leadership team as Executive Chair of the DaVita Medical Group. He'll report to me in my role as CEO of the enterprise. Chuck's been on our board since 2007. He has a wealth of experience in the health plan world, including having been the very successful Executive Chair of WellCare Health Plans; and prior to that, the CEO of Oxford Health Plans, where I was his non-Executive Chair.","This experience, combined with his brain, makes him uniquely suited to help us evaluate our long-term strategic alternatives at DMG. And he will remain in our board in the meantime, and I and others look forward to working with him.","Operator, if you could please go ahead and open up the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference. Our first question is coming from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Justin, your line is now open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good evening. I guess, my first question here is just the company bought back $600 million of stock in the last four months at prices that are 15% above the current price with full knowledge of the issues out there in terms of the concerns around third-party payment for ACA coverage, right, given the potentially significant impact on earnings here, the downstream impacts of just the government taking a harder look at third-party funding in general, managed care negotiations, et cetera, potentially getting impacted.","My question is, should we take this as a sign of your comfort level with the potential downstream impacts on third-party payment changes, et cetera, one the earnings power of the business? And if so, any color you could share on why your level of comfort is that high, would be helpful?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Justin. I would not say that the reason we chose to buyback was because of any particularly distinctive level of confidence and what exactly the outcome was going to be. And certainly, if we could do it over again, we would've preferred to have waited than be buying back more now. But awfully difficult to predict things. A lot of different variables, not only with respect to the issues you mentioned, but other issues, both threats and opportunities. And, nonetheless, I would not say that we said, gosh, there is some distinctive near-term downside and we're going to go ahead and buy anyway. I wouldn't make that claim.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Then, maybe we could just talk about your commercial mix in general, given this has been a big area of focus here. If we look at the changes in the growth and in the commercial mix and if we back out these 2,000 patients, it looks like it's been flat over the last several years.","But looking ahead and just thinking about the changes, looks like from USRDS data, there hasn't really been much incidence growth in the pre-65 population over the last 10 years. And when we couple that with the aging of the baby boomers in the Medicare from kind of commercial years, there is the indication that it could put a fair amount of pressure on commercial mix over time.","So, I guess my question is, can you tell me whether this is a reasonable view? And if so, how should we think about this factor in relation to your typical kind of mid-single digit long-term growth algorithm for the dialysis?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's a very fair question, Justin. And I think if you wanted to identify other worrisome long-term trends, you would also look at improved treatment regimens for diabetics and hypertensives. And commercial patients are more likely to benefit from improved treatment regimens.","On the other hand, there's also things pushing in the other direction. We continue to be quite successful with our non-acquired growth. And some of these hard times could lead a lot more small providers to sell or even shutdown. In addition, we're very hopeful that Medicare Advantage continues to grow, because we radically prefer a customer who cares about total value; and we tend to do much better in terms of both adding value to the system and getting reimbursed for it.","In addition, as you know better than most, to the extent the mix ever starts to put too much pressure on all the independent centers, the government has the easy option of doing that which it's done three or four times before. And that's extending the MSP provision from originally zero to 12 months, then 12 months to 18 months, then 18 months to 30 months. And so, that's a safety valve that's never far away. Justin?","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes. Kent, if you can you give me one more chance. I'll just ask you like, does this mean that should we think about within the 6%, let's just call it, mid-single digit CAGR that you look for the dialysis business, this mix looks like just the \u2013 the likely pressure that's going to be on commercial mix over the next 10 years to 20 years, is this in that number or could this have a negative impact on that number in the way you're looking at it?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Fair question. I would say that at the time we did the last Capital Markets, we incorporated all variables, although that was a three-year outlook. When we refreshed our Capital Markets' outlook at the next one, it will once again incorporate everything. And while some of the stuff that you're citing is most likely not going to be economically material within the near-term, perhaps we should, for the first time in a long time, take a cut at sort of the four-year to seven-year timeframe and stare at some of the upsides and downsides, the puts and takes, not only on mix, but on cost structure, et cetera, also modality mix and some other things that can have a big impact on cash flow and return on capital. So we don't have anything distinctively thoughtful to say to you today from an analytical point of view, but that's probably a good assignment for the next Capital Markets.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Justin.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin, your line is now open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. I have a lot of questions kind of similar to that. But I guess, I appreciate all the color about the AKF change. I think that was very helpful and I think I understand those parameters. But, I guess, the question that I'm still struggling with is what the real growth rate of the company has been over the past three years in the dialysis business?","Because if I look at operating income growth over the last three years, it's been about 5% per year. But if I was to say that this $140 million was either not sustainable or one-time in nature, then I get more like a 2% type growth in the dialysis business over the past three years.","So how do we think about \u2013 and that's the low-end of what you guys think you're going to do over the next few years going forward. And when I think about the next few years versus last few years, Medicare rates have been under pressure and likely will be in the same range. So why is the right way to think about growth over the next three years not the low-end of that 2% to 7%, like what would cause you to do better than the low-end of that range, or is the low-end the right way to think about it?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Right now, I would say if you wanted to weight the probabilities between the low end, middle and top, you would find the probabilities skewed to the low-end. But it's not by a huge amount. And then, in addition of course unit volume is for us in many ways of secondary importance, with commercial mix and the nature of commercial mix of primary importance. And that number has got a lot of dynamism to it right now, as you well know. And so, at this point, we're not revising that guidance. But we do look forward to a very intense analytical discussion at the next Capital Markets about the next generation of three-year outlook.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, I guess if we look at commercial mix and take out this maybe 1% that's related to the ACA, it looks like mix has basically been flat over the last five years, maybe down a little bit, during a time when the economy is improving. So do you think that that's really reflective of what the industry has been seeing \u2013 or I know from time to time you've raised flags about potentially competitors getting aggressive on pricing.","Has there been anything where you feel like you purposely walked away from market share, because it got competitive or is that kind of how you think mix overall for the industry has looked over that time period?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Our guess is that our trajectory of commercial mix is quite similar to others, and we have not experienced any example of someone in our mind foolishly seeking to gain share through price reductions in an industry of almost pure variable cost, very sticky volume, and high likelihood of economic retaliation. So we haven't seen any of that go on. And so, our guess is that competitor performance is comparable.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just one last question. On HCP, it looks like the number of physicians and clinicians was up nicely sequentially, but we still saw a deceleration in revenue in that business from Q2 to Q3. Wanted to see what maybe was going on there, whether the increase in clinicians was a good sign about a ramp-up in revenue over the next couple quarters?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Over the long-term, you should see a positive correlation. Right now, in some cases, we were understaffed with physicians; and by adding them, we actually think we can reduce our MLR at a quantity that exceeds the incremental costs that we're adding. In other cases, we're adding because we're doing some de novos and other work where we think by adding physician capacity we're going to get more lives. It's just that there is some lag time.","So we're very sensitive to the fact that at a time when the revenue trajectory is what it is, our physician recruiting is ramping up. But the good news is that shows what an attractive place we are for physicians, that our hit rate and recruiting is very high. The concerning news for you is we're adding to cost at a time when revenues aren't going up at the same trajectory. And so, we hear you; and over time you should see the positive correlation you expect.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Is the right way to think about that as like a couple quarter lag or a year lag, how long do we think about these doctors adding to the earnings?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Unfortunately, I don't think we're good enough yet to give you an empirical answer for that. And so, I won't hazard a guess. Suffice it to say, we know you'll be watching each quarter.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","You're right. Okay. Great. Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just sticking with the topic of the day, I think there's a broader concern by some investors that potentially the AKF would be restricted more broadly from making premium support payments to historical patients that they would have been doing it for COBRA or for other factors. Can you talk about that? Do you think that is a risk and why or why not?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. It is a risk. But the two big facts on that big issue are that for private plans to do a broad prohibition of charitable premium assistance is an exceptionally heavy lift, because there are hundreds of such organizations all over the country and thousands of hospitals that like those foundations and charities and the rest.","And to try to deploy one that's focused on our patients would be discriminatory and subject to really intense lawsuits. And then separately, CMS does not have authority over the whole EGHP realm. They of course have authority over lots of other realms, but not that one. Is that responsive, Gary?","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. That's helpful. Any chance you could tell us what percentage of your commercial patients, if you know it, receive premium assistance from the AKF?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","I think at this point, we've decided that disclosing that is not in your best interests, although we'll continue to stare at that each quarter, but that's our current thinking. Of course, we incorporate all variables into our forecasts, but sometimes some of these swing factors are difficult to calibrate.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, on the same topic, I think there are some investors that believe that in fact it's illegal for the Medicaid patients to have been given premium support. Can you just talk about that and your understanding. I assume from your perspective, it's not illegal. Can you just help us think through that?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Sure. I appreciate you bringing it up, because we certainly heard the concern. And on this, the very explicit references by CMS to how it is legal are multiple and really clear. And the RFI referred to a part of the statutes that didn't apply to the subject at hand, so was literally not germane to the critical questions that you and others are worried about.","And so, we have continued to point to the very explicit language supporting our position. We have been in meetings with senior CMS officials and referred to the fact that it's very clearly legal, and have never run into a single objection from anyone.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. That's very helpful.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Gary, let me add one other thing, Gary, that might help clear it up. It is the case that Medicaid patients cannot have federal subsidies. And so, it's not that there aren't some rules that apply, but it is very clear that there was a conscious decision made to allow Medicaid patients to make the choices that we made available to them.","And I'll even add one other element. Back when the Affordable Care Act was being rolled out, we were encouraged by the administration to promote exchange products. We were even asked to put up signs in our centers promoting the ACA plans. Now, of course, it's four years later and a lot of things have changed, but that's the actual historical context.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. That's very helpful. And then, Jim, can you just remind us at what point you would've been restricted from purchasing your stock after the end of the quarter?","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","Well, we typically are in a restriction period near the very end of the quarter, and we would be restricted throughout the period of time after the quarter ended, until through this call.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. But I thought you guys did in fact purchase some stock after the end of the quarter?","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. We did, and that was subject to a plan...","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","...that we've put in place before we were blacked out.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So you had a 10b-5 in place before it was blacked out?","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","That's correct.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys. Just wanted to again come back to the AKF issue. Obviously, you're pointing at $140 million of OI this year as in that being the potential headwind for next year. But can you give us a sense for how that ramped during the first two years of the coverage expansions? Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","How the $140 million ramped up?","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. Like, what was the exposure in 2014, and then in 2015, and now you're at a $140 million for this year in roughly 2,000-ish patients?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay. I know we didn't calculate that number prior to the call, why don't \u2013 the people around the table here will see if we can and should generate that and share it before the call is over, but we don't have it at our finger tips.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then, sort of another qualitative type question here on the AKF issue. But obviously getting to some of the \u2013 at least what's been sort of suggested from the managed care side is that by shifting some of these people from, call it, a 100% Medicaid to sort of Medicaid as a supplemental, there may have been some out-of-pocket exposure here.","I guess, when you new guys did you look back and reviewed the 2,000 or whatever that may have been in 2015 and 2014, what did you do? I guess, I'm just trying to get some comfort here that you guys feel pretty comfortable that in no material way were the individuals harmed financially? Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","I'll take a first stab, and then other people may want to add on. First of all, we dedicated a huge amount of time in developing materials and training our people, and so that historic discipline of presenting objectively was on steroids for this process. And we present very complete information that encompasses premiums, deductibles, co-pays, out-of-pocket stuff, potential federal tax credits, potential charitable premium assistance, individual versus family, high income versus low. And so, we're thorough and it's presented to the patients in ways that leaves most of them exceptionally grateful for the help and the clarity; and then, they chose.","So one can never say that theoretically you couldn't have a patient chose something that was foolish. I'm sure, out of 2,000 patients there were some, but we have to respect the fact that it's their choice. In general, however, just as we've seen in the exchanges over the last three years or four years, the average patient demonstrates a lot of economic common sense in how they move around between different products, particularly when they're helped.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","And, Chris, this is Javier. I'll just add one important point is that they never lose their Medicaid. Medicaid was in a secondary position. So the patients actually didn't incur additional costs.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay, okay. And then, just one last one here on Kidney Care operating income for next year. You made reference in the Monday press release that there could be some theoretical offsets to the $140 million. If there are, can you give us a sense for what they are? And then, just can you just give us some general sort of headwinds and tailwinds beyond the AKF issue? Thanks a lot.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Well, first of all, on mitigation, we'll be able to do a good job on that the next quarterly call if we're in the scenario where that's the topic of the day. Separate from that, and then someone else may want to add, I mean on the plus side we have a wonderful recurring unit growth. We have the potential accelerator of continued Medicare Advantage growth.","On the cost structure side, we have the opportunities in the ESA area. And on the capital deployment side, we have the opportunity for more small operators feeling a need to get out of this evermore complicated and challenging business. On the headwind side, I think, we've laid them out with painful detail already, and so I won't list them again.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks a lot.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Chris.","Operator","Our next question is coming from John Ransom of Raymond James. John, your line is now open.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. I did one day of law school and ran out in horror, so my pea brain isn't wired to understand all these fine points. But to make it simple, one of your competitors said that the no-no in their opinion was to switch people off of Medicaid, but the ambiguity was when a new patient came in, eligible for both Medicaid and an ACA plan, that's where you could present both. Is what you're doing just sort of in line with that that new patients come in are fair game, they don't have insurance, but existing patients on Medicaid you're no longer going to try to switch them. I know I'm oversimplifying, but is that a helpful way to think about it or no?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.","Hey, it's LeAnne. I think you're confusing two things. So let's talk about \u2013 patients who signed up for ACA coverage made that choice and retained their Medicaid in the secondary. I think that answers the first question. We're not substituting ACA coverage for Medicaid. If they're keeping them, they're having both of them and it's not subsidized by federal tax credits.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Does that answer just the first half of your question, John?","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Well, not really, but I'll follow up. There are so many crosscurrents here, I don't want to drag this out on the call. And what about the second scenario where a patient comes in without any \u2013 maybe they are eligible for Medicaid, but they just never signed up. How does that work? And is that something \u2013 again, your competitor said we expect CMS to clarify the rules on that patient B that comes in without any insurance at all. Is that a useful way or again was that a misleading comment by one of your competitors?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.","No. I think we do have patients that come to us that are uninsured. And our education and process with those patients would be to find out all the avenues to which they could purchase coverage, whether they be Medicare or Medicaid, a commercial plan, an ACA plan, et cetera. So our counselor's job is to make sure that each of the avenues is presented to that patient, and then the patient chooses what is best for them in their particular circumstance.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. LeAnne, hadn't heard from you a while, so it's good to hear your voice. The second question I had was, I mean, obviously in some of the comments \u2013 there were allegedly comments from either current or former DaVita employees who talked about being pressured to sign people up on commercial plans. So I'm sure you solved that stuff. Just internally, what kind of controls do you have in place to investigate those kinds of comments? And what's your general view on that true, not true, out of context or \u2013 that'd be helpful?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","John, thank you. This is Javier. First of all, I would like to highlight that the numbers are small. But, of course, regardless of the size of the numbers, we take each and everyone very seriously. We did some huge, huge oversight here. We had to train a lot of people in a very short amount of time. And so, we had heavy oversight and for a small number of people, they might have experienced that as negative.","What we do is, of course, if we have any concerns, we give it to a third-party, we give it to our compliance department and they looking to it, and we rectify if there are any mistakes. But the bulk of what we've looked into has now materialized. And actually, when we've gone into some sessions, we've literally asked for evidence to be provided of our wrongdoing and \u2013 alleged wrongdoing and we've never have been given any specifics, because, of course, we would want to correct any mistakes if they were brought to our attention.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That's great. And then let's switch gears, and two more quick ones. Let's say, we are in a scenario of a little more austerity on a number of fronts. I mean, there is obviously a big gap between your total CapEx and your maintenance CapEx. In a more austere scenario, and I'll just make up a number, let's say, revenue per treatment is $340 to $345 for a bunch of reasons, how should we think about the likely reaction of the company? What levers would be likely to be pulled? And, again, CapEx is one that \u2013 would appear to be one where you have a lot of this discretion over?","And, again, I asked this because there is a debate on the Street about should we look at DaVita on earnings per share or we should look at it on free cash flow? And free cash flow requires the assumption that CapEx is closer to maintenance than it is to actual?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. We hear you. The answer right now would be fairly generic. I mean, in a world where we would suffer some serious revenue compression we would do what any responsible business person should do, and very systematically go through every line item on the P&L and every aspect of cash in and cash out.","And we would enter into that process with the expectation that we would find some savings in the P&L side, and we would find some reductions on the CapEx side. And at the same time, we haven't quantified those, but we certainly do have some serious ranges of discretion.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Was the reduction in price for Renal Ventures driven by the new thinking around ACA plans or was it something else?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","No. It was something else. There is a part of the transaction that was contemplated at the beginning. And after further dialogue, we are not going to acquire their infusion business. So that's why the price was changed.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I see. You still think you might get that done. I know it's been dragging on for over a year, is that still to be done by the end of the year. Or maybe you never said, but that's our assumption. Is that a reasonable assumption?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","No. There is some chance of Q4. But if you were betting, I would probably go with Q1, because there is some regulatory stuff going on. So I think Q1 is...","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","18 months, is that a record? I will think 18 months might be a record.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","It is. It's a new record for us anyway.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And lastly, just thinking about potential good guys, ESA costs. Do you have a view of \u2013 you've got your current contract with Amgen obviously. But if you do a market check on what other folks are now paying for ESAs, what's your view on your kind of apples-to-apples costs versus what's currently \u2013 if you were free of that contract, would that be a good guy that could be called out? Thanks. And I'll stop there.","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, it's LeAnne again. I think you have to put it into two buckets. Obviously, I think the public announcement by FMC as to their cost reductions associated with their using Mircera gives you one category. So clearly, I think they are enjoying their prices better than the rest of the marketplace.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got you.","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.","Then you take the rest of the marketplace that's on Amgen products. And I think there was a lot of buzz about the move to Aranesp lowered the independent and small providers cost. Well, that's correct. It did. But that's a relative lowering and our ESA cost has been historically the best. And I think that holds true. And so, if you want to ask it again in a different way, but I think that should give you the answer you're looking for.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, in short, probably unless somebody opens up that contract, it's probably reasonable to assume not much movement on that line item through the terms of the contract?","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","I don't know if that's necessarily the right conclusion. Of course, when you enter into a long-term contract, both parties will look into it as things change. Amgen, of course, is interested in seeing that we are a customer post-contract renewal, and we want to be talking to all the parties that are out there. And so, what we're trying to make sure is that we have the right term solution for the long haul. So we're looking at this. You seldom get a chance to look at an $800 million cost line. And so, we are very eager in deploying the right level of rigor and resources to make sure that we get the right relationship going forward post-2018.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks so much.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, John.","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","And I've got an answer for the question that Chris brought up, which is sort of this $140 million, how did it build over time. It won't be very precise, but it will give you directionally what you're seeking. And that is that the bulk of the growth came in 2015 and 2016. 2014, it was a small number, if we had to estimate in the $20 million or so range. In 2015, the range is probably somewhere in the \u2013 I don't know, double that, give or take. We don't have very precise numbers, but we just wanted to give you directionally that the bulk of it was in 2016, with some growth in 2015.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay operator.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Gary, your line is now open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good evening. Just a couple of things. Given some of the reports that some of the health plans have already attempted to identify patients with AKF subsidies and even potentially terminate some of the contracts, I just wanted to check in on commercial mix. I know you disclose it annually, not quarterly. But I do think last quarter you did acknowledge that it was still trending higher year-over-year. So I wanted to see if that was still true for 3Q 2016 versus 3Q 2015?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","I'm sorry. Gary, your question is commercial mix, what period to what period?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Q3...","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just year-over-year in the third quarter, is it still trending higher year-over-year in the third quarter?","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","It is. It is up year-on-year, Gary.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And sequentially probably hasn't done a lot, is that fair?","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","We've seen it go down slightly in the last quarter.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then back to Renal Ventures, is that still ballpark, 2,300 patients to 2,400 patients and then anticipating some divestitures, is that still ballpark?","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","Yes.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. And then, I just want to go to the patient care costs, which you called out. And I think you talked about 60% labor, 40% facility cost, but that was in the context of the couple dollar sequential change given that ESRD OI was down year-over-year and the cost jumped about $6 year-over-year. Would that still be the same ratio if I look at the year-over-year that more than half of that's labor and the rest is facility costs?","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","Yes.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And when you say facility cost, you said it was coming down, what exactly is driving that up temporarily?","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","It was a bunch of miscellaneous line items, none of them particularly stick out. So it would just be giving you a very long list, and it just cumulatively added up to something this time. And so, we're working on it.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Last question. I believe you were talking about HCP's OI potentially being flat into 2017 and you made no comments on consolidated or Kidney and I just wanted to confirm that that was correct?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. That's correct. We'll be providing guidance on 2017 in the next quarterly call for U.S. Kidney Care.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Whit Mayo of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Hey, thanks. I'll try to keep it quick, but maybe one more on the AKF. It doesn't appear that you implemented this exchange initiative until 2015 at least according to the RFI submission. So, one, just looking to confirm that? And the ACA obviously was implemented in 2014 and you knew about it many years prior. So was there something that made you apprehensive about pursuing this strategy with patients and why perhaps it wasn't implemented in 2013 or 2014 open enrollment? Just looking for any additional color.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","There was no conscious delay on our part.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, maybe just one last one with the MA STAR ratings published. How would you characterize how your health plan partners are positioned next year? And what do you think this means for DMG, and maybe the conclusion when you look at scores like Humana's?","Vijay Kotte - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. This is Vijay. Just to be clear, the 2017 numbers are already fixed, right. So we don't see much of a change between 2016 and 2017. The Humana numbers were for payment year of 2018. And the only place where we saw a potential drop was in one market. And as you know, the STAR scores are related to a number of factors, but our clinical quality was that of four star and above. And we believe that in partnering with our health plans there are some administrative opportunities to help neutralize some of the impact of the potential hit for 2018 for Humana in that one market.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Well, that's it. We're past the hour mark. Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Well, feel free to ask another question if you'd like.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","No. I'm good, Kent. Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Patrick Wood of Citi. Your line is now open.","Patrick Wood - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Perfect. Thank you very much for agreeing to squeeze me in at the end. I'll be very quick, and this should be fairly yes or no sort of small questions. I have three, if I may. The first would be, I was very interested to hear about the apples-to-apples comparison in terms of patient numbers in relation to the CMS RFI submission. I'd be curious to hear what you guys think is an apples-to-apples number vis-\u00e0-vis what your competitors submitted, I'd be very curious to hear that?","Equally, second question would be, when I backed off from your operating income sort of impact, you guys currently gave us the $140 million, I get to about $715 or so revenue implied per treatment for the exchange funds. Is that a fair kind of back out or is there other noise in that that means that revenue per treatment number that I got it wrong somehow? And then, finally, I'd be very curious to hear of your commercial business, what percentage do you guys feel is out-of-network, would be very helpful? Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","So let me tackle number one and number three, and then someone else can take a stab at number two. On out-of-network, we don't disclose exact percentages, but we've successfully dramatically reduced that number over the last five years. And strategically and from a relationship point of view, we much prefer to be in network. And at the same time, of course, the peers got to make a reasonable offer for that tradeoff. And so, that's the answer on out-of-network.","On the patient count issue, the apples-to-apples issue, all we know is our number and our definition \u2013 and we provided we think the right definition for you to be able to assess the economics associated with this issue. And then if other competitors slice and dice it in different ways, we can't really opine on that. You'll have to really talk to them about why they think it's the right way to do that. Hopefully, we're pretty clear about why we think batching on and off exchanges is the right way to look at it for our shareholders at least.","And then, on the second one, can somebody?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. On the implied revenue per treatment, you're about right. And, of course, there is discrepancies geographically, and by payer, and product mix, et cetera. But yes, you are in the ZIP code.","Patrick Wood - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","That's absolutely fantastic. Thank you very much for your help, guys.","Operator","Our last question is coming from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Justin, your line is now open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks for letting me back in for one more. I wanted to touch on the \u2013 I think the people are trying to figure out the other $90 million of potential pressure here. And so, I just wanted to walk through, is there any way to think about where those patients came from? Specifically, you've got 3,000 patients that are on ACA, about half of them are getting AKF assistance.","I assume it's a lot less likely that CMS does something to stop people who came to you with commercial to keep what they have, or having AKF help them keep what they have, versus maybe those that come to you uninsured and are just waiting for the three-month Medicare period maybe CMS steps in on that. Is there some way to think about that $90 million and how to think about the risk and maybe break it down to those two pools, keep what you have versus uninsured?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Let me take a little bit of a stab here, Justin, but I'm not sure if we're going to be able to give you what you want. In total, there is kind of three buckets. There is the Medicaid bucket, which of course is getting a huge amount of attention and discussion. Then there are the uninsured, but that label is kind of misleading, because a very significant number of them came from state high-risk plans that shut down as part of the Affordable Care Act.","So while they didn't have classic insurance, they were funded. And they were typically funded at rates more like commercial than Medicare or Medicaid. And so, for the system, there is no increase in cost from their emergence in the second bucket of ACA plans.","And then the third bucket, which is substantial, our people who are on private plans before ACA existed, they had individual health insurance plans. And once ACA was there, they switched over. And so, these are people who've been buying insurance in the same way that everyone on this call buys insurance, only they're doing it individually as opposed to their employer. So those are the three buckets. And then within that second bucket, there are some subsets. But at some point, continued parsing and get to pretty small numbers.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So maybe I'll just ask the question this way and jump off. There are people that are going to come to you that are uninsured that can qualify for Medicare after three months. If I were thinking about the potential risk bucket here, that would be the one where potentially now you're signing up for ACA plans, where before they would just have to wait three months uninsured and get Medicare. Is there any way to think just about how CMS \u2013 could CMS address that, or effectively they're uninsured and they can buy an ACA plan like anybody else. So how do you stop it?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. I mean, just looked around the table. I don't have an answer to that. Does anybody?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.","Well, Justin, if I understand you correctly, I think what we're having a little disconnect in the room is, we have a population that does not qualify for Medicare or Medicaid because they haven't worked in a requisite number of quarters; or even if you are here and working through the Visa process, you have to wait five years before you're eligible for Medicare. So, I think, there is a genuine population when we discuss, but that cannot access the government coverage. Does that explain it for you?","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. So you're saying there is not really much of this 3,000 population that just had to wait three months for Medicare before and is now getting ACA?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Right.

My name is Debbie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference.","Jim Gustafson","Thank you and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President; and Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer.","Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties please refer to our fourth quarter earnings press release and our SEC filing, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.","Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Javier Rodriguez.","Javier Rodriguez","Thank you, Jim and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in DaVita and look forward to your questions and comments. I will start with clinical highlights as a reminder of life-sustaining care that we provide to more than 235,000 people. While we discuss clinical outcomes and lowering the total cost of care, our goal is to improve our patient's quality of life.","One specific example has been to focus on reducing infections in our patients. DaVita's patient's are prone to infection which can often lead to lengthy hospitalization days and increase in mortality. I\u2019m excited to report their efforts have paid off. In 2019, we reduce the rate of bloodstream infection by 13% and improved the rate of peritonitis by 20% versus the prior year. This is a meaningful improvement that kept many of our patients out of the hospital.","Now let me transition to our results and outlook for 2020. We had a strong performance in 2019. We met earnings per share and free cash flow growth target we set for the year. We are committed to achieving our 2020 financial guidance and in fact we are raising our earnings-per-share target range by $0.50. Joe will provide the financial details on both the quarter and our 2020 guidance.","Now let me pull up for a few minutes to share our high level views on clinical and on policy. We are in an exciting time for kidney care. We are bridging the transition of care from the nephrologist's office to different types of care. We are working with our payers to use predictive analytics to identify CKD patients with the highest risk of transitioned to ESRD. Once we support these patients, we will work on avoiding or delaying the onset of kidney failure.","We remain excited about nephrology care lines, the new physician led entity with nearly 1,100 nephrologists that will be the vehicle to connect DaVita to the nephrologists practice. The goal is simple. Provide world-class analytics and education to help physicians best deploy their time to care for the right person at the right time.","For those patients who do transition to ESRD with both a leading education platform to empower patients to choose to start on the right treatment modality or for them. For patients who chose home modality, we continue to invest in our leading home platform where we serve the most home patients of any provider. In 2019, we saw our high -- our highest growth ever in PD modality. We are working to maintain our leadership in the home dialysis with a 2020 goal of achieving double-digit growth in the PD modality.","Moving on to policy. We continue our multi-year journey towards integrated care. We are encouraged by the quality improvement that are evident in our demonstration such as the ESCO. We are hopeful that there will be additional models and opportunities to scale integrated care for ESRD patients at national levels. We remain optimistic about the administration's view for value-based care models. We believe that the capabilities that we\u2019ve built will support our collective goal to improve clinical outcomes, while managing total cost.","There has been a lot of recent conversation about Medicare advantage and the 21st Century Cures Act. We would remind everyone that Congress pass this legislation with the intent of making additional insurance options available to Medicare eligible patient, ESRD patient.","With respect to expectations of adoption, no one really know what choices will be made by the patient. We continue to believe that the selection into MA will be more gradual. We look forward to working with plan partners to manage the care and the cost of these patient. In parallel, our advocacy efforts are focused on ensuring adequate funding in both Medicare fee-for-service and MA. And as we\u2019ve said before, we remain ready and eager to advance integrated care for Medicare fee-for-service population.","Shifting to state policy. We will keep advocating for our patients in California and other states where some labor unions are pursuing policies that are not good for patients, costs or the care delivery system.","Now let me transfer it on to Joe, so he will provide additional details on the quarter and specific on 2020 guidance.","Joel Ackerman","Thanks, Javier. Before I begin, I would like to point out that we\u2019ve adjusted the first section of the press release this quarter. We hope this format will give investors easier access to some of the most important results that have historically appeared later in the release.","Now I will start with Q4 results and then move to 2020 guidance. We generated $2.9 billion of revenue in the quarter, an increase of 2.75% over Q4 2018. Our operating income was $463 million, which included approximately $67 million in profit related to calcimimetics, resulting in an operating margin of 16%.Earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.86.","Now let me take through some of the underlying drivers, starting with the components of the U.S dialysis and lab segment. Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 2.1%, relatively flat with the prior two quarters. Revenue per treatment was down sequentially by $1.10, which includes a $1.68 per treatment decrease in revenue attributable to calcimimetics. Excluding calcimimetics, RPT was up by $0.58%.","To recap performance for the full-year 2019 versus guidance, to exclude the impact of calcimimetics, we finished at the high-end of our RPT guidance range of 0% to 1%. We sell outside of the very narrow range that we provided on commercial mix and ended 2019 with a year-over-year decrease of approximately 20 basis points. Although this decline did not have a meaningful impact on our revenue per treatment.","Combined patient care costs and dialysis and lab segment, G&A expense was down approximately $2 per treatment quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by lower compensation and benefits costs.","Turning to calcimimetics. We generated operating income of approximately $67 million in the fourth quarter and revenue per treatment and cost per treatment of $12.86 and $4.19, respectively. For the full-year, we generated approximately $220 million in operating income as we negotiated significant cost decreases on oral calcimimetics.","For 2020, we now expect approximately $40 million to $70 million of operating income from calcimimetics with approximately half of this to be realized in the first quarter as we expect ASP reimbursement to decline in subsequent quarters. With that said, there are still significant uncertainty around this outlook given the complexity in the ASP methodology.","Now turning to international. For the quarter, operating income was approximately $2 million including an FX loss of $4 million. For the full-year, we generated positive adjusted operating income of $2 million, excluding goodwill impairments and including an FX loss of $2 million. Our effective tax rate on adjusted income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations for the quarter was 25.2% and was 27.5% for the full-year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and the full-year benefited from a decrease in our estimated state tax rate.","Now on to cash flow. The full-year 2019 operating cash flow from continuing operations with $2 billion and our free cash flow was $1.1 billion. Both operating cash flow and free cash flow were positively impacted by significant improvements in our DSOs and unusually low cash taxes in 2019. These two factors combined to improve cash flow during the year by approximately $300 million. We do not expect these to recur in 2020.","CapEx for the year was $728 million, slightly below the revised guidance range of $740 million to $780 million and well below our initial guidance from the year of $800 million to $840 million. The better results in Q4 was due to the timing of certain project that were pushed into 2020.","Since October 1, 2019, we purchased almost 8.7 million shares at an average amount of $64.80 per share. As a result of our recent repurchases, we reduced our share count by approximately 41.3 million shares or 24.8% since the close of the DMG transaction in June 2019.","This week we expect to complete our repricing of our $2.7 billion term loan B that will reduce the interest rate on this tranche of debt by 50 basis points. We now expect our debt expense to be approximately $90 million in Q1 2020 and then approximately $85 million per quarter in the subsequent quarters.","I will conclude with some comments on our guidance ranges for 2020. We're updating our 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.50 per share to $5.75 to $6.25. As a reminder, this includes the expected benefits from calcimimetics as well as the expected cost of ballot initiative in California. Due to the timing of calcimimetics that I mentioned and the expected timing of ballot related costs in the second half of the year, we expect some fluctuations in earnings per share between quarters this year.","Our revenue guidance for the year is $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion and our operating income margin guidance is consistent with the target range of 13% to 14% that we talked about at our Capital Markets Day. We expect to generate approximately $600 million to $800 million of free cash flow this year.","I will point out that cash flow is inherently subject to greater swing than its operating income due to the time of working capital and other items such as the timing of payroll cycle, tax payments and inter-period changes in the collections of AR. This worked in our favor in 2019 and could swing the other way at some point in the future.","Operator, let's now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to go through a couple of moving parts here. First, in terms of the higher EPS range year-over-year. Is it fair to think about it as two-thirds coming from calcimimetics benefit that wasn\u2019t in numbers before. Maybe the rest coming from lower debt costs, or maybe you could tell us any kind of moving part -- other moving parts including California kind of delaying implementation of the legislation out there on the ACAS?","Joel Ackerman","Sure. So, Justin, you\u2019ve got the basics right. Calcimimetics is the biggest component of this. And a decrease in the -- in our expected cost for AB 290 plays into this as well. Those are the two big things I'd call out. There are a lot of other moving pieces in here. Our share count moves around as the stock price goes up and a whole bunch of other things related to core OI. But I would say, calcimimetics in the AB 290 are the two big things to call out.","Justin Lake","Great. Maybe you can just give us an update on -- is there any change in terms of the sustainability of calcimimetics in your mind beyond 2020, or do you still expect that to migrate down to kind of neutral? And then, do you have a new AB 290 number for us? I think the old one was 25 to 40.","Joel Ackerman","Sure. So on calcimimetics, we still expect under the current TDAPA that it will migrate down to zero over the course of 2020. We have been -- we -- as you can see, we've not been able to predict how ASP would come down. The positive numbers for 2020 is the result of ASP not coming down the way we expected it would three months ago. I don't know that our visibility on how the rest of the industry has behaved combined with some of the black box natures of ASP have improved, but we do think this has to get down pretty close to zero by the end of the year. In terms of AB 290, we don't have a new number. Clearly the number will be smaller. That said, there will be some legal costs associated with AB 290 and there certainly is the possibility that it gets implemented towards the end of the year. So the numbers are getting to a size where I don't think it's worth calling out a specific number, but clearly below the 25 to 40.","Justin Lake","Okay. Just one last follow-up before I jump back in the queue. The calcimimetics, is it fair to say here that you think costs have come down to a kind of normal range, and we just need to track the ASP and so it falls [ph] to that $4 number kind of [multiple speakers]?","Joel Ackerman","Yes, I\u2019m not saying cost couldn\u2019t continue to drift down a little bit, but the real action for 2020 is on the trajectory of ASP.","Justin Lake","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question will come from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Wanted to ask a little bit about this year's guidance kind of in the context of your 2022 guidance, because it looks like you\u2019re kind of there in a lot of your metrics, I guess at the midpoint [indiscernible] for 2% revenue growth per year. So I guess just wanted to understand that jumping point off. Is that still the right point, or are there things in here that now maybe there is a different way to think about the long-term trajectory. And I guess, trying to think about this year's guidance versus the '22 number, I guess the '22 number is going to have a headwind of calcimimetics coming out. And then, I guess your guidance still assumes that AB90 goes into place. Just wanted to make sure that that's one thing we have to figure out if we are trying to [multiple speakers]?","Joel Ackerman","Yes. So you're spot on both those factors of calcimimetics coming out of here and AB 290 going into place. In terms of some of the other things I've call out, on the cash flow number, 2019 was surprisingly high and we called out in the script two of the factors, which are the DSOs having come down as well as cash taxes. I'd also note cash flow was helped by calcimimetics as well and the impact that had on OI. So that happened faster than expected. We also benefited to some extent in the year by some of the CapEx we're expecting late in the year getting pushed into 2020. So the 2020 number might get impacted by that to the negative. There is certainly the possibility that at the end of 2020 we will see some push into 2021 and that could flip either way. The one other thing I'd call out is the margins. We spoke about margins of 13% to 14%. We are not changing that view of the world, and so as you think about what the margins could be in 2022, I'd stick with that number.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. That's helpful. And then I appreciate the preliminary comments on MA. But I guess, it sounds like some of the managed care companies are starting to worry this is going to be an issue for them in into 2021. So I was wondering if you could talk about your conversations that you\u2019re having with your MA companies? Is there pushback on rates or anything that you would kind of highlight there that could impact the or change the impact it's going to have on you over the next few years?","Javier Rodriguez","Thanks, Kevin. This is Javier. We've gotten a fair amount of questions on MA. And so I think it's useful to just pull up a little and revisit the origin of it. Number one, this is the only patient population, the ESRD population that was excluded from having the right to pick MA. And so it was fixing a deficiency in the system. Number two, what is our role going forward? And our role is to just make sure that our patients are well informed so they can make the best decision individually. Point number three is everybody is trying to size it and when you try size something like this, there's two variables, of course, one is rate and the other one is volume. And so what we\u2019ve said is that our rate is above Medicare, but substantially below commercial. We are not going to give anymore on that variable. The one that\u2019s most sort of undecided at this juncture is the pickup of the volume and all of you know the same as we do, which is there's a lot of variables at play when individual has the primary insurance, the secondary insurance, do they have Medigap coverage etcetera. So we continue to think that it\u2019s reasonable to think that penetration will reflect the overall market. In addition, many people believe that our patients will have sort of a quick trigger to pick an insurance when there's so many complicated variables and they have many of them been in Medicare for quite some time status quo might just keep going. So we're literally asking how will our patients interpret their benefit, and so we don't know and so many people are continuing to size that it's going to be some kind of an aggressive movement and we continue to think that it'll be more gradual.","Kevin Fischbeck","I guess that's definitely helpful. I guess, two thoughts on that. Is there anything that you would think of as you think about that rate differential that you currently get that makes you think that whatever reason it wouldn't be sustainable? I guess, obviously by any standard measure, you just want to bring that delta down over time, but is there any reason why you think that could be the case or -- but maybe you could keep those economics that maybe change the way that you actually contract with managed care, take more risk things like that?","Joel Ackerman","Yes. I would think it as an opportunity for us to expand the way we talk to our contract and to our payer providers. It's an exciting time where we're all aligned in trying to make sure that we have integrated care for our patients, and so we're leaning in and trying to see how we can best serve them and be a partner. And if they think that the MA volume is going to be higher than us that might also be an opportunity to contract in that way. So we're excited. Obviously, they want lower rates. We would like higher rates and that dance is never going to change. And then the question is can we all get creative when coming up on a win-win situation.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And then I guess to your point about the shift into MA, point well taken that inertia tends to be the way people tend to act when it comes to health insurance, because it's kind of daunting to shift for that, but I would assume that the fact that you\u2019re able to meet with these people three times a [technical difficulty] what the options are would potentially change that dynamic and where we do our analysis in the 20 states where MedSup isn't available for people under 65 in an affordable way, then I would think that adoption will be quite large. The question ends up being so that where in those states where it is available, is there a rationale for those patients to switch from a MedSup plan into an MA plan? And then similarly in a -- for a dual eligible populations, which is 40% of your Medicare book. Is there an incentive for those patients to move? And why would either of those classes see the benefit of an MA plan?","Javier Rodriguez","Yes, the first premise that you discussed, which is access to the patient is worth exploring because you might be more talented than us that when you talk to people about their insurance, it's not usually like Netflix or anything. They don't want to keep watching the next episode. People usually start to glaze over a bit and say when you talk about deductibles, when you talk about coinsurance, when you talk about those kind of thing, it is not normal vernacular for most of these folks. And they\u2019ve been on Medicare for some time and it works for them. And so then you got to start to explain that maybe it's more restrictive, maybe they can't see their doctor, but it's got other benefits and you get into it and then you can see that some people just tune out. And so the question is, is it our obligation to go back at them? And the answer I think is no, because you\u2019re satisfied with the insurance. We just have to make sure that you have a new option. And so on all these -- on the dual sometimes that could actually have very little out of pocket and so you might not want to switch that situation. So it is very specific to each individual, but again the net of it is that we think we are not going to look very different than the overall population, but there is the range that we're all playing with.","Kevin Fischbeck","And just last question. Is there a time period when you feel like you will know how that shift is going? Will you know during the open enrollment period in Q4, or do you actually have to wait till January for the patient claims actually start coming in under the new payers?","Javier Rodriguez","Well, I think we\u2019re going to have to wait till January. We will have some preliminary stuff, but unlikely that we're going to want to predict how that'll play until we see it since it's the first time we're experiencing it.","Kevin Fischbeck","Right. Great. Thank you.","Javier Rodriguez","Thank you, Kevin.","Operator","The next question will come from Pito Chickering. Your line is now open -- with Deutsche Bank.","Pito Chickering","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. A few ones here. On the 2020 revenue guidance, what are you guys assuming in terms of organic treatment growth and revenue per treatment? And how does the commercial reimbursement look for 2020?","Javier Rodriguez","Sure. So, hey, on NAV we\u2019ve -- we are guiding to 1.5% to 2.5%. In terms of revenue per treatment we are not going to guide to RPT anymore in the level of specificity we have in the past. That said, I think it's safe to say going forward that it'll look similar to what it looked like in the recent past. The same dynamic in terms of commercial RPT, Medicare RPT and mix should play out next year the way they have in the recent two years. The one big change obviously is on Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement. We got that in '19 and we see that continuing forward. So, again, as we think about the how we want to guide and this is consistent with what we\u2019ve raised at Capital Markets Day, more of a focus on margin than on any of the individual inputs. That said, if you think about the inputs of RPT and the subcomponents there as well as cost per treatment and the other things we don't see anything particularly different next year to call out than what we've seen in the recent past.","Pito Chickering","Great. And then on the 2020 margin guidance, let me ask this a different way. If we exclude calcimimetics for 2020, the operating income margin is I think 12.5%. If we exclude $47 million of calcimimetics for 2020, it looks as though you\u2019re guiding to about 50 basis points improvement in 2020 versus 2019? First quarter '18 was a very easy comp, so if you exclude calcimimetics for 2019 and 2020, and easy comp of first quarter '19, how should we think about core operating income margin in 2020 versus 2019?","Joel Ackerman","Okay. Pito, you lost me there on your math, but I will tell you the way I think about my math and I apologize if this doesn't kick in tight to what you asked, but you can follow with Jim afterwards. So for adjusted normalized numbers, so this excludes calcimimetics, we came in just north of 14% in 2019. We expect that -- and again, we are not guiding to OI. So we -- again, we said that calcimimetics -- at Capital Markets Day we are sticking with that. That said, either through a top-down analysis using revenue and our margin guidance or bottoms up through EPS, you can all do the math and come up with a range. So, I\u2019m going to give some high-level thoughts relative to what\u2019s probably the middle of the range of what you should be thinking about, which should show you a little bit of margin compression in 2020 versus 2019, although still very much in that 13% to 14% range we talked about at Capital Markets Day. And if I have to point out what is driving that, you got a little bit of AB 290 in there. You've got the continued pressure on labor costs associated with the strong environment we are in and we are also looking at making some investments in the form of operating costs, investing in our future around things like home, things like integrated kidney care, things like data and analytics. So if you put those -- all those things together, you would come up with a little bit of margin pressure in 2020 over 2019, but still very much in the range of what we talked about at Capital Markets. Is that helpful?","Pito Chickering","Yes, very much. So which actually sort of the last question. At the Analyst Day you talked about capital -- capital growth with CapEx coming down to 615 in 2022. And you sort of -- you just mentioned sort of kidney start home based programs. Can you quantify how many of your centers have separate home treatments options today and how many are freestanding home centers as well?","Joel Ackerman","I don\u2019t know the answer to that.","Javier Rodriguez","We will follow-up on it.","Joel Ackerman","We can follow-up with you on that, Pito.","Pito Chickering","Great. Thanks so much, guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question will come from Andrew Mark [ph] with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Good afternoon. Just wanted to follow-up on the 2020 guidance components given all the moving parts. You raised EPS guidance by $0.50. It sounds like that increase is largely accounted for by the benefit from calcimimetics and the reversal of AB 290. So is it fair to say that the underlying assumptions on share repurchase remain the same given the $2.4 billion of share repurchase you did in 2019 combined with the nice volume of stock price in the last few months? How should we think about the size and cadence of share repurchase in 2020?","Javier Rodriguez","Sure. So the fundamentals of our share repurchase philosophy haven\u2019t changed in terms of focusing on intrinsic value and ensuring we are not buying at what we believe -- above what we believe intrinsic value is. Also with the general expectation to stay most of the time -- although not all of the time, within our leverage guidance of 3x to 3.5x, I will take a second here to notes that you'll see the leverage number in the press release is around 3.1, which would bring it in at the low-end of our range. If you think about that excluding calcimimetics, which I think is a better way to think about it, it would put it at the higher end of our range. But with all that said, our philosophy on buybacks has not changed. I think what has changed since we spoke to you in November is the stock is up from the high 50s, low 60s to now in the 80s, and that does impact our share buyback thinking really in two fundamental ways. One is that the dollars we would apply to share buybacks will just buy that many fewer shares because the stock price is up. And second as we think about intrinsic value and comparing that to where the stock is, this -- where the stock is will fundamentally impact how we think about buybacks. So we're going to give you any foresight in what we plan to do. We\u2019ve always shied away from that. But I wanted to give you -- kind of a bit of an update there on how we are thinking about things.","Quarter","Great. I appreciate the color. And then second question on the home dialysis front. The mandatory model from the executive order was supposed to go into effect last month, and now that\u2019s delayed. Are you hearing anything out of D.C. on why that model got delayed? And does the temporary or even permanent delay of the model impact your strategy that increase home penetration?","Javier Rodriguez","No, in general I think the executive order had a lot in it and they asked for comments and the community was very united on its views. And so we are glad that the administration has taken its time because we want a good outcome rather than meeting a deadline. And no to the other question, which is while policy, of course, impact at the end of the day, the patient and the physician pick the modality and that's what's driving the movement to home. People picking it or not picking it as opposed to any policy changes at this juncture.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks.","Javier Rodriguez","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Stephen Tanal","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. So I wanted to go back to the 2021 rule change. I guess where I\u2019m struggling with the idea that penetration of ESRD patient should reach the overall market is just this notion that today, I mean, penetration of ESRD patients is 25% for the market at large despite the fact they can't freely enroll in the plan. So wouldn\u2019t that tell us that this patient panel probably prefers MA and that penetration could exceed 35% over time. And I guess I know we are still anchoring to that, but it looks like CMS last week with the changes in the advanced notice for MA rates, took their forecast up to 33 and 21 and then going to 42, 41x22 -- 2024, then 42 thereafter. So obviously a much, much more optimistic outlook than you guys have. So any thoughts on those pieces there?","Javier Rodriguez","Yes. Steve, I think that all of the opinions are quite reasonable and we don't proclaim to be right. We are all doing it the same data as to economic deductibles, out-of-pocket max, sort of coordination of care network -- narrow networks or broader network. And so when we put all the variables in place, we just think that, in general, we think that it'll take a little bit longer for people to settle in to the choice than others that think that it will be what I call a very efficient and effective market and we of course could be wrong. And so there is that range that it, let's call it the low -- the base case and the high case and we don't have any additional insight that you or CMS doesn't. There's no detail information that we are relying on.","Stephen Tanal","Helpful. Okay. And then I just heard you correctly, Joel, in terms of making sure your patients are aware of their options. I imagine that applies to all states, regardless of whether there's guaranteed issue for MedSup or not. Is that correct?","Joel Ackerman","Yes.","Stephen Tanal","Okay. And then, I guess, I wanted to also ask about another part of that proposed rule to the extent you guys have the time to go through all this, but the network adequacy proposals, there's a few things in there. I won't go through all of them here, but some could be presumably read as maybe mitigating some of the market power and dialysis. How do you guys think about that dynamic, in general? I guess, I'd leave it open-ended there. I don\u2019t want to dissuade any or share, maybe I guess?","Joel Ackerman","I appreciate, Steve. Obviously, network adequacy is critical in any disease state. When you are signing up for a product you want to make sure that it got coverage, so that if you end up signing up and then you have ESRD, then you don't end up having some kind of restricted network. And of course it matters whether it's in there or not. The plans have been quite vocal. And from our perspective what we want to do is going back to our conversation earlier is we want to change the dynamics with our payer partners so that they see what we're doing and how we are adding value so that they do want to contract with us in a way that\u2019s a win-win.","Stephen Tanal","Perfect. Helpful. And maybe one more on this and then I will yield. Just going back to the treatment deltas, the MA fee-for-service. I guess, I appreciate that you guys don\u2019t want to give a certain difference, but maybe you can comment on how much variability there is in that spread? And what factors dictate his DaVita's willingness to contract for lower versus higher spreads of different MA plans?","Javier Rodriguez","Well, I appreciate the question, Steve, but I think you probably know it had low odds being answered. Every plan is steering right now at how they want to contract with us. And actually even if I try to answer it and be helpful, the contract is very specific to each plan and their ability to take risk and our ability to take risk and so it's very specific. And so unfortunately I can't give you more detail on that.","Stephen Tanal","That\u2019s fine. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.","Joel Ackerman","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Whit Mayo with UBS. Your line is now open.","Whit Mayo","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple here on calcimimetics. You\u2019re guiding to $40 million to $70 million of OI this year. 50% of that is falling in the first quarter, which implies about 25% of today's run rate of $220 million in the first quarter. So I\u2019m just curious what you're basing that on? Is that based off of ASP for the quarter today? How much visibility do you have into the first quarter contribution at this point? I guess, this is what I\u2019m asking.","Joel Ackerman","We\u2019ve got pretty good visibility with that. The ASP number came out I think in December. Not perfect visibility, but -- so in Q1, we've got that. The trajectory of what that looks like going forward though is where we don't have perfect visibility and we won't know ASP for Q2 for a little while now.","Whit Mayo","Okay. So that looks like that\u2019s about a 60% sequential decline of the fourth quarter for ASP, is that right?","Javier Rodriguez","Whit, we are \u2026","Whit Mayo","Do you know \u2026","Joel Ackerman","There are other factors that go into that. In terms of the cost decline, the changing mix between Sensipar and Parsabiv and Parsabiv cost differential. So I'm not sure you can get as cleaner number as you'd like from that, but \u2026","Whit Mayo","Is it -- I mean, presumably the ASP numbers available, so can you disclose what it is for the quarter?","Joel Ackerman","Yes. It's down a little bit more than 40%.","Whit Mayo","Okay. So some other factor would be driving your cost up to lower the OI by 60%?","Javier Rodriguez","Well, there is -- there are other factors besides cost because there's a mix issue between the oral and the IV as well.","Whit Mayo","Yes, yes, got it. Got it. Okay. That's -- and thinking about the remaining $50 million or -- not $50 million, but the remaining earnings, how do you -- I mean, are we -- how should we think about the progression of that earnings? Is it fall ratably throughout the year? I don\u2019t know, just any help? I mean, I know you\u2019ve about as much visibility into this as we do.","Javier Rodriguez","Yes, if you think about it getting cut in half each quarter going forward, that\u2019s a reasonable algorithm to use and then it goes to zero by the end of the year.","Whit Mayo","Okay.","Javier Rodriguez","Again that\u2019s not a prediction. That's just to help you all with your modeling.","Whit Mayo","Yes. Is there a scenario where by the time the industry sort of sees the benefit of calcimimetics zero out that you are still carrying some level of earnings from calcimimetics, given that you\u2019ve presumably been buying below the market for some time?","Joel Ackerman","Unlikely just because the numbers get so small in terms of the cost, I think the more interesting question about calcimimetics is ultimately how it gets bundled.","Whit Mayo","Bundled, yes.","Joel Ackerman","The TDAPA stuff will play out relatively quickly.","Whit Mayo","Okay. Just a couple of other quick ones. So just back to the NAG guidance of 1.5 to 2.5 that does implies some level of deceleration. Just Joe maybe any factors influencing your decision to bring the range down?","Javier Rodriguez","Let me grab that. This is Javier. We continue to look at the macro ranges and we just think that is the right place to land. We're continuing to invest in our missions, in our IT, in all other operations to simplify patient placement. But at the end of the day, what we are focusing is ensuring that we have the discipline and capital so that we have profitable growth. And so we're not going to chase volume. It's just not the right thing for us. And so we're comfortable with that range of 1.5 to 2.5.","Whit Mayo","Okay. Thanks.","Javier Rodriguez","And just as an FYI, my memory has me right, that is not a change from capital markets. We had at 1.5 to 2.5, but I could be wrong. So let's check that.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good evening. Just a couple of questions left for me. The first, just going back to the question about the ETC, the mandatory demonstration that's been delayed. Do you have any visibility on when that would start? Are you incurring any costs to prepare for it? And I presume since that model had some dialysis center reimbursement cuts, which you could potentially earn back since this is delayed, any potential financial impact is not contemplated in the 2020 guidance?","Javier Rodriguez","The short answer is we do not have any more information than any of you. We were given an opportunity just like all providers to give our opinions and insight. And we did and they\u2019re processing that and we have not heard back. We are not incurring any costs right now associated with it. And it was not embedded in our guidance. So right now you're even, Steven, if you will, there's no changes.","Gary Taylor","Right. Thanks. My last one to Joel. I just wondered if you would perhaps just review and clarify for us either on an EPS basis or a dollar basis what actually is in 2020 for advocacy costs because I know in the third quarter, you bumped that up $0.50 or, call it, $87 million pre-tax. But that, I think, was on top of what you view as your recurring sort of normal advocacy, But then with the AB 290 delay, maybe some of that costs came back in your direction. So maybe just some help on when we think about the 2020 guide, how much above sort of your -- what you'd call your normal advocacy spend is built into 2020.","Joel Ackerman","Sure. So nothing has really changed in that, Gary. There hasn\u2019t been any interplay between 2020 ballot initiative spend and AB 290. They\u2019re pretty independent. So the $0.50 per share is the right number and that's over and above the $30 million baseline that we plan to spend year- in year-out. The one correction I would make to your numbers is, this ballot initiative costs is not tax deductible. So your $87 million pre-tax is overstated because I -- my guess is you got to that calculation assuming this would tax deductible.","Gary Taylor","Yes, I recall you told us that, somewhere like $60 million, $65 million range, probably. So \u2026","Joel Ackerman","We are sticking with $0.50 a share. So \u2026","Gary Taylor","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Just figure out one through what's left of my question list here. Do you guys -- so first on the cash available for deployment at your end. I think if my recollection is correct, you guys typically want to run around $500 million at the parent at quarter end. So is to fair to think about you guys have another $500 million give or take of deployable cash at your end is that right?","Joel Ackerman","Yes, that\u2019s about right. $500 million is typically what we want to have in the system. So, yes, the $600 million is the number above that.","Justin Lake","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Joe you spend time talking about the intrinsic value kind of coming into repo. And given that you did a tremendous amount of repo at really attractive price for the benefit of shareholders, now that the stocks in the 80s, it looks like you are going to little bit less [indiscernible] at those levels. Is there anything we should read into your view of the intrinsic value here at the current price? And how you expect above x-stock? Could you give us a kind of at the moment update?","Joel Ackerman","Yes. We are -- we\u2019ve never really been willing to talk about what our views of intrinsic value are at any moment in time, and I don\u2019t expect to deviate from that here. I think the one thing I would point out is intrinsic value is a moving target. It's not something that stays static and its impacted by our results and it can be impacted by our buybacks and everything else. So I think what our views of intrinsic value were six months ago are necessarily the same with our views of intrinsic value today.","Javier Rodriguez","One dynamic, Justin, that is rarely talk about publicly also is that we have big blackout periods. And then you have plan and we have restrictions and whatnot and so what you want to do is not look at one quarter or two quarters, but overall what is our track record and I think you see our track record over time it's quite fluid, consistent with what Joe said.","Justin Lake","That absolutely makes sense. Thanks. And then just quickly on your commercial mix. Joe, you said it was down 20 basis points year-over-year, but not really immaterial impact on revenue per treatment. Can you just give us some more color on that, given how key that metric is?","Joel Ackerman","Yes. Look, not every commercial payer is created equal and if the mix comes from payers with lower rates, it has much less impact on our RPT than a payer who is at an average rate.","Justin Lake","And so would you say this is instead of it being just kind of normal aging of the population type of thing, did you proactively kind of walk away for some contrast that were lower priced or was that just kind of the way things fell?","Javier Rodriguez","Yes, I would say that, what Joe start off with on an early question still holds, which is there's no new dynamic and sort of the ecosystems\/ negotiation is relatively stable. There was no big decision one way or another and it will play out the way it is.","Justin Lake","Okay. Just a few couple of others here. One, Joe, just to make sure we understand, you\u2019re not giving OI guidance, but you back to Pito's question on margins, core margins ex kind of moving parts are down a little year-over-year, revenue is up a little bit. So kind of core OI [indiscernible] changes things like that are -- is effectively flat year-over-year within your guidance. Is that a reasonable way to think about it?","Joel Ackerman","I\u2019m reluctant to get drawn into the OI guidance question because we're not guiding on OI. That said, I think again you can look at the range is top-down or bottoms up. I would say it's fair to say that at the middle of the range is you should expect some OI growth year-over-year.","Justin Lake","At core, like ex moving parts.","Joel Ackerman","With margin compression which would say it's not going to grow at the rate of revenue.","Justin Lake","Okay.","Joel Ackerman","And that's, Justin, yes, that\u2019s core excluding calcimimetics and other stuff -- other noise.","Justin Lake","Got it. And then maybe quick commentary, I think you -- the industry was going to run its own ballot initiative in California and then decided to back off that. Is there some reason why you decided to back off or do I have that wrong?","Javier Rodriguez","No, you have it right. And I think the right way to think about it, Justin, is very early on you have to explore all your options. And so there's some filing restrictions etcetera. So we were exploring option, making sure that we had everything at our disposal. After evaluating it, we did not think that that was something that we should pursue. It's not in the best interest of our strategy and that\u2019s cleaner to go right after it, literally straight at it as opposed to doing a counter measure.","Justin Lake","Okay. Thanks for all the time, guys.","Javier Rodriguez","Thank you, Justin.","Operator","The next question will come from Maggie Jiang with Bank of China New York Branch. Your line is now open.","Maggie Jiang","Thank you for taking my call. My question here is what is your priority inters of the international expansion? I see that there are about 241 centers in the international as of 2018. Not sure if that number goes up in 2019.","Joel Ackerman","Sure. So our priorities for international are similar to our priorities in the U.S., which is capital efficient growth. We continue to see it as a growth business. We continue to deploy capital there in the markets that we see is having the best opportunities and those are opportunities where we can either acquire things at attractive rates or build de novos at attractive rates and where we have an opportunity to add value. So growth in '19 was relatively in line with our expectations. We see 2020 continuing along that path.","Maggie Jiang","Okay. And in terms of the long-term growth for the international business, do you expect the -- just because different regions will have different type of reimbursement system, affordability and customers, clientele. So do you -- would you expect the international profitability versus your core in U.S?","Javier Rodriguez","I think that will vary very much country by country. As you noted some countries have better reimbursement, others less so. So I think it will be a bit of a mix and where it winds up relative to the U.S will depend a lot on the different mix in the different countries and where we chose to prioritize our investments. So it's hard to predict now what the ultimate margin will be relative to the U.S margin.","Maggie Jiang","Okay. And since that the revenue coming from the international is roughly about 4.5%. However, the growth if I just purely look at Q4 2018 versus Q4 2019 the growth from the international revenue is 6.45%. So that seems to be a brighter spot than the aggregate revenue growth around 2.7%. So do you think that you will continue to approach international, particularly in China. However, on the other hand, we do see profit -- net operating loss from international.","Javier Rodriguez","So, yes, I do think we are going to continue to invest in international whether it grows faster than the U.S., we are not giving specific guidance on that. Although, I think looking at the past is a reasonable guide to the future there. So, yes.","Maggie Jiang","I see. And then in terms of Asia -- footprint in Asia, I see there are a few branches, a few centers in Taiwan and China. And you\u2019re also working with APAC JV. Can you just give me a sense in terms of what\u2019s your business model and how do you approach China or Greater China?","Javier Rodriguez","So we generally don't get into too much detail on any individual countries. So I\u2019m going to pass on that one.","Maggie Jiang","Thank you.","Javier Rodriguez","Thank you, Maggie.","Operator","Speakers, there are no questions in queue at this time.","Javier Rodriguez","Well, I want to thank you all for investing the time. We look forward to talking to you again. And we are going to do our hardest to deliver on all that we committed. Thank you and talk again soon.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Q1 2012 Investors Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Jim Gustafson, you may begin your conference.","Jim Gustafson","Thank you, Lorelle, and welcome, everyone, to our First Quarter Conference Call.","We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Jim Hilger, our interim CFO; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry","Thanks, Jim. Before I get going, I'd just point out I may be a bit more brief than usual. I'm under the weather, so that may be good news for some. The first quarter was solid. It was solid clinically, it was solid operationally, it was solid financially. I'll cover 2 topics: clinical outcomes and our outlook, both specifically and more broadly.","On the clinical side, we will continue to present our clinical outcomes first because that is what comes first. We are a caregiver company now serving approximately 145,000 human beings each week. First, with respect to adequacy, which as many of you know is essentially how well we are doing at removing toxins from our patients' blood, this past quarter 97% of our hemodialysis patients had a Kt\/V greater than 1.2. Second, with respect to vascular access, 69% of our patients have fistulas, the preferred form of vascular access. Third, with respect to phosphorus, 80% of our patients had phosphorus levels less than or equal to 5.5 milligrams per deciliter. For these and virtually all other clinical measures, our patient outcomes compare very favorably to national averages. This quality clinical care not only results in healthier patients, but also drives reductions in hospitalizations and surgical procedures, and therefore significant savings to the U.S. health care system. ","Next, our outlook. As many of you have heard, we're increasing our operating income guidance to a range of $1.23 billion at the bottom end to $1.31 billion at the top. And this range captures a majority of the probabilistic outcomes based on the swing factors that you're relatively familiar with, and which you may ask questions about later in the call.","We periodically, but regularly, get asked, \"Gee, your industry is awfully consolidated. What does that imply for growth in the core business?\" The fact is, there's a reassuring answer, even if one makes the entirely rational assumption that there can't be any more medium acquisitions by us or Fresenius because of the consolidation. So that's a very a fair starting point. You still should consider the following: a, basic demand, meaning increase in the number of treatments each year because of the increase in patients, 3.5% to 4%; de novos and other same-store growth, an additional 0.5% to 1.5%; acquisitions, an additional 1 or 2 points above that; and then financial leverage, which could come in the form of taking on additional debt and\/or buying back stock. Put all that together and you end up in the 6% to 9.5% range of EPS growth without assuming any operating leverage, which we think, over time, is likely to happen and particularly will happen at the point that we become pessimistic about other sources of growth. At this point, we've been feeling quite good and achieving quite a bit of growth in other spheres. And so it's been more appropriate to not achieve significant operating leverage in the fixed cost line, because we've been able to invest in superior alternative sources of growth. We hope that continues, whether it be internationally, through integrated care, with the potential to do other U.S. health care verticals. ","Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to our interim CFO, Jim Hilger, who, as most of you know, has been with us as Controller and Chief Accounting Officer for almost a decade.","James K. Hilger","Thanks, Kent. We experienced strong operating income and cash flow in the quarter. These were driven by strong treatment growth and improved revenue per treatment. ","Here are some specifics on the quarter.","Non-acquired growth was 5.3% when normalized for days of the week. The quarter did benefit slightly from milder-than-normal weather. Revenue per treatment was up about $4. The primary driver was the 2.1% annual market basket increase for Medicare rates. Our commercial mix was down slightly from the fourth quarter but has been flat for 4 consecutive months. Dialysis patient care cost per treatment was up about $3.50 from the prior quarter. This was due to increased compensation expense, including seasonally higher payroll taxes and increased unit cost for Epogen due to lower rebates in our new contract with Amgen.","Note that our EPO utilization was flat with the prior quarter, and based on conversations with physicians, we expect utilization to be at slightly higher levels going forward. Our dialysis G&A per treatment was up about $2 from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to professional fees, including legal and compliance spending, IT projects and spending on long-term growth initiatives.","International losses were $7 million in the quarter, flat when compared to the prior quarter, and losses in our other strategic initiatives were $11 million, which was $6 million more than the prior quarter. The main drivers for this increase were the timing of research projects at DaVita clinical research, increased investment in our direct primary care business and seasonally lower DaVita Rx profits. ","Looking ahead to the second quarter, it's likely that operating income will be flat to down sequentially. In particular, we anticipate pressure on dialysis patient care costs in a number of items, including increased pharma expense, increased wage and benefit costs and increased travel costs due to our annual leadership meeting. ","Now turning to cash flow. Our operating cash flow was $332 million in the first quarter. We expect second quarter operating cash flow will be lower due to the timing of cash taxes and our semiannual bond interest payments. We still anticipate full year 2012 operating cash flow will be in the range of $950 million to $1.05 billion.","And finally, I want to point out that in order to comply with new accounting rules, in the first quarter, we made a change to our presentation for bad debts relating to patient service revenues. Previously, we had reserved 3% of dialysis revenues for uncollectible accounts as an operating expense. We now are reflecting the 3% provision for bad debt as an offset in revenue. We have recast our prior quarters to reflect this new accounting presentation, and this change has no impact on our reported operating income.","With that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to start by talking about integrated care briefly. There was a recent National Renal Administrators Association meeting where we had the chance to talk to some of the people from Medicare, and it sounds like they remain firmly committed to moving forward with the program. Has there been any progress in your perspective, Kent, with regards to the timing of the project or the potential scale?","Kent J. Thiry","Those are still, unfortunately, big question marks. And if we were to throw out an answer, it would count more as speculation and guessing, which is just not really, I think, that useful for you. LeAnne, would you like to amend those words?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","No, Kent.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And thinking through sort of the growth dynamics in the quarter, it sounds like most of the pieces were basically right on track with your targets. If you think about some of the moving pieces over the course of the year, where do you see perhaps making some larger investments, Kent? Would it be international? Is that a primary target? Or domestic clinics? Or is it sort of all of the above and to be seen and stay tuned?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. Unfortunately, I think, in terms of a satisfactory answer, it's more the latter. We continue to look at other segments of American health care where we think we can be on the right side of reform and driving some superior value propositions to patients and the taxpayer. But you never know when you're going to find something that strikes your capitalistic fancy in those areas, as well as fitting other strategic criteria. Internationally, we're going to continue to grow, but it's not going to move the dial for you guys for quite some time, although we're excited. So I think it's same old same old until we find the right thing to move aggressively on, and who knows when that might come. I would go back for one second because on the ICM question, the integrated care question you asked a moment ago, despite the fact that we, unfortunately, have no basis for predicting, I just want to reiterate how bullish we are on the striking value proposition we think we can bring to patients and families on the quality side and to society on the reduced cost side. So we are exceptionally bullish about that in the long term. We just don't know when the starting point is.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And I guess 2 quick follow-ups on that, Kent. Any idea when we might see more data from the demos? And then a quick question for Jim, you talked about commercial mix being down after 4 flat quarters. Can you give us a little bit more detail there?","Kent J. Thiry","On the data on the demos, let's take that under consideration and see whether or not we should talk some more in the future about that. We've typically been relatively sparse in our comments. And given we are collaborating with CMS, there are some restrictions on what we can share because the data is not just ours, and often they would prefer to keep certain things quiet. In addition, we continue to get better every single quarter so we always kind of want to wait another quarter or 2. But let us think about whether or not we should do more in the next call. That's a fair point. I'll turn it over to Jim.","James K. Hilger","Ben, your question on our commercial mix. So where that -- our commercial mix was down quarter-on-quarter. But the last 4 months, our commercial mix has been flat.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you just tell me about the -- your outlook on Medicare reimbursement as we go into next year? What type of calibration do you think we might expect beyond, obviously, the budget sequestration that's already on the horizon?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, let me turn that over to LeAnne, who's in a different location. So excuse any awkward telephonic hand-offs. And then she may want to turn it back to somebody here, but LeAnne is the best place to start.","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Sure. 2 additional points beyond sequestration. One, we are, as you know, now scheduled to have an annual inflation adjustment to the bundled payment rate. And so we would continue to expect that to be probably in the 1.5% to 2% range, depending on the input factors. And then number 2, I think there is concern about the deficit coming up in that many domestic programs, including health care, could be at risk. So no prediction there but certainly something that we're working on and should be cautious about.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just a point that you guys have made in the past, which is that there are significant components of the industry, the dialysis operators who, at the reimbursement today, operate at pretty thin margins, implying there could be the risk of centers closing if reimbursement were squeezed. Is that -- can you give us any granularity on that? And is -- any information about how that may have changed over the last year or 2?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Yes. The best source of information is really -- or what people in D.C. look at, is really how MedPAC analyzes margins of the various health care sectors. And you would see from their latest report that dialysis is operating at about a 2% margin, and that's before sequestration, compared to many of the other sectors who have higher margins. So I would direct you that, that's the best place for you to look for information that members of Congress might be looking at.","Kent J. Thiry","I would amend that answer in a couple of ways. First, there are a lot of centers that operate in a relatively precarious way because of the overall economics. And members of Congress and CMS are sensitive to that. And so even if you look at their number, the 2%, and assume any kind of normal distribution of outcomes, that substantiates that assertion. Second, their 2% margin is an incorrect calculation. Parts of it, we think, they actually know are incorrect. They don't want to come out and admit that we actually, all of us, lose money on average in Medicare across the country, as you look over time. And we now carry a whole lot of centers where we lose money that are non de novos, which is part of being a good citizen, given we have healthy margins in other centers. And so what we've referred to is somewhat of a reimbursement safety net, as long as we can operate more efficiently than small mom-and-pops, as in fact still exist. It's just difficult to quantify.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And can you point to what the main source of variation is between the MedPAC number and the way you think that should be calculated more accurately?","Kent J. Thiry","There's a whole bunch of differences. It really cuts across significant parts of the cost structure. But I'll just give one example. They put an arbitrary cap in the percentage of Medical Director compensation that applies to their calculation, which makes no sense given 90% of the patients and more than 90% of the Medical Director's work is tied to Medicare and Medicaid patients.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Quick clarification question first. I just wanted to clarify that the normalized non-acquired treatment growth is adjusted for leap year as well. Is that correct?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, our NAG is not calculated based on the number of days in the quarter. It's on a per day basis within the quarter. So essentially, yes, that is taken into account.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, good. I just wanted to make sure. Okay, and then you said that you didn't see EPO rise in Q1 but you think there's going to be increasing going forward slightly. Why wouldn't that have increased in Q1 if it is going to be going up through the year?","Kent J. Thiry","I guess what it shows is that all we can do is listen to the consensus statements of our physician community. And sometimes they end up being wrong in predicting their own behavior, probably because, in many instances, they're answering our questions based on their prediction of what's going to be happening in their patient population over the subsequent couple of months based on what they did the last couple of weeks. So if they're wrong in predicting exactly what the trends are in their near-term hemoglobin and hematocrit outcomes, then they may very well be wrong in telling us what they expect to see in changed dosages. So that's the most rational hypothesis for why we would've been a little off before, but nonetheless coming back with a similar prediction.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then I know that nothing's really been finalized yet. But at this point, how do you think the integrated care demo is going to work? I guess the original ones that you guys did a few years ago were more like a capitative product. But is this going to be similar to a capitative product? Or do you think it'll be more similar to the ACO regs, where your patients still have like a fee-for-service open network type access to other providers?","Kent J. Thiry","What I would say, and LeAnne would probably have more fact-based insight, that are -- my hope is that we're far along the spectrum towards global capitation, because that provides us with the greatest degree of operating flexibility and strategic flexibility and we can really make some magic happen. If, however, they opt for the more incremental shared savings, the ACO-type approach, we ought to be able to put a lot of exciting improvements on the table as well and then use that as the fodder for moving further along the spectrum. In either case, however, it's very important for us to emphasize that we think we can offer a virtually 100% open network so that in our particular space, given how often we see the patient in an outpatient setting, some of the historical trade-offs around needing to start to close the network in order to achieve significant improvements don't exist. And so one of the reasons we should be one of the first scale pilots and new initiatives that they implement is because we offer this wonderful triangle of demonstrable and transparent clinical outcomes, saving money while retaining open networks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I do have a question about G&A costs per treatment. Jim, I know you gave us, I guess, a few things that impacted that in the quarter. I guess, just stepping back, would be curious to get some additional commentary on your view on G&A costs per treatment. We, I guess, had been tracking it the first half of '11 at around $27 or $28 a treatment. And it's recently moved into the $30 to, call it, $32 a treatment range, and it adds up on 20 million-plus treatments a year. So I guess the question is, what are you investing in there and can you help us just think about it a little bit more for the remainder of '12 and going forward?","James K. Hilger","Darren, great question. We do believe that our G&A spend will be flat for the balance of the year. And into '13, we would see G&A spend being flat to slightly up. We're hoping to get some leverage with it, but if we had to predict right now, that's what we would predict.","Kent J. Thiry","Darren, let me add there, one of the things that's hurting us there is the increased spend on compliance and legal with the private litigation in some of the investigations. And so someday those are going to go away and there'll be some nice pickup there.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And if you could just help us think about, beyond compliance and legal, which may be there for many quarters to come, but is there any transient type of cost, DSI integration, anything that you could say about integrated care investment, whether that shows up there or not? Anything to help us really put it further into context because it is a fairly significant investment in G&A from how we're looking at it?","James K. Hilger","Well, as we said, we have a number of IT projects that we're currently investing in and we've also been investing, spending on a lot of a long-term growth initiatives to hopefully drive future returns. So we have been spending a fair amount on the integration of DSI, and we will continue to spend money on the integration of additional future acquisitions.","Kent J. Thiry","Darren, we're not trying to be difficult on this. But the fact is IT, integrated care, legal compliance, DSI, growth, they're all kind of evenly weighted. It would suggest a level of analytical precision that's not reflected in my comments. But you got 4 or 5 different chunks, which add up to the hefty couple of bucks that has you appropriately uncomfortable.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","No, I'm just trying to make sense of $40 million or $50 million of additional G&A in the dialysis segment, that's all. My other question really is just more specific to the ancillary segment, where I think you've moved some of the international investment. And if I heard you correctly, Jim, some of the loss there was related to the CRO business and the investment you're making in the primary care business. But can you just talk more specifically about international and how that investment shows up in the segment results there?","James K. Hilger","Well, Darren, our results for the quarter had a $7 million loss in international, and that was consistent with the prior quarter. We expect that type of investment to continue for the balance of the year. And we do -- Darren, we do account for that outside of the dialysis segment, its own operating segment. So because it's not large enough to separately really support, we -- it is reported in our All Other segment.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, last question here. Just optimal leverage. Jim, stepping into the CFO role, are you or the team thinking any differently about what I think you've really characterized as your longer-term target leverage in the 3 to 3.5 range. Is that still the case? And are we under-levered at this point at 2.5?","James K. Hilger","We have not changed our long-term view of the appropriate levels of leverage for the company in that 3% to 3.5% range -- or 3x to 3.5x range. You're correct, we are well below that range at the moment. But we're comfortable being below or being above for certain periods of time over the long term. But over the long term, we do expect to be within the 3% to 3.5% -- or 3x to 3.5x range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo Securities.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A number of post-acute providers have talked about their expectation that the Medicare rule-making will just be final notices without receiving a proposed rule. Is that your expectation for dialysis, or are you guys expecting to see the proposed rule also?","Kent J. Thiry","LeAnne, you're best to handle that.","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Yes. We have no indication of any change. So we do expect to see a proposed rule that we'll be able to react to.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then for the first time, there's an alternative ESA available for dialysis patients. Are you guys at all second-guessing the decision that you made to go into the long-term agreement with Amgen, or what are your thoughts there?","Kent J. Thiry","Boy, if we were, I don't know if we'd ever admit it. But with whatever credibility, I offer up the answer that we're not. Our decision did include a likely scenario that there would be a competitive product, and some things have happened more quickly than anticipated. But if you recall, before they came out with their recent developments, we kind of ran through the gauntlet of the 5 or 6 filters that will ultimately determine whether or not we picked the right partner or not. And our partner always has the right to respond to any fundamental competitive steps taken by the other side. So I could recast the filter, perhaps. But we have not second-guessed it. What's happening now is not outside the range of scenarios that we contemplated. But once again, if it were not true, I don't know if we would admit it.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, I mean, and just in terms of the filters, can you provide any more detail in terms of what some of the thought process was there?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, I'll do it spontaneously and then somebody can amend the mistakes I make. But filter 1 is will another product come out, quality product. Filter 2 is when will that be. Filter 3 is how will physicians respond when they're comparing it to the gold standard of long-standing duration. Fourth is how will they price it. Fifth is, for providers, how much of their purchase will they change, given what it might do to the pricing of the product they still buy from Amgen, the gold standard. And number 6 is what is the early data once you start using something more comprehensively in the real world, not in the artificial world. And then 7, if a competitive product successfully clears all those hurdles with seriously differential math [ph] , what will our partner do to ensure that we don't want to go scurrying off big-time in the other direction when the contract runs out. That's a reasonable approximation of the filters.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just on that last one, that's very helpful. In terms of what Amgen might do, I assume you're referring to any changes in price that they might have?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. There is a lot of levers to pull in a partnership like ours. That's certainly one of them, but not the only one.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe my last question, it looks like the percent of patients with fistulas placed has remained fairly constant on a year-over-year basis. Should we think of that as sort of being the plateau of where it's going to go, or do you think you can still drive that percentage meaningfully higher?","Kent J. Thiry","Number one, the percentage will go higher. I don't know how to calibrate \"meaningfully higher,\" so I'll stay away from that. Number two, a more important number has been moving down even while that number has plateaued, which is our catheter rate has gone down. The fistulas have gotten a lot more press because of CMS's emphasis on them. But more leveraged than increasing the fistula rate by 1% is reducing the catheter rate by 1%, because when you take someone else -- when you take someone off a catheter, they can go the fistula route or they can go the graft route. And while in many instances, for many patients, a fistula is superior to a graft, the graft is way superior to a catheter. So our catheter rates continue to hit all-time lows every single quarter in the last 4 quarters, during a period where the fistula rate has somewhat plateaued. And reducing catheter rates has an incredibly powerful correlation -- it really goes beyond correlation, cause and effect, to reduced infection rate, reduced mortality, improved effectness -- and improved effectiveness of dialysis. And if I didn't already say it, reduced hospital rates. So it's incredibly clinically and economically powerful, and on that one, we continue to get better every quarter.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Is there a number that you can share with us on that, on the catheter rate?","Kent J. Thiry","We haven't shared it publicly before. Why don't we talk about whether or not we start discussing it next quarter? And we'll discuss that internally in between now and then.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a few quick questions here. Kent, I might have missed this, but what do you attribute the strong 5.3% normalized, non-acquired treatment growth to you? Is that patients getting more treatments per week or patients living longer now than previously?","Kent J. Thiry","No is the short answer. The primary driver of the improved non-acquired growth -- and that's the question, right? What are the primary drivers of our increased NAG?","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes.","Kent J. Thiry","The primary drivers, we're getting more de novos done, and we're getting more same-store growth. And then secondary, from an analytical point of view, would be the things that you cited, any growth in more frequent dialysis and any increases -- or decreases in mortality, increases in survivorship. Now to some extent, depending on the timeframe, the ranking of those 4 factors might differ, this quarter versus the last 6 months versus the last 12 months but it's a bit of a horse race across those 4.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And so de novos was the first one. What was the second one? I'm sorry I missed that.","Kent J. Thiry","Just increased same-store growth.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just wondering. . .","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. Let me add in one another point because they're furiously handing me notes. In this particular quarter, the warmer weather typically leads to fewer missed treatments and -- either because of people just missing a treatment or because of not going in the hospital. So for this particular quarter, you have to introduce that fifth variable into the mix.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And could you guys -- did you guys break that out? Or if you normalized for the mild winter, what would same-store growth have been?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, you can't normalize for that because it's impossible to come up with a metric that analytically codifies what's normal weather versus warmer. So I mean, I suppose somebody could, if we allocated 3 astrophysicists to study it for a while. But we're not going to do that.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Good use of time. And then I was just wondering if you could -- is there any update on the status of the various government investigations?","Kent J. Thiry","There's really no developments there proceeding in the way that they normally proceed. We feel very good about the merits of our case in every single instance. But that, we hasten to add, does not mean that it might not be in your shareholders' best interest for us to settle in some cases. I repeat, however, on the merits of our cases, we continue to feel very, very comfortable. And I also -- it appears I have to amend my smart aleck comments about 3 astrophysicists because it appears our finance department had 3 astrophysicists work on it and we do have a number.","Jim Gustafson","This is Jim. It's between 20 and 30 basis points year-over-year because last year was an unusually cold and snowy winter, and this year was unusually mild. So that year-over-year comparison is about 20 to 30 bps this quarter.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. Appreciate that. That's very interesting. And then just the last question, and maybe I could shoot this over to LeAnne because I think she attended, but I was just wondering what your thoughts were on the home dialysis summit that was held in D.C. a few -- about a month ago or so. Do you think that's going to go anyplace or what -- I know you guys are big purveyors of both PD and home hemo, but I'm just wondering what her thoughts were coming out of that meeting.","Kent J. Thiry","Go ahead, LeAnne.","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Yes, the meeting was really to raise awareness about the home modalities. And as you mentioned, DaVita is very much a leader in the industry in providing those to patients. So creating awareness and options was a big part about what that meeting was. And we participated, as did most of the patient groups and manufacturers and providers. So we're really excited about ensuring that patients have options.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of RBC Capital from Frank Morgan.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","2 quick questions here. On the subject of increase in the EPO cost, I think one of the comments was EPO utilization going up, but also I think I heard pricing -- I wanted to confirm that, that pricing was higher because of lower rebates.","James K. Hilger","Yes, that's -- Frank, that's correct. We entered into a new agreement, a new contract with Amgen. And in that contract, as we publicly disclosed, some of our rebates are going down.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Is there any -- and I guess that cost went up year-over-year on a sequential basis, I guess if it -- sequentially, it'd be reflecting the new contract. Is that correct?","James K. Hilger","It is a new contract and the transition from last year's pricing to this year's pricing.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Is there any other offset -- I mean, obviously, lower rebates is not a good thing, but is there any kind of offset here? Or is this pretty much this is the rate going forward?","James K. Hilger","This rate is generally reflective of the new pricing that we face. We did have some transition from old pricing to new pricing in the quarter. And it will, of course -- obviously is dependent upon utilization when you look at the total cost.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And it sounds like maybe EPO utilization going back up. So is it fair to say maybe that EPO costs come down a little bit incrementally?","Kent J. Thiry","No, you should not assume that. And right now, we cannot tell you with certainty exactly what EPO pricing will be as the years unfold.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. One other quick one here on the flattening out of the commercial mix in the last several months. Do you have any early theories on that in terms of that actually developing into a trend, or any reason why it could, at this point, just be a head fake?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, it is difficult to predict private mix. In general, if you look over 10 years, it tends to correspond in a very crude way to the healthy economy and employment. However, as we all know, there's a lot of discontinuity showing up in macroeconomic data these days, as we hover back and forth between recession and recovery and different things happen with respect to international economics. So the fact that it's been flat, given there has been some flattening out of unemployment claims and some pickups in employment, flat versus down is not surprising. But exactly what happens depends so much on which sectors are growing or contracting and the confidence around growth or the flattening out of unemployment. So it's not surprising that it's flattened out, given what's happened in America. And what happens in America will most likely continue to be the primary driver of which way it moves or doesn't move, going forward. But we can't get any more precise than that. Is that responsive?","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's fine.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a few questions. In the comments earlier about G&A being flat through '12 and flat to up a little bit in '13, was that on a dollar basis or a percent of revenue basis?","James K. Hilger","That'd be on a per-treatment basis.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dollars per treatment?","James K. Hilger","Yes. But it will fluctuate, hopefully within a narrow band.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And my other question is, is there any consideration of subcu for EPO? I guess at one time, a few years ago, doctors were talking less about targeting lower hemoglobin, using more iron and then eventually moving towards subcu. We have seen a little bit of pick up with the small providers doing a little more subcu. Is that something that you've completely ruled out, or still unknown at this point?","Kent J. Thiry","We have not ruled it out or ruled it in. We really follow the guidance of our physicians, and you can see how wrong a lot of the experts were who said that once the bundle went in, there'd be a wholesale move to subcu. These are the same people who said, \"Oh, the reasons that subcu wasn't used more before were economic,\" which is why, of course, they predicted with such certainty and such flair and drama that it was going to increase dramatically as soon as the bundle went in. They were wrong in both counts. The clinical data around subcu was unclear before, whether or not it led to sustained lower doses. You had the issue of patient preference, which tends to come down very soundly against subcu, although you never know what changes there might be there with new technologies that make it less uncomfortable. And then you have the big clinical bogeyman of the occasional incidence -- I'm not going to give the right name, it's been too many years, of red blood cell aplasia or something like that, a very serious potential byproduct of subcu, which in Europe x years ago led to some serious patient harm and made a lot of doctors uneasy about it. And so you put all that together, we don't know how many more physicians will start exploring it yet again and what the results will be. And our behaviors and actions will follow their decisions.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Last question. Kent, I heard your brief comments on the investigation update. I just wanted to ask specifically about Denver, only because on the last call, you had mentioned that a few executives had been called to testify, I think, in front of that grand jury. Is that -- can you comment if that -- those testimonies have been completed, if that's still ongoing? Is there still an active process happening in Denver?","Kent J. Thiry","They have done some and they're going to do some more.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Ruff with Insight Investments.","Charles Ruff","The $17 million operating loss for ancillary services, strategic initiatives, international, can you give us some idea of where we should expect that for the year?","James K. Hilger","We would -- Chuck, we would expect our international losses to stay in and around the results of the first quarter. Our -- and we would expect some improvement in our ancillary businesses over the course of the year.","Charles Ruff","Okay. So it won't be 17x4 of 68 should -- is 50 a reasonable number for the year?","James K. Hilger","I don't think we're in a position to give that -- to give a specific number, Chuck, but it should be less than 4x17.","Charles Ruff","Okay. And on the cash flow statement, there's a $7.1 million loss on disposal of assets. Is that loss in G&A, or where is that on the income statement? And is it a recurring type thing?","James K. Hilger","Let me get you an answer to that. I'm going to -- I'll come back to that question in a minute.","Charles Ruff","Okay. And can you give us a feel for where we should expect CapEx to be for the year? And I don't know if you can put any kind of range on the acquisition use of cash for the year.","James K. Hilger","We don't typically give CapEx guidance. But we would expect our CapEx to be in line with -- the maintenance CapEx to be in line with prior year. Acquisition CapEx is somewhat driven by the opportunities that are presented to us. And at this point, we really don't have the ability to give guidance on that figure.","Operator","And your next question comes on the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Kent, just one quick follow-up. You made a comment about DaVita Rx being seasonally lower this quarter, or at least the profit was. Just wondering why that is. Is there a lot of seasonality in that business? Or what drove the lower profitability this quarter?","Kent J. Thiry","The -- I'll take a stab, but other people have to correct me if I'm wrong. I think what we found is that the first quarter, when people are having their co-pays and deductibles, actually does influence their decision-making around adhering to the pharmaceutical prescriptions that their doctors have recommended. We've seen in DaVita Rx over the years how powerful microeconomic forces and incentives, in fact, are in determining what a lot of people with limited funds do on the pharmaceutical front. I'm looking around the room now. Is that the right answer?","James K. Hilger","Yes, Kent, that's the primary driver.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Martin Brunninger with Nomura.","Martin Brunninger - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","If you can just give us an update on what your plans in international growth and the expansion plans and what you have achieved so far.","Kent J. Thiry","I will take a stab and then you come back at me if it's unsatisfactory. We've been pleased and excited by what's happened so far, the fact that we are active in Germany, India, Saudi Arabia and China, and also have a center in Singapore and a couple being built in Malaysia. And so we are excited and encouraged by that. We always hasten to remind ourselves, however, that we're new, that we're going to make a lot of mistakes and hit a bunch of speed bumps. So we are committed to continuing. We're going to get smarter and better and more efficient. But at this point, there's such a wide range of potential outcomes as to exactly how many centers and what revenue and what operating contribution we're going to have at any given date and time, that any alleged guidance that we would provide wouldn't really be very useful.","Martin Brunninger - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","But could you maybe give us a broad sense of the strategy, whether you're pursuing a greenfield approach in various countries? Or is there a difference in the geographies, whether you prefer greenfield approach or an acquisition strategy? What do you think makes more sense mid- to long-term?","Kent J. Thiry","In almost all cases, we will devote acquisitions and de novos. And in many cases, we'll be working with local partners to help facilitate our learning.","Martin Brunninger - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And with respect to Germany, what kind of market share do you think you can get to, and what do you -- what are the regulations there at the moment that give you the biggest pushbacks?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. We just don't know since I think our market share right now is probably something like 0.25%. And we've only been in the country a few months. We're just -- you probably know what more than we do about what to expect. We love the fact that it is such an open market, in the sense there is a very, very little chain presence, as you know. But there's also a reason why the chain presence is so low compared to other countries, which is there have been a lot of obstacles. And we're hoping that we can prove with our outcomes and the way in which we collaborate with the government that some of those obstacles should be removed, and then there is an awful lot of open field running opportunity in Germany over the next decade. So we're opening -- we're hoping to accelerate that change, but pretty impossible today to predict at what rate that will happen.","Martin Brunninger - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Maybe the last question on European countries. I'm sure you've done lots of research there. What's the typical profit margin on these dialysis clinics that you're looking at?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. It varies so dramatically. I don't think there is such a thing as typical, not only across countries but within countries. And for us, as important as the current margin is, our assessment of the expected margins over the next 10 to 15 years, which creates even more variability in the forecast as you try to anticipate government reimbursement versus significant elements of the cost structure, including labor, so I am afraid there's no short way to answer that question because it varies across countries, within countries and over time.","James K. Hilger","Sorry we don't know more.","Kent J. Thiry","And I'd like to return to Chuck's question. Chuck, you'd asked about on our cash flow statement, our loss on disposal of assets of $7 million. It's disposal of assets and other noncash charges. And principally, the answer to the question is the amortization of our deferred financing cost is the vast majority of that line item. And hopefully, that is responsive to your question. If not, feel free to jump back in the queue and refine the question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Matt Weight with Feltl and Company.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Just quickly here. The sequential increase in patient care cost per treatment, about $3.50, was that predominantly due to the lower rebates or is that overstating that?","James K. Hilger","The patient care cost, it's a number of things -- a number of factors add into it. But in order of relevance, it's the compensation expense and higher payroll taxes would be the largest impact. And then increased cost for EPO.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you say how much DSI integration costs were included in G&A this quarter?","James K. Hilger","It's about $5 million in the quarter.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I think previously, you thought that, that integration would be complete by the second quarter. Is that still on track?","James K. Hilger","We're still on track with our integration plan.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And just last question. When we start thinking about integrated care, is there any differences or challenges in how you would incorporate or manage a home dialysis patient versus in-center?","Kent J. Thiry","Say that question again, please.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Well, within integrated care, are there any challenges or differences when you look at a home dialysis patient versus one that's in-center? In-center, I'm assuming it's easier to monitor their weight and then so I'm just -- what other challenges there may be or differences?","Kent J. Thiry","All right, let me take a stab at it. There's a lot of differences in how you take care of a home patient versus in-center. And this is because there is a lot of differences. Separately from patient preference, there is differences in which patients can do, one of the 2 home modalities versus in-center modality, and then there's also the variable of which patients can and would prefer nocturnal. And so there's a bunch of differences. I don't know where to take it beyond that. Some things are easier about working with home patients, some things are harder because you don't see them as often, and vice versa with the in-center.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","The demonstration project, do you have home dialysis patients in that?","Kent J. Thiry","Boy, I'm not -- I presume so. I've always presumed so. And so I actually can't answer the question because I've never asked it. And maybe there's some bizarre fact that I'm not aware of where we don't have them in. Just -- and I'm looking around the room. None of us know. So presume the answer is yes. And if it's not, we'll get back to you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Some of the -- a couple of the private companies are particularly enthusiastic about the physician JV model. As you move forward, is it reasonable to expect 5 years from now you'll have more doctors under JV than you have now? And is that -- would that change be driven by your preference or just by the realities of the marketplace as people compete for your docs and new docs coming out of school?","Kent J. Thiry","If you're talking about joint ventures where both the physicians and we own -- we together own equity at the dialysis center, is that what you're talking about?","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Kent J. Thiry","No. We already do more joint ventures dialysis centers with doctors than anyone else in America by far, and that's been true for a long, long time. So we were leaders in that space. We think it's really good for the patient and the taxpayer, as well as for our shareholders. And we don't expect that to change going forward.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And has that percentage been increasing over the past 5 years?","Kent J. Thiry","Short answer is yes.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And have you ever disclosed what percent are JV versus medical director model?","Kent J. Thiry","We have at different times thrown numbers out, and we'll probably do it again at our next Capital Markets Day. So I don't have the number at the tip of my fingers right now, but we'll disclose it, I would guess, at the next Capital Markets. And for a reasonably up-to-date number, you could go to the transcripts for the last Capital Markets because, of course, in any given year, it doesn't change that much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just coming back for one more. I just wanted to go to the kind of the seasonality of operating income this year, and you had made some comments about 2Q operating income probably being down sequentially and you'd talked about a few different factors driving that. And I was just kind of looking back in my model as far as I can see, and I don't have a 2Q operating income number down sequentially. So is the biggest part of this that annual meeting is typically a 1Q event, and this year it's a 2Q event? Is that the biggest factor? Or is there an extra treatment day or something? Could you give a little more color on your expectation there?","James K. Hilger","Well, our annual leadership conference has always occurred in the second quarter. We typically have fewer days in the first quarter. It's usually 2 days on average, sometimes 3 days on average than the rest of the year, and that is the principal reason why our first quarter typically is lower seasonally. Of course, you also have payroll tax reset, which occurs in the first quarter. This year, we have -- with our new -- with our expectations on utilization, our new EPO contract and the leadership conference in the second quarter, we could be flat to down sequentially.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And the 2Q treatment days, do you know what would those be?","James K. Hilger","It will be more than -- I think it's one more day. People are shaking their heads here. I believe it's one more day in the quarter.","Kent J. Thiry","Let me go ahead and go back to the question raised by the previous questioner. In our 10-K, we reported 18% of dialysis revenues were generated from JV centers.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Kent J. Thiry","All right. Thank you all very much for your continued interest in our company. We will work very hard between now and the next call to try to generate an attractive risk-adjusted, short- and long-term return on your capital. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"7280":["DaVita HealthCare Partners, Inc.

Sir, you may begin.","Jim Gustafson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Joel, and welcome everyone to the DaVita HealthCare Partners' Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Javier Rodriguez, the CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Vijay Kotte, Chief Financial Officer of DaVita Medical Group; Jim Hilger, our Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statement. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Thank you, Jim, and welcome to all. We delivered solid adjusted operating income and strong cash flows in this particular quarter. The total adjusted operating income was $475 million as many of you have already seen, which were driven by the strong Kidney Care results at $431 million, and a disappointing DaVita Medical Group trajectory reflected with $44 million on a non-GAAP basis there.","Operating cash flow is another bright spot of $517 million as we continue to successfully convert your earnings into your cash. We'll discuss several topics here before we get into Q&A. Number one is clinical outcomes, number two is DMG results, number three is U.S. Kidney Care, number four, a little bit of an update on international, and number five is just some additional financial enterprise level details.","Let's start with clinical outcomes as we always do. We are first and foremost a care giving company and quite good at it. Now about 185,000 patients in the U.S. alone, about 35% of all dialysis patients in America. One of the areas where we've increased our focus is on reducing blood stream infections, a very big deal to our patients, a very big deal to their families, a very big deal to the tax payer.","It's important because this keeps patients out of the hospital. Blood stream infections are one of the top five causes of hospitalizations for these patients and this impacts both QIP and Five Star. We're now performing blood culture tests on more than 90% of the situations when a patient is present with signs and symptoms of blood stream infections, will never get to a 100%, but 90% is remarkably higher than where we were ex years ago, and where so many dialysis centers are today.","Despite testing a greater percentage of eligible patients, we've actually decreased our blood stream infection rate by 16% over the last 12 months. So we're working both sides of the equation, with tenacity and some success.","On the DMG side, the DaVita Medical Group, year-to-date we've outperformed and the focused HEDIS measures that CMS uses attract Medicare Advantage clinical quality compared to the same period last year. And as a result, we are on track to achieve greater than four stars in all of our planned relationships.","For some more detail on the DaVita Medical Group, I'd turn it over to Vijay Kotte.","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer, DaVita Medical Group","Thanks, Kent. Turning to this quarter's performance, operating income was $44 million excluding non-GAAP items, as detailed in our earnings release. Unfortunately, year-to-date we have financially underperformed relative to plan and we expect this gap to increase in the second half of the year.","As a result, we're lowering our 2016 full year guidance to $110 million to $150 million. The decrease in guidance has four primary drivers: fee-for-service growth; prior-year revenue reconciliation; Medicare Advantage growth; and rebranding effort. To provide a little more color, let me walk you through those.","First, our fee-for-service revenue growth has not met our expectations. Our target was 6% year-over-year, but we're achieving 3%.","Second, we made a mistake forecasting 2016 operating profit by overestimating expected reconciliation payments for prior year Medicare Advantage revenue.","Third, while our in-year Medicare Advantage membership growth has been in line with broader enrollment trends and the geographies we operate in, is lower than we previously expected.","Fourth, as we stated in our last call, we are rebranding from HealthCare Partners to the DaVita Medical Group. To accomplish this, we expect to spend $5 million to $10 million this year that wasn't previously included in our forecast. In addition, we will need to accelerate the non-cash amortization of $110 million worth of existing trademark intangibles associated with the legacy HealthCare Partners brand. This accelerated amortization has been excluded from our revised 2016 and long-term guidance.","Despite these disappointments, we're making good progress on the key items we identified at Capital Markets. In terms of fee-for-service to value conversion, we're progressing in contracting discussions with health plan, while developing value based care capabilities in our newer markets.","Additionally, we continue to invest in the business, which we believe will fuel our long-term success. One example is our investment in seven new de novo clinics, which are a capital efficient growth platform similar to what you are used to seeing in Kidney Care.","Finally, as we look towards our long-term outlook, our 2019 OI target remain $250 million.","Now, I'll turn it over to Javier Rodriguez to speak a little bit more about Kidney Care.","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","Thank you, Vijay, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about the quarter, I'd like to highlight a recent development that we're very excited about. At our Capital Markets Day, we talked about the powerful benefits of integrated care for chronic populations, including our own ESRD patients.","Since then, two new pieces of legislation that are supported by the dialysis community have been introduced in Congress. The first is called the Dialysis PATIENT Demonstration Act and that provides for true integrated care model for Kidney Care patients.","The second is called the ESRD Choice Act of 2016 and that would finally allow for ESRD patients to enroll an MA plan. Both of these acts would be a great gift to ESRD patients and play to our long term strategy of integrated care. We're hopeful about their prospects in Congress due to the strong bipartisan support and we will continue to work hard to pursue integrated care for our patients.","Now on to our quarterly results. Overall, DaVita Kidney Care had a strong and reasonably straight forward quarter, so I won't go into much detail here. As Kent said, we delivered strong operating income of $431 million due to a slight improvement in revenue per treatment over Q1 as well as a slight reduction in cost per treatment.","With respect to growth, our normalized non-acquired growth for the quarter was 4.3%, which falls within our long-term target range of 3.5% to 4.5%. With the first half of the year now behind us, we are raising the bottom end of our 2016 guidance range by $50 million. This is consistent with our comments from last quarter that were more likely to be in the top half of our original guidance. With this change, our new Kidney Care operating income guidance for 2016 is now $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion.","As for next year, we plan to provide 2017 guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call. We made this change last year because ACA plans have become a more meaningful part of our commercial mix. This has added some new drivers of upside and downside to our business and our industry, as well as some seasonality. Providing guidance on our fourth quarter call allows us to incorporate the additional visibility we gain during open enrollment period.","Before I turn it back to KT, I want to close by saying, we remain excited about the fundamentals of our business, the gradual shift toward integrated care, and the fact that our teammates are recognized for providing the best outcomes and quality of life for kidney patients.","Now back to Kent to discuss our international business.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Okay. Thank you, JR. International losses, $13 million in the quarter, which is pretty much in line with our guidance of approximately $40 million in losses on the full year. We continue to maintain what we told you I think about a year ago that we committed to try to achieve breakeven by 2018 in our current market portfolio excluding any new countries and we are standing by that. And a number of you probably saw that we did in fact close the transaction that we had to announce four weeks to five weeks to six weeks ago, that being our JV transaction with Khazanah and Mitsui on August 1.","Just to refresh your memory, Khazanah and Mitsui have each subscribed to acquire 20% share of ownership over time. At the closing, each provided $50 million of funding to the JV in return, while each receiving a 6.7% stake.","We're excited to have them as partners. We have a very long-term point of view about the opportunity in that part of the world, as do they, and we think they're going to help us accelerate and deepen our growth.","Now, I'll turn it over to Jim Hilger to cover some more enterprise financials.","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","Thanks, Kent. And just a little more about our Asia-Pacific joint venture. In regard to the JV with Khazanah and Mitsui, please note that we expect that this joint venture will be deconsolidated from our financials and that future operating results will run through equity investment income for our pro rata share of ownership in the joint venture. Please note that we expect to record a material non-cash one time gain in connection with the formation of this JV and this gain is excluded from our guidance.","Now on to the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $103 million in the second quarter, consistent with the recent quarters. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners was 37.2% in the quarter when adjusted for the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge and recognition of a state income tax benefit. We expect the full-year effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners on our adjusted income for 2016 to be in the range of 39% to 40%.","Now turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $517 million in the quarter and $2.06 billion for the last 12 months. The last 12 months benefited from the timing of tax payments. We expect full year 2016 operating cash flow to be between $1.6 billion and $1.75 billion.","One thing to keep in mind when thinking about the cash flows of our individual operating segments is that, DMG generates a disproportionately higher share of our cash flows and its share of our adjusted operating income. While the midpoint of our DMG guidance for adjusted operating income is $130 million, the business has a year-to-date annual run rate of $200 million in non-cash depreciation and amortization expense.","In addition, as you will recall, there is a cash tax reduction of approximately $100 million per year, which is the equivalent to $167 million improvement in pre-tax operating income. This cash tax benefit is due to the tax basis step-up created when we acquired the Medical Group.","And finally, as the vast majority of DMG's business is capitated care, where we are paid before and current expenses, it has favorable cash flow characteristics with low to negative working capital. Thus, DMG contributes more to our operating cash flows than is first apparent when looking at operating income.","We continue to have a very strong cash balance with $1.68 million in cash and short-term investments as of June 30. We continue to weigh capital deployment opportunities across growth investment, share repurchases, debt repayment and holding cash.","Additionally, as disclosed in our earnings release, our board of directors just increased our share repurchase authorization from the remaining $259 million to now $1.5 billion.","And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Kent Thiry.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","I'll just make a few summary comments before we go to Q&A.","Number one, with the DaVita Medical Group, we're certainly sorry that we had to reduce the guidance. In fact, it will take even more time to get it to where we think we can be regularly growing earnings and we're intensely intent on doing, but it will take some time.","Number two, DaVita Kidney Care, wonderfully solid results yet again, probably even better than that, at the same time as JR has talked about recently, we could have some choppiness at the high levels.","And we are, maniacally continuing to invest in becoming even more differentiated than we are today in quality and service and physician experience and IT et cetera.","Third and fourth is the cash flow. Your cash flow continues to be a powerful weapon to be deployed in your defense and on offense.","And lastly, fourth, we continue to have a lot of belief in our overall business platform, everything from a geographic footprint, for capabilities by function, et cetera, et cetera.","So, thank you all very much and Joel, could you please open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely, sir. So for the participants on the phone, we will now begin the question-and-answer session.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Operator, are you having any problems?","Operator","I'm just waiting for the participants. But, at the moment, we don't have an incoming question.","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","Joel, I show seven people in the queue.","Operator","Okay. One moment.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Hey, Joel. There might be something wrong with the equipment that you're looking at, so perhaps, while the first person ask their question, you can do some checking with one or the other people there.","Operator","Yes, I'll double check sir because those are people that are on the queue. , but let me \u2013 yeah, let me open up their line now, hold on.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Okay. But that's okay to let them in Joel, because we know that there is a number of people who ask questions each and every call. So, it's okay if they do that.","Operator","Okay. All right. Okay. So, we have our first question from the line of Mr. Chris Rigg. Mr. Rigg, your line is open.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to ask about DMG here. I guess just with regard to the fee-for-service revenue only growing at 3% versus 6%, is that tied to the Everett Clinic or is that something completely different?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","It's pretty much across the board although, of course, the Everett Clinic is the biggest single source, but we're just a little bit soft in a number of different areas, and the good news or bad news depending how you look at it is, we can operate some parts of that much better outside of the Everett Clinic and within the Everett Clinic, which operates, so accidently, they had kind of an uncharacteristic stumble. And so, it's a mix of all of our fee-for-service locations nothing really jumping out.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then just a little bit forward thinking on the ESRD choice legislation that you guys highlighted. I mean how would that, at least, at a high level work in your guys opinion? Would you get better rates from the MA plans than you currently get on the fee-for-service side? Is that the right way to think about it? Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","There is a couple of ways about it and I'll chime in to Javier, and then LeAnne if you want to supplement. The main thing is that the lives would be attributed to the dialysis clinic. And so, therefore, the dialysis clinic would become the medical home, sort of de facto medical home, because we'd have the patients for 12 hours. The other important thing is that on the revenue side, instead of having a benchmark, which is a little of a black box thing, as you get a number, it would be linked to MA, and so the revenues would be a lot more predictable. Does that answer your question?","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Thanks a lot.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rigg. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Matthew Borsch. Sir, your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, this is Tejus (19:36) joining on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. There has been some recent articles about insurers focusing on third-party payments from charities like American Kidney Fund and even across other subsectors as well. I think it's been the longstanding practice for dialysis companies to donate to these charities, but for those of us less familiar, can you provide some color on how AKF fits into your overall strategy and any dynamics at play regarding increased focus?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","And before we do that, before Javier does that, this is KT, just coming back again, I want to make sure we covered all aspects of the previous questioners question. And in general, we do get paid more for an MA dialysis patient than a Medicare fee-for-service patient. It is totally intuitively to be expected, because if you have MA risk, if you're in MA plan, you care a lot more about aggregate integrated care because you're at risk on the entire expense for the patient. And so, coming to us where you get some of what we provide and therefore lower hospitalizations and happier repeat patients\/customers, it is natural that given our more robust value proposition that the payer pays us more and in fact is happier than they would be paying less for fee-for-service type service. Now, on to the next question. Javier?","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","Sure, Matthew. Thank you for the question. First of all, it's probably worth stepping back and reviewing level setting here. We believe that it is vital for patients of all different disease states to have premium assistance. It is a critical part of our healthcare system and has been so for decades. And of course, we got to have appropriate rules. So those need to be reviewed periodically.","In Kidney Care, we have been donating and so have all other providers to help patients with end-stage renal disease for decades in order to be assisted with their premium. The OIG has reviewed that framework more than once and actually just did it over a year ago or so. And so, that framework has been vetted and, of course, we have to make sure that we all stay and abide by the rules that were outlined by the OIG. Did I get to what you're going to...","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. That was very helpful. Thanks. And just a quick kind of follow-up modeling question. For the D&A, in the quarter looks like there was an uptick there. Was that associated with the accelerated amortization from the rebranding?","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","No, it was not. We have not started the acceleration, that's a forward-looking event, but we will keep you informed about that matter as we determine the final amortization periods.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","But perhaps we can expect...","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Can you comment on the uptick though?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Why don't you give us...","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","It's primarily, excuse me, it's primarily the Everett Clinic.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thanks very much.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","And so we'll check and if there's any answer that should be appended to, primarily the Everett Clinic, we'll get it back out in the next 5 minutes, 10 minutes. But, next one please, Joel?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Kevin Fischbeck. Mr. Fischbeck, your line is open.","Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America","Hi. Thank you. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin. So, question here on the transaction that you announced with Tandigm or rather selling a portion of it. So, the question here is, who did you sell the interest to? And the question, (23:34), we would like to know whether this was a strategic player maybe who could potentially help save money there or was it done for financial reasons?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","On, Tandigm, what we did is sold a part of our stake back to IBC, Independence Blue Cross, who has been our partner in Tandigm since day one and what both sides agreed was to do this in order to create more alignment between IBC and Tandigm.","Otherwise, we were in a situation where IBC got a 100% of the profits in their non-Tandigm business, only 50% in the Tandigm part of the business, and this lack of alignment was getting in the way of some of the glass breaking that needed to go on in order to move the entire organization forward. And so we agreed to be bought out in part to get that alignment, and who knows, perhaps we'll get to \u2013 go backup to a higher percentage over time.","Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America","Okay, that's helpful. And then staying a little bit on that front and specifically on the production in \u2013 I guess outlook for operating income for that part of the business, HCP or DaVita Medical Group. So specifically, how should we think about this reduction as it relates to the sale in the stake and also the exit in Arizona markets. So, is that, the guidance changed to reflect those two things or there is chance to a core performance as well? And then if it is and if you could please quantify the two different sort of buckets, the asset sales versus the core performance of the business? Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Okay. I'm going to turn that to Vijay. There was a part on Arizona and then perhaps in relationship of Arizona with Tandigm and then core performance separate from those two if I heard correctly...","Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America","Correct. That's correct.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Were those the three parts, please?","Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America","Yes. Exactly, yes. Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Okay. Thanks.","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer, DaVita Medical Group","So, Joanna, I think the first question was related to, does the guidance change, is that reflective or is that driven by the change in ownership in Arizona and in Tandigm. So it is incorporated, it is not a driving component. The four items that we called out are the primary factors that are changing our guidance expectations for the year.","Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America","So, is there a way to quantify those? So I've heard you said $5 million to $6 million of this additional cost from rebranding. So is there other, I guess, the other delta, the other part of the delta is (26:17) for service and MA, right?","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer, DaVita Medical Group","Yeah. One is the fee-for-service growth being only 3% versus our expected 6% and then the in-year MA growth and then the stake in our estimate on the prior year revenue reconciliation amount.","Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America","So is there a way to sort of out of those four things versus the change in coming from the sale of Tandigm and Arizona?","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer, DaVita Medical Group","I would...","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","I think, let me take a stab at the answer to the question I think you're asking. Those four factors explain the change in guidance. And the Tandigm and Arizona transactions had little to no impact on go forward guidance.","Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America","Great. That's what I was getting. Yes, exactly. Thank you so much.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. So the next question comes from the line of Mr. Gary Lieberman. Mr. Lieberman, your line is open.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe to stay with that last question for a second, is it possible to breakout those four components to put a dollar number on each one of those for the impact because it was a fairly large change for the guidance?","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer, DaVita Medical Group","Yeah. I think all four are pretty significant meaty parts of it, and we're not going to attribute a dollar to each one individually, but each one is significant.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then I guess maybe just going back to the explanations for the sale of Tandigm. I guess, could you just walk us through that? In other words, wasn't entirely clear kind of exactly what the driver was there?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Sure. I can. In establishing Tandigm where you know that IBC and DaVita together stood up 100,000 member at risk HMO essentially in a year, so an exceptionally aggressive implementation. It is necessary for us to work for a lot of the home departments within IBC and also to be negotiating with the same hospitals that IBC is negotiating with for their other products.","And what we found is some IBC team mates as you would rationally expect, say hey, an extra dollar of hospital rate relief goes a 100% to IBC if I put it in this product, negotiated for here, and only 50% if I negotiate for their. Now the fact is, those perceptions are going to change over time because of the offensive potential of Tandigm and because more and more IBC people are becoming a part of Tandigm. But in the mean time, rather than try to deal with some of that understandable organizational friction, we said the simplest way to deal with it in the near-term is to let us be bought down. And so all of IBC could see that they had a significant majority of the profits in either case.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then you mentioned the opportunity to potentially increase your ownership stake back up. How would that work?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Correct. Without going into a lot of detail, we have some rights with respect to buying back up to our prior position.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So you're still committed to Tandigm and it's going well compared to when you initially did the deal or how would you characterize that?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","We're still committed to Tandigm and they're doing well. I kind of hate saying yes or no to something like that. It's a young company. We're making progress every quarter. If you hit plan, then it sounds like you're doing well, but it could have been you made too soft a plan, if you're missing it, it can sound like you're doing poorly, but it could have been you set a good aggressive plan or had a little bad luck. And so, all I can say is that we're a lot better today than we were four months ago. We're better four months ago than eight months ago. We've got some new executives onboard and so we're feeling pretty darn good. But we also set out to do something that really hasn't been done very often. And so, we just don't have a lot of illusions about skipping up the mountain. We know we're going to skin our knees a couple of times on the way.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then may be turning towards the comments by some of the managed care companies this quarter regarding the premiums from the American Kidney Fund. It sounds like some of them may actually be talking to state insurance commissioners or pushing back in other ways to maybe get out of taking those premiums. Can you talk about any conversations that you've had or your thoughts, generally speaking, about how any of this might transpire?","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","Sure, Gary, this is Javier. And again, it's very useful to step back a bit. And so, in a world right now, where in 2014 the exchanges came into play, we've heard so much about the risk pools and how they're not well funded. And so a new product comes into market. Our dialysis patients and our social workers work really hard to make sure that they explain and understand their new product and at that time the patient and the patient alone makes a decision on what's right for them.","As you know, many of the chronic and high cost disease states have caused these risk pools to be challenging to the payers. I think that they've in some instances have highlighted ESRD expense, but the reality is that it's pretty much our chronic diseases. So, CMS is evaluating third-party premium assistance to see what their stance is, but it's complicated around the healthcare continuum. And so, right now they're evaluating because the last thing they want to do is use a broad brush and then have consequences on one disease state versus another.","So, right now what's going on is that in every state people are trying to lobby to get one thing or another. What we have found is that regulators once they really hear our patients' needs and what they literally need as choice, they're quite sympathetic to the cause and so it will play out state-by-state and of course the patients and ourselves will do the best we can to make sure that they have right to these products regardless of the fact that they end up being expensive patients.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's very helpful. And then maybe final question just on \u2013 staying on the Kidney Care front. It looks like patient care cost per treatment was down marginally in the quarter. Any changes specifically on use of drugs and then to the extent that you guys are willing to comment on any negotiations or conversations with alternative providers of ESA or your current supplier? Thanks.","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","Hi, Gary, thanks for the question. No big change on utilization of med. And there is nothing new to update. The negotiations continue and all the dynamics that we've explained before are the same.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Lieberman. The next question comes from the line of Mr. John Ransom. Mr. Ransom, your line is now open.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, nobody ever calls me Mr. so that's a nice honorary. A couple of things. Kent, let's kind of step back and think big picture on HealthCare Partners now renamed. You've been in this for four years. Clearly the numbers haven't been what we all hope they would be. How much of that do you attribute to structural factors and what I would say about that is maybe not as many markets were ready for this revolution as we thought? Or secondly how much of it do you say, well, gosh, maybe we didn't execute as well as we thought we could have, if it's possible to do that?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Yeah. It's a very fair point, maybe I'd refer to the four chapters. Chapter one was huge reimbursement cut, $200 million of OI loss because HealthCare Partners was more adept than others that capturing the equity codes, which we knew going in, but didn't anticipate the dramatic change in policy. We knew there would be some softening there and some compression and we knew it wouldn't be small, but we did not \u2013 with respect to what happened so much and so quickly, and therefore we own that. So, chapter one was breathtaking reimbursement, that's $200 million annually.","Chapter two was pretty much total displacement of the leadership; California, Nevada, Florida, the three markets, potentially 100% change and that took time. And, of course, while you're doing it, it does get in the way of things getting done and it does create some transitional trauma.","Chapter three is bring in the new infrastructure. You can buy the house on the best lot with the best architectural bones. But if it needs new heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, you got a lot of work to do. It doesn't really start showing up until it's done that makes a hell of a difference as to the experience of going inside. And so that's a chapter we're in the midst of right now.","Chapter four is the one we're just starting to feel in some places where we're bringing a new level of operating excellence, a new level of innovation and enhanced value proposition, new levels of creativity and contracting. But these are just little saplings breaking through the surface right now. The good news is they're there and we're ready to take care of them. So, I would divide the world into four chapters and then I would offer up my empathy for the fact that so many of the shareholders have had to lift through the excruciating burden of chapters one through three.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's a great answer, and I've a follow up for Javier. Just to push back a little bit on this foundation issue. I mean, these patients, would be covered by Medicare. It's not as though they would be bereft to health insurance or then \u2013 I think, I've read 5,500 or so patients are now on exchanges, being paid full by the foundations. I mean, aren't you arguing that United Healthcare and Anthem should take, I don't know, $5,000-$10,000 in premium and have a fair cost of over $100,000?","I mean, how can we make that argument to these plans, when they could be covered under the public plans that's and I would assume, you guys have your proportional share of the 5,500, just stepping back from kind of a public policy standpoint. How do you, at a time when the plans are losing money in the exchanges, how do you argue to them that they should cover people that could be covered for a fraction of the cost under Medicare?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Yeah. A couple of things. If you're on Medicare, you're not eligible, as we go on the exchange. And so, that is the benefit that you have. For the patients, that switch, I don't know, if the number you cited is right or not, we haven't disclosed those numbers. It is a very personal decision that is based on access to specialists, drugs, and other things. So, the patient actually do get differentiated care.","And so the reality of this thing is that the system, set it up for individuals to make a choice as to what their best coverage is and so patients made that choice, and it's a very personal decision that I can't decide whether that's right or wrong for the system, but rather they get to make the choice.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. That's it from me.","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","One might well also ask the question how appropriate is for plans to make multiple times the magnitude of profit on MA patients that all the providers in America do combine, that might be another philosophical question to ask. The fact is, it gets interesting. There is pockets of profitability within healthcare and then you have pockets of loss. For examples, for us about 80% of our patients are Medicare fee-for-service and we lose money on every one of them. It really doesn't make any sense and so you end up having to kind of think of it as an ecosystem, where the plans might look like excessive margin somewhere and then have losses elsewhere, where we take care of some patients and an absolute significant unambiguous loss. In other cases, have higher margins than you would expect us to. So, you've sort of have to end up looking at it as an ecosystem and see if anyone part of it is getting out of balance, because it's hard to get each individual part of it exactly right.","Operator, go ahead with the next question.","Operator","All right. So, we have another question from the line of Mr. Whit Mayo. Sir, your line is now open.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Excuse me, good afternoon. Maybe I missed this, but can you go back to the prior year revenue headwind within DMG or DMG \u2013 was that prior to your issue in the quarter or is this something that you expect to hit in the second half?","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","It was something that we expected to receive and recognize in the second half of the year.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Maybe just help us understand the process around identifying and truing up those claims and what specifically this is?","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","This is not related to claims, this is about revenue and the kind of finalization of revenue with CMS. And we typically bring that in on a cash basis in the second part of the year and our estimate of that was higher than what we now believe that amount to be that we will receive in the back half.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And if you just look at the four buckets that you've outlined I guess the sources of underperformers, if you will, within the be it medical group, the rebranding doesn't seem to be an issue that's probably going to recur into 2017, maybe it does to some extent, the prior year revenue that the stuff happens, but I would imagine that's probably something that doesn't recur next year. So how much of the guide down would you call to be \u2013 would be more from transient factors?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","I think the way you're thinking about it is right, and we don't want go any further into what 2017 would look like, but I think the way you think about it is right.","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","I'll go a tad further than that, because right on the mistake we made in forecasting and unfortunately cut it before we were into that forecasted period, we certainly hope that that doesn't recur. We like everyone else hope that MA enrollment growth is higher the next couple of years than the last couple that's not entirely under our control of course, it depends on what government policy comes out in terms of rates to a great extent. We're working hard to nudge off that fee-for-service growth, so we don't want that to be recurring, and we don't expect it to be recurring in the long run, but we don't know how quickly we're going to be able to either bump it up to take out some of the expenses associated with not having higher growth, and I'm missing the fourth one, but I think you \u2013 you also nailed that one, enough said.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And maybe just remind us, renal ventures, is this included in your guidance at this point and it feels like maybe this deal is taking a little bit longer than maybe we anticipated just an update with the timing of that.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Sure. The answer to the first question is, it is not included as to the timing. We are equally as frustrated and are moving as quickly as we can, we anticipate back in fourth quarter closing. As of now, but as you know that is a moving target.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Any specific reason that just for the hold up on the deal or is it just one of those things, it's out of everyone's control.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","It's normal profit but low for \u2013 I can't exactly tell you why, it's just the normal profit, but it's just gone low it seems that every step of the process.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Understood. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Gary Taylor. Mr. Taylor, your line is now open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good evening. Couple of questions. First on California, will that Arizona divestiture, will that close in third quarter?","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","That was already \u2013 that closed within Q2.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So it's included in the cash flow statement proceeds for the six-month, which is not very much. Can you just remind us then of \u2013 in that market, what the revenue model was in the membership.","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","We don't typically disclose our numbers on a market basis. So I'd refrain from giving you that level of detail, is there more specific question you can ask?","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, I guess, I'm trying to understand what it was you sold and who do you sold it to and what the revenues come out for HCP. Obviously, you said it won't have a much impact on operating income, so apparently it wasn't that profitable, but we do need to model HCP revenues on a go forward basis. So any help there would be good.","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","Gary, absolutely fair questions and we didn't think of that one ahead of time and we don't want to establish \u2013 on the one hand, we don't want to establish new precedent for disclosing things and on the other hand, we don't want to keep it from being able to take care of your model. So, we'll work on it and say, hey, everybody it was a follow-up call can figure out what we can say or not say about the Arizona particulars, but for us to do it spontaneously is a little too nerve-racking.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. On commercial mix, improved about 100 basis points last year, I believe, and I did note that revenue per treatment growth slowed this quarter year-over-year. So, I didn't hear you call anything out. So I'm presuming you're just counting that growth of commercial mix and are we right to think that maybe commercial mix is pretty stable year-over-year, is that down?","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","This is Javier again. So I think you're alluding to, 2014, we disclosed 10% and revenue per treatment was $342 million and 2015 we disclosed 11% revenue $348 million as you saw we're $351 million. We haven't disclosed the mix. So, it's fair to say that stable with a slight pump.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. On the HCP side question. Are any of the rates contractually tied to the health industry fee holiday, in another words, we've heard from some plans that, as they get released in 2017, and not have to pay this industry fee holiday, some of their capitated groups contractually get a bump, because they effectively had to eat, as you did some rate cuts over the last few years. So, this is effectively a net rate increase to the plans and not to have pay this fee. Will HCP benefit contractually from that in 2017?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Again, as it relates to our contracts, there is a \u2013 it's a mixed bag. Some of our contracts will have it flow through, others won't, but in those where it does flow through, there may be some slight pickups there for the one-time period, as you know all the details we're up.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And last question, I believe at Investor Day, you had sized $25 million Medicare headwind for HCP, in 2017. And I wonder if there is any update to that, obviously we're thinking about potential negative impact of the dual risk or model change in some markets, but positive in others and then maybe a little bit of benefit from this industry fee holiday. At this point, is that $25 million still the best number?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","That is still the best number, including all the things you just described.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, all right. Thank you.","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","Thank you, Gary.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Taylor. The next question comes from the line of Ms. Lisa Clive. Ms Clive, your line is now open.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Okay, thanks. Three questions, just the HCP Arizona sale, could you talk to the rational for that? Second question, just on the write downs that we've had on HCP, over the last few quarters, are we at the bottom here or are there potentially more to come and obviously it depends on what your accountants say, but just be helpful to think through that. And then the third question is on the international business you mentioned a goodwill impairment charge, just wondering what the source of that was?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Let me first start on the Arizona divesture. In short, we got a good offer that was presented to us and as we looked at the alternatives, the way that we did invest and deploy our resources for a greater value, it was the right trade-off. So we decided to accept that offer and divest. Jim, you want to touch on the...?","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","In regards to the goodwill impairment that we took in the quarter, as we look forward there is a chance that we will have another impairment. As we disclosed in our 10-Q, we have a negative cushion in our Nevada and Florida markets, and there's a very kind of nuanced and detailed accounting rules around impairment accounting, and so when you have a negative cushion, that means that your fair value is less than your book value. And so if there was any further deterioration in performance or in our outlook of those markets, we could see a further impairment. Additionally, the FASB is looking at changing the rules around accounting for goodwill impairments. When they do that, there may be an effect related to the adoption of those new rules. And then the final part of your question was an international impairment. We did have a small international impairment last year, but we did not have one this year.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Okay. Thanks for that clarification. Just one follow-up on the Arizona deal. Who did you actually sell to?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","I don't know if we're authorized to say. Does anybody around the table know for sure? I don't know the contracts by \u2013 I tell you if you could call in and we'll check in now if it's fine, it's also relatively commonly known in the market in case you know anyone there, but we'd happy to give the answer once we confirm that we were legally allowed to.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Okay, thanks. Yeah, I was just curious as to what sort of entity would give you a good deal to take it off your hands.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Yeah. For us, it was better for us to focus on other markets than that one.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Okay. Thanks for that.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Ms. Clive. We have another question from the line of Ms. Margaret Kaczor. Ma'am, your line is now open.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. I was hoping to start out with exchange plans. Over the last couple of calls, this has been a popular topic for you guys. But now that we're in August, halfway through the year, are you seeing the regulatory environment improving, stabilizing or patients receiving adequate access to care, especially near term? Any trend data that you guys may have would be helpful.","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","Yes. We actually don't have any significant change. The patients are receiving great care. And right now, as we stated earlier in the call, there is a lot to be played, so a lot of rules and enforcement is still to be played, but right now there is nothing different to report than what we told you in Capital Markets Day.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","And I think the way I would put it is that the regulatory agency's capacity to enforce the regulations with respect to exchanges remain weak, either by virtue of lack of motivation because they're worried about the exchange's financial liability or because they just don't have the resources.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Is that something that can change at some point in the next 6 months, 12 months, 18 months?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Yes, it could change and it's likely to change some, but one wouldn't want to pin one's hopes on it changing a lot.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then on your international ventures, how is Asia developing and some of these other countries like Saudi Arabia developing? And then how do you compare those businesses versus some of your clinics in Germany both in terms of patients, investments going forward and profitability profile?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","We're in 11 other countries now and the microeconomics and growth trajectory are different in every one. The good news is that in virtually every one, the microeconomics work at a very reasonable market share position. So, even if we're losing money now in a country just by increasing our scale with the existing achieved microeconomics of our current centers, we know we're on the path to the promise land of, first, being profitable and then, second, having an adequate cumulative return. But the differences are quite large, and Germany and Saudi are two of our more successful markets from many perspectives including the microeconomics. Am I getting to your question?","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Well, and part of it becomes how do you guys bridge to that profitability gap you talked about at the Capital Markets Day, and what impact and how many years really will it take for China to either be material as well as profitable?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","So I don't know is the answer with respect to China. That day is almost certainly outside your investment time horizon, and yet the only way to become a leader in China is to get into China and learn it, very difficult to try to transplant your way in X years later. In China, we'll probably end up with a few partners is the right way to do it. Just as we concluded in Asia, despite the fact that we were doing well in Southeast Asia partnering with Khazanah and Mitsui we thought was going to help us grow faster and better everything from helping us recruit more talent, helping us oversee what we have, helping us interact with the government more and the regulators. So, in all sorts of ways, we learned important lessons, which should make the next five years very different from the last five years, but having said all that, in China in particular, you want to be very careful before you start talking about any bullish forecast because it is one tough place to do business.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, and then one last question. We're trying to balance some of the growth within dialysis, again some of the other companies we cover and what we're noticing is as some of the acute care demand at least for equipment is growing a little bit faster, you are seeing PD growth a little bit faster, so maybe what are you guys seeing in the field, are you actually seeing acute care patients improve in PD, and how does that end up benefiting you guys? Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Yeah, thank you, Margaret. We are seeing our PD grow similarly than our non-acquired growth in in-center, so we're not seeing a disproportionate growth there. And as it relates to our acute business, there is noting that stands out to our historical trend, so it could be that equipment of course is in this line with services and that equipment could be old or someone decides that they want to do some treatments in their hospital and\/or change their staffing ratios and instead of having a room where they conduct dialysis, they want to go bed-to-bed in the hospital, so it's really hard to predict the alignment there, but we're not seeing anything different in our business.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ms. Kaczor. At the moment, speakers, we have no more questions over the phone.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, HealthCare Partners","All right. Thank you very much, everyone, for your interest in DaVita. We'll do our best for you in between now and our next call. Take care.","Operator","Thank you, all speakers.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to DaVita's Q2 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Jim Gustafson, you may begin your call.","Jim Gustafson","Thank you, Candace, and welcome everyone to our second quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Jim Hilger, our interim CFO; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included on our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry","Okay. Thank you, Jim, and welcome to everyone. Thank you for your interest in your company and our company. The second quarter was a rock solid one as probably you already know from looking at the release. We did perform well, clinically, operationally and strategically. And I'll cover a few topics here before we turn it over to Jim. As usual covering clinical outcomes, I'll provide an update on legal proceedings as well and then talk a little bit about our outlook.","First, clinical outcomes. We always present those first because that is what comes first. We are first and foremost a caregiver company, serving now approximately 150,000 patients in the U.S. and some elsewhere, as you know. Rather than provide the normal clinical metrics, I'm going to take a little bit of a different path today and give you a sense of the dynamism and living our core value continuous improvement and just give you a sense of some data that I shared with about 3,000 of our leaders from across America just a few weeks ago.","June was our best month ever in 3 categories: fistulas placed, fistulas in use and day 90 catheters. And looking at Q2 overall, it was the best quarter -- excuse me, the second best quarter ever -- excuse me, the second quarter was the best ever, I can't read my own handwriting, for Kt\/V less than 1.2 and URR less than 65. So in addition to us still looking very good on the normal metrics we report, just wanted to give you a sense of how closely we monitor our continuous improvement for some of those categories we have had improvements every single quarter for over 2 years.","And one of the great things about this is not only does it mean that our patients are experiencing the benefit of higher quality care and better outcomes, but also those improvements in those outstanding absolute and relative levels of clinical performance drive reductions and hospitalizations and surgical procedures and therefore, drive savings to the U.S. health care system, improving our value proposition each and every quarter.","On to the second topic, which is not nearly as positive. Just a brief update on our recently announced legal settlement. We did, as most of you know, agree in principle to settle the Woodard case for $55 million plus attorney's fees and some other related expenses. This was an exceptionally frustrating situation because we do not believe, we nor the physicians prescribing EPO to patients in our clinics to this period, did anything wrong. Please remember, the government thoroughly investigated these allegations on their own and decided not to intervene. But the individual that had filed this suite still had the right to pursue their claims on their own. And the sad fact is that sometimes agreements like this are in your best interest and we respect that.","Third category, our outlook. And here I'm going to take a few minutes to put a fair amount of color around it. Although there is nothing new in what I'm about to say, just important to refresh it every now and then. We are increasing our 2012 operating income guidance to a range of $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion, excluding that second quarter legal accrual. This guidance captures a majority of the probabilistic outcomes, of course, we could fall above or below. Maybe one doesn't fall above, but maybe might fall below and reach above.","Looking out further however, let's restate some of the more significant business risks that you should worry about, because we do, as well as the strengths and upsides that we derive comfort from and you should too.","On the risk side, I will cite 4: a, government reimbursement, no one needs any significant elaboration there; b, commercial patient reimbursement, because it does not only account for 100% of our profits but in fact more because the private patients unfortunately much more than Medicare in order to subsidize the losses we sustain on the 90% of our patients that are government reimbursed, not an optimal system for society but it's the one we live in.","This commercial patient reimbursement remains an area of risk. As a reminder, we just want to say that we may be forced in some cases to turn away patients rather than accept new patients at unacceptable rates and there remains a lot of uncertainty around the impact of exchanges on our private patients as it does for lots of other health care service segments. Item 3 under risk factors, oral drugs will be added to the bundle in 2014 at a currently unknown number. And item #4 under the risk category, our new models of care such as ACOs, Accountable Care Organizations, that everybody's talking about and changing affiliation models for physicians like employment by hospitals, that also everyone is talking about. The bad news, is that when you have new dynamics like this, is that they may well create downside for us. The good news is that they may well create upside and only time will tell.","Moving away from those 4 significant business risks, I'll cite 6 strengths and upsides that you can balance against those risks. Number one, excellent and continuously improving clinical care. That does significantly reduce shareholder risk separate from its consistency with our mission. Second, our steady volume growth. Third, the history of solid cash generation and deployment. Four, a strong national market position. Five, our capability to provide integrated kidney care, which significantly increases quality while decreasing cost and customers more and more open to that kind of improved value proposition and willing to do the administrative work to put it in place. And then finally, number 6, an extension of MSP, although we make no prediction about when that might happen.","So moving away from outlook, maybe give me a 1 moment to cover HealthCare Partners, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter of this year, consistent with what we said before. As we discussed at our Capital Markets Day, integrated care is where we believe the health care book is heading. This is not exactly an insight anymore. It's where a lot of a people think the puck [ph] is heading too and remain very excited about the potential. As we had hoped, the announcement of our combination has precipitated significant additional interest from a bunch of organizations across America and we are working with our wonderful new teammates, the HealthCare Partners, leaders to respond to all that interest.","And I will now turn the call over to Jim Hilger.","James K. Hilger","Thanks, Kent. During the quarter, we experienced strong operating income and cash flow driven by strong treatment growth. Our non-acquired growth was 4.7% when normalized for days of the week. Dialysis revenue per treatment was consistent with the prior quarter and our commercial mix was flat with the first quarter. Dialysis patient care cost per treatment was up about $1.50 from the prior quarter. This increase reflects higher compensation expense, higher travel expense due to our annual national leadership meeting and increased unit cost for Epogen. Please note that EPO utilization was flat with the prior quarter. And based on our conversations with physicians, we continue to expect utilization will be at slightly higher levels going forward. These increases were somewhat offset by lower accruals for self-insurance reserves in the quarter.","Our second quarter dialysis G&A per treatment was down about $1.50 from the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily due to lower professional fee spending and a continued decrease in DSI integration costs as the DSI integration is almost complete.","Note that in the second quarter, we had approximately $10 million in HealthCare Partners transaction related expenses. These expenses and the $6 million of transaction expenses that we incurred in the first quarter are now reflected in our corporate level charges and not in dialysis G&A.","Despite the fact that we had some nonrecurring transaction costs in the quarter, we review -- we view our Q2 operating income to be a fairly representative run rate as we had some other operating items, including favorable insurance accrual true-ups previously mentioned in the quarter to offset these transaction related costs.","On to international. Our international losses in the quarter were $12 million, reflecting higher legal and professional fee expense related to our development efforts. We now expect international losses to be in the mid-$30 millions for 2012. The main drivers for this change are the higher legal and professional fee expenses that I just mentioned, delays in closing certain transactions and our decisions to do -- to not do some deals due to their valuations.","As an update on our international activities. We have recently entered Saudi Arabia, expanded the number of centers in India, and were awarded a second management contract in Singapore and also received a license to operate in Malaysia. In addition, we expect to be operating centers in China in the third quarter. All this underscores what we have said before. While international expansion is a long-term growth opportunity, it will require investment and continued losses in the near term.","Now turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $202 million in the second quarter. We still anticipate full year 2012 operating cash flow will be in the range of $950 million to $1.05 billion. This range includes the expected payment in 2012 of the $78 million legal contingency that we recorded in the quarter.","Now with respect to HCP. After HealthCare Partners' second quarter results are finalized, we will include them in our planned S-3 filing, which hopefully will be filed in the near future. HealthCare Partners continues to perform according to plan and its results are consistent with the 2012 and 2013 EBITDA outlook that we provided in June. First quarter results were strong and we do have an indication that EBITDA in the second quarter will be approximately $135 million. We repeat, this is on-plan and consistent with expectations. But as always, our outlook captures a majority of likely outcomes, but actual results could fall above or below this guidance.","And in regards to the DaVita merger process with HCP, I'm happy to report that the transaction remains on plan. In fact, we're launching our bank financing this week and the bond financing, hopefully later this month or potentially in early September. Demand for this offering appears strong. In fact, we have already received commitments for 95% of our Term Loan A.","And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo Securities.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess maybe just to step back to some of your comments on the G&A line. Was the $10 million that was included in G&A or that was not included in G&A? I'm sorry, that just wasn't clear.","James K. Hilger","Gary, that $10 million is reported in our G&A line in our financial statements. But in the supplemental data, in our press release, what you'll see is the $10 million is now reported in our corporate level charges and not in dialysis G&A and that's for purposes of segment reporting.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then what was the amount of the med mal true-up?","Kent J. Thiry","We're not breaking out the different insurance trips. It was in a couple of different categories, Gary. But in aggregate, it offset a bunch of the transaction expenses.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess big picture since you announced the HCP acquisition, obviously the Supreme Court ruled in favor of healthcare reforms. I guess can you talk about the HCP acquisition in that context and do you feel better or worse or any different about the acquisition post that decision?","Kent J. Thiry","I think the most important response is that it wasn't a big deal either way. There were some upsides and downsides in each direction. And we think independent of the specifics of that decision, that the trend is clear. The demand is clear, the need is clear. Having said all that, reforms staying in place probably means that ACOs and some other organizations that we think reinforce the need for what HealthCare Partners does differentially well, probably accelerates those. And so is a net incremental positive. On the other hand, if it had been repealed, there were some immediate P&L pickups that would've been kind of nice, but not strategically essential. So I think it's a slight positive. We've got, Matthew, the CFO of HealthCare Partners, here. Matthew, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?","Matthew Mazdyasni","That was perfect. That's the way we look at it based on that decisions.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two things. I wanted to just talk a little bit about international. I understand you've increased your losses. Can you just share with us the revenue and loss contribution from international in the second quarter? And I guess just maybe some forward-looking comments on the number of clinics that are in the works here for the back half of the year just so we can put the international losses into more perspective.","Kent J. Thiry","Well let me talk about the number of centers and then Jim will respond to what you asked about the revenues and expenses, to the extent we're prepared to do that. I think the number of centers we had approximately in Q1 was about 15. Now it's about 19. And there's some more in the pipeline. But with deals, particularly international deals, when you're learning, like we are, you can never be too sure if and when they're going to close. And so there's more variability than we're used to in the domestic side of the business. So on the center level and patient level, the growth is chugging along with some fits and starts. Is that responsive for you on the center and patient volume side?","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. No, I think so. I mean, I guess you've given us a flavor for some new countries that you'll be in. So I think that's good. Maybe just some numbers on international and then I just had a question on HCP if I could?","Kent J. Thiry","Okay, we will come back to HCP.","James K. Hilger","Darren, the -- on international, still very early days as we've just getting under -- our feet underneath those. But our revenue in the second quarter was approximately $4 million. And we had a heavy professional fee expense that really the transaction that we're working on, that resulted in the approximately $12 million in losses in the quarter.","Kent J. Thiry","And maybe, Gary, before we go to your HCP question. If I read into your questions about international, a broader, higher-level question, which is are we happy with the level of P&L expense versus the current reality and trajectory of revenue and operating contribution from centers. The answer to that question is no. On to HCP.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. Fair enough. So HCP, I guess the question, thanks for giving us the EBITDA numbers, which look pretty much in a band with what we saw from Q1. But I guess the question here, is this somewhat volatile reporting season for managed care? And we did hear a little bit about some volatility in the MA books of the some of the other companies in the managed care space. So I guess just maybe a broad comment or 2, if you would, on HCP's performance in the context of what you saw relative to how you priced PMPMs. Matt, I know you're in the room, so any sort of broad brush commentary you can say about the performance of HCP and what looks to be a little bit more of a difficult operating environment for your managed care partners there.","Kent J. Thiry","Let me take a cut at answering and then Matthew will correct any mistakes. That some of the trends being discussed by others are a result of their PPO books of business. And our book of business is dominantly on the HMO side, which has very low out-of-pocket expenses, et cetera. And therefore, utilization tends not to be as affected either way. Meaning, it didn't go down in the last few years because of recessionary effects or any of the other effects that are often cited, nor would it therefore go back up to much more steady state because the economics of our base of business just don't change in the way that the books of business that are being commented on by others change. Having said that, I will now turn to the person who taught me all that, Matthew.","Matthew Mazdyasni","Thank you, Kent. I think that's accurate. And the way we look at this is in the managed care, even the very small co-pay and coinsurances that these patients have and some of the health plans, as you know, have changed their benefit. That even hasn't changed any utilization and we tracked that. Especially for the Medicare Advantage population because the Medicare Advantage population normally have very, very small co-pay and coinsurance. And they're really -- the physician is in control of the utilization. So we have not experienced any trend like what these health plans have been reporting. Our exposure to -- we don't have any PPO that's capitated for us or we take any risk, whatsoever, on that book of business. Those are all based on fee-for-service.","Kent J. Thiry","I'll make one other point, Gary, because it's so important and we made in our Capital Markets Day but this kind of underlines it, which is one of the reasons that we chose HealthCare Partners is because how strong their clinical emphasis is. And they proactively pursue trying to identify what chronic conditions patients have and then proactively try to get them more time with the doctor. And that's all because keeping people healthy is the most powerful long-term economic driver. But this is yet another reason why some of these microeconomic or microbehavioral factors that other plans or delivery models refer to, don't affect us because what our doctors think is right for the patients and our care manager thinks is right for the patients is totally unaffected by anybody's deductible or co-pay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I was wondering, Kent, if you might give us some insights into some of the potential partners that have approached you after the HCP deal, whether it relates to size or geography and if there's things there that are of -- whether near-term or maybe 2013 -- interest?","Kent J. Thiry","I think I can't give a useful answer because we've been contacted by organizations from all geographies and all sizes, contacted by both payers and delivery organizations, both hospital-oriented and physician-led. So it's pretty much runs the whole gamut along all the categories you cited. Which ones of those will turn into partnerships and done deals and new business, of course, time will tell. But it's been very encouraging nonetheless.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Kent, do you view that as more sort of partnerships as opposed to acquisition opportunities or also again, same answer?","Kent J. Thiry","Same answer. It's just so early on. It's certainly, some of both and we're certainly open to both. But, boy, it's way too early in the game to start getting more specific.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And one other question, if I may. I know in the past, you'd invested aggressively in IT infrastructure in an attempt to build out your capabilities on the accountable care side. Have you been able to get a better understanding of how HCP may allow you to taper some of that or are you still learning how those 2 systems will dovetail and what you may need because we didn't see a real change there in trajectory on those investments it appears this quarter?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. Fair. Very fair observation. The short answer is no. We do not expect the combination of the 2 companies is going to lead to any change in IT spending in either company. There's too many differences and both of them are so busy adding to their capabilities for their different businesses that it would not make economic nor strategic sense to divert talent to try to pick up minor synergies. So you're not going to see any relief in the IT math on either side.","Operator","And your next question comes from Matt Weight with Feltl and Company.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Kent, last quarter, EPO utilization was flat. It was flat again here in the second quarter. It sounds like you're still expecting it to be slightly up. Is this continuing just to be from what physicians are saying or is there some hard evidence this is occurring?","Kent J. Thiry","I know it's what physicians are saying. I do not know of any actual trend but there could be one because it's not something that I'm necessarily conversant on over the last 4 to 8 weeks, particularly given the general consensus from what a lot of docs are saying, which tends to typically end up being true. We, with our physician community, have been experimenting and exploring and comparing different anemia management protocols and since that work continues even as we speak, it's kind of hard to get any more definitive. But the answer to your question is, it's from my point of view, totally based on what doctors are saying, perhaps just someone else in the room that as the call proceeds, will be able to answer more specifically with respect to any hard data trends.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And then just the only other question here with the Woodward settlement there. Is there any potential to see some reduced G&A spend with presumably lower legal compliance?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, certainly. The spending on that lawsuit will go way, way down and away very, very quickly and so that's a definite pickup and a nontrivial pickup. Whether or not anything else is going to ramp up and keep us at the prior level, I actually don't know for sure because each of the different major legal issues tends to ebb and flow. And so, I can definitely assert there will be a pickup in nice savings. I just don't know if anything else is going to pop up to offset it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I appreciated the numbers on HealthCare Partners for the EBITDA this quarter. Do you have the number for the previous year quarter? I don't think that was disclosed in the proxy?","James K. Hilger","We have not disclosed the Q2 2011 numbers yet nor have we disclosed other than giving you an indication of how Q2 2012 was going to result. We will have that in our S-3 filing, but that is still being prepared and those numbers are still being finalized.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, Kent, in your comments, you made some comments about integrated kidney care and how that more payers are open to that type of structure. I guess that it would include commercial payers. Are you seeing -- or do you actually have more kind of larger bundled type contracts with commercial right now, is that something that's going on, or is it in discussion stages?","Kent J. Thiry","Nothing significant has happened. And I would assert that you shouldn't presume that anything material will happen on the commercial side within your investment timeframe. So it's really good for hopefully reinforcing the fact that we're differentially effective in managing total cost. And hopefully, that will buy us some incremental patient volume and security on our current rates with the right annual inflation increases. So I think most of the economic value tied to that conversation is going to be embedded in those 2 things as opposed to expecting any big, commercial, globally capitated contract anytime in your investment time frame.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then it sounds like you're experiencing [ph]  A little bit more losses in the International business now, but you obviously raised the guidance. What were the drivers to the guidance range?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, I don't have a good concise answer for that one. Why don't you let us play with it a little bit while we answer the questions and see if we can be useful and organized. It was pretty broad based, which is why we didn't cite any 1 or 2 drivers. But let us reflect a little bit as we move through the call.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, capital deployment. Obviously, you have some pretty big capital deployment by year-end. Should we just assume that cash kind of builds up on the balance sheet after you do some of the smaller U.S. and international deals that you kind of always do? Or is there room to do things like share repurchase, et cetera, between now and year end or is just cash building up for that the most logical use?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. A very fair question. I think we just can't answer anything other than the normal generic way we have for 10 years, that we take deployment -- the generation and deployment of cash as your sacred trust in us. And every quarter, we look a lot at how much leverage is appropriate given the near-term outlook and debt rates, whether or not this is the right time to repurchase stock. Are we likely to do a bunch of acquisitions? How much cushion should we have? And so, I just don't think that it's a good idea for us to start predicting what's going to happen with our cash balance over the next x months. Because the fact is, whatever prediction we have today could change tomorrow because of all those other factors and our desire and long-standing inclination to be nimble and responsive. So I don't mean to avoid the question. But I think we just better stay away from it because it's so darn situational.","Operator","And your next question comes from Gary Taylor of Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two quick ones on dialysis, first. Other revenue was up $20 million sequentially. Were acquisitions a part of that or what else was driving that sequential revenue growth?","James K. Hilger","It's principally DaVita Rx.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So that's a big sequential jump, was there a new contract or something that...","James K. Hilger","DaVita Rx just continues to expand at a pretty steady rate. We're very pleased with our performance.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Understandably. And then the other dialysis question is really since, I guess, the bundled payment rules got finalized, you've really had some much higher acquisition activity that just continued last quarter, this quarter, another 33 centers. Is your outlook that you can continue that really substantial pace through the rest of this year. And is the primary driver still just the change of payment model and small guys getting out?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, first, what we expect for the balance of this year is incorporated into our adjusted guidance with all the normal caveats around it. Second, it is so difficult to predict when more people are going to want to sell and with what intensity are they going to want to sell it, at what prices are they going to be willing to sell. So I don't know that we've demonstrated a lot of confidence in predicting that over the last few years. It is certainly the case, however, that what you said is true. That lots of the smaller players with everything that's going on in the country and everything that's going on with government spending and everything that's going on with health care, that you have more of the small players who are saying this is a reasonable time to exit and\/or find a stable and value-added partner. So I think there's going to continue to be deals, but whether or not it's going to continue at the pace that we've enjoyed for the last 1.5 years or so, we just don't know.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Last question is on HCP and maybe I'll direct this towards Matt. We're just trying to understand the risk contracts a little better, particularly the California contracts that you've disclosed in the filings, where Europe bookings shared savings but not really booking the gross per member per month revenue. And so I kind of have 2 questions around that. One, do you have the same risk in those contracts as you do on the capitated contracts? So if total medical expense exceeds the per member per month, do you take losses on those contracts? Or are you broadly capped? And secondly, there's about $800 million of managed revenue under various shared saving type contracts that is not being booked as revenue. I guess how much of your booked revenue represents shared savings earnings from that $800 million of managed revenue?","Kent J. Thiry","Just give us 1 second here to confirm before we respond. Hold on 1 second.","Matthew Mazdyasni","Gary, those are fair questions so in California, because we don't have what's called a [indiscernible] license, we are not capitated by the health plan for what's referred to as institutional risk. So those risks are being capped by the HMOs. And then, we have various risk share arrangement with them that those are confidential information at what risk we have. As far as the number you quoted for the managing the institutional, that number is what we are still managing that care. However, what you're recognizing in our financial statement for California is the net results.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And is that a figure as it impacts your revenue line that you'll ever disclose for us?  I guess we're -- obviously, we're just trying to be in a position to model that better.","Kent J. Thiry","We're still sorting out what's going to be the right way for us to report so that you guys get all the information you need to make your decisions. And at the same time, we don't sacrifice any competitive advantage or limit our ability to add future value for you in how we contract. So we're still sorting that out and, of course, the deal is not even closed yet, even though we're working very closely together in driving towards the future together. So I think on that one, you just have to wait a few more months.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just following up on Gary's line of questioning. Generally speaking, how direct or not is the relationship between the gross rates received by, say, a Medicare Advantage payor and the rate that HealthCare Partners gets, either in a traditional model or what you're doing in California and other places?","Kent J. Thiry","All of our Medicare Advantage contracts are as a percentage of what CMS pay the health plans. So I would say it has a very direct relationship or correlation with that.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And generally speaking, in years past, let's say, when pricing was not so good, what did -- what's the -- because you guys look like you just performed right through all cycles. But what steps are -- what levers are there if -- let's look at 2013 with sequestration or 2014 with MLR regs and what have you. What -- generally what levers are there for you? Because you're already operating at a very high level with your cost performance. What additional levers are there on the margin side to manage through a negative pricing cycle?","Matthew Mazdyasni","As far as our activities, I mean, every single day, we have ideas by our providers and physicians and care management and clinical people how we can do this with a higher quality service and reduced cost. So we still are very bullish at our ability to reduce cost for Medicare Advantage patients. So from that point of view, I think we feel and I think we have Incorporated that in our projections, that fee for service equivalence reduction on the Medicare, we still -- the results are we continue doing very well on Medicare Advantage.","Kent J. Thiry","And what I'll add to that is, you are pointing towards some of the sort of structural and programmatic risk on the revenue side. Parts of our cost structure are directly contractually linked to CMS reimbursements. So the cost structure adopts proportionate to the revenue structure for a subset of the business. In addition, when Medicare revenue economics are bad, that tends to affect the entire health care arena, hospitals, nurse and other caregiver and physician compensation expectations, et cetera. So there is a less direct, meaning, not contractual linkage between revenue and cost structure. But nonetheless, a very real one. None of this, in what Matthew said and what I'm adding, means that we're totally buffered. We don't mean to suggest that. Rather, there are some significant offsets and those are 3 of the categories in which you find them.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Sure. And that is a great help. Just a couple of little additional things. In your mind, generally speaking, if you looked at the 100 largest markets in the U.S., are there structural -- because 1 of the critiques we hear is well, they've done great in laboratory perfect conditions with high Medicare rates and physicians willing to play ball. But as you look across the U.S. you think about exporting this model, you think about your M&A. Do you find any huge structural barriers? Is it going to work in 25% of the markets, 50% of the markets, 10%? How do you think about the opportunity to export the model beyond the states that you're in?","Matthew Mazdyasni","Well, that's a fair question, John. So I'm going to answer it from 2-point of view. One is that Medicare Advantage and managed care in your traditional HMO. We still feel that there is tremendous opportunity there and also the population health. We also are trying with this Accountable Care Organization, which is basically incorporating the population health and all the things that we do with evidence-based medicine in a fee-for-service environment. That's both Medicare and the commercial. So we look at the opportunities are endless out there, both in the markets that they are not producing the kind of quality service and cost that we're producing on HMO and the markets that they this fragmented fee-for-service and there is no metric on equality and service. So we see the potential is incredibly rich out there for what we do.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is the -- I think you mentioned this before, but please remind me. I guess in our simplistic mind, the 85% MLR mandate should increase the demand for what you do because you're able to solve a problem with your customer, your upstream customer? Is that a good way to think about it, or is that -- are we missing something?","Matthew Mazdyasni","I think I'd look at it a little bit differently. I'd look at it that we're at this position, that anything that health plans pays us is calculated towards their MLR. We are not under any MLR rules or restriction. Therefore, the opportunity is to give us even more opportunity to take the entire risk. And for that, the HMOs can include that in part of their MLR.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. So I think the -- what Matthew is saying is, your assessment is correct and he's talking about some of the reasoning why it is. At the same time, we don't think it's any reason to start dramatically changing forecasts of anything. The world is too complicated for that. But directionally, your hypothesis is correct and then he's talking about the next level of detail as to how they think about it.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And you guys mentioned before that I think maybe some of us made the mistake of thinking you're like this captive Kaiser model and all the doctors are employed. And you mentioned that a lot of the doctors are essentially just contract. Have you -- did I miss this, have you provided a breakout of employed versus contracted doctors? And is that something that you have a preference for one way or the other?","Kent J. Thiry","We actually love both. The fact is it's wonderful to have a foundation of employed doctors because that means the level of operating integration and mission alignment and all the rest is just so, so tight. At the same time, in order to have a superior value proposition to the patients and to the payors, having network physicians around and in between employed leads to just a higher value products. So we're always going to have both because it works best. In addition, in many instances, the affiliated docs who end up subsequently becoming employed docs once they have gotten comfortable and familiar with the mission alignment and the basic operating competence and economic fairness. So that would be my response. Matthew?","Matthew Mazdyasni","Yes. And I would add to that the difference is Kaiser employed all of their physicians. We appeal to both group of physician. The physicians who want to be employed and the physician who wants to stay independent and just contract with us for all of the services that we bring to them, the hospital list, the after-hours care, all kind of things that we do. So we are comfortable, as Kent said, with both group, and we don't mind growing in each segment from that point of view.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I don't think I heard a direct comment on this, maybe you gave it. But can you elaborate more on the second quarter EBITDA number with HCP, just the 135, when I square that with the 150 it's obviously lower on a sequential basis. So anyway to put that number in context for us? We obviously don't have the benefit of seeing some of the details behind that.","James K. Hilger","Well, we're not prepared to go into a detailed breakdown on the differences between the quarters. But suffice to say, that we did view Q1 as a strong quarter, but within plan. And our full year of guidance remains unchanged. Q2 is in line with what we had expected. And again, our guidance for the year remains unchanged.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And you mentioned that you plan on launching the financing pretty soon, maybe this is public and I've missed it. But any details with how you're thinking about the structure of the debt financing between bank debt and bonds at this point?","James K. Hilger","Yes. We hope to raise approximately $3 billion in bank debt. And some of that in Term Loan A and some Term Loan B. And then in addition to that, we expect to raise roughly $1 billion in notes. And the term -- the split between the Term Loan A and Term Loan B will be somewhat dependent upon demand. But we are currently expecting a little more Term Loan A than B.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And it's probably a little too premature to ask sort of what the indications of interest are in terms of rates.","James K. Hilger","Well, in our S-4 filing, which I point you to, we had to use pro forma rate of 5.24%, including swap rates for the overall debt that we'd be raising from the new debt.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's helpful. And maybe one last question here, maybe fair, unfair, not sure how you want to look at it. But not to undermine or belittle Jim's contribution. But, Kent, maybe, can you talk a little bit about where you are in the search for a full-time CFO and what the timetable looks like to bring someone onboard? I'm sure there are a lot of kind of variables at play there.","Kent J. Thiry","No. I appreciate the straightforwardness of the question. And the fact is we've just started the search. And actually, let me go back and you may want to ask a follow-up question, but I want to go back to a question that was asked maybe 15 minutes ago and try to be a little more helpful. As you look at our cash and our balance sheet, perhaps the way to shed some more light on where that question was going, is post deal close, our leverage ratio will be 3.7, that is slightly outside our historical range of 3 to 3.5. But of course we've always said there will be times when we're below and times when we're above. That is a fairly small amount above and even if we do quite a few acquisitions, we will delever to be beneath it relatively quickly. This means our ability to have the full spectrum of options with respect to cash deployment, which means acquisitions versus debt paydown, versus share buyback, will continue to exist throughout this entire period because in the right situation, we're not averse to being above 3.7. However, we love the fact that absent any significant opportunities for cash -- deploying cash elsewhere, we'll delever beneath that quite quickly. Now back to the CFO question. Did I -- I think I answered the one you asked, is there anything else you wanted to know?","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Well, you said that the process has really just begun and I was kind of curious if there is -- the board if you had a conversation with the board in terms of timetables with which you'd like to bring someone onboard?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Any way to elaborate any further on that?","Kent J. Thiry","No, I don't mean to be cute. Yes, the board and I have had lots of conversations. And yes we've talked about different timetables. And no, I don't think it's a good idea to share it. It's so unpredictable to figure out when you're going to make decisions in an important search process. And so I just don't think there's any particular upside in doing that and a lot of downside.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. Kent, I was wondering if on the dialysis side, have you seen any integrated care pilot programs with any of the commercial payors?","Kent J. Thiry","Can you ask the question again I missed the first part. My bad.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Are there any integrated care pilots that you guys are participating in with the managed-care payors?","Kent J. Thiry","On the commercial side?","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes.","Kent J. Thiry","Well, yes, is the short answer, and have been for some time doing some work with some commercial payors on integrated care. It's not globally capitated, but a number of different arrangements where we do stuff beyond dialysis to manage the patient in a more holistic way and one way or another we get compensated for it.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So that's been going on for some time. Can you say about how long these pilots have been going on?","Kent J. Thiry","I wouldn't call them pilots because they're just basic contractual arrangements with a small number of commercial payors. And it's been years. The good news is it's been years and we've generated good results for those payors. The bad news is it's never really caught on and grown to be material enough to talk about to you. But we appreciate the question.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Got it. Now your big competitor mentioned it today on their call and I thought there might have been some new pilot that rolled out but I guess not. And then, I know someone else asked the question about the integrated care RFP from Medicare. Do you have any idea on the timing? And what about the size, have you caught wind of anything new out of Washington?","Kent J. Thiry","Short answer is no. It's still very little guidance on what the specs will be and that's, of course, just discussing the first draft and then what emerges subsequent to a comment period or all the interaction even more difficult to predict.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then, what about the home therapies? It sounds like -- can you give us any update on how home dialysis is trending for you, specifically PD versus home hemo?","Kent J. Thiry","Both PD and the home hemo are growing and we will repeat what we've said for quite some time, which is that there are folks who have a vested interest in pushing one or the other of those modalities and talk about glorious clinical and economic results from increased utilization and forecast amazing growth. And then there are others who have a vested interest in other modalities and are very critical of what those outcomes are and issues of self-selection and are quite skeptical of any differential economic or clinical performance across the broad patient population. We are totally impartial. We do more of them than anyone in America and we are still learning a lot every quarter about what subsegments of the patient population benefit. And if there is a clinical benefit for the patient, at what cost to society does that benefit come, is it higher, lower or the same? So they are both growing and we remain incredibly curious and eager to keep generating clinical insights and economic insights every year. Did I answer the question?","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes, yes. That's helpful. And just one last one on HCP. We understand that HealthCare Partners is a standalone business versus the dialysis business. But is there anything within HCP's integrated care model that you can take out and maybe apply to the dialysis business, especially when we've seen an expanded bundle or integrated care program rolled out from Medicare?","Kent J. Thiry","We are going to have a very intense session very soon comparing what we do in integrated care with kidney care patients to what they do because they have over 1,000 of those types of patients in their delivery model already. So there'll be some very rigorous idea sharing there at a  superficial level, we do a lot of the same things, which is no surprise. But there could be some nice learning at the second or third level. Beyond that, there is nothing obvious that jumps out and would be economically material. But who knows as we go through the next year or 2 of what learnings might flow in each direction as we work in different ways with the same payers, some of the same doctors, some of the same integrated delivery systems. So we are sure there's going to be some more real insight sharing back and forth. We're just not sure when and in what area.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Matt Weight with Feltl and Company.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Just one follow-up question on HCP for Matt here and it's more of a process question. Matt, when new members come on during the annual enrollment period, Medicare Advantage fully capitated, how long does it typically take you to cycle through these members so you can understand their health status, get the risk code accurate, send it on CMS so you can ultimately get a higher risk score or higher reimbursement for those members?","Matthew Mazdyasni","That's a fair question. So what we try to do in the first 30 days that the member has signed up, we want that member to come to our physicians, whether those are employee physicians or contracted physician, and have a full physical on -- at the same time, while we are asking for the medical record from the previous providers for those new patients to be transferred. So usually, is much shorter than 30 days. But our goal is within the first 30 days, have that patient has a very comprehensive physical exam done.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","So would you say that after the first year, those new members are running profitability rates similar to what you would, say, existing members are?","Matthew Mazdyasni","I think it's hard to predict. Every market, every population is different. So I wouldn't say it might -- some patients, it might take us day 1, some patient it takes us a little but longer. What we care about is what I refer to as if they are deferred care that we need to provide and sometimes, recovering, if you will, for those deferred  care might take 3 months, or 6 months, or 1 year. But the key is to find out all the issues with the patient and have a treatment plan and refer them to the right specialist or right treatment plan and caregiver and care education.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I was just surprised because I was under the assumption that CMS only updates risk scores twice a year. So if somebody came on in January. I would've expected that maybe it would be difficult to get an updated risk score that quickly in March.","Matthew Mazdyasni","You are absolutely right as far as the risk score for the purpose of paying us, but we like to capture all the -- because risk score is a proxy for all the conditions, chronic conditions, that the patient have. That is the most important thing for us, which is capturing those chronic conditions so we can develop a treatment plan for these patients.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to our presenter for closing remarks.","Kent J. Thiry","All right. Thank you very much for your interest in DaVita HealthCare Partners. We will work hard for you over the next 90 days and look forward to talking to you again then. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remark there will be question-and-answer period. Thank you.","Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference.","Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Jenny, and welcome everyone to our third quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning those risks and uncertainties, please refer to our third quarter earnings release out earlier today and our SEC filings including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release filed with the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Jim and thanks everyone for joining our call. Before we get into the specifics of our Q3 financial performance and outlook, we'll start as we always do with our clinical performance. First within the DaVita Medical Group, the opioid epidemic, of course, is getting a great amount of publicity and appropriately so. Our Everett Clinic in Washington was recently awarded with the Washington State Medical Association's highest award for patient safety because of their work in this category. We had an amazingly robust program where we implemented pain scarring tools, risk assessment, urine screen and trainings supporting for providers. And were recognized by the community for the exemplary leadership that we demonstrated.","Within DaVita Kidney Care, it's a good time to step back and stare at our cumulative accomplishment in the area of integrated care. If you look at the C-SNIPs that we've been involved with for 10 years or so, the outcomes are simply outstanding, just to name a few. 25% reduction in hospitalizations, 49% fewer readmissions, 66% lower CBC rates compared to the national average, et cetera, et cetera. And the recent ESCO data both from us and others further reaffirms the value, the potential, both clinical and economic, of integrated care. It is all relevant not only clinically for our community but for our shareholders as well because it seriously supports and reinforces the arguments for our PATIENTS Act where we'd build on these existing vehicles to really scale those integrated care accomplishment.","As many of you probably noted, the bill was reintroduced with bipartisan support in the House and Senate in just the last couple of weeks. This proposal is scalable, it's sustainable, does not penalize high-quality providers like DaVita, and it gives nephrologist flexible and substantive participation options, more on that in the quarters to come.","But now I'll turn it over to Joel Ackerman to discuss DaVita Medical Group.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Kent. Good afternoon. For the third quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had an adjusted operating loss of $5 million, which excludes a $601 million non-cash goodwill impairment and other non-GAAP items.","Before I discuss the drivers of this disappointing outcome, let me start by saying that we recognize that the business is not achieving our capital return expectations nor is it contributing to OI growth. We recognize the skepticism investors will have right now as a result, but we remain confident that the operational changes we are making will result in improved financial performance in the future.","As a reminder, this business has a disproportionately high amortization load, $45 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 million related to the acceleration of our branding initiative and depreciation of $16 million for the quarter. Therefore, this quarter's adjusted operating loss of $5 million translates into an adjusted EBITDA of $55 million for the quarter.","The outcome this quarter is primarily the result of two drivers. First, higher than expected medical costs, which represents about $30 million of impact. This is largely of the result of two things; increased utilization, driven by higher patient acuity than we have seen in the past; and by true-ups of prior period costs that impact our shared savings result. We anticipate the higher acuity seen during the year will result in increased revenue of approximately $30 million in 2018 as the new diagnoses of these patients will be reflected in our 2018 reimbursement.","Second, the finalization of prior year Medicare Advantage payments, which we have historically received in the third quarter, was delayed by CMS. For your reference, this was a $13 million item in 2016. Despite this underperformance, we continue to make operational progress on the four drivers of improvement we laid out at our Capital Markets Day.","However, the financial impact of these operational changes have yet to show up in our results. Of particular note, during Q3, we announced the restructuring that eliminated 350 non-clinical positions in DMG. We expect the resulting annualized savings to be approximately $40 million per year starting in 2018.","Looking forward, we now expect full year 2017 adjusted operating income for DMG to be in the range of $50 million to $85 million. We plan to give 2018 DMG OI guidance in February on our fourth quarter earnings call. While we're not giving specific 2018 guidance at this time, we expect that DMG's 2018 operating income will be up from 2017 adjusted operating income for several reasons.","First, we expect $40 million in savings next year from the recent restructuring, as I just mentioned. Second, $30 million of revenue increases that reflect the patient acuity increase, as I mentioned before. Third, we expect to benefit from four risk contracts that have or are near signing in our new markets. Finally, we've been making progress in re-contracting with payers in our legacy markets and have signed or substantively agreed with payers on improvements in terms covering approximately 25% of existing Medicare Advantage risk business.","Overall, we're optimistic about our ability to drive increased revenue per member per month in 2018. We expect all of the above should more than offset the 2018 Medicare Advantage rate headwinds we have previously disclosed. For 2019 operating income, we continue to see reasonable scenarios that deliver operating income greater than $200 million through the four levers we discussed at our May Capital Markets Day despite the reduced expectations for 2017.","Now I will turn it over to Javier Rodriguez to discuss Kidney Care.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon. Before I go into the quarterly result, I want to take a moment to recognize the amazing caregivers responded to the hurricanes and floods during the past quarter. As the leader of Kidney Care, I am so proud of the team's passion, dedication, compassion and professionalism in a time of real crisis. From working multiple shifts back-to-back to rescuing stranded patients in their boat so they can be dialyzed, to traveling cross-country to allow the local team to take care of their displaced families. It was truly an inspiring period with heroic behavior from very caring teammates.","Now onto the quarter. We had solid results for Kidney Care business. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $404 million, up approximately $3 million or 1% versus the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra treatment day. Our adjusted operating income included the negative financial impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma, which we estimate to be approximately $7 million of higher cost and approximately $7 million of lost contribution from missed treatment and uncollected revenue from disruption to our billing process.","The hurricane negatively impacted our non-acquired growth by approximately 25 basis points for the quarter, leaving our non-acquired growth for the quarter at 3.3%. We continue to expect non-acquired growth to be within the range of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis, although we will likely be near the lower end of the range for 2017.","Revenue per treatment for U.S. dialysis and lab business was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, and we expect revenue per treatment to essentially remain flat for the fourth quarter. Our patient care cost was up approximately $1.76 per treatment quarter-over-quarter, which, as mentioned, approximately $1 of that per treatment was due to the hurricane impact.","Now I'm going to transition to proactively address three topics: charitable premium assistance, payer contracting and guidance. Let me start with charitable premium assistance. As you know, we recently released information concerning our exposure to charitable premium assistance. I want to take this opportunity to summarize the four most important points.","Point number one, charitable premium assistance has been critical support for the neediest patients, who are forced to navigate through an extremely complicated insurance environment. Point number two, we think charitable premium assistance is unlikely to go away for many reasons. Point number three, even if charitable premium assistance were to go away for dialysis patients, we believe that a large number of patients would likely retain their existing coverage, despite facing significant financial hardship. Point number four, if this unlikely scenario plays out, we estimate approximately $100 million to $250 million of downside risk to our annual operating income. Because we provided a lot of color in our press releases, I will leave additional comment for Q&A.","For the last couple of quarters, we have also received some questions around the payer environment, so I want to provide additional color and try to be as helpful as I can.","As we review the portfolio for 2018, we don't see anything to call out as unusual. So can I provide a little bit more detail? What does this mean? Four out of our five largest payers have rates locked in for the next two to three years, and we're currently negotiating the fifth in the normal cadence of renewals. For the smaller regional players, we continue to have normal give-and-takes in negotiations, so some will end up and some will end up down.","On to guidance. For 2017, we're tightening our adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.6 billion from the previous guidance of $1.565 billion to $1.625 billion. The new range includes the negative financial impact of the hurricane.","Next, given there are so many moving pieces in the business, we want to be as helpful as I can here and break from the recent practices of providing guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call.","First, a reminder. We will have a year-over-year accounting headwind of $100 million in 2018 for our recent transition to 401(k) match program. Nevertheless, we expect operating income for the Kidney Care business to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in 2018.","In our guidance, it's worth calling out three elements, which we have considered in the forecast, but they're harder to handicap. Number one, open enrollment for ACA plans. Given all the regulatory uncertainty, it's hard for us to forecast individual patient decisions.","Point number two, cost of the MEDICs. We don't have clarity around price, cost and volume yet.","And then lastly, advocacy in California. As you know, the labor unions have proposed a ballot initiative that would significantly alter our economics in the state of California. If they decide to proceed with the initiative, we might have to incur significant onetime costs in 2018 to support our advocacy efforts, which we have not included in our stated guidance range.","Longer term, we continue to expect the multiyear trajectory to be consistent with what we said at Capital Markets Day earlier this year. Now I'll give it back to Joel to discuss international.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Javier. For this quarter, adjusted international operating losses were $8 million, which includes $1 million foreign exchange loss and excludes higher equity losses of $6 million due to goodwill impairment at the APAC joint venture and restructuring charges of $3 million. This restructuring charge is related to a reorganization of our international operating structure to improve efficiency and reduce our G&A by eliminating some redundancy across the global, regional and country level.","We expect this restructuring to save approximately $6.5 million per year in international cost starting in 2018. For full year 2017, we reaffirm international OI guidance we provided last quarter.","Looking forward, we continue to expect to reach breakeven internationally during 2018. As we said last quarter, whether we achieve breakeven for the full year of 2018 will largely be a function of our acquisition pace for the rest of 2017. As mentioned in Capital Markets Day, we're building a solid platform for growth in our international businesses.","Finally, some comments on cash generation and capital deployment. Operating cash flow was $553 million in the quarter and $1.56 billion year-to-date. Cash flow continues to be strong despite the adverse impact of a temporary increase in DSO of four days over the last two quarters due to the following; as a reminder, one day of DSO translates to approximately $30 million in operating cash flow. So the four days were the result of three things. First, receivables inherited in the Renal Ventures acquisition, which contributed about 1.5 days; second, delays in submitting claims from centers impacted by the hurricanes, which contributed another 1.5 days; and third, normal fluctuations, which contributed one day. We expect our DSOs to decline three to four days over the next few quarters as we work through these items.","Separate from these short-term DSO increases, we have also seen a structural increase of dialysis and lab DSOs of approximately three days over the past year due to changes we have made to our collection processes. These include changes to our billing processes for government payers, anticipating changes in regulatory requirements as well as changes in billing frequency for certain commercial payers to reduce collection costs at the expense of a slight increase in working capital. We continue to expect operating cash flow for 2017 to be in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion.","Now, over to Kent for a few closing comments.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Joel. I'd like to offer a few thoughts on three topics. Number one, DMG; number two, CPA; number three, capital deployment with respect to share buybacks. While it was a solid quarter for Kidney Care, it was an extremely disappointing quarter at the DaVita Medical Group, as you no doubt, have already noted.","It is difficult at this point to find any words that are useful to the capital markets given our continuous failure to meet the expectations we have previously set. This reality is exacerbated by the fact we still believe in the value and potential of these assets and teams. Nonetheless, the results are the results.","We are intensely focused on affecting a change in the burden that DMG performance is placing on the enterprise, your enterprise, through both strategic and operating initiatives. We would like to reiterate what we said in May at our Capital Markets Day. We are pursuing strategic alternatives for underperforming assets across our businesses and across markets. Steps like the $40 million G&A reduction that Joel discussed are still in our control; many others involve third parties and therefore are difficult to time.","I'd like now to move on to charitable premium assistance, CPA. First and most importantly, our teammates acted ethically with respect to our charities and our patients. CPA is unambiguously good for ESRD patients who are among the most in need. Charitable assistance has long been explicitly accepted and endorsed by the government, above board explicit, intentional, and it was intentionally expanded by the Affordable Care Act.","We have a responsibility, both regulatory and ethical, to comprehensively educate our patients. And as to any notion that commercial insurers are unfairly burdened by the aggregate regulatory ecosystem of the ESRD system is ridiculous. There are two subsidies that cut the other way that dramatically outweigh any incremental burden from charitable premium assistance on commercial insurers, namely the Medicare entitlement for patients under 65 and the 30-month limitation of Medicare Secondary Payer statute or commercial coverage.","Our patients are the only Americans discriminated against in this way unable to keep commercial coverage that they would like to keep and have the ability to pay for. Most important, of course, in all of this is our teammates continue to provide amongst the best clinical quality care to dialysis patients in America. We will continue to advocate for our patients to be taken care of by the system.","Finally, regarding stock buybacks. We have continued to do them. We have been deploying a considerable amount of our durable cash flow towards our long-term capital allocation strategy, which has manifested itself in the form of these repurchases in recent months. In fact, since our last earnings call, we have repurchased nearly 8 million shares or approximately 4% of our outstanding stock and announced a new authorization with approximately $1.2 billion currently remaining.","Year-to-date, this means year-to-date through November 7, that is, we have purchased approximately 11.4 million shares or about 6% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. We think this was the right thing to do with your capital.","Operator, would you please open up the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. So I guess, one, when you think about the 2018 number for dialysis and basically we assume that you're kind of at the high end of the range and we throw in the $100 million stock comp change, you're looking to grow about 3%, it looks like ish OI next year in that business. And I guess you're talking about growing volumes organically at least that amount, actually more than that amount. So why wouldn't there be EBITDA growth more like in line with where the top line growth should be kind of in mid-single-digit next year?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Appreciate the question, Kevin. A couple of things. As you know, next year, Medicare reimbursement is only going up 0.5 and for every percentage point is roughly $40 million. So when you have that line not going up and you have the labor pressures that we have and the cost structure moving up, you just have some compression there. So the range that we gave you is consistent to support that.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And I guess when we think about the DMG outlook, and then I guess I appreciate the complexity of the DMG business and the general rate pressure in that business over the last several years. And it's obviously more complicated than the relative sustainability of the dialysis business, but I guess the inability to forecast earnings from quarter-to-quarter, is this really surprising? I mean, as we think about this business over since you've owned it, does HCP have this problem before you owned it as far as quarterly visibility? Or is there something new in the way the business is being run or the factors influencing the business that make it difficult for you guys to consistently forecast just a quarter or two ahead?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","I'll go ahead and take a stab at that, Kevin, and you let me know if it's sufficient. The two big changes in the last four or five years compared to the prior four or five are, one, the rate of annual Medicare Advantage rate increase benchmark rate type stuff, and then number two, in the case of HCP, a non-trivial increase in the weighted average acuity of their patient group during that same period.","And what that meant is you could be off a fair amount in your medical loss ratio forecast or your unit growth forecast, but it would all be matched by your reimbursement per member per month increase. Because in the last four or five years, instead of increases in those two areas, there's been dramatic decreases totaling in the neighborhood of $275 million. I'm not going to get the number exactly right.","Therefore, any adjustment or any miss on the medical loss ratio or unit growth front, even though it might be of exactly the same absolute magnitude as prior years has a dramatically bigger impact on the net remaining OI. And of course, it takes a while to restructure the business according to the new revenue reality. Is that responsive?","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. And I guess the acuity side makes more sense to me. But I guess to the extent that there's always going to be this inherent delay between when your risk scores adjust to the acuity care you're seeing underlying basis, is there a reason to believe that the acuity dynamic this year is unusual in some way, or are you going to have the same issue where next year the acuity increases and you'll get last year's acuity boost, but you won't be able to factor in next year's acuity issues?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Excellent question, and let me try to step through it in a reasonable clear way. If there was the same kind of acuity increase every year, then there wouldn't be any year-over-year delta or it'd be very, very modest because every year would benefit from the prior year's acuity increase. But in fact, that's not the case. This year, there was a differential increase in acuity.","And so in fact, we did incur a significant number of incremental medical costs tied to that higher acuity. Just to give you one reason for why that happened, we did a great job of dealing with an unusually high percentage of our patients who had flu issues and an unusual incidence of serious issues within that flu population in the first quarter.","The derivative benefit from all that extra care in cost is that you actually capture a lot of other acuity developments that you would otherwise not have because you wouldn't have seen the patient for significantly longer period of time. So that's just one analytical sliver of the larger picture.","So this was truly a discontinuous incremental increase in acuity. We don't have any reason to expect there to be another one the subsequent year. To be honest, from a long-term point of view, we would be happy if it happened again because while you suffer a relative deficit in the first year it happens because you're incurring the cost and the revenue is deferred, on average, we keep our patients for a long time and do great work with them. And so the actual net present value of this type of change in acuity is seriously positive. However, in the very first year it happens, you're eating the cost and none of the revenue.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that makes sense. And I guess maybe my last question, you talked about recontracting 25% of your MA risk business for next year. How should we think about that? Is that unusual? I guess you mentioned on the commercial side, you've announced that you've got a large contract signed up for two or three years. Is this 25% just normally happen or are you specing this out because you're saying this 25% are the real problem contracts and that's what you're talking about, first. And then second, what is it that you're doing? Is it really a rate recontracting or is there some other aspect that you're really looking forward to improve the profitability?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yes. So first, it's not normal course. It is something that we set out intentionally to do and accomplish this year, which we haven't done in the past. In terms of the second question about what exactly we're doing, it's I think the simplest way to think of it is increasing the percentage of premium that we are keeping relative to the percentage of premium that the payer with whom we're contracting keeps.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So that's it, just follow through it then to the bottom line from your perspective?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Exactly.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","And Kevin, the only thing I would add there is our results this year are, as you all know, highly public. And so we go with great credibility to our payers in this context and point to the fact that we are a very high-value added and significant part of their network. And the industry is in a different spot now and there simply have to be adjustments in the revenue paradigm to adjust for the changes on the government reimbursement and cost side.","Operator, could we go on to the next one, please?","Operator","Sure. Our next question comes from the line of Tejus Ujjani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. It's actually Tejus Ujjani actually. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to go back to this workforce reduction in the DMG segment. You mentioned $40 million of annual operating impact or operating savings, and just trying to understand if this is a sustainable reduction in kind of overhead infrastructure, why wasn't it done in prior quarters or previously if the group had been underperforming for some time?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Sure. So look, we have been thinking about the performance of the business for quite a while now. The decision to eliminate this many positions is not one you can run into quickly. There are puts and takes when you make decisions like this. And now is the point where we thought some of the operating changes that we had made had been established well enough that we could handle a change like this within the business without it hurting the overall operating performance.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And just kind of switching topics to the DaVita Rx. I think Javier had mentioned back in Capital Markets Day and it came up on the last call as well, a $70 million to $90 million EBITDA headwind for the pharmacy business in 2017. Can you just share any update on how much of that's actually occurred so far this year? How much you have incremental for the rest of the year? And if there's anything actually incremental in 2018 guidance?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yes. We are on the high-end of the range, but we are \u2013 so that number did hold up. And as it relates to 2018, we expect the economics to stay in the same range as they did in 2017.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks very much. And then just going back to, I think, one of the earlier questions about what's implied in core Kidney Care segment growth, given some of the top line pressures and wage pressures. I mean, it seems like you're saying that there's not really any operating leverage kind of going forward into next year in the Kidney Care segment. I mean, given the scale and size of the business, I mean, are all the costs really variable at this point? I mean, I guess any color on that would be helpful.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","No doubt about it that 2018 is not where we want to be. And 2019, the numbers are looking better, because we have the Medicare reimbursement and we have some visibility into other items that will look better in 2019 over 2018.","We will, of course, work very hard to beat the number we have. But that is the right number to do at this juncture. And as I said, there's three big variables that we're going to get visibility into shortly here with open enrollment and in the cost of MEDICs. And so we will do our best to perform on those metrics.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. I'll hop back in the queue.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. So a few questions here. Wanted to first go back to premium assistance. And appreciate all the color you've given. Wanted to talk about your interaction with CMS on this, right. So they came out last year with something outside of the exchange reg that they later pulled back on. The exchange reg came out just recently, there was no mention at all of charitable premium assistance.","So given that, I'm curious as to what is your interaction with CMS right now on this topic? Has it quieted down, given most of managed care is making significant profits on the exchanges now? Just give us some kind of an update, if you can?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","And, Justin, I'll take a stab at this. Number one, I would say that there's a dramatic difference in how this administration at least so far is approaching the issue versus the prior administration, which is to say a lot more listening and developing a much deeper understanding of the nuances and the complexities, both generally on the issue and with respect to dialysis patients. That's a good thing. Second, they're also, as everyone knows, way behind in staffing up and missing some key leadership spots.","Put all that together, it is not that the item has dropped off the agenda at all, but perhaps nothing is going to emerge for a while. It's very difficult \u2013 impossible would be a better word \u2013 to predict.","You are also correct that because a whole lot of plans are doing better in the exchanges now than before and throughout this entire period, more people are noticing that they were making very substantial profits in most of their other lines of business, while at the same time complaining about the exchanges that that pressure has also abated somewhat.","So I want to repeat. It's still on the agenda, both of the plans and of the administration. And we can't predict when they're going to do something. But the good news is, it's at least from a process point of view, far more measured than before.","And we just don't know what to expect. We will continue to advocate for our patients who, as we mentioned in our preparatory remarks, this aspect of the dialysis and kidney care ecosystem has existed very explicitly and very intentionally for 25 years.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Then, Kent, in regards to DMG, as recently a September 7 at a conference, you said DMG had some nice momentum.","So given the problems in the quarter, obviously the visibility in this business that I think you discussed before must be limited. How should we think about or educate ourselves on this? Your forward view of the business, given the interest from others you've talked about in acquiring it, and your discussion around strategic alternatives. Are there any other strategic alternatives for something like DMG, other than a sale of the business that we should consider? Or is that the main strategic alternative you're discussing?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Well, first as to the question you asked at the front end of your paragraph, we understand that you and others must have a very dim view of our confidence when it comes to forecasting, and there really is no other rational perspective for someone to have at this point. Second, as to the question, are there other strategic alternatives other than selling everything? The answer to that question is yes. There's different options in every single market as well as in aggregate. Of course, at the same time, we also recognize our fiduciary responsibilities to you and your associates.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","So can you give us anymore color on what those other strategic alternatives would look like?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Well, I'll just give one example so you get an idea. It could be that one would sell \u2013 create a separate equity vehicle in an individual market and have some of the local players become serious equity partners simultaneously enhancing the contract terms between us and them in an individual market. Just to give one example of a non-total sale that could change both the short-term economics of the business as well as derisk the business as well as liberate some capital. So I'm not advocating for that versus anything else. I'm simply answering your question as to what would be an example of an alternative strategic alternative to selling everything and then adding on top of it the follow-up question, which is, well, what would that do for shareholders?","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","That's helpful. And then just lastly, before I jump back in. You brought 6 million shares in October despite knowing that DMG was having some clear issues. Can you give us some color around that decision?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Sure, Justin. It's Joel. We're, in general, not going to comment on our individual purchases over a given quarter or a month, but let me give you a little color about how we think about this. So in general, we like to use both open market purchases or 10b-18 purchases as well as planned purchases, 10b-51 purposes. They have different advantages and disadvantages. The open market gives us flexibility on a day-to-day basis to decide whether we want to buy or not depending on the stock price than anything else.","The challenge there is the window does close at times, and we obviously can't trade when the window is closed, so that removes certain flexibility. The 10b5-1 solves the window issue, but it locks us in over a protracted period of time and we can't respond based on all the other factors.","So we use both. When we do 10b5-1s, we tend to lean towards more complex plans to try and think forward about what's likely to happen, ensure that we're buying at opportune times. That said, there can be unintended consequences of the complexities of our 10b5-1 plans.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","So if I'm hearing that correctly, is it fair to say that you put that in place before the quiet period ended or began, I should say? And you have the information on the quarter, but maybe felt like the stock price at that time was interesting so you wanted to buy?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","I'm going to leave it where I did in terms of the general guidance without getting into any of the specifics.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Justin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from Robert Baird (sic) [Robert W. Baird] (40:56). Your line is open.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. On this exchange topic, CMS mentioned Friday during a webinar with both navigators and payers that those eligible for Part A coverage or have Part B Medicare coverage should not be enrolling in marketplace plans or some language to that effect. I think we talked a little bit about this at my conference briefly. And this is, I think, the second time that they've sort of guided the payers and the navigators to this point. Do you just have any thoughts on the implications of this with the ESRD patients?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Whit, we're looking around the table here for a moment because none of us are feeling well equipped because we didn't know about this Friday statement and it's a fairly tricky area where you've got to be pretty damn precise. So LeAnne or Jim, do either of you have any ability to shed light on this, or do we just say we'll have to get back to you. We're not thinking we can do a great job, repeating stuff we've already said.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That's fine. Okay. Jim, I'll send you the email. And maybe back to Joel's comment on some of the changes to the collection process, and I think you referenced anticipating some regulatory changes. Any color on specifically what you're referencing?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","This is Javier. Basically, we went through and reviewed the best way to do billing. We had a new billing system, and we changed some policies and procedures. So there's nothing from a regulatory perspective at how we're doing internally.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And looking at the Kidney Care guide, I think you signaled that the international losses or the ancillary losses, I guess, should be sort of breakeven. Is that generally the assumption that you've used to construct the 2018 guide?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","I'm sorry, I was writing down something. Could you repeat the question?","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Just the Kidney Care guidance for 2018, I'm just curious what the assumptions were for the ancillary business. I think you've consistently stated that you believe it can breakeven, and I was just looking to confirm whether or not that's exactly what you've assumed sort of within the range?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","We don't have an immediate answer. Why don't we have some people take a look and get back to you before this call is over, okay?","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That's fine. And maybe just one last one here. Just back to DMG and the comment on higher utilization. I mean, I think you're the only person this quarter or in the past year for that matter citing higher utilization. Is that really acuity or are you really seeing utilization days per thousand go up?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","So it is acuity. What I would also remind you about us is given the nature of our business, we don't have the scale of the large payers, so we are rather localized. And while we are in six markets, we are dominated or we are heavily-weighted towards one market. And as a result, we don't have a diversification that some of the other larger managed care players you're talking about have.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","And the other thing I would add, in some cases, if we're below average utilization in a market, and that's what we've been 18 months, and then we become less below average, for us, it actually shows up as an earnings decrement. But separate from that, LeAnne, you have an answer on the navigator question?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.","Well, I think if I heard you correctly, you're saying that the navigator training is instructing navigators if a patient has enrolled in Medicare, they can't enroll in a QHP, which is true. So I think that may be the clarification. But unless I see the training, I couldn't respond beyond that, but happy to take a look at the training and give you any another color.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","No, I'll send it over just stating if someone is not enrolled and is eligible for Part A, you should direct them to Medicare and away from a market-linked plan (45:40), but I'll send it over, LeAnne. Thanks.","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.","Sure. No problem.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","And then I just want to follow-up on the question you asked on the SIs in international. We don't guide in particular line, so it's included in our broad range.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is open.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. I'm disadvantaged from having Justin who had asked all the smart questions. So I'll weigh in with my weak stuff at the end. On the pharmacy, you put in your slides for reviewing assets strategically, that's a business of scale. That would seem to be kind of an easy one to see if someone else could maybe do it better because they like may buy a little cheaper. Why are you hanging onto that asset if it's going to continue to kind of boil in 2018 at these levels? I'm just curious about that.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yes. Thanks for the question. On the pharmacy, it is a clinical story. And so when you look at the research and you look at the quantity of prescriptions that our patients take, so on average, a dialysis patient has 10 prescriptions and takes about 20 pills. So one of the big advantages is that we can consolidate and we could really help the patients on adherence. And then, of course, as you know, we did that business bottoms-up, so we didn't deploy a lot of capital. And so it's been a clinical story that's actually been an acceptable return on investment. So that's how we think about it.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I mean, is it making positive EBITDA at this point? I know its missing plan, but is it net positive EBITDA or is it negative EBITDA?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","It's got thin margins, but it is making money.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then my second question is, your sort of preliminary guidance for 2018, with all the puts and takes in managed care, how does the pricing, commercial pricing, compare in 2018 versus 2017?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","I think what I gave is as far as I want to go, which is our portfolio is in what I'd call a normal state with a lot of our contracts being stable on the large account and the normal fluctuations of the small account. And that's as far as I'm going to go today.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","But you made some cryptic comments Javier about 2019. What's better in 2019? I mean are you already seeing that play out? What's better in 2019 other than Medicare than we might see in 2018?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yes, I probably shouldn't have gone there. When I said it, I cringed. So unfortunately, you were paying attention at every word I said.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's a rare moment. That is actually a rare moment, so I'm going to take credit for that.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, well, I'm not going to regret and go further on that, but it's fair to say that I shouldn't have said it.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Well, I guess what I'm trying to figure out with my simple mind is if you've got a clinic with 50 patients and you add two Medicare patients, and I know Medicare doesn't cover the total cost, it would seem like the marginal cost of treating a Medicare patient would be less than $250 which is about right on with your base. So I'm sort of questioning the operating leverage of the business if that isn't the case. And if that's not the case, are you rethinking maybe de novo spend? Because maybe the economics have gotten different in the business than what we've seen (49:36)?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yes. No, I get where you're going at, and this is obviously are we compressing margin. And if so, would we deploy capital in a different way? And so we are, of course, evaluating our capital deployment. And if the returns do go down, what we would do is, of course, we'll operate our centers at a higher utilization and so would everyone else.","But what we have to look for 2019 is, number one, we wouldn't have the 401(k) headwind. And number two, Medicare is going back to normal increases. And so that will be a nice tailwind, back to normality on that.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","And let me go backwards a second to the question about last Friday and CMS' comments. If their comments were precisely what we heard on this call, that would probably be a mistake by them. And if on the other hand, it was a comment they were making that pertained only to Medicare eligibles over age 65, it may not have been a mistake for them to say.","So the devil is really in the detail on this. And we look forward to staring at it. And we'll follow-up with them if there needs to be any clarity.","It is also not unusual for that population to just in general, lean philosophically towards Medicare for everything. And many of them think that Medicare should be the only program that covers all Americans, period. And so to have some sort of implicit bias is not at all surprising or new. For it to be explicitly decided as procedural guidance would be another thing entirely, and so we'll look into it, and thanks for bringing it up.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Wood from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Patrick Wood - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you very much for taking my questions. I just have two please, if I may. And the first one would be on the ESCO savings. I'm just curious if these came in -for the data that CMS put out \u2013 if these came in roughly in line with where your guys were expecting the overall pool to come in? And also, long term, whether you think that that's a fair set of expectation going forward? Or if you think the industry can do a little bit better, given it's early days?","And the second question is just appreciate on DMG that the confidence over the long term to still see that inflection up in the total EBIT level. The difficulty I've got is, and maybe I'm thinking about this simplistically, but a $600 million write-down is not a small proportion of the total value of that asset. How should we think about the fact that you're maintaining that outlook at the same time as writing down the asset. Just to give me some comfort around that would be helpful? Thanks, guys.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","First, let me take the ESCO question. I don't know how precise we were in the numbers, because the reality is that we are big supporters of integrated care, because we've done it for quite some time. And we know that when you have the comorbid condition that our patients have that it just makes sense that someone that is a quarterback of healthcare through all the transition, and when you have access to them for 12 hours, that you can bend the cost curve.","So that being said, we were happy with the progress we made. We also have to highlight that it's a small population, so that number will fluctuate over time. And so it's going to be a bumpy up and down, because of the small size.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","And let me just add that one of the fundamental architectural flaws in ESCO is \u2013 that rebounds to everyone's detriment is the open-ended black box of rebasing. And what this does is makes the long-term returns highly uncertain. And what that does is dramatically reduce the amount of transformational investment that people like us and FMC and others are willing to make to drive truly breathtaking improvements in the system where everybody would win.","And so this is related to the answer to your important question of what can you expect from the ESCOs downstream. On to you, Joel, for the other question.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Sure. So as you think about the goodwill impairment, there are many factors that go into that calculation. And while the performance in 2019 that we talked about is certainly one of them, there are many others, some more short term in nature.","So while they certainly are not disconnected, there are a lot of things that go into the goodwill calculation other than our thoughts about 2019.","Patrick Wood - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Sure, appreciate it. Thanks so much for the color, guys.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Patrick.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good evening. Had a couple questions. The first one, I just want to make sure I have this right. The implied fourth quarter Kidney operating income that would be comparable to the $404 million this quarter, I think the midpoint is $402 million. Do I have that correct?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","No. The midpoint would be closer to $400 million, but that's in the ZIP Code.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And so any incremental \u2013 I think the $404 million you're implying really would have been for 2018, including hurricanes, and so stepping down a little bit sequentially would be mainly driven by what?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","There are two main things in the fourth quarter. We have an escalation of benefit costs as the teammates run through their deductibles. And we have historically a higher G&A during the period. That explains the bulk of that difference.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I do have a CPA question for you, Kent. What we've heard from a number of plans is that they feel they're under no legal obligation to pick up the AKF funds and as they have rescinded some of these policies and refused to accept checks and wire transfers to AKF. Instead, they're now seeing a lot of these patients paying with a prepaid debit card, and in fact that those cards are going to the dialysis center care of patients and dialysis administrative personnel are helping these patients pay those premiums.","And I guess my question is, given your view that this is an acceptable and sustainable part of the ecosystem, why is it necessary for the AKF to potentially hide the origin of that funding? And is there any business risk to DaVita in essentially being complicit in circumventing these plans' terms and conditions of coverage if they decided not to accept those payments?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Well, first, I'm not intimately familiar with what the AKF does, so we'll have to follow up. Second, there couldn't be anything more explicit and more public than provider funding of the AKF in the entire pantheon of American health care, and it's how it's been for 20 years. It's how the government approved it, consistent with criteria the government set down. But I cannot opine on exactly operationally how that comes up.","I also know that the overwhelming majority of payers, a huge percentage, I'm not going to get the number right, but overwhelming majority probably understates it are continuing to process charitable premium assistance claims in the same way they did a year or two or three ago. And so whatever tiny subset of reality you may be discussing, I'm just not familiar with, but feel free to follow up with our team. But on the broader frame, the other statements I've made are highly, highly relevant.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll step back. Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line's open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Appreciate getting back in the queue here. Just wanted to run through a bunch of numbers question here. First, if we go back into something in the neighborhood of $10 million $15 million, I think, from hurricanes, can you give us the exact hurricane OI impact in 3Q? And I apologize if you gave it already. And any impact assumed for 4Q that we should consider?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","I couldn't hear the last part, but we did highlight that there was $14 million plus 25 basis on NAG. Was there something else that you said on the back end?","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","So yes, is there a 4Q impact?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","I am not sure of that. Let me look around. I think the bulk of its flushed through the quarter, but I'll verify here.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And is there any reason to think that shouldn't be coming back whatever it is the $14 million plus wherever the fourth quarter shouldn't come back next year, is there any kind of sustainable hurricane impact 2018 that we should consider?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. We are still assessing a couple of the centers, but the numbers should not be a meaningful number right now. And the number that they just gave me for the fourth quarter is in the range of $2 million to $3 million, Justin. So...","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Then getting back to the question around re-contracting benefits. You put pretty specific numbers around the savings from restructuring, the revenue increases from the risk scores as they go through. Is there any number that you can give us in terms of what you think the benefit will be from this re-contracting next year?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","We're going to stay away from giving a specific number on that. Some of that is still playing out over the balance of the year. So we'd rather not give a number.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then I just wanted to go back to the international question that Whit asked. I know you guys don't typically guide to the entire employer business, but you've been pretty specific in terms of international? So, can you give us what international the expected loss is this year on international first?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Sure. So we said last quarter, and we're sticking with it, something in the low 30s of OI, excluding the onetime stuff.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","And should we expect that to get to breakeven next year? Is that what's implied in guidance cause you've been talking about getting to breakeven I think this year?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Sure. So what's implied in our guidance is in 2018, we will get to breakeven. When during the year we get there and whether not we'll be breakeven for the full year really depends on the acquisition pace over the remainder of the year in 2018, but we believe we will get there at some point during the year.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Javier, you mentioned California, advocacy cost could impact next year. So just want to make sure I understand that from a perspective of did you say that there was some of that built into guidance? I thought you said that wasn't built into guidance. And so what's the answer there? And then is that something that you would consider a onetime charge and kind of strip out or is that something that you kind of look at as normal course of business?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","It is not built into the guidance, so that is correct. I don't think we would \u2013 from an accounting perspective, it wouldn't called out as a one-time charge, but we would view it as in year non-recurring, how's that? So we would tell you what that number is so you could carve it out.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","And you talked about as being somewhat meaningful impactful. Can you give us a ballpark on like would this thing really does kick up with 2018 what the impact of it?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","The numbers are all over the place, and these campaigns can really go up and down. So it's really hard to give you a number, Justin.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Thanks for all the color on the numbers. Appreciated it.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Justin. Feel free to come back again.","Operator","I show no questions at the moment.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","All right. Then thank you all very much for your continued interest.

And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning those risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release filed with the SEC and available on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Jim, and thank all of you for your interest in DaVita. We will today, of course, discuss what we would characterize as a solid quarter. Before we get into the specifics of that quarter however, we will start as we always do with our clinical performance. We are first and foremost a care giving entity. Within DaVita Medical Group, we achieved 4.9 star average ratings across all markets. If you round in the same way that CMS rounds, would equal a 5 star, which is the highest we've ever achieved and is literally outstanding. It means we're doing wonderful things clinically with our physicians for our patients and also makes us differentially attractive to our payer partners.","Within DaVita Kidney Care, fluid overload is one of the three leading causes of hospitalizations. Our own clinical researchers estimate that patients who do not achieve the recommended post-treatment weight have a 50% high risk of mortality over the subsequent year further underlying the significance of this clinical event. We have special initiatives aimed at ensuring our patients achieve target fluid levels. And in the second quarter of 2017, we had our best ever percentage of patients achieving that recommended post-treatment weight with a 10% year-over-year improvement. That's a big deal.","And I'll now turn it over to Javier Rodriguez, the CEO of DaVita Kidney Care to discuss that quarter.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon, everyone. Kidney Care adjusted operating income for the quarter was $402 million, up $22 million or 6% versus the first quarter. Overall, results were in line with our expectations. Let me cover some highlights. Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 3.6%, which is within the range of our long-term expectation of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis. As a reminder, we expect to see fluctuations around this range on a quarterly basis. Revenue per treatment was down by $3.38 quarter-over-quarter. As we disclosed at Capital Markets Day, Q1 revenue benefited from some positive one-time adjustments.","We continue to expect full-year average revenue per treatment in 2017 to be down 1% to 2% from full-year average in 2016. Our patient care cost per treatment was down $5.65 quarter-over-quarter driven by better performance in center operating expenses and normal seasonal factors that negatively impact quarter one cost per treatment, including EPO utilization, payroll taxes, and less treatment days. Now, turning on to our outlook. We're raising the bottom end of 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance by $40 million. Our new guidance range is now $1.565 billion to $1.625 billion. Looking ahead to 2018, similar to the last couple of years, we will issue formal guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call.","That said, I want to remind you of a couple of specific items to keep in mind as you look at 2018. Number one, we will have a year-over-year headwind of approximately $100 million due to our recent change from profit share program to a 401(k) match program. Number two, our cost inflation continues to outpace the rate increases we received from payers. It may be hard to see this trend in second quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the benefit from our new EPO contract as well as a one-time benefit from the transition to 401(k). Lastly, as a reminder, the proposed 2018 Medicare rate increase in the preliminary rule is 0.7%.","Now, I hand it over to Joel to discuss DMG.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Javier. For the second quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had adjusted operating income of $34 million. As a reminder, this business has a disproportionally high amortization load, $44 million for the quarter, which includes roughly $7 million related to the acceleration of our branding initiative. Therefore, this quarter's adjusted operating income of $34 million translates into an adjusted EBITDA of $94 million for the quarter. Now, with respect to our value conversion. We're on track to our plan since our last update. We've signed a contract in Colorado, one of our newer geographies, and expect to add value contracts in New Mexico and Washington State by the end of the year.","We had a fairly active quarter in closing tuck-in acquisitions of new groups in our existing geographies. We believe that these transactions are a capital-efficient and low risk way of acquiring new physicians and patients. Collectively, the groups we acquired in recent months consist of approximately 140 providers serving nearly 200,000 patients, of which about 20,000 are currently capitated. Regarding guidance for DMG, we're leaving our 2017 adjusted operating income guidance unchanged at $110 million to $150 million and we still believe it's more likely that we will be in the bottom half of this range. This operating income range includes an estimated $240 million in depreciation and amortization for 2017.","Now, to International. International operating losses in the quarter were $13 million, which includes approximately $4 million of prior period adjustments and a $1 million foreign exchange loss. For the full year in the International business, we now expect adjusted operating income loss in the low $30 millions plus or minus a bp. This excludes the impact of currency and one-time expenses. We're disappointed in this change in guidance, which is the result of lower than anticipated clinic acquisitions and slower operating ramp of acquired clinics. These changes in outlook is incorporated in our adjusted operating income guidance for Kidney Care and the enterprise.","Looking forward, we expect to reach breakeven internationally during 2018. Whether we achieve breakeven for the full year of 2018 will largely be a function of our acquisition pace for the rest of 2017 and early 2018.","Finally, some comments on cash flow and capital deployment. Second quarter operating cash flow up of $146 million was adversely impacted by the timing of cash tax payments associated with our settlement with the VA that was announced in the first quarter and by an increase in accounts receivable DSO. Year-to-date, we generated operating cash flow of $1 billion and our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 remains $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion.","As we discussed at our Capital Markets Day, we expect to be using some of this strong consistent cash flow as part of our long-term strategy to repurchase stock over the coming quarters. In the second quarter, we repurchased nearly 3.6 million shares or more than 1.8% of our shares outstanding for $232 million.","Now, over to Kent for a few closing comments.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","I don't really have anything new to say. I would just step back and make a few observations. Number one, it was a solid quarter. Number two, we have a solid foundation. Number three, we have some wonderfully valuable assets. And number four, we are good at what people want more of.","With that, let's get on to Q&A please, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. Just wondering if you can provide a little more color on commercial in the quarter on the dialysis side. How has the switch around third-party premium support on the exchanges gone versus your guidance? And then any kind of new pushback from payers on rates on the non-individual business?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Kevin, this is Javier. Nothing has changed from when we talked last quarter and so our relationships with payers continue to be the same. We're trying to make sure we add the right value to their members and our patients and nothing has changed in the guidance as it relates to the economics we gave you last quarter.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. So I guess when you provided guidance at the Analyst Day, you mentioned $45 million to $90 million of kind of additional risk that wasn't reflected in the actual results this year. Can you provide a little bit of color as to how we should think about that for 2018? Is that risk that you think we should be building in as far as pressure into 2018 or is that something that at this point you don't feel like you're going to experience, but you just want to highlight for conservatism's sake?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Well, let me clarify, Kevin. I think what we said is, people wanted to frame what was the risk in the individual plans if CPA was completely eliminated. So we said on the outer bounds that's the $90 million. We said, if CPA was eliminated in an individual plan, that some people would have some tax credits and other things, so that's why we put a range of $45 million to $90 million. Does that answer your question?","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well, I guess, my understanding was that when you initially talked about $140 million to $230 million as the issue here you have said that $230 million was the right number to think about, but there was still $40 million to $90 million of potential pressure, that some things came in better, some things came in worse and that there was still $45 million to $90 million of \"risk\" in the commercial numbers. Is that not correct?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","I think the way I would frame it is that we've had \u2013 we've learned more as the quarters have come along and then we've superseded information and updated it. And so, now we're saying, hey, the easiest way to do instead of getting to all the different slices is number one, the risk that's left in individual plans on CPA is at $45 million to $90 million, it then went away. And then number two, our average revenue will be down 1% to 2% over our average revenue in 2016. That that is sort of the freshest information that we have and the most useful information that we have.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Then just last question, that $45 million to $90 million, how do we think about that, is there a reason to think that didn't present this year, the reason to think it will present next year, what would be the indication or cause of that following through next year, if it didn't follow through this year absent regulatory guidance?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. I think we don't have any visibility on timing per se, but we were trying to be useful when people were trying to frame and size the risk of CPA in an individual plan. So we put the number out there without any sense of whether it would occur or not or any sense of timing on it but rather just trying to frame and size the number.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","And what I might add Kevin is, is we would not try to characterize any change in the risk. No increase, no decrease nor any change in our ability to predict when the government might come up with something that would constitute a decision that there is a bunch of no change.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good evening. Few questions here. First, maybe you could just tell us what kind of payer mix changes or commercial mix changes I should say, you saw in Q2, if any?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Nothing that's worth calling out, Justin.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So, pretty steady Q1 to Q2.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yes.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then Kent, I know you don't want to give specific 2018 earnings guidance in the second quarter, but earlier this year you talked about targeting growth in overall operating income next year. Just curious, given all the moving parts, any updated thoughts on that target? Can you grow OI in 2018?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","My memory of what we said in the Capital Markets, Justin, and Jim to my left here will clarify if I get it wrong is that our comments at Capital Markets, of course, is usually do supersede any prior comments and we didn't make any representations on 2018 relative to 2017 at that time, but let me turn to Mr. Gustafson.","Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.","That is correct. So, it's just too soon, Justin.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. I mean, I get this question a reasonable amount. So maybe, is there any color you can give us on why you felt comfortable earlier in the year talking to that, but less comfortable now? Is there any changes that you want to point us to?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","I think I just became more thoughtful.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Understood. Last question, there are a number of commercial plans like Aetna, Humana and Anthem exiting the exchanges for next year or at least some of their exchange footprint for next year. And so the payer mix could start to change in \u2013 just in terms of the plans that are still offering and where these numbers shake out. Any thoughts on how we should think about the potential of that impacting 2018? Or as you look at it, are better payers leaving, and maybe lower payers staying or is it vice versa, any insight there?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. As opposed to quantifying whether they're better or worse, I think the answer arithmetically is that is minimal change to our economics. Of course, there are some payers that are still deciding but the majority of what we've seen now is minimal impact economically because most members have a comparable option in their market.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Justin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tejus Ujjani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Tejus. Thanks for taking the question. Can you share some color on the situation with Aetna? From public court docs, it looks like there is an ongoing feud in which they're requesting member records related to CPA, and if I'm correct, DVA is basically refusing to provide the records. Any color you can share on that status and as well as the administrative subpoena from the DoJ on AKF related patients?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. That request that Aetna had was denied and we're working with Aetna to get a download under what's in, to make sure that we adhere to the contract and that we get them the proper documents","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And any, can you share your latest thoughts on some of the legislative efforts out in California? I think people are familiar with SB 349 regarding the minimum staffing requirements. But there's another item called AB 251, that I think is still in progress out there. I mean it's essentially attempting to mandate medical loss ratios or cap dialysis clinics to like 15% and I think DVA has quite a bit of exposure out in California. Just trying to think about how you're, understand that situation and how you think about the risk.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Both of these bills are being driven by a union, and what we're saying is, this is an unprecedented act, this AB 251. And of course, it is not good for patients. It is not good for the citizen because there are some centers that are profitable and they carry all the centers that are not profitable. And so, if that passes, it would have a disruption to the care and over the long haul, it would be a real problem for the ERs and for the patients there. So we hope that policy makers will see through this as what it is, which is bad policy, and we of course are working hard with all our constituents in the community to educate them.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Whit Mayo from Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Looking at the cost per treatment in the quarter, if I isolate all of the EPO purchases just within the June quarter, was it all under the new contract or did you have any purchases or any old inventory that you were working through rather I should say? And I'm just trying to think through the run rate going forward.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. All of the purchases were under the new contract for this quarter.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","So, does the second quarter have the full benefit of the new contract or is there a tail on this that we should consider as the year plays out?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","It's got the benefit that's intended to have for this year.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, got it. And maybe just any details on DaVita Health Solutions. I think you announced a new segment during the quarter. Just kind of curious more on what the model is and can it be built out, the infrastructure. Do you need to acquire any capabilities such as home health and SNF, just any color on exactly what this business is?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Sure. I'm happy to answer, although we don't want to put too much of a spotlight on it because it's just a startup and so it will take time before it would ever really warrant a significant amount of attention. But to your specific question as to whether or not we need to acquire any capabilities, no, not within the current scope of the business. One of the beauties of what we do at DaVita Health Solutions is capabilities that we've been practicing at the DaVita Medical Group for 10, 15, 20 years in most cases. And so, its stuff that we're very good at, we're very credible at. And so, we look forward to advancing the cause and for those who aren't familiar, the short characterization of what we do is, is we got to a payer and take over responsibility for the top X thousand and some of their most sick, most expensive, most at risk patients and in particular focused on SNF management and house calls. Although, there is other things we do as well including at times, palliative care, et cetera. So that's a little bit of a thumbprint.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. And maybe my last question just on DaVita Medical Group. There was a jump in the capitated revenue in the quarter but the capitated lives declined sequentially and year-over-year. So, is there anything notable to call out, anything one-time, any payments we should be aware of?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","There was a change in the accounting. Some of our shared risk contracts converted to global risk. The net result is the institutional component of the cost, which used to be accounted for on a net basis, is now accounted for on a gross basis, which drives the revenue up.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. I guess, I'll follow-up afterwards.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Look, I realize I'm talking my book here, but we ran some analysis on paper, the economics of selling DMG and buying back stock are pretty overwhelmingly positive for shareholders. I know what the bodyline has been, but maybe you could reiterate the bodyline and what it would take to maybe shift your thinking, if at all?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Sure. So, look, we talked extensively at Capital Markets Day about our capital allocation strategy and our focus on OI growth and return on capital. I'm not going to reiterate that, nothing has changed. Regarding the specific analysis, really two major drivers driving most of the value in your report. One is increased leverage, and we could achieve that increased leverage whether we sell DMG or not. The second was the implied increase in EBITDA multiple, which is hard to count on. So, that's our thinking about the analysis regarding DMG, look, we've laid out a plan to drive OI growth of $100 million or so over a couple of years. We feel good about the business. So, that's where we are.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good evening. I just had a question about DMG for 2018. I know you had previously talked about the MA rates constituting about a $30 million headwind. You're taking a goodwill charge of $51 million, which I understand is present value of DMG or certain markets over time. So I guess my primary question here is, is there any change to how you've evaluated the rate headwind for 2018 since the Capital Markets Day?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","No change.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then in that same discussion in the press release that you had mentioned the rate pressure for 2018, but also makes comment about increasing medical costs, and I presume that was kind of talking about 2018 and I presumed it meant rate pressure in the context of a business where medical costs rise and I just wanted to make sure that was \u2013 those presumptions were correct and there wasn't some other comment about something happening in terms of medical costs in the near-term?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","No, I think your characterization is fair.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We show no further questions in queue at this time.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Operator, we'll just give it another 15, 20 seconds just to make sure.","Operator","We have a question from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two from me, real quick. In terms of Renal Ventures, can you give us an update in terms of what stage you are at right now in incorporating them into DaVita and how should we look at the next few quarters in terms of cost for that acquisition?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","We are in the initial parts of the integration. We, of course, will have the one-time cost in year one. And then, we will have them in a normalized way by fourth quarter or so going into Q1 of next year's run rate.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then in terms of the joint venture that you guys have in China, it's been a while since we've heard about that. Can you talk a little bit about how much investment has gone into that partnership at this point? What have you learned and maybe what's been surprising at the upside or the downside?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","So, we don't disclose the specific capital that we've allocated internationally. In terms of China specifically, it's a fascinating market. It's growing incredibly rapidly from a patient standpoint. That said, we have learned the challenges of entering China as a multinational corporation. We are looking at our strategy going forward thinking about partnerships as an opportunity for entering the market specifically.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","And let me just try to clarify Margaret, were you referring to our Asia-Pacific joint venture with Mitsui and Khazanah or were you referring to a very, very tiny dialysis joint venture we had in one particular geography in China?","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","The former.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. And so, what \u2013 that partnership still exists, and in fact, Khazanah and Mitsui just put in their second tranche of their committed $300 million investment. So, there is another $100 million in the balance sheet as of the last 24 hours or so, and we continue to look forward to working with them to grow that business over the long term.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Are you guys saying revenues and I guess, P&L expenses for that business, and where are you reporting that? Is that the other line?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Right now our international operations are just reported in one set full piece, and for the near term, that's really our intention.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right, thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Margaret.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Just a few more here, since we got the time. I know you got a question on DMG post the goodwill impairments. The commentary in the press release indicated that it's going to be tough to offset that $30 million of rate pressure next year. Should we think about that as, given the fact that you took those impairments, it's less likely you can offset that $30 million and we should think about that as potentially a greater risk than you even mentioned at the Investor Day or is this just kind of mechanical?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","It's more mechanical, Justin. There hasn't been any change in our assessment of the risk upside or downside since Capital Markets.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. And then, it was really helpful to get an updated view on the international business. Anything you could tell us about what you expect to have in terms of ancillary and corporate losses that's built into the guidance for this year?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Could you say the question again, Justin? I'm not sure on exactly what you're going for.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Well, I guess just trying to understand, the international business is generating losses. We also know that you have corporate costs that basically offset dialysis income. And so the corporate costs and the ancillary businesses that are losing money, any thoughts like, can you share with us what you think those losses could be as we're trying to model out 2017? Any projection for corporate losses and ancillary and \u2013 or I should say corporate and ancillary losses for 2017?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","So would you be primarily referring to the strategic initiatives line item or something else?","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Correct. No, that's it. That's the ancillary business.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Yeah, Justin, what you're seeing in that number and the reason why it grew is, you're seeing the effects of the management fee from Rx that we talked about in Capital Markets.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Sure.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","So, you'll see that run rate continue.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So this is a reasonable run rate the second quarter for the rest of the year.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","The other aspect of this question is the SI line.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. On the SIs, you're talking about the $25 million this quarter and that is mainly again, Rx. It's got an addition of some integrated care initiatives, but the bulk of it is Rx.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just a couple of the numbers questions, DSOs were up four days year-over-year and two days sequentially. Anything to note here?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Nothing particular to note other than our run rate is going to be more in the range that it is now. We had some operational changes and we think that this is the right range going forward.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And lastly, in the press release you noted that the company obviously did a significant amount of share repo in the second quarter but hadn't done any post June, so nothing in July. Anything we should read into that?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","No.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, so we should \u2013 at the Investor Day you had talked about share repurchase being a significant use of free cash flow. We should still expect that to continue through the rest of the year, is that reasonable?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, Nothing about our plans for capital allocation and share repurchase specifically has changed. We think the $230 million that we bought back during the quarter was a good pace for us. There are a lot of criteria that go into whether we buy at a moment in time that relates to our cash flow, our growth, our leverage levels, the stock price, etcetera, and as a reminder we are blacked out at certain points because of earnings and other issues.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Sure. That's helpful. Thanks guys.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","All right, thanks, Justin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tejus Ujjani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up question. Just want to clarify one of the responses to my question on the Aetna records. When you said it was denied, did you mean DaVita denied the request or the court denied the request?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","The court.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then also just to go back to the Capital Markets Day, and DaVita Rx, you talked about $70 million to $90 million EBITDA headwind. I think some of that was from loss of patient volume associated with co-pay support as well as fortifying some compliance. But you mentioned that that wasn't at all related to the AKF. Can you just clarify who is providing that support if it wasn't the AKF and also kind of how much of headwind was that actually in the quarter?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","I do not know the technical answer as to who provides that support. So, we'll have to get back to you on that. And we also added a couple of things as to why the \u2013 it is what it is. We also said that the pharmaceutical pricing had not passed, so that was a pass through in essence when prices go up that had not increased. And then secondly, we talked about a contract that had changed its contribution in addition to the two other items that you brought up. And that run rate, that $70 million to $90 million hit is included in this quarter.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, sorry if you have addressed this. I'm just old and forgetful. But the cadence of the EPO purchasing benefit. I mean, we've taken some statements from the manufacturer to interpret that to mean, it's sort of equally weighted between this year and next year. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","I don't know if we can comment on that. We have big restrictions on what we can say on the contract. So I think, we're going to have to pass on that one.","John W.

Sir, you may begin.","Jim Gustafson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Cindy, and welcome everyone to the DaVita HealthCare Partners' Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Jim Hilger, our Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","I'll start with our forward-looking disclosure statement. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.","Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all of you for your interest in our enterprise. In the third quarter, we had solid \u2013 strong results in both Kidney Care and HCP. But as always, we'll talk about clinical outcomes first, as that is what comes first, we are first and foremost a caregiver company. We have about 177,000 patients in the U.S. now, and that's about 35% of the total dialysis patients. 97% of those patients had a Kt\/V of 1.2 or greater; 73% of those patients have fistulas placed for their access for the second year in a row, DaVita is the clinical leader in the CMS Five-Star ratings system. 46% of our centers are Four-Star or Five-Star rated compared to 23% for all other providers, truly noteworthy.","HealthCare Partners, we continue to take care of over 800,000 patients on a globally capitated basis and several hundred thousand others on a fee-for-service basis. To give you another snippet of clinical information from HealthCare Partners using the 2014 HEDIS results, in Florida, one of our three legacy markets, we once again exceeded the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics, and we are Four-Star to Five-Star across all MA patients on all nine HEDIS metrics, that is outstanding.","If you stare at these and other numbers, you see that the clinical outcomes for both Kidney Care and HCP compare very favorably to national averages, healthier patients, healthier patient satisfaction, savings to taxpayers, that's the result.","Onto operating performance. On the HCP side, $83 million NOI, that number is a bit misleading in that it includes the net benefit of $22 million from the recognition of some risk-sharing settlement that we do not expect to recur, that was real money that we earned, but it shouldn't have been centralized or concentrated in this particular quarter, but certainly very good news and even independent of that, a solid operating quarter.","The big news on the HCP side, as many of you already know, is the announced combination of DaVita HealthCare Partners with the Everett Clinic. The Everett Clinic is one of the most respected, multi-specialty practices in America with a strong primary care focus, more than 350 physicians currently and we and they believe there is wonderful potential for highly robust growth in their market in the years to come. Already they take care of over 300,000 patients, that's mostly fee-for-service today, but there is especially strong interest in that geography by all parties to work with it and moving further down the value versus volume spectrum, we look to close in early 2016 and we're awfully excited. The balance of the business pipeline is strong, I'll leave it at that unless people want to talk during Q&A.","On the Kidney Care side, operating income on the other hand was adversely impacted \u2013 affected by a non-recurring incident, $23 million reserve for refunds related to prior reimbursements received by our DaVita RX pharmacy business.","So, we had a $22 million non-recurring pickup on one side, a $23 million non-recurring hit on the other side. So the net is the quarter is the quarter, but it's got those puts and takes.","Our non-acquired dialysis treatment growth was 3.5%, usually I don't cover that, I'm covering it this time because it was the lowest in some time, a lot of different causes, just discuss a few of them, we've referred to some hospital contracting changes as of the last quarter or two, that continues to impact our numbers.","We're also experiencing significant delays in some states where we are more concentrated than others. Due to delays in state certification and other regulatory issues, we have nearly doubled the number of de novos awaiting certification compared to the same time last year. And in addition, so far this year, we're not picking up any tailwind in terms of treatment growth from decreasing mortality.","Nonetheless, we still expect total treatment growth over the intermediate term to remain between 4.5% and 6% as we have previously discussed at our Capital Markets Day, although we could be a bit below this year. And we expect non-acquired growth to remain between 3% and 4.5%, although the near term is likely to be at the lower end of that.","Overall, 2015 guidance \u2013 enterprise guidance is now $1.87 billion to $1.915 billion. In Kidney Care, we are raising the guidance just slightly, operating income from $1.63 billion to $1.655 billion now. In HCP, we are tightening the range, operating income expectation of $240 million to $260 million. We're not giving quantitative 2016 guidance at this time, we'll be doing that \u2013 that type of 2016 guidance on the Q4 call, but we do want to provide some directional guidance for both HealthCare Partners and for Kidney Care.","On the HCP side, we have two definite earnings headwinds and one potential earnings headwind. Number one is a definitive headwind in the form of reimbursement cuts. And these have been previously discussed for the most part a net $50 million hit in MA reimbursement because of the completion of the 100% move to the new HCC model, which has been previously disclosed and that number discussed.","In addition, we expect about $20 million in Medicaid cuts as the State of California adjusts for the data on the Medicaid expansion population that came in earlier in the program and them settling that out at this time.","The second earnings headwind is actually, we intend to make good news for the long term, which is some significant infrastructure and next-generation investments on the HCP side. We're at the point now where we can execute in these kinds of strategic moves with more confidence. The biggest chunk of that is on the IT and technology side, everything from improving the point-of-care information for our delivery system, significantly improving the depth and breadth of our mobile applications, significantly enhancing our website presence and features both for internal use and external use, and when we talk about external, we're talking about IPA physicians, we're talking about brokers, we're talking about patients, significant improvement in our data mining capability, in our clinical data warehouse, improvements in patient scheduling, things like that.","The second largest area of increased investment will be in compliance legal. The \u2013 one of the other large ones is in increased physician recruiting as our growth potential continues to unfold, but the general title is a lot of infrastructure and next-generation investment. Now, one would reasonably want to ask for a lot of rigorous discussion of any such investment, and at our Capital Markets Day, we will provide just that, and we intend to do Capital Markets in the first half of the year.","The third headwind is the potential headwind, which is the potential of the non-renewal of a payer contract due to the fact that right now, the rate offer is unacceptable. We hope it doesn't happen as it will cause significant patient and employer disruption, but it could, but that's a potential.","Now the good news to weigh against those two real headwinds for next year and the one potential headwind for next year is our expectation of continued strong performance in our legacy markets.","If you look over the last three years, the growth in our MA population in those legacy markets has been 15% on a CAGR basis. And if you eliminate the MA rate reductions on the RAF model side, on the HCC model side, then the CAGR of EBITDA growth in the last few years is approximately 4% or so. So, without those headwinds, we would be looking at some more favorable numbers. Nevertheless, when you put all that together, the net is that 2016 OI in HCP is likely to be lower than 2015, stepping back from that one year fact, our investment thesis still stands. We have a strong and substantial foundation where we are good at doing at scale what others want to be good at and we are working hard to enhance the team and value proposition as we move forward.","On the dialysis front, I think we can be quite concise that it would be a year with the typical puts and takes in terms of upsides and downsides, if not for the fact that our Medicare reimbursement will be near-flat, and that's just a difficult headwind to overcome on that side as so many of you know.","A few words on capital deployment, from an enterprise perspective, perhaps three points: point number one, in the quarter, we did significant capital deployment with substantial acquisitions in both U.S. Kidney care and HealthCare Partners, and we also did significant share repurchases as our earnings press release reflected; The second point is, we still have a healthy cash balance and continue to generate strong cash flows; and the third and final point is that we look forward continuing to deploy that cash over the next several quarters in the same way that we deployed that capital in this past quarter, evaluating the relative opportunities on an ongoing basis.","Now, I hand it over to Jim Hilger, our Chief Financial Officer, who will walk through some more details and some of the numbers.","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","Thanks, Kent. Starting with Kidney Care, operating profits increased $17 million sequentially. This includes the increase in refund reserves recorded in Q3 at DaVita Rx. This improvement is driven primarily as a result of two main positive factors: one, an additional treatment day in the third quarter; and two, solid cost management of both patient care costs and G&A expense, with each down over $1 per treatment in the quarter as compared to Q2. International losses were $15 million in the quarter and this is consistent with the last quarter. We continue to expect international losses in 2015 to be close to $50 million.","Now, on to the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $103 million in the third quarter, which is a good run rate for debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to non-controlling interests was $46 million. We expect non-controlling interests to be slightly lower in Q4.","Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the third quarter was 40.5%. We expect the full-year tax rate for 2015 to be in a range of 39% to 40%, excluding the impact of the Vainer settlement. Also, we purchased $341 million of our common stock in the third quarter, which brings our total year-to-date repurchases to $425 million and 5.6 million shares.","As you think about modeling the fourth quarter, here's a few things to keep in mind: Q4 is typically the weakest OI quarter of the year for HCP, and dialysis G&A tends to increase in the fourth quarter. Both of these are factored into our full 2015 operating income guidance.","Now, turning to cash flow, we continue to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $679 million in the quarter. We now expect 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.675 billion and $1.775 billion. This range excludes the approximately $300 million after-tax impact of the Vainer settlement.","Please note that the strong cash flows in 2015 are borrowing a bit from the 2016 operating cash flows due to the timing of cash tax payments and other working capital items. As always, this guidance range captures a majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range.","And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. I'm sorry. I was on mute. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from Mr. Kevin Ellich. You may begin.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Hey Kent, just wanted to start off, could you talk a little bit about \u2013 you named a bunch of headwinds? And also, the $22 million of risk sharing settlement for HCP. Just wondering if you'd give us a bit more color on that, how we should think about that if that is (0:15:35) kind of a one-time item?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. When you \u2013 you're referring to the $22 million positive pickup?","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Yes. That's right.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Jim, why don't you go ahead and cover that?","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","Yeah, Kevin that amount is \u2013 did occur \u2013 let me start over. That amount covers multiple periods, not just all in this quarter and it was out of trend. That's why we call it out. I wouldn't expect the same level of impact in future periods.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It was a positive development in large part, after a whole lot of back and forth between us and their payer, where the payer agreed that we actually deserved additional revenues and settled up in one fell swoop.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. And then, I know you guys have the non-acquired treatment growth has been a little bit lower and you called out a number of things, Kent. How long do you think this will persist and when do you think we'll see normalized growth kind of back in the 4% to 4.5% range? Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's the right question, Kevin, and I'm unfortunately going to disappoint you in the answer, which is, it's not clear. We know, as we've continued to prune our hospital portfolio, that we'll put that behind us and then the year-over-year comparisons will start to be different than the way they look right now. But the certification and regulatory delays are very hard to predict and particularly in places like California where we have a lot of centers and a lot of centers waiting to be built and\/or certified and\/or occupied, where we're really getting hurt. And if we were more adept in this area in terms of predicting, we would have told you ahead of time that it was going to happen, and clearly, we didn't tell you ahead of time.","And then on the mortality front, we've done so well over the last four years, five years, six years in a row, and this plateauing was not something we expected. And so, we, at the same time or in the same way, are not good at saying what's going to happen over the next year to that trajectory. So in two out of the three that I mentioned and then there's a few other drivers that just aren't worth going into, but as you can see, in two out of the three that I did mention, we just don't have the ability to predict, unfortunately.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks a lot. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Yes. Our next question is coming from Mr. Matt Borsch. Your line is open.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Just directionally, it seems that you would still be pointing to the Kidney Care side having positive operating income growth for 2016. Can you comment on that?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We actually are not commenting on that and we only wanted to comment on HCP because we felt there might be a growing gap in the perception what was likely to happen because you couldn't have insight into how aggressive we intend to be in terms of infrastructure investments and next-generation investment, reflecting a real bullishness on how differentiated we could be a few years downstream. And so because of that, we said, gee, there is no reason to wait because we know we're going to do it. It's not dependent on any intervening development. And we know we're going to have to do a lot of explaining and we're eager to do that explaining. But absent that, we just felt it's not appropriate to go into further quantify guidance at this time.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Let me back off if I could and just ask a high-level question. As we think about the HCP model and certainly I think there's a very compelling case that the physician-led delegated model is \u2013 has historically and will continue to outperform the hospital-centric model.","But if you look at the markets where, in essence, you're competing with the hospitals for the hearts and minds of physicians, do you think what the hospitals are doing, I'm sure it varies by system, but is it real here or in most cases, we really haven't gotten into real risk taking in a lot of these markets? It's upside-only bonuses and window dressing and bells and whistles around HCOs. I just want to get your sense of your assessment of the hospital systems and what they're really doing on integration.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me grope around here for a minute and then we can see where you want to take it, Matt. First of all, not surprisingly, the answer differs a lot by institution, that some are far more committed, far more adept, have been working on it for far longer, allocate more talent and capital. And those entities are doing some real stuff, real population health management, really bending the cost curve. That is a small minority of the overall pool.","A lot of other folks are acquiring practices and recruiting doctors, where \u2013 with 85% of the motivation being to just secure their referral flow. And they are not making the tough decisions and tough investments associated with actually getting very good at that. And so for us, however, in either case, we look at it with a fresh set of eyes. Some hospitals and health systems are becoming great partners to us. And we will work with them to succeed in both population health management and fee-for-service at the same time. In other cases, we are in fact competing with hospitals as they speak to move down the path or just try to gain control of their referral flows. So for us, whether health system is really committed and getting good at it or actually not committed is independent of our decision of who is friend or foe, and sometimes it's kind of in the middle.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. No, that's great. I'll get out of the queue.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. You're welcome back as always.","Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is coming from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck. Your line is open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks. Can you just explain a little more what the pharmacy item was?","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","It's just a case where we had built for some items and we got paid for them. And as part of our normal compliance reviews, we uncovered that. We should not have been paid for them or paid the wrong amount, I'm not going to know all the details. And so, we went back in time, identified all those instances, and in some cases, I think going back four years, five years and maybe payments to the government. But because we did it in one fell swoop across three different issues going back in time, it added up to a pretty significant number, and so we felt we better carve that out and let you know.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And I guess when you gave the guidance on HCP, you didn't mention there is a tailwind to deal \u2013 that you guys have been pretty active on the deal time to \u2013 you've obviously been ramping up some de novo starts. And I guess there was some thought that Arizona and New Mexico would start to look better next year. So just wanted to see directionally, are those things not going to be contributing into next year or how do we think about that?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Very fair question. And the problem with the business model is A), right now, some of these assets are expensive, because so many people would like to have them as their partner; and B), in many instances, they one \u2013 step one is actually to add expense to start building the capability and start negotiating the contracts that are going to lead to the incremental value and the incremental profit. But it means you're adding expense before you're adding revenue with positive contribution margins, and it takes time to get some of the contracts and execute.","So, while a number of those different investments we've made are right on plan, those plans are not going to contribute any significant incremental profit in 2016. And in cases like the Everett Clinic, which has a long track record of strong operating performance, nonetheless the growth opportunity is so substantial, we are eager with them to invest, to go pursue that growth opportunity. But in the short term, that means a bunch of expense. So, we understand that it's our responsibility to delineate this with good conceptual and analytical rigor at the Capital Markets Day. In the meantime, the net number is nothing to get excited about from a short-term profit point of view.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I guess, that makes sense. What about the Arizona and New Mexico, I thought those were kind of on a multi-year kind of a rebuild?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think our policy is not to go through every individual market on every call. What I can tell you is that if you look at our sort of portfolio of new markets and joint ventures, some which are two-years-old, some are one-year-old, some are six-months-old, that the 2016 versus 2015 results in aggregate are going to be about the same, and that's a mix of \u2013 of some moving into profitability, some moving into bigger losses and everything in between. But the portfolio is basically a non-story in terms of helping or hurting 2016 versus 2015.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then I guess maybe last question. If the CMS reg was finalized, I just wondered (0:26:13) your interpretation of the provisioning there to kind of include drugs more quickly into the bundled rate. I think there's been some hope that as EPO goes generic, there can be notably a period of time where you guys benefit from the lower cost drug for a while, it seemed like what TLS was trying to do is trying to narrow that window. And so, I just want to understand your interpretation of that, and then also, if in fact Amgen waits a while to match, and one of the drug that's currently out there starts to get used a little bit, is that going to put you \u2013 is that a headwind potentially into 2017, I guess?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me turn that one over to LeAnne.","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs","Yeah. Well there was a couple of questions in there. So let me adjust restate what CMS is doing. One, they have categories which they have identified for when a drug or a service would be new, and so how that would come into the bundle. And number two, as you're specifically referencing, I think, the introduction of IV Sensipar, they have accepted the industry's recommendation that that product be outside of the bundle for a transition period, which time that they will be to able to establish the cost and clinical efficacy, et cetera of that product, and then as they suggest that that period be a minimum of two year. After such period, both that product as well as the oral equivalent will come into the bundled payment system. They don't go through much more detail than that or a little bit more detail, but I'm sure we look forward to working with them over the next couple of years through the detail implementation. I'm not sure if that answers your question, but if you want to be more specific, I can certainly provide a little more data.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, that's definitely helpful. I guess the generic biosimilar, could a biosimilar EPO gets thrown into that same...","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs","Yeah. So, in the first \u2013 in my first statement, they have identified categories where a new entrant would just come in under existing payment. So yes, the biosimilars, we would expect, would be under the bundled payment system when the FDA approval is complete.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And they're just going to \u2013 weighted average for the use of those drugs versus the average to come up with what the new rate for that drug will be?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs","Yeah. So, remember, for the ESRD payment system, there is no particular quote rate for any single component of the bundle, but it's the bundled payment system. I haven't thought through for you how non-ESRD clinics would be reimbursed for a product like that. I can give it some thought and certainly get back to you.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. Okay. No, that's helpful. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is coming from Mr. Gary Lieberman. Your line is open.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I guess the first question on the HCP expenses for the infrastructure and investments. The way you were speaking, it sounds like most of that's going to be expensed. Is there some portion that would be capitalized or are you still trying to figure out how much of that would get capitalized versus the expense?","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","Some will be capitalized, but not a big percentage.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And so I guess excluding the sort of some of those upfront investments, you didn't say specifically, but sort of insinuated that operating income would be positive without that? Is that a fair statement?","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","Well, let's see. What I did say was that because of the expected headwinds, netting against the organic growth, et cetera, that we expect OI to be down. I actually \u2013 trying to do all the math in my head, without the investments, I can't answer your question spontaneously. But in aggregate, given the two definitive headwinds and the one potential headwind and given our current sense of organic growth, et cetera, that we expect the net to be unfortunately one that leads OI to be down 2016 versus 2015, so I realize I just restated what I said earlier, but I think I just have to leave it at that.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe on that, the third potential headwind, is there any more detail you could throw us on that, is that a large contract, is that somewhere that you've had issues before?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that would be not in our shareholders' best interest to go into any more detail on an active negotiation.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe turning towards the Kidney Care business and just getting an update on, to the extent that that you can give it on your ESA strategy, specifically I guess the 10% of the drug that you could use non \u2013 not of EPO based under the current contract, are you doing any of that or you're thinking of doing any of that? And then also maybe comment on, it sounds like Amgen is trying to move some customers to \u2013 onto Aranesp to see if you are doing that or what your thoughts are around that?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","LeAnne, do you want to go ahead and take that please.","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs","Can you repeat your question please, sorry?","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Sure. The \u2013 first part of it was, is sort of just an update on your ESA strategy and specifically...","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs","Yes.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","...the 10% of your contract that you're allowed to use outside of Epogen? And then the second piece of it was, any comments or thoughts or anything that you're doing regarding Amgen's apparent move to try to get someone dialysis operators to move to Aranesp as opposed to Epogen?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs","Yeah. Sure. We do intend to do a pilot on the long-lasting Micera (0:32:32) agent in 2016, and certainly we do have availability with that 10% to try both a long-lasting agent as well as one other biosimilar for Epogen that would come in and we certainly will consider both options.","As for Amgen-specific actions with respect to moving the industry to Aranesp, clearly that seems in some way for them to be competing with the steroids, the long-lasting agent and making sure that they have an opportunity for the marketplace to test our product. We are not presently doing anything significant with Aranesp. Does that answer your question?","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. I think that answers my question. And then, excuse me, really just a follow-up on that, (0:32:24) any questions \u2013 not any questions, any thoughts or comments on the FDA's letter on Retacrit.","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs","No, just we've seen what's in the public marketplace the same issue and we wish them the best if they answer the questions with the FDA.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Margaret Kaczor. Ma'am, your line is open.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I know you guys don't want to talk about specific kind of partnerships. But you've seen (0:34:01) you've seen (0:34:02) running at a $500 million run-rate. And just broadly speaking, as we go out until year three, year four, and year five, what should we think of top-line growth rate as well as the profitability profile? And then just to follow up on that, as we think of other partnerships that you guys are doing, are you expecting a more similar profitability and top-line growth rate? Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we are not in the practice of giving that kind of market-by-market guidance. And even if we were, we would hesitate because there is so much uncertainty in exactly how it will unfold. And we, as you know, ramped up from nothing to $500 million, imputed top line in a very short time, and as (0:35:00) going in the markets to the range of outcome over the next year or two is quite wide. And so, we're excited about it and we have a high-quality partnership with the big-positioned IPA and with IVC. But to go any further would just not be prudent. There's just two wide a range of outcomes.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And in terms of kind of the NAG growth, I know you touched on the impact of acute care contracts and maybe those patients coming in. But can you give us any kind of clarity in terms of what the chronic non-acquired treatment growth was in the quarter?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll have to turn to my partner here, I don't know if it's a number we've disclosed before or not. We have not done that in the past, but we'll let us reflect on it, given our NAG is down and that's one of the reasons it's a very fair question. So let us reflect and maybe starting next quarter, we'll put it out.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, I'll sneak one more in if I could. In terms of kind of the delays \u2013 the regulatory delays in opening some clinics, do you expect that to move into different states as well? Are you prepared for that? And is it just you guys that are maybe seeing some of these delays or competitors as well? Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We think everybody is experiencing the same delays on that front. However, we have a significantly higher percentage of our de novas in some of the states that are the slowest right now, California being prominent among them.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you, Margaret.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mr. (0:36:43). Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Good afternoon. With regard to Everett, you commented that it serves mostly a fee-for-service population, and that you hope going forward, it becomes more of a value-based enterprise. How do we move from sort of the fee-for-service model today to where you want to be in the future? And is that primarily going to come in the Medicare Advantage space or commercial partnered with hospitals, or how do we think about the conversion there? Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Got it; three points. Point number one, we think good multi-specialty groups can make significant contribution margins in a fee-for-service world, as Everett Clinic and others have demonstrated. So, we never want to confuse profitability as being only the result of having globally capitated contracts that \u2013 it's our premise that exactly the opposite is true, especially, when we start partnering with a group and they have more access to capital to do some of the things that are quite leveraged even in a fee-for-service world.","Second, that the \u2013 one of the powerful levers to pull to enhance the value proposition and profitability of a major medical group is actually to sign some global risk contracts and begin to invest in eliminating waste from this system and improving health.","And then third, there's all sorts of less dramatic value-based contracting that can go on in between, whether it's shared savings and bonus plans and new market incentives and combined ancillaries, and so that the menu of intermediary steps that can be taken with plans in a market, or with a health system or with other medical groups is quite long. And so, with the Everett Clinic, we're excited because our five-year strategy encompasses accomplished all three of those fulcrums.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. And then just a follow-up on HCP and you sort of touched on this generally. But investors, I would say, have been patient with sort of the business and profitability trends. And I think a lot of people were optimistic that 2016 would sort of be the inflection year, where things generally start to turn for the better. Clearly, some of the things that are going on next year are true business sort of things that will come up, other \u2013 some of it's going to be discretionary. I guess, what would you say to people that \u2013 when should we really start to thinking about an inflection in the investments in the patients really begins to pay off for the shareholders? And I'll leave at that. Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's the X-hundred million dollar question. And right now, we just can't give a date where that happens, although we certainly respect the fact that patients can run thin, and it's part of why we look forward so much to the upcoming Capital Markets session, where we can spend a significant block of time going through this with more analytical rigor.","I would remind folks that absent the change in the RAF model, which certainly we've mis-handicapped, but absent the change in the RAF model, we would all be sitting here quite content with our margins and returns and their trajectory. Now, that just so happens to be a major issue. And not to be ignored, and government policy can continue to change although that model of course is 100% implemented in the MA program has an awful lot of political support in terms of supporting the benchmark rate. But we do want to make sure people continue to parse through the impact of that single MA model change from the performance of the legacy market \u2013 from the performance of the new market.","And at Capital Markets, we'll attempt to do a real good job of parsing through those different components. And so, you can assess whether your patients should be sustained or jettisoned.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks a lot.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is coming from Gary Taylor. Your line is open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sorry. Hi. Good evening, a couple housekeeping items first, I want to make sure I have correct. The refund of the pharmacy payments in the ESRD segment, that was a revenue item?","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","Yes. That reduced revenue.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And the new revised guidance for consolidated company on operating income, the $1.870 billion to $1.915 billion, that is versus the $1.421 billion nine-month figure or is that nine-month figure actually being adjusted in some way?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","People are reflecting and staring at pieces of paper, Gary. So, can you go on your next question and...","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","...I'll come back to you later.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. On that, I guess I'm getting to kind of \u2013 I'm trying to understand just the implied fourth quarter operating income, which I think is $449 million to $494 million, which tied to again kind of your comment sequentially, but I just want to make sure I'm apples-to-apples there? And...","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","Gary. Yeah. You said that the year-to-date $1.421 billion, that's correct. Yeah. That'd be non-GAAP adjusted.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And revenue per treatment in Dallas has been stronger year-to-date than we thought, I know in the last couple of calls, you've talked about commercial mix being kind of a surprising positive trend factor. Obviously, that number was stable sequentially, so it couldn't have done \u2013 it couldn't have done much, maybe the growth year-over-year narrowed a little bit. So is that the right conclusion, commercial mix kind of holding stable with that \u2013 that year-over-year improvement, Kent?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Of the two dynamics, one is mixed, and of course, even small increments and decrements can move the dial. And I'm trying to remember at what level we were around on the numbers that you've seen. But if it's a full percentage point, which is my memory, then...","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I think it's right.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","...there can be a significant movement within that. And then, second, as you know as well as any of us, that we're always winning and losing some battles on the payer front in terms of rate negotiation. And right now, we're having a few more victories than defeat in that realm, and so some of that \u2013 that's \u2013 some of that is contributing.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Last question, just trying to understand a little bit, going to the ATP segment, capitated number of months down \u2013 no actually pure enrollment, I think down about 18,500 or a couple of 2% sequentially and down a little bit year-over-year. I know you call out in your text legacy markets and for months (0:44:43) approximately flat. So will this include \u2013 you've intentionally dropped some membership in some of the newer markets or is that the right conclusion?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We do have one of the new markets where we very intentionally dropped a plan that led to a significant drop in membership, and that was a good thing for our P&L and for our strategic position. Now, having said that, I'm not sure that explains exactly what you're bringing up, so let me look around the room here. Yeah, Gary, yeah, that is the explanation. It was very conscious and negotiated and has significantly enhanced our P&L.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is coming from Steven Erito (0:45:38).Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","I just wanted to follow up on the HCP questions. I think the keyword was patients, and we've been in your stock for a couple of years on in-patient. Is there any way we could get some outlook prior to the Analyst Day in May? Certainly, you guys have made a decision to budget higher expenses. I'd just like to get an idea of what type of return you're looking for to get on those expenses and not have to wait until April or May of next year? Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We will think about it. We are contemplating moving the Capital Markets up relative to last year. And in addition, we're going to give the actual quantitative guidance after Q4. So, I think you'll have two good bites of the apple of getting more information and being able to test it relatively soon. Am I answering the question, or am I missing it?","Unknown Speaker","No, I think you got it. That's fine. And the other questions, kind of addressed it, so I won't belabor the point. Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions.","Kent J.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita HealthCare Partners First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute, to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions).","Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin sir.","James Gustafson","Well, thank you Kim, and welcome everyone to our first quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations; and with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Garry Menzel, our CFO; Craig Samitt, President of our HealthCare Partners Division; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meanings of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, included in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-K.","Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent Thiry","Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for your interest in DaVita HealthCare Partners. Q1, disappointing financial performance in HealthCare Partners. Strong financial performance in Kidney Care. I will discuss this performance as well as we will update our outlook, but first as always, I will review our clinical outcomes. We continue to present our clinical outcomes first, because that is what comes first. We are first and foremost a caregiving company.","On the Kidney Care side, we now serve approximately 165,000 dialysis patients in the United States, approximately 35%; and in this area, CMS recently released the quality incentive program payment results for 2014 payments. I remind everyone that the way they structure the quality incentive program is with penalties only, there is only downside, so that's why we will use the penalty word.","They had established four clinical measures, central venous catheters, AV fistulas, URR, less than 65, and hemoglobin, less than 12. DaVita ranked number one in the industry in all four clinical measures, and if you look at the percent penalties in aggregate, only 1.6 of DaVita clinics had any penalty, compared to 6% of clinics for the rest of the industry. This performance is even more notable, especially when you adjust for socio-economic factors given we have more lower income people and people of color in our patient population in the overall nation.","Nonetheless, we had a 59% lower rate of penalty centers versus the rest of the industry in four counties, and we improved our rural clinic performance year-over-year, while the rest of the industry saw rural clinic performance decline.","Moving on to HealthCare Partners and clinical metrics in that area, one of the areas of focus is reducing hospital readmissions in the second half of 2013, looking at California and Nevada, we had a 14% readmission rate, that is 24% below the national benchmark of 18.4%. This alone means our patients avoided more than 700 readmissions over the last six months, relative to the rest of the nation.","For these and other clinical outcomes, for both Kidney Care and HealthCare Partners, we compare very favorably to national averages, and our superior clinical results in healthier patients and lower taxpayer costs.","Now, moving on to operating performance, where I will jump right into discussing HealthCare Partners. I will discuss both Q1 and the lower guidance for the year. Q1 was amiss, it was a big miss and it was another in the series of misses. This is embarrassing for us, and no doubt, worrisome for you. So legitimate and expected question is, what is going on? And the explanation for the quarter and the year are pretty much the same. So I will discuss most of it in the context of the year.","Number one, the primary driver of this shortfall, is the fact that in the first phase of the DaVita HealthCare Partner's combination, there was a small group of new market, new business deals done, which have substantially underperformed plan. The deals fell into a few different categories, including acquisitions and assuming some risk contracts.","In aggregate, these deals explain about half of the $50 million reduction in the midpoint of our guidance. Within this category, the largest was Albuquerque, and on this front, the new and incremental bad news, is that the health plan acquisition of the Lovelace plan by Blue Cross, Blue Shield has not yet been approved by the government, which means our globally capitated arrangement does not fully kick in, which creates incremental losses each month, and also makes the post approval, if we assume approval recovery, incrementally tougher as well.","Separate factor for the $50 million, we misestimated the average MA rate we will receive by 0.8%, eight-tenths of a percent on our patients across our geographies, which equals $16 million for the year, $4 million per quarter.","Next, the third and final contributor to the decreased guidance, but it does not constitute underperformance, is that we have incorporated this expectation of $10 million in startup losses in our new Tandigm joint venture, with independents Blue Cross and Philadelphia. This was explicitly excluded from our guidance last quarter. So while we corporate it, means that we go down in under $10 million in guidance, it does not constitute any underperformance versus prior comments.","There is a potential offsetting upside to the scenario we just laid out. We had a contractual contingency in one of our new markets, that could very well lead to recognizing another $30 million to $45 million in revenue this year, of which $10 million to $24 million would be attributed to 2014 performance and activities, and the balance to 2013.","Now the next question you might well ask, how can you possibly expect us to feel comfortable going forward, given the magnitude of this change? And the answer is, we probably can't make you feel comfortable, until we start doing what we said we would do. But we can tell you, that the team that did those deals, was displaced many months ago.","The next question might well be, when will the new markets get better? Assuming no contingency payout this year for us, we would be disappointed, very disappointed if they did not do better in 2015.","Next question, how much better should we expect them to do? And on that front, we are not comfortable estimating at this point. We fear it would be too unreliable.","The next question is, while separate from the economic underperformance of this portfolio of early deals, how should we think about what that says for our overall value proposition? And here the good news is, that in each of these situations, we are adding the clinical value we are supposed to add. We are getting good physician leadership momentum, as we are supposed to and we are advancing the integrated care capability of our partners and affiliate physicians, as we are supposed to. So we are fulfilling the fundamental value proposition in these situations, despite the underperforming economics.","Next question might well be, as you stare at the numbers and reflect on this explanation, would be, given the explanation of the shortfall, it seems to apply that the three big legacy foundational markets, California, Nevada and Florida, are performing solidly. And the good news is, that answer is an unambiguous, yes. If you were to strip out, what we might call legacy ACP from the four deal portfolio, they generated approximately $76 million NOI and $116 million in EBITDA after allocating all corporate overhead, and a couple of minor non-recurring item adjustments, and those numbers, as you well realize, would put us right on schedule.","Next question, what does the series of events do to your confidence, my confidence, our confidence, and the team and the business? And our answer has a few parts. That the new team, the new HealthCare Partners leadership team, does deals with traditional DaVita discipline. Having said that, we are doing new things, and there will be an experience curve. And as to the broader question, a broader question about the industry, our views have not changed, and greater care and population health management will grow. We are good at doing that with physicians in the lead.","Thank you. I look forward to your questions, and now on to LeAnne Zumwalt with an update on policy issues.","LeAnne Zumwalt","Thanks Kent. I will cover two topics. One, the recent ESRD legislation, and two, the 2015 Medicare Advantage rate notice.","So first, as part of the reason, physician SGR legislation, Congress partially addressed dialysis, reimbursement underfunding. The key legislative highlights are, as in the 2014 ESRD rule, the 2015 rate would be essentially flat with 2014. The good news, is that the remaining dialysis cuts were reduced and stretched over three years.","In 2016 and 2017, our bundled payment rate will be updated by market basket minus 1.25%, and in 2018, market basket minus 1. The bundling of additional oral drugs is delayed until 2024. This is positive outcome, as there was substantial risk that CMS significantly underfunded these drugs in 2016, resulting in a de facto rate cut.","Overall, this is a good victory for the care community, as these changes were scored by the congressional budget office, of putting about $2.2 billion back into the dialysis payment system.","Having said that, we still on average, lose money on our Medicare patients. The absence of full market basket increases over the next few years, the Medicare reimbursement will be further below our cost of providing care. As a result, we will expand only in geographies where there is a healthy subsidy from the private sector. And geographies without the private support will remain flat, or be a contraction of service, as we will be forced to close some centers.","Second, in April, CMS announced the final Medicare Advantage benchmark rates for 2015. Based on the final roll, we expect 2015 rates to be roughly flat for us, compared to 2014. We and others benefit from the rollbacks in the planned risk recalibration in 2015. Although this presents uncertainty in 2016 and beyond, as CMS moves forward with the new model.","Going back, the risk recalibration is good for beneficiaries, as it will help prevent more dramatic benefit changes in 2015, moving to the new model could create adverse selection or encourage payors to take steps to avoid serving higher cost patients, whose health needs are the greatest.","Its encouraging that CMS ought to protect MA benefits and acknowledge the clinical improvements that Medicare Advantage Program is making. Saying, and I quote, enrollees are benefiting from greater quality. Over half of enrollees now in plans with four or more stars, a significant increase from 37% of enrollees in such plans in 2013. Note that in HCP, we have over 80% of our patients in plan, that are four star rated and above for 2015, well above national averages.","I will now turn the call to Garry.","Garry Menzel","Thanks LeAnne. I will walk through a few more details on the numbers. First, some additional comments on our Kidney Care operating metrics.","Kidney Care adjusted operating income of $387 million was up $1 million from the prior quarter. Non-acquired dialysis treatment growth in the quarter was 5%, when normalized for days of the week. Dialysis segment profitability was down $21 million sequentially, due to two negative factors, offset by three positive factors.","The two negative factors were; one, three fewer treatment days in the quarter; and two, an increase in patient care costs of $4.42 per treatment, which was due primarily to an increase in EPO unit cost in the quarter, and seasonally higher fixed and central level expenses per treatment, because of the fewer treatment days in the quarter.","These were largely offset by three positive factors; a 2% increase in treatments per day, as a result of strong non-acquired growth. Two, a $0.77 increase in dialysis revenue per treatment; and three, a $4.19 decrease in dialysis segment G&A, $1.50 of which is due to impairments that were recorded in the fourth quarter, and the remainder is a combination of tighter G&A controls, and normal quarterly fluctuations.","During the quarter, we lost $6 million in our international operations, in line with our prior international outlook of $25 million of losses. However, at the time, this specifically included any costs for our Saudi Arabia expansion. As our planned ramp up in Saudi Arabia will create $15 million in additional operating losses in 2014, we now expect to lose $40 million internationally, which is included in our increased Kidney Care guidance.","Kent has already discussed in detail the performance of HealthCare Partners, so I will next review some key metrics for the overall enterprise. First, our debt expense was $106 million in the first quarter. Second, the effective tax rate was 40.5% in the quarter, in line with our expected range of 40% to 41% for full year 2014.","Third, we continue to generate strong cash flows, as operating cash flow was $419 million in the first quarter. We still expect operating cash flow to be between $1.45 billion and $1.55 billion in 2014, excluding any payments associated with the potential settlement of physician relationship investigations.","Finally, we have updated our 2014 operating income guidance. Our updated enterprise operating income guidance is $1.725 billion to $1.84 billion. This includes one, reduced HCP guidance of $205 million to $260 million. Two, increased Kidney Care guidance of $1.52 billion to $1.58 billion. Note that this Kidney Care guidance includes $15 million in 2014 losses to ramp up operations in Saudi Arabia, which were not included in the prior guidance. So combined with the $10 million for Tandigm, that means we are including $25 million in expenses previously excluded. Therefore, on apples-to-apples basis, the bottom of our consolidated guidance range is up $25 million and the top is up $5 million.","I will now hand the call back to KT.","Kent Thiry","Thank you, Garry. I'd like to add one editorial comment on the policy front. The ESRD Kidney Care victory was a big one, and once again, we led the community to a thoughtful strategy and through formidable campaign. I'd like to step back for a moment, and just think about our two primary businesses, Kidney Care and our Medical Group, and think about each of them across four parameters, as we look out over the next two to three years. Rate minus expense times volume and then factored by execution risk.","On the Kidney Care side, rate, there is more downside than upside. Although, we do have somewhat of a reimbursement safety net, as the government cannot afford to have many centers closed.","On the expense side, things look relatively stable, compared to historical norms. On the volume side, things look relatively stable, probably a bit slower than the rate we have enjoyed the last few years. With respect to execution and reliability, Kidney Care looks pretty solid.","On to HealthCare Partners, our medical group. As to rate, there is more downside than upside. As to expense, there is probably more downside than upside, but hopefully, we can make those words not true. As to growth, unit growth looks very promising, and as to execution, reliability, the legacy markets look solid, the new markets look poor.","Now if you step back to look at the aggregate enterprise for a moment, we still think it is a differentially solid platform for the long term. A strategic position is good. The market positions are strong. The talent trajectory is good, and our capital structure and our capital efficiency and our cash flows are all solid.","Thank you, and let's move on to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Justin Lake with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan","Thanks. Good evening. First question, you mentioned the operating income for HCP, and you gave us a number of metrics that basically allowed you back into these recently acquired practices are losing about $80 million for the year in your guidance. Can you tell us what the plan is for turning this around, Kent, and how much we can expect to improve for 2015?","Kent Thiry","Justin, could you repeat the numbers you threw out please?","Justin Lake - JP Morgan","Sure. You said the legacy business is running $76 million, the reported numbers for HCP are $54 million positive. [Indiscernible] back into these newly acquired centers, running about $20 million a quarter of losses? Or $80 million for the year. So obviously a very big number in terms of losses there. I am curious, what you are doing to turn that around, and how quickly you think you could turn around?","Kent Thiry","Yeah. First, without getting into a lot of complexity, you can't just subtract the two and take the difference, and then attribute all of that to new markets, because there is some other stuff going on, like the MA rate predictions, etcetera. There are some issues that cut across the two categories. Its not quite as clean as that. And in addition, some of those losses were absolutely planned and intentional, part of establishing ourselves in new markets. But separate from fine tuning the actual number, what we are going to do, to make it better, is going to sound pretty vanilla on our call. We are working on the rate side, the expense side and the unit side. But the biggest single swing factor, is having the transaction in New Mexico be approved by the government.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan","Can you give us a number on the swing factor for that?","Kent Thiry","I don't think that would be in your best interest, Justin. So I think we will have to hold back from that.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan","Okay. And then, on HCP again. Last quarter you mentioned you're working with plans to try to get the contract structures that were a little more reasonable, in terms of times, when there was pressure on reimbursement. We are just curious if you can give us an update on how those negotiations are going, and whether you're feeling more comfortable going into 2015, than you did in 2014?","Kent Thiry","Yeah, I would say, we made tiny bit of progress in the quarter, that's actually not disappointing, in the sense that a lot of contracts aren't appropriate to change, until they are up for renewal, and we don't necessarily want to precipitate an extensive renewal conversation with everyone at one time. So its not disappointing when I say tiny, nor is it impressive, its kind of a tweener.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan","Okay thanks. I will jump back in the queue.","Kent Thiry","All right.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Good afternoon. Kent, just wanted to clarify again? You said the three big legacy foundational markets was doing -- was at $76 million of operating income, or was it $176 million?","Kent Thiry","It was $76 million, its actually right in that $75 million to $76 million range, and the other number was $116 million in EBITDA after allocating all corporate overhead.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Then, can you give us a little bit more color on the potential upside? Is that all dependent upon the deal -- the Blue Cross deal in New Mexico going through, or is it something else that you're thinking about, that you don't know about yet?","Kent Thiry","We can't disclose exactly where that contractual contingency sits, because of some confidentiality agreements. And so, all we can say is that, that contractual contingency exists within our new market portfolio, and there is a good chance, better than 50% chance that it will in fact be triggered.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Okay. But we don't have any idea on the timing?","Kent Thiry","Since every prediction on the timing has been wrong so far, I think we will shy away from venturing into predicting again.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Fair enough. And then, as for the Medicare Advantage, obviously pretty positive news on that front. But just curious, how close are we to achieving parity between the [indiscernible] parity. Isn't that a year or two out?","Kent Thiry","Most of our counties are in the two year or four year phase down periods. So 2015 will be the final year for our counties and the four year. We do not have any membership of significance in the six year, based on [ph] counties. ","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Okay. So 2015 really is the last year. Okay, great. Then last one on HCP, looking at the decline in operating -- the ratio of operating income to care dollars, have gone from 10% a year ago to 5%. What's your long term objective, where could this go and what's going to get us there?","Kent Thiry","Kevin, say the question one more time please?","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","The ratio of operating income to care dollars under management this quarter came in at 5%. A year ago, it was 10.4%. is that just contingent upon improving operations, and one out of HCP, I guess I am trying to get some idea as to what a normalized ratio should be?","Kent Thiry","I think I am hesitating, because there is a bunch of variables that could push it one way or another. For example, we will probably be doing more joint ventures with payers, and that may very well b e low margin business, because we are splitting the equity and the upside. But on the other hand, it could be incredibly capital efficient, and in the long run, as we have talked about for 15 years, its cash on cash, return on capital, that ultimately determines a company's long term future. And so in some cases, we may be actively seeking, what looks like low margin business, but is incredibly attractive in terms of risk adjusted return on capital.","And then, looking at it from a different perspective, we will also still be doing some of the good old traditional global care business, where we and our physician leaders take the entire bolus of it and manage it with ever increasing capability. So how those different factors are going to net out, combine with just in general, increase competition in the space, is pretty hard to predict.","So I think -- what we will have to get good at doing, is just parsing out these different variables. So you can see, where any movements in margin are good news, bad news, or neutral news.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Kent Thiry","Thank you, Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Zimmermann with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Zimmermann - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Thanks and good afternoon. I was wondering if you could give us some updated thoughts in potential closing of centers. The CMS rate is going to improve and just curious if you're still planning on going ahead on closing centers?","Kent Thiry","Unfortunately the answer is yes, and we are probably going to be closing in the neighborhood of 20 in the near to intermediate term, as much as it breaks our heart, when the government cuts our reimbursement, and holding it flat constitutes a cut, given there are certain cost pressures we face, that we simply can't get down to zero. That in some geographies, where there are not enough private patients to subsidize the federal government, we and other people are going to have to close down some centers. We will do so with incredible care and respect and oversight, in order to take care of our patients and our teammates. But in the end, we are caring a lot of money losing centers, and we can't continue to carry that many, if in exchange, our rates get cut.","Brian Zimmermann - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then on the patient care cost side, I understand that they went up per treatment, but you did a pretty good job containing costs from the G&A side. Can you give us a bit more detail on what those G&A cost controls were, and do you see additional opportunities in the next couple of quarters?","Kent Thiry","I do not think we are going to see a continuation of tremendous accomplishment, so that's where -- that we pulled off over the last year. We started thinking about it and planning for it, a full two, two and a half years ago, when we expected the government to be squeezing reimbursement, and so it was done with a lot of foresight, with a lot of warning and planning, and so it is not to disrupt people's lives nor our company's operations, and of course most importantly, our patient care.","Having said all that, there's limits to how much can be done there, and so, I think you are looking at, pretty much the end of that run of progress.","Brian Zimmermann - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then my last question is on capital deployment. You're sitting here with $1.1 billion on the balance sheet. Can you give us an update on thoughts towards acquisitions or potential repurchases?","Kent Thiry","Well, we are hoping, although it sounds funny to use that word, that we will be taking a big chunk of that cash to execute on our settlement with the federal government, and that would be about $390 million or so, and at our new size, we certainly want to keep -- certainly want cash on hand. Having said that, we don't need to have $1 billion in our wallet, and we will go through our normal exercise, consistent with how we thought the last 15 years, in comparing at that time, our business opportunities, our repurchase opportunities and our debt reduction opportunities. And so right now, we don't have a position on that, and of course, we welcome any input from all of you, which you would prefer.","Brian Zimmermann - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Kent Thiry","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","And your next question comes from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Hi everybody. So wanted to just may be ask a little bit more about some of the deals that you're referring to, and if I guess if you could may be help us think through where you think you miscalculated the most, in terms of entering these new markets and the types of structure you had, its clear in Albuquerque, you miscalculated with regard to the payor landscape and the ability to forge a better relationship there with Lovelace, hopefully that changes. But, can you maybe help us think through how else you have miscalculated, and how this strategy may be pivoting, so that you can avoid that?","Kent Thiry","Darren, it\u2019s a right question. But the correct answer to it, is that the team that did those deals, was not thoughtful. It did not do the right kind of rigorous analysis, reflection. Did not weight the relative merits of partnership versus fighting, and in particular, in one instance, didn't correctly calibrate what had happened after fighting a battle in Albuquerque. Both Lovelace, the hospital and the plan, and us, both sides came out significant losers. The only ones who benefited, were our collective competition.","The new team has since turned relationships around in that market, and we are readying employees to work collaboratively, with both Lovelace and the new plan. The way these things should work, assuming that we do get government approval on that transaction.","So rather than go through what would sound like a relatively vanilla characterization of different types of mistakes, the root cause was the team that was working on it did not bring the right discipline and thoughtfulness, and those people are not doing deals with us anymore.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","Okay. That's fair. I guess may be that turns me to the next most obvious question is, you just announced a fairly significant transaction, this Tandigm joint venture. So may be just, given that there is a new more thoughtful team, I guess, that put that one together, give us some background on how that deal came about, what the model looks like, and may be talk a little bit more about how that strategy will be different?","Kent Thiry","Let me go ahead and take a quick stab, and then Dr. Samitt may want to add. But this is the type of arrangement we might end up doing in other places, and we certainly have a lot of major payors, who are talking to us about types of arrangements like this. IBC is the leading payor in that market, with a very strong market position, and a good reputation, as a citizen in the healthcare community. So we like that type of partner. The way we structured it, is the new venture is incented to succeed. So neither parent company, so to speak, can get in the way, because of any other considerations. The new management team and the Board of Directors are incented structurally to deliver success for patients, physicians and shareholders through that venture; and that's the only way to attract the kind of challenge you need to tackle the challenge, in a market that does not have any significant integrated care penetration.","Lastly I would say, the way its structured, although it will not lead to any quick profit drop-through is very capital efficient; because we are not having to make any large acquisitions, and because of the way the economics are structured, the upfront operating losses are quite modest, in particular, quite modest, relative to the long term market opportunity.","Craig is there anything you'd like to add?","Craig Samitt","Sure KT. Just four additional points. The first is that the IBC-Tandigm transaction allowed us to review lessons learned from the prior deals that KT described in the past, and focus on avoiding risks, that we were faced with some of the other deals from prior to 2014. The second is, as you can see, this is our new pilot in forging a team of equals relationship between a payor and a renowned delivery system. And so, we are optimistic that the shoulder-to-shoulder partnership will be highly effective.","In terms of structure, we are through Tandigm, enabling primary care physicians, with supports from both the payor side, which is very data and analytics rich, and healthcare partners, which is clinical care model and population health rich, in managing the transition of Philadelphia marketplace from volume to value. And fourth, is the reason why this is a prime market for us is that, Philadelphia is one of the highest cost of care marketplaces in the U.S., with in fact the highest admission rate per thousand in the country. So our expertise is very much needed in that market.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","Makes sense. My last question just about Tandigm. What is your enrolment target, if we think about this couple of years down the road, how many lives do you think you will have in that arrangement?","Kent Thiry","It\u2019s a fair question, but there is just too much uncertainty at this point. So giving you a number would be tantamount to just guessing -- if we succeed, the number could be significant. But succeeding is not going to be easy. There are reasons why markets have high admit rates, and part of our challenge is to establish a collaborative constructive relationship with the leading hospitals, in order to collectively bring quality improvements and appropriate savings to the table, shared by everyone.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Kent Thiry","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo","Thanks for taking the question. I guess going back to Albuquerque; specifically, it would appear that there was a meaningful decrease in performance sequentially. Can you give us any more details around what was worse than you had originally expected, just over the last quarter or so?","Kent Thiry","I think Gary, we don't want to go into any more micro detail on individual market. So if you could just allow us to stick with having disclosed much more than we typically do already in individual market, because we felt we needed to, in order to answer the legitimate questions. But I think we best leave it at that.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo","Okay. I guess may be then, a little bit bigger picture on the underperforming deals. Can you may be discuss, how much risk you feel is still there? Is there still some meaningful downside of things don't get better or on the same technology, or do you feel like it sort of bottoms out?","Kent Thiry","I would say, we are much closer to bottoming out, and so the ratio of upside to downside is attractive, a breath of fresh air, in an otherwise stuffy room. So that's good news, I would say.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then do you have any concern that the Blue Cross deal does not close in Albuquerque, or is it just typical stuff that's maybe going to take longer?","Kent Thiry","We don't have any insight really. The Department of Justice keeps those things close to the vest certainly, and periodical evidence would suggest, that the deal will get approved. But you never know for sure, and particular, if in the government's mind, Blue Cross Blue Shield is unwilling to agree to reasonable conditions, then all bets are off. So we don't know enough to handicap other than these things typically, as you know, get closed.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then, does any of this change the guidance you had given on the acquisition pace at HCP, which I think was sort of two this year, more next year, and then a lot the year after?","Kent Thiry","I would say at this point, we are not changing anything.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo","Okay. May be one question on the international comments that were made, the losses, I think Garry, you said were $40 million, and that changed. What was it before?","Garry Menzel","$25 million. Sorry Gary.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo","That's very helpful. And may be last question on dialysis, what did you guys think of the revised parameters around the accountable care demo with the ESCOs?","Kent Thiry","Before I answer that Gary, let me go back and tweak my response to your question about the expected pipeline of significant deals in HealthCare Partners. I think we probably should dial back that expectation a bit, because we need to prove quickly, that we can reliably deliver on what we say we are going to do, before we should run around deploying any more of your capital. So probably, we pull that back a bit, and can't quantify right now, but at least directionally, I think you should think about it that way.","On the ESCOs, we know that we are incredibly passionate and bullish on our capability, to dramatically improve quality and substantially reduce costs and deliver incredible patient experiences in an integrated care, globally capitated or anything like it world for Kidney Care, and we have proven it. And we have proven it at significant scale with breadth and depth, and so we so much want to bring that value to America, and in so doing, forcing others to invest and get better and better at the same time. And we are very grateful that CMS has put so much time into trying to figure out a way to introduce a vehicle for making all that come true.","Having said that, and being very appreciative of some of the changes they make, we were disappointed in what they came out with, and I think I will just stop there.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo","Would you say they are headed in the right direction and just need some minor tweaks, or is it still significantly off-base for what you would need to really ramp up your involvement?","Kent Thiry","We think there is just a couple very reasonable changes that would open up the gates to a beautiful pilot. So we think its very doable and very reasonable.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo","You can't share any of those specifics with us?","Kent Thiry","I don't think that would be good to get into on a big public forum. We are sharing our thoughts with them, and we are incredibly grateful that they are listening.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Kent Thiry","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gurda with KeyBanc.","Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thank you. Kent, if we think about a deal that actually works out as it expected to, how should we or how should we expect to see the multiyear impact on margins play out? Is it one to two years of initial losses, followed by ever increasing margins after that, or --?","Kent Thiry","Yeah, it\u2019s a tough one to answer Jason, because in HealthCare Partners, every deal could be quite different, depending whether we are primarily partnering with a hospital or a physician group or a payor or all of the above, and whether or not they already have risk, or whether or not we are just starting a new risk contract. And so, unfortunately, given unlike dialysis, every deal could be quite different. You need to stare at our track record, in order to draw the right inferences and extrapolations. This is where we have made your life very difficult, by having a lousy track record of doing new things. And so, we recognize the torturous position that our performance has put you in, and we hope to make amends over the next couple of years.","Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets","All right. Putting aside the Albuquerque decision. You will be facing more Medicare Advantage rate cuts in 2015, making additional expansion in investments. Should we expect operating income growth at HealthCare Partners next year?","Kent Thiry","At this point, I think we ought to stay silent on 2015, until we get a little more time and experience under our belt. We are not comfortable saying, OI is going to go down. We are not comfortable saying its going to go up. We are not comfortable sayings its going to be flat. We need a few more months under our belt, before we can give you a value added estimate.","Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. My last question would be, I think you have warned in the past, that the exchanges offer more downside than upside, I think that's the way you put it. Is there any early read on your relationships with the payors on the exchanges that, any takeaways from the first quarter?","Kent Thiry","Although its very preliminary, because as you understand, there is a lot of lag time, in finding out exactly who is going to exchange, and what exchange is going to pay and all that kind of stuff. So with a big caveat, on the fact that it is preliminary, the early results are positive, in the sense that we thought it was going to be quite bad, and so far, it is not.","Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thank you.","Kent Thiry","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. I guess a few questions on HCP. You mentioned that -- I think you said half of the issue was related to deals in new markets, and you mentioned contracts, what was that comment related to? What was the other issue there?","Kent Thiry","There are three drivers of the shortfall Kevin. Half was the new market, new business acquisition portfolio. The second was the Tandigm $10 million previously excluded, so doesn't represent underperformance. The third component was a mistake, we were 0.8% off in forecasting our actual MA rates across the markets, and that 0.8% equals $4 million a quarter, $16 million on a year, right off the bottom line. Its of course embarrassing for us to make a mistake like that, but we did.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess though, in that source bucket we see -- you said the deals fell into buckets of new acquisition and then taking on new risk contracts. I just want to understand what you meant when you meant risk contracts, as opposed to deals being new market entrants?","Kent Thiry","Got it. I am sorry Kevin, I understand the question now. There is one example where we just took over a network for a payor, it was an unsuccessful MA network that they have been running by themselves and with some others unsuccessfully and we took it over from them, with no exchange of capital involved.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So you've basically assumed a new risk contract?","Kent Thiry","Correct.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is it a new market or an existing market?","Kent Thiry","This was a new market, and while we expected losses, because we knew what their current economics were, and some of that we were cushioned from, and then some not. The problem is, the actual losses have exceeded the expected losses in the assumption of that contract.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then I guess broadly, because that sounds hard to sell, I guess sometimes, maybe they are hard to differentiate. But when you look at HCP, would you say that it is more a cost issue or more a contract issue; because it feels like one might be easier to solve in a short period of time than others? I just wanted to get your thoughts around that.","Kent Thiry","Our primary problems there have been from unthoughtful contracting non-thorough due diligence and one very bad business decision. Not our ability to drive integrated care, not our ability to work with physicians in the community to drive quality improvements, and savings and utilization etcetera. The news on those scores is positive, and so I think your diagnosis is correct. The stuff that was done wrong is easily fixed and we think we are there. Now also I want to add, again, we are doing new stuff and different stuff, so there will still be an experience curve, and there will still be a [indiscernible] issue. But we already are way, way, way better on the dimensions that cause us the problems a year, year and a half ago today.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And I guess, I understand the shortfall this year makes you reticent to kind of make predictions about next year. But I think at the Analyst Day, you were kind of thinking that, you could be flat year-over-year in HCP, depending on how the final rate came in with the risk adjusters. It feels to me like the final rate for 2015 was better than one might have thought at the time. This years numbers are lower, it sounds like you feel like you understand to some degree that there is a contracting opportunity into next year, and yet you're not comfortable to say that you will be better next year versus this year. When you think about the swing factors, if its not your ability to manage costs, and that feels like its in control of the next year, what are the factors that you could understand going into next year? Generally where the rates are, generally what the contracting issues are that would stop you from growing next year?","Kent Thiry","Yeah, its very good logic Kevin as usual, and I think the honest answer is just that, if you're sitting in these chairs, having been wrong now a few times, we simply don't want to represent, until we have done a lot more work, analytical work on every aspect of the business, before we start talking about stuff that's a year or two out.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, then I guess just last question. California Duals, do you have a sense there of how you will be participating in there, what the revenue opportunity might be for you?","Craig Samitt","Yeah Kevin, this is Craig Samitt. We are in active discussions with multiple payors, who will be participating in the California Duals program. We hope to be able to participate in the program, but don't know yet if we will, with which payors or for how many patients we will be providing care for.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right. Great. Thanks.","Kent Thiry","Thanks Kevin.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ben Andrew with William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions. Couple of things I guess to start, Kent. Is there some sense that the window of opportunity for transactions is tightening on you, given both the lag between when you have been able to announce large transactions, and that's perhaps what's being manifest in the need to move towards more partnerships than [indiscernible] acquisitions?","Kent Thiry","Let me take a stab and see if I get it right. There aren't very many mature proven MA risk management NDs that are around and independent anymore. So there is not a lot of eight point bucks out in the forest. And the good news is, those that are out there, are differentially interested in us, because of our legacy and our reality of physician leadership. So that's the bad news and good news on that side. But we do these other partnerships, not have a sense of need or not because of some notion that they are second best. We actually think that they can be absolutely as good and effective, as the conventional acquisitions. And in fact, the deal in Philadelphia is starting off with a very collaborative partnership with a leading physician IPA in the market. Its not just a payor DaVita partnership. The leading doctors who want to bring the improved quality and savings that comes from integrated care are very much onboard with the effort.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Okay. And then, looking at that Pennsylvania opportunity is kind of your first big foray in the northeast. Are there other obvious markets in that region that makes sense for you all, assuming that you're able to prove out the kind of the performance with this one?","Kent Thiry","Yes.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Excellent. And then I guess the only other question is, on the international dialysis side. The Saudi Arabian contracts, and you have given us some good details on the startup there. How quickly can that be a material contributor? Is this really going to be a multiple year process to bring that to something that moves the needle for the dialysis franchise internationally? Thanks.","Kent Thiry","Its going to be a couple years, just because there is so many centers involved and so many patients, that will be in a constant state of having a bunch of young immature centers, where we have got operating costs but not many patients, or zero patients as we build them, and then just the classic issues of having overhead, that's disproportionate to the revenue, and tell you have enough centers up and running. So its going to be a couple of years.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Thank you.","Kent Thiry","We will of course work very hard to provide analysis that allows you to gauge our progress, and not just force you to sit back and wait for years until the portfolio matures.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with Citi.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","Hi, good afternoon. A few questions; one, I just wanted to follow-up on the California Duals -- maybe I am incorrect, but it was my understanding at LA County, the plans were enrolling to Dual eligibles already. So I would have thought, they would have had provider networks in place, but it doesn't sound like that's the case?","Kent Thiry","That is correct. The first phase of enrollment has begun. Again we are in active discussions with multiple plans and do hope to be able to participate in the program. We are not enrolling to-date, at this point.","Craig Samitt","And therefore the plans do have lives that they are accountable for, that they don't have organized networks for and people just keep on going to their existing provider, with whatever management the plan itself can overlay. But for them, its just highly imperfect, but pretty normal way to get something like this started.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","So there is no revenue, no operating loss -- income or loss expectations associated with this in the guidance or there is a little probability weighted something in there?","Craig Samitt","Right now, the premise is that, there is nothing big that's going to go on good or bad with Duals, and if we cut a deal that we think is material, we will get back to you the moment it happens.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","Got you. On the other and corporate drag on the growth Kidney Care operating income, which typically runs $22 million, $26 million a quarter was actually zero this quarter and the gross Kidney Care operating income was down. Was there a reclass or was there some unusual benefit this quarter?","Kent Thiry","Would you just repeat the question please Gary, and then either Jim Hilger or Jim Gustafson can hopefully nail it for you.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","I am just looking, year-over-year, dialysis operating income a year ago, $408 million. You had $22 million of losses in other and corporate to take you through a net $386 million operating income. This quarter, the gross was $387 million, you had zero net other and corporate, to get a net $387 million. So its up $1 million year-over-year, but obviously the loss is from international ancillary and corporate were much lower than they typically are. So I didn't know if there was a reclass between those, or some unusual benefit in the other and corporate lines this quarter?","Kent Thiry","Jim [ph], can someone give a good answer?","James Hilger","The improvement is in DaVita RX and in international. Year-on-year the accounts are almost solved.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","And is that recurring?","Kent Thiry","Why don't, Gary, you give us a minute, because it just sends too much tentativeness in the answers. So give us a couple of minutes and we will get back to you.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","Okay. So unrelated though, I mean, Kent, you characterized dialysis performance as strong. So the gross dialysis operating income was from $408 million a year ago, down to $387 million. How does that translate to strong --","Kent Thiry","Very fair, and by that standard it wasn't strong, relative to our guidance and our fears about what 2014 might look like. We actually feel -- on our side, we are feeling very-very good. But compared to the standard that you just set forth reasonably, you're right, you could then say it was just -- you could say whatever you want.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","Okay. Last question, and maybe I will reveal my ignorance here. You said treatment days, down three days year-over-year, and I calculate weekdays the same and Saturdays the same. So was that weather related or am I just not understanding how you calculate treatment days?","James Gustafson","This is Jim Gustafson. That's sequential Gary from Q4 to Q1, not year-over-year.","Gary Taylor - Citigroup","Okay. That makes sense. Okay, that's all I had.","Kent Thiry","All right. Thank you. I will point out one, I think it was mentioned earlier in the call, but we did have a significant increase in some of our costs, including EPO, which is part of why you see the OI number on the dialysis side, that Gary you were talking about. Okay, operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James.","John Ransom - Raymond James","Hi. I just want to demonstrate my grasp of the obvious. The deal in Pennsylvania, just to think about expectations for that division. You're probably going to have to do five to 10 of those deals and its probably going to take a couple of years, before we start seeing some material EBITDA from that strategy, is that a fair way to think about it and is that a reasonable pipeline?","Kent Thiry","Yes sir.","John Ransom - Raymond James","Yes on both?","Kent Thiry","Say again please?","John Ransom - Raymond James","Yes to both questions? So you need 5% to 10% or its going to take a couple of years?","Kent Thiry","Maybe better say both questions again, so I am not being -- I am not too cryptic.","John Ransom - Raymond James","No I am saying, it looks like it would take a couple of years by your own reckoning, and then may be you have to do, five to seven deals like this and a couple of years before you start to see some material EBITDA to the enterprise, is that a fair way to think about it, and is this the new template going forward?","Kent Thiry","Well, if we are successful, the Philadelphia joint venture could be of pretty serious size, just like healthcare partners in California and Florida and Nevada. And so, the numbers could be substantial, therefore, you don't have to do lots and lots of them, if you succeed and they grow at a nice steady pace.","Having said that, we do want to do more than one. We do not think this will be the last time we use a model like this and in many other instances however, we will still be a majority owner. In this particular case, the payor had such a strong market position, and because of some other aspects of the agreement as well, 50-50 just seemed like the right thing to do.","John Ransom - Raymond James","Now the other question, you have a fairly small percentage of their MA lives in total. What's the trigger to get more than what you have? Or is it -- are you in the short term, or you just kind of limit these 300 primary care doctors, or is there a trigger to expand this beyond, what I'd call kind of a [indiscernible] to a broader relationship with their other MA lives?","Craig Samitt","John I am sorry, I missed the beginning of the question. Can you repeat that again?","John Ransom - Raymond James","Sure. I am sorry. You have a fairly small percentage of their MA lives. I am talking about the Blue Cross plan. What's the trigger to get a bigger percentage? Are you limited in the short term, that is the 300 docs?","Craig Samitt","We are beginning to venture with the 300 physicians. But the hope and expectation is that, we would expand the contracted network with Tandigm beyond the 300 physicians through this year and into next year as well. So our expectation is that, our membership of both MA and commercial will grow in this venture.","John Ransom - Raymond James","But its not -- you have to wait a year or you can grow it during the year, and next year there is something like -- we are going to try this for a year and see how it goes, and then we will extend it. So you can grow this as it happens?","Kent Thiry","There is no specific trigger, before we can expand this network.","John Ransom - Raymond James","Okay. Thank you.","Craig Samitt","But I will add you don't want to take too many lives, if they are being cared for by physicians who are not committed or positively interested in the new model. Okay, operator. Thank you.","John Ransom - Raymond James","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Lisa Clive with Sanford Bernstein.","Lisa Clive - Sanford Bernstein","Hi. Just one question, going back to integrated care on the dialysis side. Your Village Health business has been going along for several years, and obviously with ESCO not quite exactly the way you want it. What should we think about for the outlook of integrated care on your non-Medicare fee-for-service patients?","Kent Thiry","The question is, what kind of growth can we expect on the Village Health side? Is there a reasonable care price?","Lisa Clive - Sanford Bernstein","Yeah. And maybe not specific growth, but sort of what are your long term plans there? Is there a way to move into integrated care, without the ESCO program, or is there -- how are you thinking about that clearly? DaVita RX is a big platform for you, but what else should we think about as opportunities there?","Kent Thiry","Village Health, we can grow it outside of the ESCO program. Not as cleanly and as aggressively as we could, if there was an attractive ESCO program. But yes, we can continue to nudge it along and push it along. In addition, one of Village Health's great benefits, is it adds value to our fee-for-service clients, who then can take that value into account, when we are negotiating dialysis rates. So just because we are not capitated or at risk with them, doesn't mean that they cannot appreciate the impact on quality in total costs, and how that reflected and monetized in part through conventional fee for service rates. But to the first part of your question, where we will continue to strive to grow Village Health everywhere, we can. It just won't be rapid without a government program that works.","Lisa Clive - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, great. And then maybe actually just one last question on the ESCO program itself. Under the current ESCO 2.0, it seems like the size is still pretty limited. Assuming you can get over your or you can reach an agreement with CMS on the few outstanding issues that you have, how many patients would you ideally like to enroll in this product program?","Kent Thiry","Oh, if we like the program, we like to take the whole program to ourselves. I think they are putting a cap of 15,000 or 20,000 and of course, they would never allocate more than X percent to us, and we would take that in a second and double it if we could, if we just get a couple of changes.","Lisa Clive - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Thanks very much.","Kent Thiry","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have one question that just queued up, Whit Mayo with Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird","Thanks for squeezing me in. You guys gave the OI for the legacy HCP markets, but can you also share the revenue and how margins would have compared versus the prior year?","Kent Thiry","We can't do it spontaneously, and we will think about doing it for the next call, let us sort that out. We want to make sure there is reasonable boundaries on how much market specific stuff we talk about; because in general, its not in your best interest for us to go to deep market-by-market. We violated our normal policy, because we felt we had to do it in order to be responsible in discussing our current performance to you. But I am not at all sure we are going to want to go, where you're going.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird","No I can appreciate that. But I guess may be directionally, can you confirm that margins were higher this year versus the prior year? Anything to kind of point us in the right direction without divulging too much specific data?","Kent Thiry","I think not, and let us just reflect after the call, and if I am making the wrong game time [ph] decision, Jim and Garry will correct it.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird","No, that's fair. Thanks a lot.","Kent Thiry","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, we show no further questions.","Kent Thiry","All right. Thank you all very much. We will -- wait a minute, we have some breaking information.","James Gustafson","Just wanted to respond to Gary's question. Gary the answer to your question is, we had better overall results in our ancillary businesses, which includes international. And the management -- the corporate charges were down, because we are allocating corporate costs among our various operated segments. And that is a change on the corporate charges.","Kent Thiry","Okay. So hopefully Gary, that took care of that one, and our early answer we apologize was misleading. So I am glad we are able to correct it quickly, and thank you all very much for your interest in us. We will do our best to do what we said we were going to do going forward. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's call. You may disconnect at this time."],"7289":["DaVita, Inc.

My name is Iris and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to DaVita's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference.","Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Iris, and welcome everyone to our third quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me in the room today are: Joel Ackerman, our CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; and Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer. And also joining us via teleconference are Kent Thiry, our CEO; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in our third quarter release of earlier today and our SEC filings. Please refer to our third quarter earnings release of earlier today or in SEC filings including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all of you for your interest in DaVita.","I've got four headlines before we let JR and Joel take over.","Headline number one of course is the Prop 8 victory, but I'm going to let Javier talk about that primarily, certainly excellent news for all of our stakeholders. Number two, regarding the sale of DMG, we continue to work together with Optum to close the transaction in 2018. However, as most of you will recall, we did execute an amendment earlier this year to extend the termination date in case we do not meet that timeline in light of the ongoing regulatory approval process. Number three of four, the quarter did have some unusual expenses, which Joel and JR will go through in some depth. So they do not get in the way of your ability to evaluate the ongoing strength of the business. And finally, fourth headline is, as you net it all out, it's a solid operating quarter in what has been so far a solid operating year.","And then, finally before we go into all the different detail and synthesis, we are first and foremost a clinical caregiving company. That is what comes first and so consistent with our tradition, we'll always talk about a clinical accomplishment at the top of the call.","We're going to broaden that slightly going forward to include either a clinical accomplishment or an improved patient experience. And what I'm going to talk about right now is more in the latter category because so far this year-to-date, we've added on a net basis 1,300 more PD patients, peritoneal dialysis that is, people that can take care of the dialysis without coming into our centers.","Now this does not always lead to improved clinical outcomes, in many cases those clinical outcomes will stay the same, but for many of these patients, it's a tremendous improvement in their quality of life, because of the scheduling and physical mobility that they pick up and so that's our patient experience story of the day.","Javier, please take it over.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. Let me jump right in. I will discuss four topics today, Prop 8, calcimimetics, team and an update on guidance for 2018.","First on Prop 8. Let me start with the obvious. We are pleased that Prop 8 was defeated. This was the right outcome for our patients, California and the entire system. We thank not only the California voters but also the entire coalition of over 160 members that worked hard to defeat this union-backed ballot initiative. The broad coalition included the California Medical Association, the California Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association of California, the American College of Emergency Room Physicians and California Chamber of Commerce to mention a few.","In pursuing Proposition 8, we believe that the SEIU-UHW abuse of ballot initiative process and displays disregard for patients by putting the union's organizing objectives above access to life-sustaining care. Unfortunately, we do not anticipate them stopping their efforts. We expect this to cause us to spend considerable resource opposing these types of initiatives over the next years. While it's difficult to forecast we're assuming an increase in our baseline spend of $30 million per year on general advocacies plus whatever incremental spend is necessary to counter the specific initiative.","Now on to calcimimetics. In the third quarter, both revenue per treatment and cost per treatment declined slightly, so is essentially neutral to operating income. We continue to expect the net impact of calcimimetics to be a mid-single-digit margin before our indirect cost to administer the drug. This excludes any short-lived benefit that may come should generics enter the market.","Third, I want to pause and take an opportunity to recognize the professionalism and the dedication of our team, whether it's the California campaigns or the recent hurricanes, our caregivers have stayed committed to delivering life-sustaining therapy. We're proud of and inspired by them.","Lastly, let me provide guidance for 2018. For our annual adjusted operating income guidance, we're narrowing the range to $1.5 billion to $1.25 billion. This guidance is at the low end of the range we specified last quarter. There are two reasons for this. First is, we spent $20 million more for advocacy, but we feel great about the results. Second is $23 million for a change in our executive, retirement policy which Joel will discuss.","We also would like to \u2013 the context of the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year, that guidance was $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion excluding advocacy, because that was such an unprecedented variable and quite distinct from ongoing operation. So if you want to put the updated guidance into context, you would add $95 million to the updated range yielding a $1.595 billion to $1.62 billion. In other words, we will be at the high end or above the original guidance we provided last year. So no matter how you cut it, it was operationally solid quarter and a solid year-to-date.","Now, I'll hand it over to Joel for financial details on our results.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Javier. Adjusted operating income from continuing operations for the third quarter was $314 million. Let me walk you through the components; first growth, our treatment per day growth of 4% and normalized non-acquired growth of 3.3% continued to be at the low end of our long-term guidance range.","On revenue\u00b8 RPT was down $3.75 compared to Q2. Approximately half of the decline is due to the non-recurring Medicare bad debt recoveries from prior periods in the second quarter of 2018. Approximately, 20% was due to a decrease in calcimimetics revenue, which as a reminder had a similar decrease in cost. The remainder is due to other normal puts and takes with revenue.","G&A cost increased significantly in the quarter due to two items. First, $45 million in advocacy spend, a $32 million quarter-over-quarter increase. This is in the dialysis and lab segment Q&A (8:45). Second, approximately $23 million non-cash charge for modifying and accelerating existing equity awards due to the adoption of a retirement policy on the treatment of equity awards held by executive officers. This is in the corporate G&A segment.","For international, our adjusted operating loss in the quarter was $4 million. We continue to expect to achieve break-even adjusted operating income in Q4 2018, excluding any foreign exchange gains or losses.","Now our cash flow, which has remained strong and enduring. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $362 million for the quarter and nearly $1.2 billion year-to-date. We continue to expect operating cash flow from continuing operations for the year to be $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. We also expect CapEx for continuing operations for the year to be consistent with the approximately $925 million we mentioned previously.","On to share repurchases. Through September 30, 2018, year-to-date we repurchased approximately 16.8 million shares for approximately $1.15 billion, representing more than 9% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. This includes approximately $71 million of stock repurchase since our last earnings call. We made no repurchases after the end of the quarter.","For the third quarter, our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations was 41.4%. For the full year, we now expect our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations to be between 30.5% and 31.5%. This is as a result of the increased advocacy spend and the adoption of the executive retirement policy.","Now I'll turn it over to Kent for closing remarks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay. I'd just like to make a few statements before we move to Q&A. Number one, as we try to avoid redundancy in these calls, but at this stage, I can't resist being a little bit redundant to JR. With respect to the SEIU-UHW, it is one thing to try to organize a union and there's very well-developed and heavily supervised processes for that. It's quite another to demonstrate a stunning disregard for patient care by trying to put an entire industry unsustainably under water. It's really strikingly irresponsible for the patients and also ironically for the teammates that they purport to care about. So we will do our best to represent our teammates and patients well going forward as we did this year.","Number two, we continue to be very well-positioned for the general movement towards integrated kidney care and in particular for implementing the PATIENTS Act if we're able to get it through the legislature. You might well ask, with the Democrats taking over the House, how does that affect us? The good news here is that for 15 years DaVita has never strayed too far from the middle, one always spends somewhat more time with the majority party. But we have never skewed that very far because we know these things change over time and in the Senate even despite whoever is in the majority, you really need both sides to get something like this done. And so we've all the way along invested in both the Republican and the Democratic sides of the House and have a strong position there. And in fact Democratic constituencies represent a highly disproportionate percentage of the patients who would massively benefit from the PATIENTS Act. And so in some ways it's an even better philosophical and constituent fit.","The third of the four comments I'd like to make before Q&A is just to once again point to the resiliency of our cash flow and our respect and caring for that, we take it quite seriously. Fourth and finally, we will continue to work very hard to get the DMG deal closed and put those proceeds to work for you.","Operator, could we please move to questions?","Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.","Iris?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Jim, do you have a way of getting that...?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","I'm sorry. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We have our first question coming from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Let's start off with the third quarter and kind of the results, obviously, a lot of moving parts here. So if I wanted to simplify it a little bit, the guidance is down about $37 million at the midpoint, you had what sounds like two costs that weren't contemplated that total $43 million, so ex those costs, it sounds like you took the guidance up at the midpoint. Is that the right math to think about, number one, and if that's the case, is it fair to say that the underlying run rate of the core business is running ahead of the previous plan for third quarter and in the fourth quarter?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","So Justin, Joel here. Your math is right in terms of where we're running pretty much consistent with what we had expected, bounces around a little bit but no real changes there.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then as we think about the underlying run rate of OI coming out of 2018, again with all these moving parts, how should we think about the right jump off point for 2018 OI going into 2019, once we remove kind of the charges that aren't going to continue into next year?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. So, I guess, I would start with kind of the 2018 guidance we've given you and then you'd really want to normalize for a bunch of things. So there is advocacy, which we've talked about, this retirement policy change, there's the Medicare bad debt which showed up in the first half of the year; and then two other things I'd call out; one is DaVita Rx which we've called out as a headwind in the back half of the year of $20 million to $35 million and the third was a one-time good guide from DHS of $17 million at the beginning of the year which we also called out.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So if I do that math, I still think I'm coming out to about $1.6 billion in run rate OI. Do you agree with that?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","The short answer is yes.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So as we think ...","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","We're limited on what we can kind of say from an FD standpoint \u2013 not from an FD, from an accounting standpoint about adjusted OI. But yes, I agree with your math.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, given I brought up OI for 2019, maybe is there anything you could tell us about how we should think about that $1.6 billion going forward into next year, how we should think about growth relative to maybe the normal growth rate you talk about in the business?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","We're not in a position to give guidance on 2019 right now. We're not going to go there.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Maybe puts and takes, headwinds, tailwinds you want us to think about versus that $1.6 billion.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Not really.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","And Justin, while I've got you on the guidance question, I was given a piece of paper that said that I did not say the right guidance range, you probably picked up on it. The guidance range should be $1.5 billion to $1.525 billion. So my apologies for that.","Operator","We have our next question coming from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. I wanted to follow up on that guidance, that's probably the right way to think about it looking at the midpoint of the two, but it does look like a bigger decline on the top end of that range of $75 million, I don't know if you can kind of say that $45 million of its advocacy and the stock comp, I understand most of that decline, but if the core business is kind of coming inline if not slightly better, then why is the top line coming down even more than kind of those two one-time charges?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Joel, why don't you continue.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Kevin, I'm not sure I understood the question. Could you say that again?","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, so you took the guidance from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion down \u2013 the high end of the range from $1.6 billion down to $1.525 billion, so you took it down by about $75 million. And there's two discrete items you called out, advocacy was $20 million more than you had last quarter and then your stock comp was $23 million more, that's $43 million right there. But in answer to Justin's question earlier, you kind of said the core business was coming inline if not slightly better than you thought, so why is the high end coming down even more than the range, than that $43 million?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, so look we guide to a range for a reason there. There are fluctuations as you would expect and as we look at those, we're comfortable with coming in at this $1.5 billion to $1.525 billion, I don't think there is anything specific that I would point out.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then with the treatment numbers, it has been really bouncing around the bottom end of that long term 3.5 million to 4.5 million (19:30) range, that you guys talk about, is there anything you know driving that, are you seeing any issues around demand or is this just an issue around opening new de novo sites?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","The short answer is ...","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","JR, do you want to...?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Kent. There is obviously a lot of noise in the volume. We are seeing it in the lower end of the range or below the range. And so there's nothing that we can tell from what we have the data had several years of lag. And there's several dynamics going on with upstream diseases like hypertension, diabetes, what's going on with mortality and transplants. So, unfortunately, I don't have anything that could be useful on that. We're seeing the same things that you are.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But you're not \u2013 you're not expecting to \u2013 you still think 3.5 million to 4.5 million (20:28) is the right range, there is no reason to think that it's now 3 million to 4 million (20:31).","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","We're looking at all the variables and we'll get back to you if we need to change that guidance.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then last question just on the DMG sale, I was a little \u2013 I wasn't sure exactly what was \u2013 what am I to infer from the impairment charge on that business? Is there something along the lines of \u2013 sounds like there is no change to the deal itself, do you still expect the same proceeds, I wasn't quite sure if there was something that we should be reading into, I guess, A, the commentary the deal might drop into 2019 and then B, just that you had to do valuation of that business?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. So the valuation adjustment is the result of our need to evaluate fair value every quarter. And based on our update of the various inputs including the transaction itself, risks, timing, the performance of the business et cetera, we booked this valuation reserve. As far as timing is concerned, look this is a complicated regulatory process but we continue to work hard with Optum to close the transaction in 2018.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But nothing's changed about what you think the net proceeds will be?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","In terms of changes to the deal, the only changes that have been made have been the termination date.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right. Great. Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay, operator...","Operator","Sorry. Our next question comes from Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. So I just wanted to dig into RPTs for a minute, a couple of specific questions. It didn't sound like you sized calcimimetics on RPTs this quarter, but that it did step down from 2Q where I think it was about $19. Can you share the number for 3Q?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","JR, you want to grab that?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","The decline for the quarter is $0.81. That's the RPT impact from calcimimetics.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Sequentially, so about $0.18 in the quarter.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Roughly, yeah.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just commercial mix and rate, any update there. Did that have any impact on RPTs or is there anything changing inside of that bucket?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Go ahead, JR.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. On RPT, a couple of things. Let me start off by saying we're not seeing anything unusual in our negotiations. Number two, we have seen a slight decline in commercial mix and a small shift toward lower paying plans, and so \u2013 but one would ask the question what can one take into the future, what are the trends, and unfortunately on that one, there is no clear trend, so there's nothing that you can take forward at this juncture.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And any color on kind of the shift in the lower paying plans, is that exchanges or I don't know, how best to think about that as \u2013 any additional context there?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","We don't have any insight into it but yes they're shifting towards exchanges and lower paying plans.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. And just lastly kind of related to this line, but maybe a little bit bigger picture, we've been expecting about $7 million of loss revenue kind of recapture from the 3Q 2017 hurricanes and obviously had some exposure. It looks like you probably had some exposure to Florence and maybe a little bit to Michael as well. So any context on whether that $7 million materialized or what the impact of the hurricanes this year may have been on either volumes or expenses or both and how that's affecting the guidance?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. The impact on OI is not significant, I think the net impact on NAG is maybe 10 basis points which is an uptick from Q3 2017, offset by some hurricane impact in this quarter, but nothing significant.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Understood. And maybe just the last one before I jump back, Prop. 8 kind of at this point, it's behind you. Sounds like you're looking at $95 million of advocacy costs for the year and color today suggests there's about $25 million in 2Q, $45 million obviously in 3Q is stated, so is it safe to assume you know you're looking at something around $25 million in Q4?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, it's in the right range.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We have our next question coming from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi Good morning. Good morning. Gosh. Good evening actually. Just a few quick ones. Just on the charge related to DMG and part of it was tax related, the $118 million. Will that impact your net cash proceeds from the transaction or this is all just the accounting?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","It won't have an impact on the proceeds.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And I want to make sure given all the adjustments I'm correct, it looks like you know if we \u2013 I think it's $1.143 billion of adjusted OI through nine months which would be comparable to your new guidance. So it implies 4Q of $357 million to $382 million do I have that correct?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","I'm sorry, Gary. You're running a little quick there.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. I was taking your new guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.525 billion on OI and I believe the nine-month adjusted OI number in the press release was $1.143 billion. If I had that correct and comparable. So I think it implies $357 million to $382 million of OI for 4Q?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. That's right.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Which looks like \u2013 it looks like it implies a larger year-over-year decline. The advocacy costs are easing sequentially, but maybe the pharma losses are increasing sequentially is there an obvious answer as to why 4Q would be down more than 3Q?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","I don't \u2013 I'm just stumbling on the math a little here, Gary, and I apologize for that. My recollection was after you adjusted Q3 and Q4, OI are about flat.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Maybe I'm not doing it right. My last question...","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Gary, we're going to do a little math here, while it keeps going and I'll just clarify that for you.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I may have been incorrect. My last question will be for Kent. Given you've talked about the necessity of advocacy ongoing, I guess particularly I'm thinking about the charitable premium assistance issue where it's not just the SEIU that's been involved, but the insurance lobby to some degree believes they have some skin in the game. Is there \u2013 do you think there's a need to sort of readdress this issue with the insurance industry in any way or do you think the right approach is just to advocate in the state legislatures?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, very fair question. First, with respect to the CPA legislation that the SEIU was involved with, there was only one plan that worked with them. Now that's not to say that there aren't a lot of other plans that don't like charitable premium assistance period for dialysis or anything else. But since our patients are so much more identifiable and so much more expensive, it's an easy poster child. So, while it is true that the insurance industry as a group doesn't like it, with respect to that one piece or sort of predatory legislation, there was only one plan that really worked on that pretty much at all which was actually rather interesting.","Now moving on to the question beyond establishing the context, I think, it's a fair idea to take another run at trying to sort things out. Historically each time we have and said let's try to work out our own compromise and our own code of conduct that both providers and payers will agree to. We just haven't gotten much take-up, and so I think it's a fair idea. But the most likely outcome is that everybody is going to wait for the regulators decide. And as you know, it's been quite a long period of time now and there's a reason for that, it's pretty complicated and you could hurt a lot of patients pretty quickly. And so folks are appropriately hesitant as they try to sort out the truth. So we're still in that state where they could make a decision of some sort in the next month. They might not make a decision for the next year. And we'll take under consideration this notion of once again trying to see if there can be an industry compromise.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Hey, Gary, let me just clarify on your question before on Q4 over Q3. So if you take Q3 add back the advocacy and the retirement in the quarter, you'd come up with an adjusted number. And then if you'd compare that to Q4 and add back advocacy in Q4 as well you'd show Q4 being about $30 million ahead of Q3.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. And is \u2013 I guess, I was \u2013 okay, I'll rework that. Appreciate it.","Operator","We have our next question coming from John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Just a couple from me. If we look at 2019, and in your commercial contracts, what percent of your commercial revenue is currently contracted?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","We haven't...","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","JR?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, thanks Kent. We haven't disclosed the number, but it is the great majority.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I would like to point out that I'm also JR, just for the record...","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Well, then you answer the question.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Well, when I say great majority in cell C3 (32:09) it doesn't spell out anything, but that's fine. The second question is, I know I've been a pest about this, but capital efficiency, how should we think about, is run rate CapEx still in that $700 million to $800 million range and if we've done any more work to try to break the link between the spending and growth? It just seems like I know I'm having an opinion, it seems like an awfully high number of high level spending and I wonder if there's any more efforts to become a bit more capital efficient down the road?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. So no changes to what we've said in the past about capital which is $925 million for the quarter coming down next year. And we anticipate that continuing to happen and looking forward, we are looking for ways both short-term, as well as long-term ways to make the business more capital efficient. That said nothing specific.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Oh! I'm sorry, $925 million for the year, I'm told I've said for the quarter, I apologize. But yeah, we are looking for ways to make the business more capital efficient over the long term, but no specifics to update you on with that.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just some \u2013 I might be the only guy I didn't know this, but to think about next year how much will we pull out in total for the year for pharmacy in terms of avoided losses with your new structure?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. So JR or Joel?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. So, what we've said is in the second half of this year, we would lose $20 million to $35 million for pharmacy. We still are looking at that range, so you'd have to back that out as a tailwind for next year.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got you. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Clive from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Great. Thanks. First, just wanted to drill down on your comment on the slight decline in commercial mix in the quarter, your large competitor mentioned that there was a big July enrollment that \u2013 or a bigger July enrollment period than historically and it sounds like they didn't do a particularly good job attracting new private patients and thus lost some share. Could you maybe just comment on normal quarterly fluctuations that you see with private patient mix and whether your trends seems sort of out of whack with those fluctuations and a related question, have you seen more competition from ARA, now that they have a national contract in place with United Health. You obviously don't run into them in that many markets, but I'm just curious about the dynamics where you may have clinics near theirs?","And then final question, just on home dialysis. Could you remind us what proportion of your patients are on PD today and what proportion are on HHD. FMC appears to be making quite a big push into HHD. They've increased their HHD patients from 2% to 4% in the past few quarters, and I'm just wondering how much of a priority it is for you at this point to build out a bigger HHD platform?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay. Well, thank you for the questions and let me try and take them one at a time. I'll take them in reverse order since that's the way I remember them. On home, we have 11% of our patients on PD and about 2.5% on HHD, so about 13.5% over both modalities.","On the second question on ARA, have we seen any change in the competitive landscape, the answer is no to that. And on the third one is there anything in particular that we should call out on the commercial trend? We don't see anything that's worth calling out.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We have our next question coming from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks for taking my question, again. So just to follow back up on the commercial mix here. Given it seems I think it's been pretty stable for the last four, six, eight quarters talking about a decline here. Can you give us any more color in terms of the magnitude, what you saw in the quarter, did it get worse through the quarter, any of that?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Justin, on that we're trying to be helpful and obviously know that these words are not comforting. It's slight decline and again our negotiations look the same. Seasonally adjusted Q3 always has a little change because Medicare enrollment opens up and so that's going on. But other than that we had that small shift that I already outlined to lower paying plans. There's really nothing else to call out.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. The run rate, tax rate we should think about going forward as we go into 2019, what is the right number to be putting in our models here?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. So obviously we're not going to give specific guidance here, but I think you can kind of step back to our guidance at the beginning of the year. Think about the increased advocacy spend, which will not all be not tax deductible, but most of it will not be tax deductible and that should help you get to a reasonable estimate.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Could you tell me if the tax rate is higher than what you expected in the year of core, has it gone up or \u2013 and if so why?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","It's at the high end of the range. You know, the tax code was pretty new when we put out that range. A lot of things got clarified over the course of the year and that's really what drove where we wound up in the range.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So core ex the advocacy stuff we should think about the high end of the range is a reasonable kind of starting point?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yes.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, the buy down you bought a bunch of stock in July and then it looks like the buy down slowed down meaningfully versus the first seven months of the year in August and September and that you didn't buy anything in October. So just anything we should think about in terms of the pacing of share repo given that's pretty different than what you did the first seven months?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Our leverage wound up at 4.29, which is way above the range we've historically talked about. We've always been comfortable going above or below the range for various reasons, but we are further above than typically feels comfortable. And I think we've tried to communicate that was kind of a pre-buy in anticipation of the DMG deal getting done, and we're \u2013 I think it's safe to say we're slowing down as we get to that higher end of our comfort around leverage.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So maybe it's fair to say that you kind of take a pause and wait until the DMG deal closes before there is meaningful share repurchase going on here, is that the right read?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Look, there are always things that could impact that, but I think you're in the right general ballpark.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just circling back to the DMG deal, is there anything in particular that you would point to that's lengthening this or complicating it versus a typical deal. I mean, I think we're five-plus months post the second request.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, as we said, look, the regulatory process is ongoing, it's extensive, it's live and unfortunately, we just can't discuss the details of the process.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So, maybe I'll ask a different question on this. Just \u2013 go ahead. Sorry.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Justin, I'd just add, it has proven to be a more difficult process than we contemplated and perhaps that's obvious given the length of time it's taken. But just to eliminate any ambiguity that has been the case.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","And can you tell us whether the difficulty in the process is coming from the DOJ or is it coming from maybe Optum is not wanting to divest what a lot of people would have expected they would need to divest to close the deal. Is there a resistance of divestitures or?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","We're not comfortable I think sharing any of the details. So, sorry about that, but it's hard to see that thing constructive to the process, and I think everybody's working hard. Everybody, the government, Optum, we are all working hard. And it's just taking every bit of that work and more.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Let me come at it one other way and I'll jump back in the queue. If we get to a point where the DOJ says, this is what you need to close the deal, and let's just say that's a package of divestitures, and United doesn't think that that's reasonable. Is there a possibility here, this goes to \u2013 the FTC sues and we go to court. And if that's the case, what happens if Optum loses, does the deal just break and we go back and run an auction?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Justin, look, we are working hard to get this deal closed in 2018. It is a complex process. And with that, I just don't think we want to speculate about the hypotheticals. We're trying to get this done in 2018.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Thanks guys.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Justin.","Operator","We have our next question coming from ...","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Operator?","Operator","I'm sorry \u2013 from John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Just one more from me. And I think this is for Kent. I mean, just kind of stepping back from the picky and (43:27) sort of near term stuff, the company appears to be a little bit at odds with the unions and also with the payers. Strategically, what do we think about over time to kind of bring you back in line where everybody around you kind of feels good about the value proposition because it just seems like you guys are fighting, fighting, fighting and is there something that you could think about doing differently to make everybody think that we're all on the same page? I know this is a squishy question, but you guys seem to be a little bit more at odds than some of the other companies that I'm familiar with?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, I think it's a very fair question. And let me take a good shot at and feel free to continue probing that, with the payers, I think the visibility of charitable premium assistance, which is not that big a chunk of our profit, the visibility has overshadowed the fact that we're doing lots of great highly aligned work with a lot of payers, including some who have very strong feelings on charitable premium assistance from a policy point of view, but it's not preventing we and they from making big strides on implementing aligned value based care propositions.","And so, I think there the visible activity is pretty inconsistent with a lot of the invisible activity in ways that would make you feel much better. And then I would also point out that in Congress, we've probably never been as well-situated and aligned and in a positive spot. And with CMS, I'd say we're in pretty much as good a spot as we've been for much of the last 15 years. And so, the sense which I think I would perhaps have too if I just looked at the newspaper headlines that a bunch of things have trended negative is misleading once you are more on the inside.","With respect to the unions, which is the one group where I can't point to any sort of silver lining, it's pretty difficult to have a constructive relationship with a group that starts out day one, doing the things that they have done, it's pretty difficult. And we talked to an awful lot of people who have had dealings with them and emerged quite negative on a whole bunch of levels and for reasons that were consistent with what we experienced, and so that one unfortunately got kicked off in a very zero sum way by them. So, I think it's a very reasonable concern. I think the non-visible data would make you feel a lot better. And with respect to CPA, I would repeat that the person who spoke earlier, I think they were right that it's us taking another run at some sort of reasonable compromise is a good idea.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. I mean, I guess from my perspective, it's surprising that 2018, 2019, we're not further along with you guys having executed some \u2013 let's take care of your 10,000 dialysis patients in these four states for x dollars a patient, we will be on the hook for the quality and the outcomes, you pay us one number. Why has that proven such a \u2013 and I know you're at the mercy of the payers, but why isn't there been more vertical traction with some of these risk-sharing things? It's just not clear to me also looking in why we're still kind of in a fee-for-service world and we're fighting over 2%, 3% or 4% revenue per treatment increases and not any further than we were \u2013 it doesn't look to me any further than we were 10 years ago.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, I'll go first and then JR may want to add. Number one, we are getting new deals done that have more aligned economics every year. We don't announce each of them because none of them in isolation are significant enough to warrant it. And so the progress has been steady and the quality and quantity of conversations has grown. Why has it moved so slowly, however, is largely because it's \u2013 for a lot of payers, they don't have \u2013 while they have a lot of patients nationally, they're spread all over the country and a lot of plans have grown by acquisition and other ways.","And so, their ability to be a good dancing partner to isolate and discretely track all of those patients has been limited. Now that's changing a lot right now. But historically, a lot of them administratively simply couldn't really get there without having to allocate an amount of administrative resources that they were legitimately uncomfortable with. So, that's really the primary reason it's moved so slowly.","On the government side you saw that they really wanted to try to get ESCOs to work because they believed in it. And while they were testing ESCOs, they just didn't have much of an appetite for other stuff. Now we're three, four years into that, what's happened is exactly what we said would happen is that the program has not scaled and has plateaued, but we lost four years when the PATIENTS Act was sort of put aside by them for a while because they hoped their idea would work. And so that's just the way it goes sometimes with the government that you get a binary fork in the road and this one cost us a few years. JR, do you want to join in?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Sure. I'll just add one point, John, and that is that we agree with you and that our DNA is very partner-oriented that we want to be leaning in to take as much responsibility of the patient as possible. We believe that our clinics are the natural place to be because we have essential care for 12 hours with a diverse set of caregivers.","That said, back to Kent's dancing partner, the payers have a unique dynamic in dialysis in that they really only have about 1 in 10 patients. And so therefore, they fail to see that we are one of the most, if not the most, efficient caregiving model out there.","So if you look at our revenue per treatment weighted average across all of it at $300 and change for four hours of life-sustaining therapy, it is incredibly, incredibly efficient and a gift to the system. But the constraint is because of MSP limits the timeframe on commercial, that puts all kinds of restraints on doing these bundled deals, and if we had normal mix 70-30 like everyone else, it would allow for a lot more of this. And instead the payer wonders how long they're going to have a dialysis patient, and we get a little of the sort of the noise around the fact that our patients are chronic and therefore expensive. So those are some of the dynamics, but to your point, our DNA is all around partnering and trying to put a solution to this.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Those were great answers. I really appreciate the expansive commentary. Thanks so much.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We have another question coming from Lisa Clive from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Great. Thanks. Just two follow-ups; one on the PATIENTS Act, how many supporters are you losing with the new Congress coming in. I'm just trying to understand how much ground may need to be covered a second time if this doesn't pass by yearend, and instead becomes a 2019 initiative? And then interestingly for your further comments just about the private payers and the fact that they only have the patients for 33 months, what do you think the chances are for an MSP extension, obviously there was a small three month went in the opioid build, but then Congress decided they didn't actually need to fund it so it got pulled out.","But it was interesting that that should have made it back onto the table seemingly without much involvement from the dialysis industry. I'm just curious as to whether that could focus payers on integrated care in a more substantial way?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","LeAnne, you want to take the first one or both?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.","I can do either. I'll take the first one. As it relates to the PATIENTS Act, we are still very well positioned in the house, all four of our sponsors are returning and they are well-positioned with their leadership. So although we have a new Congress you have to build support from the broad base. We think this policy will continue to have the merits it did and it will continue to have the leadership it has. So we feel good about building the same kind of support that we have to go into the next Congress.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","And perhaps LeAnne \u2013 Lisa if you want to call tomorrow or something we can provide the exact number of sponsors that may have lost, but given we're up at about 195 with an almost perfect half D and half R split in that we did retain the leaders, and we do have relationships with some of the senior house folks.","You'll see that the net answer is supported by the numbers that we're still in very good shape. Although the bad news is that there's always just a lot of things going on and a lot of noise in the system when there's a change in power because they've got a pent-up agenda, so that's bad.","On the other hand, the other side of that sword, the other edge of that sword is that they typically are absolutely hyper to get some stuff done, and that's good for us because we are such a bipartisan idea that's sitting on the shelf. So you can kind of argue that one either way.","Then on MSP, the way we look at it, is we were thrilled that we've kept that one in play enough so that it made it into the house version of the opioid bill. Unfortunately the Senate bill didn't need any savings, didn't need any pay fors, and so it lost the tailwind and the impetus that comes from that. So the right way to interpret what happened there is that, it's good news that it still has a place on the shelf and a lot of people know about it, that it's sound policy that actually generates savings. At the same time, we never say that we're optimistic that it's going to happen anytime soon because we know that business and private insurance companies always oppose it. So it's never going to be a lay-up.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Okay. Thanks for that.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Lisa.","Operator","There are no questions in queue at this time.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay.

My name is Debbie, and I will be your conference facilitator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Gustafson you may begin your conference.","Jim Gustafson","Thank you Debbie, and welcome everyone to our third quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Javier Rodriguez, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President; and Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer.","Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties please refer to our third quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2019 as updated by our quarterly report for Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2019.","Our forward-looking statements are based on the information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements. Additionally, we'd like to remind you during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Javier Rodriguez.","Javier Rodriguez","Thank you, Jim and thank you for joining the call today. And as always, I will start with the clinical highlights to remind us that clinical is at the heart of what we do here at DaVita. As we talked about at Capital Markets, over 50% of our patients begin dialysis treatments through the hospital setting, which is bad for the patients and expensive for the system.","We're working hard to lower the number by helping the people better manage their chronic kidney disease through two efforts. First Kidney Smart, which is DaVita's community education program that provides free education on what the kidneys do, diet, medication, and treatment options, including home modalities and transplant.","I'm pleased to report that, we have educated over 180,000 people through Kidney Smart and we're making a difference. Based on our tracking, we know that Kidney Smart education individuals who transitioned to ESRD have better clinical outcomes both during and after the transition.","Additionally, 32% of Kidney Smart-educated individuals begin dialysis on a home modality, which is almost five times better than the general population. Our other key effort to improve chronic kidney care is our new nephrology-led entity the Nephrology Care Alliance, which will enable nephrologists to come together with DaVita to improve the care coordination for patients.","In this model, DaVita will create patient education and predictive analytics while the physicians will contribute clinical expertise to help the patients slow kidney disease progression and start on-home modality. These capabilities are important in both fee-for-service environment and as we continue to grow our value-based care arrangements.","We're off to a good start. Two supporting points, first over 500 nephrologists have joined the alliance; and second, Dr. Leslie Wong from the Cleveland Clinic has agreed to join DaVita to lead the way.","Next a few comments on our Q3 performance and results. Our adjusted operating income results continue to outperform our original estimates at the beginning of the year, and we have raised our 2019 adjusted operating income guidance for the second time this year. Calcimimetics has contributed to our OI performance, and we have delivered a great outcome.","In addition to resulting in positive financial results, our clinical and operational protocols have both improved health outcomes and driven savings to the health care system. While we expect at least one more quarter of positive economics, we continue to expect operating income from calcimimetics to be near breakeven over the long-term.","Regarding our financial goal of capital efficient growth our discipline on cost and capital continues with our goal of margin stability. We have delivered strong performance on labor productivity all year, while actively managing our capital expenditures spend down. These efforts have generated strong cash flow a lot of which we have deployed toward share buyback.","Now, let me comment on some longer-term issues and developments since our last earnings call. First up California, we're disappointed that Governor Newsom signed AB 290 into law, despite clear evidence of the harm this union-backed legislation will cause for many of our most vulnerable patients in California. Because of the law the American Kidney Fund has made it clear, it will have to cease operation -- operating its patient assistance program in California as of January 2020.","To remind you this will leave nearly 4,000 low-income primarily minority patients without financial support that they rely upon to afford health insurance. We along with other kidney care community filed today a legal challenge to AB 290 in federal court in California because we believe it violates the United States constitution.","Also in California, we recently learned that the SEIU-UHW has introduced another ballot initiative which could be voted on in November 2020 election. You may recall that in 2018 they sponsored Proposition 8 which was rejected by the majority of California voters. The Union has until April to gather enough signatures to put the proposition on the ballot. We will oppose this new ballot initiative which is simply another attempt to inflict harm on providers, physicians and patients and we believe would add significant unnecessary cost to the system and the taxpayers.","Now on to more constructive development, two weeks ago, CMMI released application for 4 voluntary integrated care models for CKD and ESRD. I won't get into the significant detail today, but let me make a few points. These models are nephrologists-centric. The models are complex and we will work to educate the nephrologists to help them evaluate, if these models make sense for their practice.","For us the model appeared quite challenging in their current form and they will require significant investments that are unlikely to move the needle on the economics. In partnership with the community, we will continue to share the feedback with the government on ways to improve the model design and quality outcomes for patients. ","Finally, it's been a busy 6 months and as many of you heard in capital markets we laid our strategies for long-term success including a new set of financial metrics and goals. I'll be the first to acknowledge that we have more work to do to achieve our longer-term objectives. And yet as I interact with our caregivers, I'm even more confident that we're on a path to improve kidney care for our patients.","In closing, we also announced today that Peter Grauer, the Lead Independent Director on our board since 2003 and a member of our Board since 1994 after he took Total Renal Care public, plans to retire from the Board effective at our annual meeting in 2020.","After helping to lead the Board through the Chief Executive transition and the sale of DMG, he believes it is now time to step down. We are forever grateful for his tremendous leadership and role in our organization.","Now on to Joel, who will provide additional details on the quarter?","Joel Ackerman","Thank you, Javier. Let me start by providing our Q3 enterprise results for revenue, adjusted operating margins and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to DaVita. We generated $2.9 billion of revenue in the quarter, an increase of 2% over Q3, 2018.","As a reminder in Q3 2018, DaVita Rx contributed approximately $100 million of revenue. Our adjusted operating income was $462 million resulting in adjusted operating margin of 15.9%, which includes approximately $74 million related to calcimimetics. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to DaVita was $1.53.","Now let me walk you through some of the underlying drivers starting with the components of the U.S. dialysis and lab segment. Non-acquired growth for the third quarter was 2.2% effectively flat compared to NAG in the prior two quarters. While we believe, we are starting to see some progress in the leading indicators of NAG, it's too early to give any guidance on the timing or magnitude of potential improvement.","Revenue per treatment was down sequentially by $0.56, driven by normal quarterly fluctuations in revenue. We continue to expect RPT for the full year to be in line with our guidance of up 0% to 1% compared to 2018. Combined patient care costs and dialysis and lab segment G&A were up approximately $1 per treatment quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by higher compensation and benefits costs offset by lower calcimimetics acquisitions costs.","Focusing on calcimimetics. We generated operating income from calcimimetics of approximately $74 million this quarter, as ASP remained relatively flat over Q2, while acquisition prices fell significantly. Revenue per treatment and cost per treatment for calcimimetics were $14.54 and $4.87 respectively. For full year 2019, we now expect to generate approximately $220 million in profit from calcimimetics.","Now turning to international. For the quarter, adjusted operating income was approximately $1 million including an FX gain of $3 million and excluding an $84 million goodwill impairment to our German operations. For the full year, we continue to expect to generate positive adjusted operating income, excluding goodwill impairments and currency adjustments. Our effective tax rate on adjusted income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations for the quarter was 27.6%. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate attributable to DaVita for the full year to be between 28.5% and 29.5%.","Now on to cash flow. In the third quarter, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $648 million and our newly defined free cash flow was $437 million. DSOs for the U.S. dialysis and lab business declined sequentially by three days to 60 days in Q3 2019 in line with the improvement we forecasted early in 2019 and back to the level it was at this time last year.","CapEx for the quarter was $173 million. We are revising full year CapEx guidance down by $60 million to $740 million to $780 million. Two primary factors are driving the change. First, we managed down our spend on de novo clinics; and second, we delayed spend on some self-development projects that will shift into 2020. We expect to see continued progress on reducing CapEx in 2020. Since Capital Markets Day, we purchased an additional 8.9 million shares at an average price of $58.90 per share. As a result of these purchases, we've reduced our share count by approximately 36.9 million shares or 22% since the close of the DMG transaction.","I'll conclude with some comments on our guidance range. As Javier referenced, we're increasing our adjusted operating income guidance for the year to $1.74 billion to $1.77 billion which includes our expectation of approximately $220 million of operating income from calcimimetics. We're also increasing our operating cash flow guidance from continuing operations for 2019 to $1.525 billion to $1.675 billion. For 2020 we're planning to give full guidance next quarter.","In the interim we are updating the 2020 adjusted EPS guidance we gave at our Capital Markets Day in September. As a reminder, our guidance at Capital Markets Day was $5 to $5.50 per share and excluded any costs associated with ballot initiatives in 2020. At that time, we did not know if there would be any ballot initiatives introduced. Now that we know there is one being proposed, we've decided to incorporate the current estimated cost of opposing the initiative in our adjusted EPS range. Even after adding in this additional cost, we're increasing the range by $0.25 to $5.25 to $5.75 per share. As a reminder, this range incorporates the estimated impact of AB 290.","Operator, let's now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Stephen Tanal","Good afternoon guys. Thanks for the question. I guess just the first thing to follow-up on, I guess the new guidance for calcimimetics profit for the year implies about I guess $68 million or so in Q4 if we've been tracking this right. And I think the reimbursement for the oral drug is flat sequentially from CMS. So I just want to understand why this contribution would step down sequentially. Is cost going up? Or am I missing something else in that?","Joel Ackerman","It's -- there's -- I'd say there's a bit of noise in the system. The reduction -- I wouldn't read anything material into the reduction.","Stephen Tanal","Got it, okay. And I guess like kind of thinking through that a little bit further, so the final rule came out on TDAPA and it looks like calcimimetics will go to ASP plus zero for next year. It would seem like you guys are potentially buying better than the market. So I guess like shouldn't this leave room for a profit just given your scale? Or how should we think about that?","Joel Ackerman","Yeah, so I would say there certainly might be a little bit of profit. There could be a little bit of loss. There's some noise in the system associated with bad debt that we may not get reimbursed for and some other costs. So I don't think you'll see a big number in either side of zero, but I think zero is a reasonable starting point.","Stephen Tanal","Got it, okay. And then last for me I guess on the patient care cost side per treatment was down pretty significantly year-on-year. Wondered if you could flush out some of the bigger drivers there, maybe touch on Epogen costs in that and whether that's still favorable sequentially versus 2Q? Thank you.","Joel Ackerman","Yeah. So year-over-year pharma costs did come down and that is an important driver. Sequentially it's not -- there's very little difference between Q2 and Q3 as it relates to Epo.","Jim Gustafson ","Debbie, do you have another question?","Operator","Yes. The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jim Gustafson","Hey, Kevin.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. Hey. So, just wanted to clarify the 2020 guidance change, it wasn't clear to me exactly why you were raising the EPS number. You're including AB, but your is the rest -- what is the rest? Is it that there will be some calcimimetics benefit next -- into the beginning of next year or share repurchase? What was the...","Joel Ackerman","Yeah. So Kevin, I think the best way to think about the change in 2020 is a better share count number to some extent offset by the ballot initiative costs. As you would imagine there are a bunch of moving pieces in there, and we're not ready to give 2020 guidance yet. Our budget isn't finished. So there are other moving pieces. But if you want to think about the dominant dynamics, it's share count driving it up offset by ballot initiatives driving it down.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And just to think about how we should be modeling calcimimetics into next year, does that kind of break even? Is that for the full year? Or did it kind of trend down towards breakeven as the year goes on there maybe a benefit at the beginning of the year moving down to zero?","Joel Ackerman","It could trend down a bit. It's hard to know. Because of the trajectory of ASP, it's hard to figure out some of the cost issues. But I'd say it's fair to say zero for the full year trending down from a little bit positive at the beginning, potentially a little bit negative towards the end.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And then, as far as the volume numbers that you talked about. I think you said that you're -- it's early. You're starting to see some leading indicators of NAG going positive. What are you -- exactly are you looking for when you talk about leading indicators? And what are you seeing that's giving you some optimism?","Javier Rodriguez","There's a couple of things that we look at Kevin. But in essence, what we're doing is we're monitoring that the right shifts and the right capacity is going online in our centers and that our admissions execution are -- we're monitoring the demand into our centralized missions and that's looking to stabilize right there.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And then maybe last question ifs versus as. It seemed like the big delta in the quarter was calcimimetics and excluding that the quarter was pretty much in line. Is that how you were thinking about it internally? Or how did this quarter come in versus your internal expectations?","Joel Ackerman","Kevin, I think that's a reasonably fair way to look at it. There is a little bit of cost relating to LTIP that is elevated as a result of calcimimetics. So, you can think about that in different ways. You could attribute it to calcimimetics. You could say it's noise in the comp line as we always have noise in the comp line, but I think yours is a reasonably good starting point.","Kevin Fischbeck","That\u2019s great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Joel Ackerman","Hello, Justin.","Justin Lake ","Thanks. Hi. How are you doing? Good evening. So, just wanted to go through a few things here. First, your share repurchase assumptions, so you ended the quarter I think with a little over $1.2 billion. You bought back $250 million, so call it $1 billion, plus cash flow this quarter. I think you typically like to run around $500 million. So should we think about kind of the dry powder that's left $500 million kind of plus whatever free cash flow you generate going forward? Is that a reasonable way to think about it?","Joel Ackerman","So, I start thinking about our share buyback philosophy, thinking about our leverage range and our comments about intrinsic value and all that kind of stuff. If your question is narrow, how much excess cash is on the balance sheet right now net of the buybacks that have happened since September 30, I think your math is pretty spot on.","Justin Lake","Okay. That's helpful. And then, the ballot initiative, appreciate you kind of putting that in the 2020 numbers. Is it reasonable to think of that spend that you've built in there, in a similar ballpark to the incremental spend you had in 2018 to fight off that ballot initiative?","Joel Ackerman","Yes. So, I'll tell you, it's a tough number to predict from where we are right now. That said, I think, that's a reasonable number to start with. As we've kind of played with it, we would say kind of a max of $0.50 a share -- $0.50 of EPS would be the maximum impact that we're looking at right now. But again, it's still pretty early to try and put a definitive range around that.","Justin Lake","Okay. And so then, if we just do some simple math, if the business is doing what you expected it to do and to your point you took up the EPS by $0.25 plus offset, let's call it $0.25 to $0.50 of the ballot initiative costs, you basically assume that the share count -- the share count is ending up, let's call it, 10% to 12% better than what you previously expected, just because you're buying the stock materially cheaper. Is that a reasonable kind of bow to put on this package? ","Joel Ackerman","Is your question, Justin, what are our assumptions today relative to at capital -- to the assumptions we're using at Capital Markets Day? Or are you asking where do we think we'll be relative to today's share count next year?","Justin Lake","No. I guess what I'm asking is more the former, right? At the Capital Markets Day your share assumptions got you to $5 to $5.50. Now effectively, they're getting you, if I exclude the ballot initiative, they're getting you more to like $5.50, $5.75 to $6, $6.25. So it's just, you're taking up the -- I'm just trying to make sure I understand the magnitude of the share repurchase improvement relative to what you thought is that entire movement, which is, again, north of 10% of EPS ex ballot?","Joel Ackerman","Justin, let's come back to this question in a couple of minutes. There are some heads nodding yes and some heads nodding no. So we'll do some quick math here and I'll come back to you in a couple of minutes.","Justin Lake","All right. I'll get back in the queue then. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Pito Chickering","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. If you go over the patient care costs in the quarter, it sounds like calcimimetics moved about $4 sequentially. So excluding that, it's still down $6.20 year-over-year. Epo was part of that. Can you break out how much of that decline came from nursing costs?","Joel Ackerman","So you're -- I'm sorry. You're asking year-over-year on -- ","Pito Chickering","On patient care costs, excluding -- ","Joel Ackerman","On cost per treatment, just from nursing? Pito, I don't have that number. I don't think we've ever disclosed anything anywhere near that level of granularity.","Pito Chickering","So look is it fair to think that if we look at the year-over-year decline in patient care costs, excluding sequentially what are favorable impact from calcimimetics $6.20, is it fair to think that half of that is labor and half of that is areas like drugs like Epo? Or is there any sort of detail you can give us sort of why that would keep on declining so well?","Joel Ackerman","Yeah. So Pito, I'm thinking about year-over-year. So not in the quarter specifically and I think it year-over-year gives you a cleaner number takes out some of the noise. As we think about patient care costs, our expectations are we'll come inside the guidance range, which is remember up 0.5% to 1%.","And if you think about how do we get there, it's comp pressure. So maybe that's what you're asking about and that comp pressure comes largely in the form of wage rate pressure and that's offset by the Epo decline. I mean, there are a bunch of other things going on in there. But at a very high level, I think that's a reasonable way of thinking about it, but year-over-year the cost per treatment is up not down.","Pito Chickering","Okay. Fair enough. The organic treatment growth looks to have stabilized this quarter. Is there a sense you can talk about sort of possible headwinds you face from facilities hitting max capacity in states like California?","Joel Ackerman","So, I mean, we've -- I guess, we've talked about this before in terms of the pressure that can come on admissions growth if you're running labor too efficiently. And you can think about it as max capacity. You can think about it as shifts being full and the pressure to not open a new shift, because of the negative impact that can have on labor productivity.","So that's a dynamic that we're keeping a careful eye on. I wouldn't necessarily attribute it to any specific market, but the dynamic you're calling out is certainly one that we're keeping a careful eye on.","Pito Chickering","Great. And then last question for me. As there's more and more focus on treating patients at home versus in the center, can you sort of break out what percent of your patients are treated at home and if we're seeing nephrologists begin to sort of change their behavior to get more patients now?","Javier Rodriguez","Yeah, Pito, this is Javier. The mix is roughly 12% PD and a little below that 2% on HHD. So we're a little below the 14% if you combine the two modalities. The PD is growing at a nice healthy trend and it's similar to what it was before we had the shortage. And so there is clearly an interest in making sure that the patients go to the right modality, but we've seen this in years in the past. ","Pito Chickering","Great. Thanks so much.","Javier Rodriguez","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from with Whit Mayo with UBS. Your line is now open.","Whit Mayo","Hey, thanks.","Javier Rodriguez","Hey, Whit.","Whit Mayo","Hey, afternoon. So in the final ESRD rule admittedly, I haven't read the whole thing. But was there anything that surprised you with QIP, AKI anything? I know there's this innovative transitional drug add-on change for supplies equipment. Just wasn't sure if that means anything for you?","Javier Rodriguez","LeAnne, do you want to comment on that? ","LeAnne Zumwalt","Sure. First the final rule is very similar almost exactly to the preliminary rule. And so they had teed up that certain medical supplies which will be truly innovative could get some partial incremental reimbursement. So that's positive for sure but it was not a surprise. Does that answer your question? ","Whit Mayo","I think so. Maybe it would be helpful to explain elaborate a little bit more with maybe an example of how the TDAPA work for this new supply and equipment. I guess I don't fully understand how it works. ","LeAnne Zumwalt","Well I don't think they gave complete detail. But what I can tell you is that in the final rule they said the equipment or supply must represent an advancement that has substantially improved renal dialysis services. So that's kind of their orientation. There is going to be a process to which these devices will be asked to introduce after 1\/1\/2020 and it will be the decisions will be made through the FDA marketing authorization. So I'm not sure what exactly you're looking for. I'd be happy to answer specific questions or take it offline with you if you'd like.","Whit Mayo","No that's really helpful LeAnne. My other question I just wanted to kind of talk about California for a second. And let's assume that you and the industry the AKF were unsuccessful getting perhaps an injunction filed and we actually see the AKF pull out of the state altogether. What are the other options for patients at this point? I mean presumably you've thought some about this. I'm just sort of curious come January 1 like what ultimately may happen? ","Javier Rodriguez","Yes it's going to be very interesting to see how it plays out and then of course there are different categories. In some instances the patients will be able to get funding in some other way. And in some instances they're going to lose their coverage. And so we're trying to do math around it and that's why we try to be helpful with the range that we provided and we embedded in our guidance. But the reality is is that we've never been in a situation like this and that's why the range is a bit wide. ","Whit Mayo","Yes. I mean is there another -- when I'm thinking about other ways to obtain premium support the only thing that comes to mind is tax credits premium support and the exchange marketplaces. Is there any other obvious substitution for premium support? ","Javier Rodriguez","Not that we are aware of. Of course we are pursuing all options. Some might qualify for Medicare and other things. So that's why the math is a little tricky and again the range is a bit wide. ","Whit Mayo","Okay. No that's helpful. And maybe two real quick ones. Joel I don't know if you commented on commercial mix. If not can you? And then can we get the actual ending share count on September 30? I don't know if you gave that either. ","Joel DaVita","Yes. Well we didn't comment on commercial mix. There's not a lot to talk about. Q3 tends to be seasonally a little bit weaker because of Medicare open enrollment but nothing significant. ","Whit Mayo","Ending share count? ","Joel DaVita","So the ending share count at the end of Q3 was just under 134 million, 133.9 million. Remember that excludes the shares we bought back since the quarter ended.","Whit Mayo","Great. Helpful. Thanks guys.","Joel DaVita","I'm sorry. Before the next question, Justin I want to get back to you. It's always hard to compare ranges. But roughly speaking, I think you can think of our share count forecast being down about 10% relative to what we talked about at Capital Markets Day.","Operator","And our next question will come from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Javier Rodriguez","Hi, Gary.","Gary Taylor","Hey, good afternoon. Just a few quick ones. For the 2020 ballot initiative, did I miss that? Did you size what you thought that would be?","Joel Ackerman","Yes Gary, we -- I'd say two ways to think about it. One is using what we spent in 2018 as a potential proxy. The second is we were thinking if you want to think about it on an earnings per share basis, we would say $0.50 impact on 2020 would be at a kind of a max.","Gary Taylor","Got you. And will you call that out for us in the quarterlies like you did in 2018 what that spend is in the quarter?","Joel Ackerman","I expect we will. I think we'll -- we're trying to develop a pattern of calling out things that are unusual like calcimimetics and the ballot initiatives. So the answer is, yes. I do want to remind everyone on the call that the spend on the ballot initiatives is not tax deductible. So as you're modeling the impact on EPS keep that in mind.","Gary Taylor","Just another one. When I look at full year from where we started the year in January, your OI guidance is up $130 million to $200 million. Am I right that calcimimetics started the year at the $80 million OI assumption that's now a $220 million? So the low-end of that is covered by the calcimimetics increase?","Joel Ackerman","Yes, so Gary, I don't think we gave a specific calcimimetics number at the beginning of the year. If I were to think about a number for early year calcimimetics, I think your number is a bit high. So if you're trying to say of the OI increase from the beginning of the year, how much of that is the result of calcimimetics. And therefore, what's been the -- what's our thinking about core OI now relative to the beginning of the year, I think it is safe to say that the vast majority of the increase is the result of calcimimetics. Core OI is up a bit, but not a lot.","Gary Taylor","Thank you. Last question. I know last quarter we were surprised by the magnitude of labor productivity you had in the quarter. And I know your thoughts at that time were that was going to reverse to some degree. So as I sit here and sort of adjust for the decline in the calcimimetics costs in the quarter et cetera, I mean, it looks like labor productivity wasn't as good as you experienced in the 2Q, but still looks very attractive on a year-over-year basis. Is that the way you're looking at it? Is there anything else -- any other color on those 2Q productivity gains and how they carried into the third quarter?","Javier Rodriguez","You're directionally \u2013 sorry, Gary, you're directionally correct on the math that you said. A couple things to call out as well is as our volumes decrease, we did a great job of adjusting and I think we explained the interdependencies between sometimes having labor and volume, and the correlation of managing both of those pieces.","So we did go up over 2Q. And we do -- with what we're seeing we expect it to go up even further in Q4, as we're seeing the hiring numbers. And the training costs for the fourth quarter.","Gary Taylor","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Ackerman","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Justin Lake","Thanks for the questions. I have a couple of follow-ups. You mentioned the impact of the benefit from -- or the impact of LTIP this year, should reverse next year. Is there any kind of number you want to throw out for that that we should kind of keep in mind?","Joel Ackerman","Not really. It's relatively small. And I think they're -- it's not something I would call out as a significant headwind or tailwind going from 2019 to 2020.","Justin Lake","Okay. And then, obviously, we're now looking out to 2020 and thinking about 2021. First, just for a second, it's just simple to say that 2020 earnings that you've got out there now are depressed by about $0.50 because of the ballot.","Is there -- there's no offsetting good guide there to think about such that 2021 there would be effectively a $0.50 tailwind as the ballot initiative costs go away, just because there's no ballots that year?","And earnings are automatically $0.50 higher before you kind of think about capital deployment and core growth. Is there any kind of offsets you want to throw out there before we kind of think about that?","Joel Ackerman","No. I think the $0.50 is a pretty clean headwind into next year and tailwind into 2021.","Justin Lake","That's helpful. And then just a couple of follow-ups, I think Pito, asked about home starts. Clearly, I think, yourselves and others are pushing to accelerate home. So, I think, the number you gave there of 12% and 2%, was your current number.","Would it be helpful maybe to share with us the new starts? And how that might have changed over the last couple of years? Or even just the last three to six months as it seems to become a bigger push? Have you seen any kind of meaningful change there?","Javier Rodriguez","The reality Justin is, that we had a bit of a disruption with the shortage of supply. So it's hard to connect. But pre-supply shortage, we were running around the same rates, that we are now, which are in the low double digits, so anywhere between 12% -- sorry 10% and 13% on PD.","The HHD has been more in the flattish range. So the people that fall out are roughly replaced with the newcomers.","Justin Lake","Okay.","Javier Rodriguez","Did that answer your question?","Justin Lake","So the new starts really isn't any different is your point.","Javier Rodriguez","Well, they're different than they were a couple years ago because we had the shortage. And then of course you have to staff up. And you got to tell people that you're ready in. You got to get the market to be confident that you can supply it et cetera.","And so, we are actually quite energized by how quickly the market reacted. And how much interest there is. And again, I think with what we said in Capital Markets, it's also not looking like there's going to be transformational but rather evolutionary change.","Justin Lake","Got it, and then, Javier you guys put in an 8-K yesterday that kind of talked about your new compensation agreement and it looked pretty unique in that it looks like you're pulling forward about five years of stock comp into one. And so I just wanted to know if there's -- I know in the -- there was a strike price number in that I think in the high-67s before you're in the money on those RSUs.","But is there anything else in terms that we should know about in terms of vesting that? Do you have to hit certain hurdle rates? Is that in a proxy I can go dig out, number one? And maybe you could just give us some color on kind of given this is fairly unique from what I've seen in my time, I just love to kind of hear kind of how you thought about this and how the Board thought about it. And I know you ran it by shareholders as well so maybe just spend a minute on that? Thanks.","Joel Ackerman","Hey, Justin, it's Joel. I'll take this. On the narrow question of vesting, it vest 50% at the end of year three and 50% at the end of year four. There is no performance vesting. I think, the concept here is creating a premium price is effectively what's used to ensure that Javier gets significant value when the shareholders get significant value. And that's really what the Board was trying to create here was an alignment of incentives between the new CEO and the long-term shareholders of the company. And I think there was a lot of support as we went out to talk to shareholders.","And I would add this will be put to a vote by the shareholders so all the shareholders would get the opportunity to approve this. So really the guiding principle here was aligning incentives for the new CEO, for the long-term shareholders. And I would -- one other point, I'd highlight is that there is a five-year holding period here. So this isn't about driving the stock price up towards a single or two separate vesting events. Javier has to hold the stock that he gets here for five years. ","Justin Lake","Thanks for all the color there. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Pito Chickering","Hey, thanks. At this point, all the questions had been answered. So thanks so much.","Joel Ackerman","All right. Thanks to you.","Operator","The next question will come from John Ransom with Raymond James. Your line is now open. ","Joel Ackerman","Hi, John.","John Ransom","Hey, guys. Hey, let's pick a point in time a couple years ago where all the payers were mad at you about the exchanges and you had some tough negotiations and let's say, that was the non year. Where are you -- I mean this is a qualitative question, but where are you kind of long-term with some of your key payers? And I know it's always going to be somewhat adversarial just because of the structure of the industry, but what steps are you taking to maybe dial down some of that contention? Thanks.","Javier Rodriguez","Yes, thanks, John. In general I think you've stated we had some issues on understanding what happened with the exchanges in relation to our industry and the economics of the dialysis industry. I've gone on, on a CEO roadshow with several of the largest payers and continue to reach out to many to make sure that; A, they understand the dynamics and the framework that we have and how unique it is. Two, I want to make sure that they're clear that we are very, very into long-term, sort of, value arrangement and that we are open to being creative in a new structure that we are not married to some kind of fee-for-service old structure. That we are confident that we are the best to be the primary care for our patients because of the amount of time they spend with us and all the comorbidities conditions that we can impact and that we can structure something that is both good for the patient, good for the payers, and good for us.","And so that's why we're excited to build the capabilities of integrated care. That message is resonating. But as you know it takes two to dance and it's a complicated systems, arrangements, and math to make sure that you get holistic cost across a commercial population, et cetera to establish benchmarks and trends, so they can do good risk arrangement.","So, we're up and running. I think the conversations will take years. So, you're not going to wake up one day and say, wow, there was a tectonic shift. I might be wrong in that, but it looks like it will be a slower transition, but the payers are reacting quite well to it.","John Ransom","Okay. And yes, it's your fate in life to be between difficult people. So, speaking of difficult people physicians one of the things we hear is this move to home and you guys have said it too is a bit of it is culture and a physician training issue. And you have some markets where you have very little. You have some markets where it's 25%.","So, again, qualitative question where are you in your charm initiative with the doctors to get some of them maybe to think a little more about PD as a first alternative versus maybe what some of them might be defaulting to the clinic?","Javier Rodriguez","Yes, our physicians are actually quite reasonable in that what they want to do is make sure they do what's right for the patient. And they really worry about what's right for the patient and what's right for the system, and they're very independent in their nature and in their thinking.","And so what we have to do is make sure that we put the right science and the right specific and the right analytics, so they could train and encourage the right patients to go home. And once we do that the doctors are quite onboard to do whatever is right for the patient and the system. So, we're working on that. And of course we have thousands of them so it takes some time. And as you said some are more bullish and some would want to wait to see how it plays out.","John Ransom","Okay, that's it for me. Thank you.","Javier Rodriguez","Thank you, John.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Javier Rodriguez","Hi Matt.","Matt Larew","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Javier I wanted to follow-up on your comments around some of the CMMI models. You mentioned that they would require significant investment upfront and that maybe not quite like move the needle for you in the near-term. Are there things in particular that you're providing feedback to for CMS things you'd like to see change that would make them more compelling both for you and the -- your nephrologist partners?","Javier Rodriguez","We are and the industry is actually very well-aligned including MedPAC. So, there's a lot of comments out there that try to make sure that people understand how these work. If I were to use -- something to be useful for you Matt is they're a little like -- the frameworks are a little like the ESCOs and then more complicated.","And so we now have experience on how surprising it is and let's call it difficult to understand how and what you're going to get paid because of benchmark changes and there's little visibility to it. So, imagine adding all that risk but now you have a physician practice instead of a well-capitalized corporation.","And so physician practice would have to be out-of-pocket and not know exactly what its cash flows would be. And so that's really an uncomfortable position for a small business. And so we have a lot of more detail, but in general, I think that's a good healthy way to think about it.","Matt Larew","Okay. Thanks.","Javier Rodriguez","Thank you.","Operator","We show no further questions in queue at this time.","Javier Rodriguez","Well, I want to close out by thanking all of you. We will continue to work hard for you and for our patients. Talk to you next quarter.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

With respect to adequacy, which is essentially how well we're doing at removing toxins from our patients' blood, this quarter, 98% of our hemodialysis patients had a Kt\/V greater than 1.2. Second, with respect to vascular access, 71% of our patients have fistulas. Third, with respect to phosphorous, 81% of our patients have phosphorous levels less than or equal to 5.5 milligrams per deciliter. We also did very well in vaccinations in a number of other areas. And for these and virtually all other clinical measures, our patient outcomes compare very favorably to the national averages. And this quality care not only results in healthier patients, but also drives reductions in hospitalizations and surgical procedures and therefore, significant savings to the U.S. health care system.","Subject #2 for me is our outlook. But the good news is that both DaVita and HealthCare Partners have continued to perform according to our plans and expectations, perhaps even a little better than that. And the ultimate 2012 outlook reflects that trend. In addition, we are initiating operating income guidance for 2013 and that's to be in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.9 billion NOI, which of course includes the HealthCare Partners contribution, and this guidance incorporates the majority of the probabilistic outcomes.","We also have a significant number of headwinds and challenges to face on both sides of our enterprise. On the dialysis side, some of the most significant risk factors that we had to take into account are: a potential 2% cut to Medicare reimbursement due to sequestration; additional risk around additional Medicare reimbursement reductions, as there is risk that the physician fixed will take place and will be paid for by across-the-board cuts to other Medicare providers or not across-the-board cuts to other Medicare providers; and then third, the uncertainty around our commercial book of business, both mix and rates, because sadly, we continue to lose money on Medicare treatments and have to rely on private insurance to fill that gap.","Despite these formidable risk factors, the fundamentals of our core kidney care business remained noteworthy, both in terms of excellent and continually improving clinical care, strong market position, steady volume growth and a history of strong stable cash generation. So as we look at the intermediate and longer term, we're well positioned in this essential therapy and we're eager to get the government's permission to expand our abilities to provide integrated care to more patients and families across America. We will improve quality and save money once we're unleashed and allowed to do that.","And my third and final topic is an update on the HealthCare Partners combination. We expect the acquisition to close soon. The integration process is going according to plan. We have started to work in partnership with HealthCare Partners management on enhancing their infrastructure to drive new market growth. This will, of course, take some time. And throughout the process, we've become ever more convinced of the foundational strengths of the HealthCare Partners business practices in terms of: a, improving health, demonstrably improving patient health; number -- b, providing patient and physician-centric services; and c, controlling the long-term health care spend in a highly differentiated way.","Once the combination is completed, our leverage ratio will be about 3.7x net debt to EBITDA, which is only slightly above our long-stated preferred leverage range of 3.0x to 3.5x, although we have also said for a long time the lead periods when we go above or below. Thus, through this combination, we will have added tremendous upside onto our shareholder platform without much of a change to our balance sheet.","On a combined enterprise, we'll have a very distinctive potential for free cash generation as HCP is highly likely to contribute significant free cash flows in 2013, even after the initial debt cost to finance the deal.","I'll now turn the call over to our interim CFO, Jim Hilger.","James K. Hilger","Thanks, Kent. Non-acquired growth in Q3 was 4.4% when normalized for days of the week. The U.S. dialysis revenue per treatment was down about $0.74 from the prior quarter, primarily due to a decline in mix in the quarter. Note that this decline occurred after our mix had remained stable for the first 2 quarters of the year. I would like to point out that our private pay population continues to grow in absolute terms. But its growth was outpaced by the growth in government programs, such as Medicare Advantage and the VA in the quarter. U.S. dialysis patient care cost per treatment was up about $0.20 from the prior quarter, which is within the normal quarterly fluctuations. Dialysis G&A per treatment was down about $0.35 from the prior quarter, benefiting from lower professional fee spending and a continued decrease in the DSI integration costs, as the DSI integration is almost complete. Please note that G&A costs generally fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, and we anticipate higher G&A expense in the fourth quarter due to increased IT spend and the timing of legal costs.","International losses declined to $8 million in the quarter, reflecting some reduced legal and professional fee expenses. We expect international losses to be in the mid- to high-$30 million in 2012. Debt expense in the quarter was impacted by the recently completed HCP-related bond offering in late August. This offering resulted in approximately $9 million in interest expense and related fees in the third quarter. This HCP-related debt expense reduced our earnings per share by $0.06 below where it otherwise would have been. And operating cash flow was $367 million in the third quarter.","Now, a few additional points on our outlook. We are updating our 2012 operating income guidance to legacy DaVita to a range of $1.315 billion to $1.33 billion, excluding the second quarter legal accrual and certain fourth quarter transaction expenses related to the HCP acquisition. Furthermore, the remainder of -- for the remainder of 2012, we expect HealthCare Partners to contribute $25 million to $30 million per month in operating income once the merger closes. We are also providing 2013 operating cash flow guidance of $1.35 billion to $1.5 billion.","Next, I would like to provide an update on the operating results of HealthCare Partners and some important effects of the HCP acquisition. HealthCare Partners continues to perform according to its plan, delivering strong results in the third quarter, reporting an EBITDA of $161 million. These strong earnings were a result of 2 factors: First, seasonal Medicare Advantage revenue true-ups, which occur in the third quarter of each year and have historically provided a boost to operating revenues; and two, seasonally low utilization.","We do anticipate that HCP will see lower operating income results in the fourth quarter as indicated by our guidance. We now expect HCP to exceed their 2012 EBITDA earn-out target of $550 million. And for 2013, we forecast HCP's segment operating income to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million.","Following are a few more details you should consider when modeling the impact of the HCP transaction this year and next. We anticipate total debt expense in the fourth quarter to be approximately $102 million. We anticipate our total debt cost in 2013 to be about $425 million. But this could vary depending on any hedging we might do and the LIBOR impact of unhedged debt.","In addition, following the close and subject to the finalization of purchase accounting, we anticipate HCP depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $14 million per month, approximately $12 million of which would be amortization of intangibles. We expect equity compensation for HCP to be approximately $1 million per month. And the effective tax rate attributed to income for the combined company in 2013 will be in the range of 40% to 41%. We will have one-time deal costs for the HCP acquisition in the fourth quarter. We will call out these costs when we report the fourth quarter. And finally, keep in mind that we will be issuing 9.38 million shares of DaVita's stock upon closing of the deal.","And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask a few things here. I guess just in terms of the outlook, would be interested in just getting your thoughts on sequestration, in particular. I'm familiar with your probabilistic language in terms of how things get baked in from the risk side of the equation. But I guess I'd be curious just to know how probable or high the probability is in the outlook relative to sequestration, just to help us get our arms around that. I think most of us have assumed in our model that, that's close to 100% probability. So specific to that, maybe would like to hear how you're thinking about that on the risk side.","Kent J. Thiry","We also ascribe a high probability to something like that happening.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So high -- greater than 50%? Just maybe you could qualitatively help us think about how that's baked into your outlook.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. Darren, it's KT. I think, as you know, and significantly above 50%. We think it's highly likely that something like that will happen relatively soon no matter who's elected. It is not 100%, but we put the number up pretty high, and I repeat, that either it or something like it will happen as scheduled or sometime soon.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then if I could, with Matt in the line, we obviously appreciate the detail, Jim, on the HCP performance in Q3. I would be curious to know, what the year ago, Q3 was, we're also getting a hand on the seasonality of the business. So just with a comparison on EBITDA. And, Matt, specifically, if you can just help us think about the seasonal true-ups and the utilization and sort of what the your order of magnitude was for those in the period.","Matthew Mazdyasni","Sure, the utilization in third quarter, usually, it's better and we had the same phenomena happen last year third quarter. Also, there were true-up based on our risk adjustment factors that's at the time of the year that Medicare CMS pays us and updates the RAP score. So that exact thing happened also in 2011.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And the EBITDA number in '11, in the third quarter, against the 161, it was what?","Kent J. Thiry","I don't think we want to go in the history of that level of detail, Darren, because there are some so many puts and takes. But suffice it to say that what's happening this year, Q3, Q4 is comparable to what happened last year Q3, Q4.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then just one last thing, if I could. I'd be curious to know if LeAnne's on the line or somebody if you could comment. We're obviously expecting a pretty important rule-making cycle for dialysis in this next year. And I just would love to get your thoughts on how robust you think CMS's data set is. I'm sure you've had a lot of conversation with them. But specifically, as it relate to the orals, how do you feel that CMS is sort of prepared to include a thoughtful rule for 2014 on that?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, let me take a first pass, Darren, and then LeAnne is on the line and she can amend any of the statements. The good news is that CMS is working hard because they know their data set is fundamentally flawed and incomplete. And so they know that and they are doing good work and good analysis and doing good listening to try to figure it out. The tough reality is it's not easy for them to do that and the dynamics of orals are pretty intense. And so we continue, since we're the leader by far in that arena in terms of providing a comprehensive array of orals to patients, we're unique in having the data that shows what well-managed utilization protocols and practices and conventions are that correlate with the best clinical outcomes, both for health and for macroeconomics for the health care system. And we are, of course, dutifully reporting to those, to them every opportunity we get. So good news is they're working it hard and showing it the respect it deserves as an important and difficult issue. The bad news is that it doesn't necessarily mean they're going to get it right and if they get it wrong, it's really bad for patients. LeAnne, what would you amend?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Nothing, Kent. That was well stated.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess on the HCP front, there was an announcement of an acquisition during the quarter into a new geography. Could you comment on how that's going and maybe more generally on how you think about new geographies as you enter them and what makes them attractive?","Matthew Mazdyasni","That is the acquisition -- it's ABQ Health in Albuquerque, New Mexico. We consummated that transaction effective September 1. And we are now in the process of helping them to have all the core competencies that HealthCare Partners has and implement that for that market.","Kent J. Thiry","And what I would add, Gary, is as is been documented in the public realm that's we're in a bit of a spat with one of the other local organizations there, and so right now, battling it away and impossible for us right now to predict what the outcome, what the short-term outcome of that will be.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Is it possible for you to give us any color on the spat?","Kent J. Thiry","No, it's pretty typical stuff when you can't agree on a rate between a plan and a provider, that then you get into a bit of a tussle. And that's what's happening, so it's pretty normal as those things go. And also, it's an intense exchange and that's why we just have to say, we just can't predict how it's going to come out.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Maybe a couple of housekeeping items. I'm not sure if you said it, but what percent of commercial -- of total dialysis treatments was it?","James K. Hilger","10%, Gary.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And that's rounded, I assume?","James K. Hilger","Yes.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then as you are negotiating the commercial book of business, are there any updates as it continue to sort of be the same back-and-forth or is it getting more difficult or easier?","Kent J. Thiry","I would say, at this point, it's the same, which is to say, always difficult, always a big challenge. We are holding our breath a bit. And at the same time, there's always some opportunities and it kind of nets out in the last couple of years to a relatively smooth trajectory. It's pretty misleading in terms of how it feels like to be in the boat. But there is nothing dramatically different going on right now in terms of the things being harder or easier.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And was there any impact from pharmaceuticals on the cost per treatment in the quarter? Did prices go up or down meaningfully in the quarter?","James K. Hilger","Gary, not really. It was pretty flat in the quarter.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if you could just update us on how you're thinking about the use or I guess the potential use of any of the competing drugs that are out there today?","Kent J. Thiry","Gary, a particular one in mind? Otherwise, we might ramble too much.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Omantis was the one I had in mind.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, that's what I figured. Well, for us, as you probably recall and many others recall, we made a -- established a serious partnership with Amgen, with Epogen, which is the gold standard for anemia management. And so, we've got our partner with a very well established, proven drug and therapy. At the same time, we're paying a lot of attention to, of course, what else is going on and we'll be very curious to see exactly what does unfold.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But you're not doing any kind of small demo or trial with Omantis, are you?","Kent J. Thiry","No, we're not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'll assume that's me then. This is Kevin Fischbeck. A question for you about the guidance for HealthCare Partners for next year. I know that a lot of times the Medicare Advantage plans talk about the selling season or their benefit design versus their competitors. I mean, I guess, when you guys outlined your operating income projections for next year, I mean, what factors are you looking at to give you comfort with that range for next year?","Kent J. Thiry","Boy, Kevin, I had pretty much -- Matt and I would just list off the generic stuff. We had to take it all into account. What you think is going to happen with rates, what's going to happen in existing markets with non-acquired growth, what deals we're going to close, all of the various components of the medical loss ratio, so how much expense we're going to add to ramp up our ability to go into new markets. So can you come at us again because I'm worried that we're being so generic, we're not helping you?","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, I guess it's just that we've seen kind of utilization be pretty low for quite some time. I mean, how do you think about utilization going forward and your ability to control that in the context of where your rates are settling out? What kind of assumptions you're making about membership growth and the plans that you guys are aligned with because that's going to help drive your client base as well?","Kent J. Thiry","Kevin, I think as far as our utilization is concerned, we are pretty comfortable with our projection. By October 15, usually, we have very good visibility on all the benefits that all the health plans have filed. So from that point of view, we are able to incorporate that to our projection. And I think on enrollments, we have looked at our rate of growth for the past few years and incorporated that into the projection.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And if you could just remind me, you mentioned deals and I think you guys have talked about doing good number of deals each year. So in your guidance, you're assuming a certain number of deals, you just assumed that it's prorated overtime? And if you can just remind me kind of how to think about the EBITDA contribution from deals each year?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, I think what we did emphasize in the capital markets is that they didn't flow evenly, not like dialysis where we do 20, 30 deals a year, huge numbers of de novos that HealthCare Partners, the new business in terms of deals comes much more in chunks. And some of them have a lot of potential for post deal ramp up and others don't. So it's going to be chunkier than what DaVita shareholders are used to. Having said that, we are very confident that in the next few years, we will be getting exciting or attractive deals done. We just, right now, wouldn't be very good at predicting when. Is that responsive?","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I thought that the guidance at the capital markets, it was something like it's $80 million of deals a year and then chunky bigger deals on top of that. Is that not the way to think about it? And if it is, then what did $80 million of transactions mean from a contribution perspective?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, as to your question about what prior guidance was provided, everyone in the room is telling me that no, we did not say what you thought you heard. And then as to the second one, sort of generically, what does $80 million in deals buy you. Boy, it really differs so radically because sometimes, you might get an asset with no earnings but tremendous potential. Other times, you get one with nice healthy earnings at a solid multiple. And other times, well, I won't go through more scenarios. But I think you'll see from the announced transactions, that there's deals that get done in sort of the 6 to 7.5 multiple ranges, captures a high percentage of transactions that are actually completed, with some outside that are on either end.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I was getting confused. Maybe you're assuming that paydown in","your worst case scenario, maybe that's what I was thinking about. Okay, then last question. If you gave the international losses for 2012, I didn't hear a 2013. What are you assuming for 2013 in your international losses guidance?","Kent J. Thiry","You are right. We didn't provide -- that it is, of course, incorporated into our broader guidance and why don't we provide that next quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Weight from Feltl.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","First question on the guidance for HCP. Can you confirm, does that include the 2 most, I guess, recent acquisitions, ABQ and I think the other one was Arta?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, it does.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Matt, I appreciate the color on the risk coding adjustment that you guys received here in the third quarter. When you look back historically, what kind of a contribution has risk coding done in terms of percent of growth from your kind of revenue PMPM?","Matthew Mazdyasni","That the level of detail -- first of all, it moves up and down quite a bit. And second, that's not a level of detail that we've provided up to this point. I don't know that we ever will, but certainly, aren't doing it now because it does move amount a fair amount.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. Thought I'd ask. And then the other one with ABQ, I'm wondering, would you be able to provide any sort of break out with the membership? I believe they had about 26,000 in MA members, in total maybe 180,000. Could you break the rest out between commercial and Medicaid at this point?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, the 26,000 is MA and then they have about another 20,000 Medicare regular fee for service and there is about 60,000 Medicaid and the rest of it, commercial book of business.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then also I missed the explanations in terms of the G&A expenses. They look like lower than what we are estimating here for the quarter. Can you provide that again, please?","James K. Hilger","Yes, G&A expenses in the quarter benefited from lower professional fee spending and a continued decrease in the DSI integration cost. So it was $0.35 per treatment improvement.","Matthew Mazdyasni","Matt, this is Matthew Mazdyasni. I want to go back to your earlier question about the coding. I think what is most exciting to our organization and our physicians and caregiver is by appropriately coding and documenting it, it really help us to do the disease management, the population health, the treatment of these patients. So the fact that we are very good at it, I think mostly is because we're looking at it from a clinical point of view and using that information to help us treat the patient more effectively. So I just wanted to add that.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that. And last question. It looks like, for the quarter, your provision as a percent of the dialysis revenues kind of ticked up a little bit there. Was there anything that you guys want to point out to that increase?","James K. Hilger","Yes, Matt. That was primarily driven by the changes in bad debt recoveries in the quarter, where -- and as a result from changes in the new bad debt, the Medicare bad debt rules. We expect that to be sustained.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich from Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just following up on the G&A question to Jim Hilger, is this level sustainable, is this a good run rate or is there anything where that would push back up?","James K. Hilger","Well, we haven't given specific G&A guidance for 2013 and we're not prepared to do that yet as we are still putting together our budgets for next year. But we do expect G&A expense to increase in the fourth quarter. And again, that's due to IT spend and the timing of legal costs.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And yes, the legal cost, what is -- is that related to the closing of the deal or something else?","James K. Hilger","These are not related to the transaction costs. These are other legal costs that relate to compliance and legal spend costs.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then going to HCP. In the press release, you guys talk about the $275 million of earn-out payments that will be paid this year and in 2013. Is it split evenly between the 2 years? And will it be paid upon closing or how should we think about that?","Kent J. Thiry","It's split evenly across the 2 years and it's based on the completion of the 2012 results and then the 2013 results. It would be paid shortly thereafter. I don't know the precise definition of shortly.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then, as we all look to incorporate HCP into our models, is there a good way, Jim, to think about modeling the revenues? Do you want us to just use kind of what HCP had provided in the S-4 or I mean, is there a more defined or greater level of detail that you can help us or walk us through?","James K. Hilger","I think what was in the S-4 is a good thing to base your modeling on. May I just remind you that HCP has reported that revenue is not -- does not represent the full amount of medical funds under management, it is a higher number.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, okay. Good points. And then...","Kent J. Thiry","When we say under management, we mean the dollars where we are coordinating the care.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Right, right. And then, you gave us the amount for amortization per -- D&A per month of $14 million. Was that the same as what was provided in the capital markets presentation, where you gave the guidance of $550 million to $600 million for EBITDA?","James K. Hilger","It was the same that was in the S-4 filing that we did, Kevin. In the -- we did not -- I can't recall the dollar amount we actually put in the capital markets day presentation. But it is the same as that we had in the S-4 filing and we do expect to update that number once we complete our purchase accounting.","Kent J. Thiry","And if you give us a follow-up call, we can let you know exactly what we said in the Capital Markets session.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it, got it. And then just lastly, on the international front, you guys have been slowly moving there. Is there anything, any new markets that are looking interesting, maybe South\/Latin America, anything like that?","Kent J. Thiry","We are looking at 1 or 2 new countries because they look distinctively attractive, and we have specific opportunities that are differentially attracted to us. But I think it's probably in your best interest to keep them quiet until we see if we get something done.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Unfortunately for me, I missed about the first 20 minutes, so please just refer me to the transcript. I want to ask something again. But I just wanted to confirm one thing. On the $14 million of D&A per month, that includes both the modest depreciation that HCP had and all the deal amortization, correct?","James K. Hilger","Yes. It's the depreciation expense, which should be similar to what HCP had incurred, as well as the amortization of the intangibles. That does not include goodwill, which you do not amortize.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And on the 2013 operating income guidance, do both ends of that range include sequestration, or is that -- can you hit the top end of the range if sequestration stays in place?","Kent J. Thiry","Gary, the model, of course, is a combination of our assessment of the probabilities across a wide range of variables, not just picking one number for each variable. So could we -- if theoretically, we said we had the full impact of sequestration but did well everyplace else, could we hit the high end? I don't -- none of us here on the table know the answer to that specific question because we wouldn't have run that specific model. There are so many swing factors, and we play with lots of different probabilities. So I'm afraid we can't answer that specific one. We can just state the obvious that if you do math, then sequestration alone has a very big incremental impact. But it's a little bit -- we'd be a little bit, I think, tenuous to say that something like that is going to happen and everything else is going to go really well. That's just not usually how the world works. There's usually more of a distribution of outcomes across the swing factors.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And what's the dollar amount you'd roughly put as a sequestration impact?","Kent J. Thiry","It's about -- it's 2% of the Medicare revenues. Medicare represents about half of our dialysis revenue, so roughly 1% of our dialysis revenue.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right, okay. Last question, Kent, when you think about 2014 -- I know you just gave '13 guidance, I'm already asking about '14 but just conceptually. When you think about 3 big moving parts for the dialysis business in '14, any potential rebasing? Obviously, the oral is coming into the bundle and where the final payment amount will be for that and then obviously, some opportunity presumably with EPO going off patent. When you look at the combination of those 3 factors, what's your confidence level that those 3 factors are a net positive to DaVita, a neutral or net negative versus '13?","Kent J. Thiry","That's a very fair question, Gary, and I think I'll disappoint you in the answer, and there's also, I would say, exchanges into the mix as another big new development potentially or not. So there's really 4 of them, and in each one, a pessimist would find comfort in being pessimistic and an optimistic would find some comfort in being optimistic. And it's probably going to end up being sort of a mix of outcomes across those 4. So right now, we don't have a tilt in any direction other than that much change always feels, on a net basis, kind of scary when you've got a successful operation that's doing good things for patients and societies. So maybe the only leaning I could give you is we would prefer not to have so many big swing factors kicking in, in 15 months because that's scary stuff.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Any new developments on any of those, I guess, coming out of any DC to any color to add or not at this point?","Kent J. Thiry","Nothing, I think, that would help any of us predict the outcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Maybe for a change of pace, Kent, can you talk a little bit about your latest thoughts on integrated care within the traditional dialysis business? It sounds as though, perhaps, there's a greater impetus towards an RFP early in 2013 of some size.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, it does. I don't know. At some point, you just worry about losing all credibility. Although I think we always hedged with sufficient clarity that we're not actually wrong, but it does seem that in the next 6 to 9 months, they are certainly intending to come out with something. And they had hopes of doing it in 2012. That was their own goal. But I think it would be unfair to criticize them for not hitting it because it's very tricky, and the good news is that they're asking a lot of right questions and soliciting a lot of the right input. So I would be quite surprised if we got through, unless the election results or some other external factors throw everything into disarray, I'd be very surprised if by 6 months into next year, we didn't have an RFP to react to a comment period.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Are we wrong to think it could be of significant scale, even as much as, say, 10% of the overall market?","Kent J. Thiry","No, we do not know. And so someone would have to have better intelligence than us in order to answer that question. We just don't know how confident they're going to get in the end. We are still confident that we can give a great clinical and economic gift to patients in America if we're given a fair shot. But as to how risk-averse they'll be in the end, I just can't say. We, of course, try to point out the -- as opposed to the risk of something going wrong by trying a new approach like that. Right now, we have the reality of things going wrong for a lot of patients because it doesn't exist. And so it's really hard for us that our caregivers do deal with all the constraints on providing such a powerful gift. But I got to go right on back to say they may be too risk-averse to do something anywhere close to that. We just don't know, and I don't know that they've decided yet either.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Bici with UBS O'Connor.","Andrea Bici","Just a couple of questions, Kent. First, as you move towards the bundle, and you said CMS is working really hard, has the discussion come up that one of the orals that will be put into the bundle goes generic in the first quarter of 2014, which is ostensibly kind of the first quarter the bundle is being implemented? Second, when you look at the HCP opportunity and look back as you, Renal Care Group and a few others really consolidated the dialysis industry, how would you characterize almost the running room that HCP has versus the running room DaVita, Gambro, that you all had probably in the mid-2000 time frame, like 2005 or so?","Kent J. Thiry","Let me answer that second one, and I'll turn to LeAnne for the first one regarding early 2014 patent situation. On the issue of sort of market fragmentation, if you will, and the potential for a few key players to emerge as leaders to a fair amount of consolidating, on the one hand, the population health management industry or community, that's a more complicated -- it's a more complicated operation compared to a pretty unidimensional kidney care. Although within kidney care, there's a lot of richness, at the level of your question, there's quite a difference. Having said that, we do believe that the dream of DaVita HealthCare Partners is to do the same thing there that we've done here, which is be different enough, be credible enough for the capital markets and be aggressive enough to, in fact, become not just a leader in a few regional markets but a national leader with a differentiated value proposition for patients and for the taxpayer and premium payers. So over the long term, we think that there can be a parallel story, even though it's more complicated.","Andrea Bici","And, well, the next question is also for LeAnne.","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Oh, did you want me -- sure. As you know, Roche and Amgen entered into a marketing agreement in '11 to bring their product to market at the end of May in 2014. I'm not familiar with where they are with respect to actually introducing their commercial product.","Andrea Bici","Okay. Also on the bundle, how do we think about it, the bundle coupled with the orals? Do we think about it as some sort of neutral transition, as an uplift to revenue per treatment just based on how the discussions are going, or is that too forward of guidance to give?","Kent J. Thiry","LeAnne, do you want to take that one?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Sure. Obviously, right now, we don't have specific visibility into the answer to that question, Andrea. CMS has not announced their intention specifically whether they are going to rebate the entire bundle or not, and they obviously have not yet given specifics around how they're thinking about the oral policy and the introduction of that. We're having good conversation with CMS. They understand the magnitude, the challenge of introducing these oral drugs and, at the same time, doing it in a way that allows clinical quality to improve while the economics are reasonable for providers. So that is certainly something that will be the subject of continuing discussion between the industry and the agency as we move forward in 2013.","Andrea Bici","Great. And one last question. Sorry to be such a pest. How do you think about labor inflation? If next year is kind of a make-or-break year, we'll either be in a recession or the economy could turn around and improve. And obviously, you've done scenario analysis modeling. And just maybe how do you frame it or how have you been thinking about it?","Kent J. Thiry","Let me take a first stab at it, and then you come back at me if I'm missing the point or if someone else here on the table wants to add. And by the way, LeAnne is in another city, so if some of the handoffs are a little awkward, that explains most of it, at least. On the labor front, 2 things. If a bunch of the bad stuff happens, sequestration, using some of our money as part of their physician fix, et cetera, then we and other health care service providers are going to have to ask our teammates to help absorb some of that burden because it would be quite a blow. And so that's one factor. The second factor is the impact of those kinds of measures as a part of broader government policy are pretty difficult to then translate into a forecast for how overall unemployment and wage movements are going to behave. And apart from industry-specific things like sequestration or dialysis-related cuts to fund part of the physician fix, we've got the big just macroeconomic forces where we know that those ripple through into what happens for our people. And so those are the 2 big influencers of what happens next year. We, of course, are hoping that we have a strong year and do kind of merit increases and profit-sharing with our team that we like to do. But in the face of lots of other bad news, that may not be possible.","Andrea Bici","That is helpful. And can you maybe provide in your guidance what percent of your cost structure is labor? Just so we know what number to kind of work with as we're incorporating all these scenarios.","Kent J. Thiry","I think these people are going to give you a couple of numbers to make sure we get the right definition between field versus corporate or SWBs versus related. And so why don't we fire that exact number back to you in a couple of minutes?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from Robert.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess first just a quick technical question on the earn-out, I'm just trying to figure out exactly how that works in 2013. It doesn't appear that it's in the guidance. So I guess I'm trying to get an idea of how you accrue that cost, do you accrue it at all, is it onetime in December and to what extent you'll provide transparency around that.","James K. Hilger","Yes, Whit, this is Jim. The earn-out is actually put on the opening balance sheet as a contingent liability, and then each quarter, the probability of achievement of that is reassessed. And if it increases, it's run through as an expense. If it decreases, it\u2019s a negative expense effectively. That would go through the 2013 financials, but there will be a probability of achievement already on the books on the closing financials.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So implicitly, you are including part of the earn-out based on various probability and assumptions here for 2013?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, that's right. We will make an assessment, a probabilistic assessment of the likelihood of achieving the earn-out in '12 and '13 as part of our purchase accounting. And we will record that as where the assets acquired and also a liability, which, as Jim said, may fluctuate and run through the P&L as the actual results are achieved.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And I wanted to go back to ABQ for a second. As you look at that deal sort of in hindsight, can HealthCare Partners be successful in that market without Lovelace? And does that dynamic at play or, I guess, the spat, as you call it, does that, in any way, reshape the thinking on entering new markets or the development strategy at all?","Kent J. Thiry","I'll take this one and then Matthew might want to add. Number one, it does not affect our appetite for new markets. Number two, yes, we can be successful without Lovelace, and at the same time, we have no particular desire to, but that's the answer to the question. And number three, I didn't want to try to minimize it when I used the words spat, and so when you replay it for me, it makes it sound like I had been trying to trivialize it. It's a very, very intense competition going on there. And so please forgive me if I, in any way, was interpreted as trying to minimize it. Within the context of that market, within the context of HealthCare Partners overall, the EBITDA run rate there was about 2% of total HealthCare Partners EBITDA. So in that context, it's quite tiny, but I did not mean to minimize the intensity of the competition in the market.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's fair. I guess I was just trying to get a sense of -- do you think about relationships with payers and providers any differently after dealing with that contractual argument at this point in time?","Kent J. Thiry","No, not at all. And over HealthCare Partners' 30 years of consistent success, there have been other times where they've gotten in battles and standoffs and the rest with different payers. However, while that is a true statement, the overall track record and one of the areas where our philosophies blend well is that, that's not what we believe in. What's far more noteworthy than the 2% EBITDA that has these battles going on is the 98% where we worked constructively with payers for years and years and years, both sides benefiting and then both sides helping the patients' benefit. So that's the dominant element of our philosophy and our strategy, and it's just unfortunate that Albuquerque is an exception to that general rule. Matthew, would you like to amend that at all?","Matthew Mazdyasni","Yes, it is truly an exception because when I look at what we are hearing from payers who want to partner with us and really ask us to go through different areas, it is very much -- they want to work with us because very much, they are interested in partnering with us. So it is truly an exceptional situation that exists. When we look at the opportunities on all the other markets, the payers are more than interested for us to grow with them.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's fine. And I guess one last question. We've covered it a lot, but, Kent, back to your point on looking into 2014 and some of the risk with exchanges, I presume you're referring to the unknowns of the small group market and the individual market and whether or not MSP does or does not apply there. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on how you're thinking about that dynamic and what conversations, whether LeAnne's having in DC at this point in time?","Kent J. Thiry","And the conversation on which topic, please?","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Looking at the exchange -- the unknowns around exchanges and whether or not we'll see the small group market compromise and the individual market grow and the questions around whether or not MSP applies to the individual market in the exchanges. I thought that's what you were referring to when you said there were some risks around the exchanges. Maybe we're talking about 2 different topics here.","Kent J. Thiry","Okay, let me take a stab at it because we just got a note that LeAnne's line got cut off. Otherwise, I would have turned to her. And I'm going to go back to Albuquerque one moment just to dive into the weeds in one way, given you asked sort of a broader question about what that suggests or implies for other payers elsewhere. One of the unusual elements of the Albuquerque situation is Lovelace is a plan in a hospital that are in one organization. So as opposed to most plans across America that have a real strong interest in improving quality and reducing costs, they have a very strong interest in keeping hospital costs up. And so that made it a lot less surprising for there to be a difficult time in reaching any kind of quick agreement. We're just feeling really good about what our model does for society and patients as opposed to one that's quite focused on maintaining high hospital admissions and high hospital rates. LeAnne is back on. I'll take a cut at your exchange question. No, there's nothing that we know that should create any concern beyond what you had before in this area nor any good news beyond what you would have already heard. It's just the uncertainty about the actual architectural detail of how they are going to operate. And the mechanics means that we still don't know if we're going to have lots of new patients with insurance at good rates or we're going to have fewer private patients at good rates. It's impossible to predict now how many uninsured people will become insured and more attractive from an economic point of view versus how many private pay patients that pay a certain level today will be paying at a lower level then. And you can create very, very feasible scenarios in either direction, and right now, no one knows the answer. That's why I listed as the fourth significant swing factor around, which we still have a very neutral stance in terms of predicting this. Does that answer your question?","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. No, it does. I guess I was trying to dive a little bit more specifically into the individual market and whether or not -- if it's complicated because MSP doesn't apply there and if you begin to see the small group market compromise over time. I guess it's a sort of longer-term question that we all sort of have.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. We think it's -- well, I'll let LeAnne go ahead and comment.","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Well, I do think what Kent -- Kent's remarks were correct. Yes, most of us do not know how this will play out. A couple of things that we can offer, which is that the benchmark plans do cover dialysis, so that's a good fact. It is a fact today that individuals do pay out of pocket and maintain their commercial insurance. Hopefully, within the exchanges, that same type of level of policy would be reasonably affordable. I don't believe we can yet make predictions about what the policies would look like more specifically or who will purchase them. I think that's just not knowable at this point in time.","Kent J. Thiry","And it's certainly the case, just to add on, that if the government would start taking -- a lot of people around private insurance start taking their insurance away, that would be unpopular with a lot of folks in a pretty intense way.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to dive into the weeds of Albuquerque. Is the MA a global capitation, or is it just a physician capitation at this point?","Kent J. Thiry","If you're talking about the MA that we have with Lovelace, it has been based on a discounted fee for service payment, not capitated.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Does it cover the whole spend or just the physician spend at this point?","Kent J. Thiry","The numbers with ABQ is only the physician spend.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So is it potentially an opportunity to expand that to the global healthcare spend [indiscernible]?","Kent J. Thiry","That's what we want in every market over time.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So just to be clear, when you ran the economics on that deal, you ran it based on the business as is, or was it just the physician piece of the spend?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, we never get into any market without the intention and goal of moving to a coordinated care physician, where it's either globally capitated or some form of shared savings coordinated care. So that's always a part of our motivation.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich, Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just had 2, really, clarifications. One, Jim, you guys mentioned just with regards to the earn-out, the accounting treatment for that. I just want to confirm that you plan to expense that as a contingent purchase price expense. I guess that's the accounting treatment that we're used to seeing now for earn-outs. So essentially, you take the $275 million and just divide it by 8, and that's what's in your OI guidance as an expense. Is that generally speaking the right way?","James K. Hilger","No, Darren, that's not correct. What we will do in purchase accounting is estimate the probabilistic outcome of the total earn-out. So if the total earn-out is $275 million, we will record as part of the purchase price some amount that is less than $275 million because there is some probability that they won't achieve the earn-out in '13 or '14. And then, as the earn-out is earned and as things progress, quarter-by-quarter, we'll reassess that probabilistic outcome, and the change in those estimates will then result in either a P&L charge or a reduction of expense in the quarter of the change in estimate. So I would not expect significant quarterly swings here, Darren, unless there is a significant change in the business.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And so the starting balance sheet for that contingent liability, what will be the number that we should just be thinking about or expect to see when that balance sheet is set up?","James K. Hilger","Well, we haven't finalized that yet, but my guess is it will be in the range of -- and I'll give you a broad range, but just to try to size it, $225 million to $275 million, somewhere in that range.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then the last thing, really, this one is for Matt. Can you give us the average star rating across all of your health plan partners for 2012 and then to the extent you have any visibility on 2013, what you think that average will be?","Matthew Mazdyasni","Sure. The average currently is 3.5. And as you know, the star rating, it's not only based on what we do. HEDIS, which is the measurement that we contribute, it's part of that star rating. The rest of it, it depends on how the plan does business and how good they are in responding to the patients' calls and lots of other things. So we are working with certain health plans to see how we can improve upon that. That is now a bigger item, if you will, when health plans come, and we have a monthly or quarterly meeting with them. They're paying a lot of attention to it, and they are asking us to help them also. And we believe in the long term, it's going to also incentivize and encourage these plans to really work with the groups who really are effective in those measures. And some of the smaller groups and IPAs, unfortunately, they are not investing and have not invested in those infrastructure to improve the HEDIS criteria.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Any sense for whether you think that will improve from 3.5 next year? I'm just trying to understand if that's possible swing factor for next year.","Matthew Mazdyasni","I can't predict what the number is going to be, but I think it's an opportunity as they're finding out that we can help them and others cannot, perhaps, bring some more enrollment to us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Bici from UBS O'Connor.","Andrea Bici","Sorry, just following up. Did you get the labor number?","James K. Hilger","Yes. Labor for dialysis is in the range of 36% to 38% of revenue.  That's fully loaded, Andrea.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Kent J. Thiry","All right. Thank you all very much for your consideration of our enterprise. And once again, we hope you and your families are and continue to be safe in the Northeast. Thank you. Take care.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the DaVita HealthCare Partners Q2 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Jim Gustafson, you may now begin your conference.","Jim Gustafson","Thank you, Ian, and welcome everyone to our second quarter conference call.

I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations; and with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Bob Margolis, the CEO of HealthCare Partners; Matthew Mazdyasni, HealthCare Partners Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer and Interim CFO; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements.

All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

Thiry","Okay. Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all of you out there for your interest in our enterprise. This quarter, as maybe you've already noted by seeing the press release, we experienced mixed results with continued solid performance in our Kidney Care business but with results below your and our expectations at HealthCare Partners. I will cover 6 topics: number one, clinical performance; number two, HealthCare Partners performance; number three, Kidney Care performance; number four, a policy update; number five, a quick comment on investigations; and number six, our outlook going forward.","Category 1, clinical outcomes, which we always present first, because that is what comes first, you probably know, we serve about 1 out of every 3 dialysis patients in America at this point. Our adequacy at 98% of our patients with a Kt\/V of greater than 1.2 is outstanding. Our vascular access was 72% of our patients having fistulas is outstanding. We've talked about those metrics in the past. We'd like to comment on an additional one this time and talk about our strides in reducing their peritonitis rates for our PD patients, which represent between 9% and 10% of our patients. The international guidelines for peritonitis is 1 episode per 18 months; our data, 1 episode for every 45 months, about 1\/3 the rate of issue and is across a very substantial patient population. Overall, as you've heard many times, our patient outcomes compare very favorably with national averages and that is both good for patients and saves taxpayers money.","I'd also like to start talking more about the wonderful clinical outcomes at HealthCare Partners. We can compare our 2012 performance in California, for example, to the national HEDIS data for Medicare HMO patients. We are still harmonizing the rest of the HealthCare Partners data across the 3 markets and so in the future, we'll be able to provide aggregate metrics. But right now, California, which is the biggest market by far, our Medicare Advantage patients, once again, several years in a row, scored near the top across a wide variety of metrics, including above the 90th percentile with respect to colorectal cancer; above the 90th percentile with respect to female patients screened for breast cancer; and near the 90th percentile with respect to diabetic LDL less than 100. For these and many other clinical outcomes, HealthCare Partners compares very favorably to national averages. In addition, we averaged 4 stars or better on the HEDIS clinical quality metrics in all 3 of our legacy HealthCare Partners partner markets.","Next, turning to HealthCare Partners operating performance, which I'm sure is the subject of primary focus for many of you. It was a weak quarter, no 2 ways around it. What's the right way to think about it and diagnose that weakness and its implications going forward. First of all, if you take our guidance for the year, which was OI of $400 million to $450 million and take the midpoint, $425 million, you just divide that evenly and that would be about $106 million per quarter. Then you allow for, in general, the long-term trend being second half better than first half of each year, probably tweak that down to $103 million or so, which means we were $22 million off what someone might have expected. Of course, I'm picking single-point numbers when one would normally use a range but I'm trying to simplify things. Well, about half of that, $10 million, was a normal seasonal decline that happens in Q2, about of that magnitude. Last year, it was a little bit higher and you should expect a similar seasonal trend in future years, indexed to our MA growth, which is where you experienced a bunch of that seasonality. So about half of that number was, in fact, not an operating shortfall. However, the other half was; first sub-point under that category is sequestration, which started April 1 and that explains about $7 million, so it's over half of the remaining $12 million, sequestration, which is might very well recur for some time. And then of that remaining 40% or so, 40% of the $12 million, Albuquerque was the single, biggest chunk, where our operating performance is under what we expected, and then there was this small basket of miscellaneous things that round out the variance. We do expect to do slightly better in Q3 and Q4 than Q1 and Q2, hence, are lowering the full year HealthCare Partners expectations, which I'll talk about in a minute.","Regarding growth, very important to us and to you. Total member months did decline 2% sequentially in Q2 compared to Q1 due to our ending a relationship that had unfavorable rates. That one is actually good news for you. But more important, we had 20% year-on-year growth of Medicare Advantage patients in our 3 legacy markets, of which, 12 -- 60% or 12 of the 20 was organic and 8% through a series of small but important acquisitions at reasonable multiples. Please note that the year-on-year comparisons incorporate dates prior to the completion of our merger, which was in the middle of the fourth quarter last year.","We'll now move on to Kidney Care performance. I think I can handle that quite concisely from my point of view, although Jim Hilger will go into more detail, just by saying our Kidney Care business continued to operate solidly all across the board in the quarter and year-to-date.","Enough on that, I'll move on to public policy. Starting here with Kidney Care and the proposed 2014 Medicare reimbursement cuts. This is exceptionally frustrating, given already dialysis providers lose money on Medicare patients and charge private patients significantly more in order to subsidize government patients. It is our understanding at this point that CMS felt compelled to focus on a very narrow sliver of the bundle having to do with pharmaceutical utilization and felt circumscribed from not being able to take into account other factors. We actually disagree with that interpretation and are making that point vigorously and hoping this comment period that our protest with respect to that logic is taken seriously. Time will tell. If they cut reimbursement, there will be changes to patient access to care. There's no 2 ways around it for the nationwide community. I could provide a list of the potential consequences but the most significant one is that, almost inevitably, some centers will close -- actually, inevitably, some centers will close and they will tend to be those centers that served the most vulnerable patients. We have carried a lot of centers that lose money overall in aggregate, trying to be a good citizen of the system but if they cut reimbursement, at some point, it becomes impossible to do that everywhere.","Moving on to health care policy. The big policy issue, as you know, is around Medicare Advantage. We have no material update on this to provide. It's nice to reflect on the facts, however, that Medicare Advantage remains a superior value proposition, both in terms of clinical outcomes and overall cost to taxpayers.","Let's go back to Kidney Care for a moment, another aspect of policy and that is the ESRD Seamless Care Organizations or ESCOs. First, we do want to publicly thank CMS for all the time that they have put into this whole process in the ESCO design. Second, however, we are very, very disappointed that the small changes to the proposed ESCO design will not make it one that merits significant investment; and to implement the kind of spectacular success that we've had in integrated care, the proven success we've had in integrated care does take a bunch of upfront investments and we simply can't put a lot of your capital at risk in that way when we know we could generate a return through improving quality and reducing costs with the right architecture of the program and the right duration of the program. But we can't make all those formidable investments if, in fact, after we make all those improvements, there won't be any return because, of course, you would not allocate anymore capital to us to continue to grow what could be a beautiful program. We will not give up hope for the future, and once again, we're grateful for the hard work that CMS put in. It's a complicated subject, no doubt. But you can tell by our remarks and the consistency of our remarks over many years now that we believe strongly in coordinated care, that it is a win-win-win for the patient, for the taxpayer and for the enterprise and that we have proven that this is the case and it can be scaled.","Next topic, quick update on investigations and lawsuits. On the physician relationship side, we continue to have discussions with the government but have not reached any settlement or resolution yet; and then 2 pieces of really strong good news. We had 2 previously disclosed lawsuits against HealthCare Partners, the Zanre [ph] suit and the Slogan [ph] suit, both previously disclosed as I mentioned; and each of them, the judges ordered that the cases be dismissed with prejudice, meaning the plaintiffs cannot refile those claims. In both cases, dismissed before they got very far at all because the claims were so meritless and our advocacy was so appropriately and justifiably strong. So 2 very nice pieces of good news on the legal front.","Last, our thoughts looking forward. As you probably read already, we have made changes to our 2013 guidance, decreasing HealthCare Partners OI guidance by $20 million, so there's now a range of $380 million to $430 million. And on the other hand, increasing Kidney Care OI guidance by $50 million to the range of $1.45 billion to $1.50 billion and the net impact is, what you probably already calculated, is a net increase to the bottom and top end of our consolidated operating income guidance of $30 million, in other words, to somewhere between $1.83 billion to $1.93 billion. Of course, this guidance excludes the impact of any legal settlement related to the physician relationship matters or anything else, as well as any impact from any change in value of the 2013 earn-out associated with the HealthCare Partners marriage. As always, all the guidance that I have mentioned and we've referred to in our documents capture a majority of the probabilistic outcomes based on our whole wide number of swing factors and it could happen that we end up outside the guidance above or beyond.","Looking beyond 2013, we are unfortunately unable to provide any useful guidance on 2014 right now. You all know of the significant reimbursement cuts. You all know we've all operated reasonably efficiently in the past. So simply too many variables at this point to provide useful guidance to you, and we wish we could but to provide guidance that's too speculative doesn't do anyone any good. So we will not succumb to that temptation.","Looking longer, the good news is, we are well positioned. A, we have strong relative value propositions on both sides of the enterprise, that's both in absolute terms and relative to the competition. B, a second piece of good news, we have strong business development opportunities at HealthCare Partners. C, the bad news is that muscle, the new market muscle, the business development muscle, still needs to be developed at HealthCare Partners. But D, fourth and finally, the good news is we have a very robust and secure cash flows as we proceed down the path of building those capabilities and taking advantage of our strong relative value propositions.","Thank you very much. I look forward to the Q&A, and I'll now turn it over to Jim Hilger. Take it away.","James K. Hilger","Thanks, Kent. First, I'll cover a few more dialysis operating metrics. Our non-acquired growth was 5%, when normalized for days of the week and our commercial mix improved slightly in the quarter. Our U.S. dialysis revenue per treatment was down $1.58 from the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of the 2% Medicare sequestration cut, which went into effect in April, partially offset by improved commercial mix. Our dialysis G&A per treatment was down $1.28 from the first quarter due primarily to seasonal fluctuations, including compensation expense. And during the quarter, we experienced $6 million in international losses, in line with our prior expectations.","Now next, a comment about HCP. We've reduced the estimated fair value of the contingent liability with the HealthCare Partners earn-outs or 2013, creating a gain of $57 million, which is reflected in our operating income. We're adjusting the expected fair value of the earn-out based on the first half performance of HCP and the expected operating performance for the remainder of the year. We'll continue to value this liability each quarter until the earn-out is finalized. So we may continue to see some swings in the value -- if the value changes. As far as the overall enterprise goes, our debt expense was $108 million in the second quarter and this is consistent with what we've guided last quarter. This should be a good run rate for the remainder of the year. Our effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners was 39.5% in the quarter, excluding the accounting adjustment for the HCP earn-out. Note that we now expect a tax rate of between 39% to 40% for 2013, excluding the loss contingency reserve we recorded in Q1, as well as the HCP earn-out adjustment.","Now turning to cash flow. Our operating cash flow was $307 million in the second quarter. We're raising the bottom end of our 2013 operating cash flow guidance and our current expectation is for operating cash flow to now be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion for the year. This guidance excludes the impact of any legal settlements we may reach in the physician relationship investigations.","And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Matt Weight.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Kent, I was wondering if you could just start with rebasing here. Clearly there were several discussions you guys have with CMS. And so when I look at the disconnect here, is this a function of just poorly written legislation to begin with or did CMS, more or less, disagree with your analytical analysis, I guess?","Kent J. Thiry","Fair question. Let me sort of stumble for a moment and then you come back and see if I've added any value. The -- right now, they are maintaining that they have a different interpretation of the legislation, and so that is a part of what is going on and we are asking for a more senior legal review based on the premise that, that hasn't happened yet and so that is potentially one variable. Based on what we've been told, it is one variable. And then second is, of course, just their overall view of the sector in a world where they want to find Medicare savings. And there, it's impossible to say for sure what their real view of our economics are. On the one hand, we know the facts are. We lose money on Medicare on average across America. On the other hand, they see that we and other providers are, in aggregate, successful. And so how much of what drove their preliminary recommendation or idea or proposal was driven by category A versus B, we can only speculate.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Do you feel that -- so it sounds like you don't feel that there would necessarily need to be a new bill that would almost replace what was written in the fiscal cliff though?","Kent J. Thiry","No. What they need to do is absorb the comments, which they are, and we're grateful for the fact that they're listening. They're hearing a lot from the kidney care community because there are a lot of people, big and small, that are worried about closing centers, restricting hours, et cetera, et cetera. So there's an awful lot of feedback being provided to them, which is exactly what they want in order to make their final decision, which they'll make in a couple of months after hearing from us and parts of Congress. And then depending on what happens, of course, we always have the recourse of trying to go to Congress if we feel we've been unfairly harmed, but we all know what a tortuous path that is.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","And in the past, you've discussed at times anywhere from a -- maybe 150 to 200 of your centers do operate at a loss. So to the extent the proposed rule isn't adjusted, would you say a majority of those clinics are at risk?","Kent J. Thiry","We're not talking about an aggregate number because so much will be driven by what they ultimately decide. Suffice it to say, it won't be 0. I mean we are, first and foremost, a caregiving company, and a notion of closing a center where we're taking care of kidney care patients is pretty much an aftermath [ph] to us, which you can see by our track record. At the same time, at some point, the reimbursement has to be fair in covering the costs of those centers that don't have enough private patients in order to subsidize the government. We wish there was some magic wand where they could just increase Medicare reimbursement, where there aren't enough private patients to subsidize because that at least would be a move towards a more rational system. But right now, while we know the number won't be 0 for us, it won't be 0 for the industry. Nonetheless, we're not talking about an aggregate number because it would be totally speculative and it just hurts too much to even think about it.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. I'm assuming, obviously, you guys are not just sitting on your hands here. So what kind of levers can you look to pull? I know you're already run an efficient model there, but there's clearly going to be some pressure. So can you help us think about some of the levers?","Kent J. Thiry","No. Your words are exactly correct. As much as we think, both HealthCare Partners and Kidney Care have done very nice jobs in managing productivity and efficiency over time, you just can't stare at reimbursement cuts of this magnitude and do nothing. It just doesn't make sense just as you wouldn't do nothing in your family household and suddenly your income was dramatically impaired. So we will be looking at every single expense and I'm confident we'll find some savings. Right now, we can't put a number on it. And unfortunately, it\u2019s not going to be big enough to change the fact that we're going to take quite a hit.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","All right, I'll -- one more and then I'll jump back in queue. Switching just briefly over to HCP and I think, Kent, you made the comment in your prepared remarks that the new market muscle still needs to be developed there. So I'm curious if you could expand on that, what's maybe taken a little bit longer. And then also, I know they are small acquisitions but curious that HCP acquired in Nevada in March a hospice operator and then a cancer center in June in Nevada, too. So any color on what's the strategic thinking with that kind of acquisition versus an IPA would be a helpful color.","Kent J. Thiry","Well, I'll let Bob comment on the hospice and cancer center acquisitions. But before he does that, as to the new market muscle, it's pretty straightforward, which is HealthCare Partners had and has an amazing track record in the 3 legacy markets clinically, economically, patient service, patient satisfaction, physician satisfaction, HEDIS ratings, star rating, et cetera. They focused on those 3 markets and did beautiful things on all those dimensions. They did not go out into new markets. They did not go out and do different models and so it's a new thing. And I think we're making steady, not impressive, but steady progress in building that capability. Cannot, at this point, translate that into numbers for you. The pipeline is very robust. Because of our capabilities on that side of the house, lots of folks are interested in working with us, and so that's wonderful news. Exactly how long it will take us to develop all the right capabilities of transferring those capabilities and implementing them with partners, right now, we just can't put the kind of number on that, that you would legitimately want. But let me go ahead and turn to Bob for the hospice and oncology, and then you can come back at me if you'd like.","Robert J. Margolis","It's an interesting question. Certainly, there are acquisitions related to new doctors, new IPAs, medical groups, new markets and that's, perhaps, what you think of when you think of acquisitions. But first and foremost, we're a caregiving company and the opportunity to manage and coordinate the full continuum of care is an important driver in the clinical results that we want of all of our systems. And so a hospice acquisition made a lot of sense because of the opportunity in Las Vegas to coordinate the very difficult time of life, the end-of-life care in a fully seamless and compassionate way relative to the continuum of care. And likewise, cancer care or an earlier cardiology acquisition that you may have mentioned, or similarly, so that we could have the full integrated services delivered to our patient, the populations we serve in that market. We may do similar things in other markets where a buy-versus-build decision pushes us in that direction.","Kent J. Thiry","And Matt, I think it's time for us to go to someone else. You probably should try to stick to that normal convention of 1 to 2 questions each and then back in the queue, if that's okay.","Operator","And your next question comes from Gary Lieberman at Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess maybe just to go back at the HCP muscle development or the business development. I guess, can you maybe share with us what your expectations were and if they fell short or that you sort of didn't know what to expect and it's maybe going slower? Or how would you characterize that?","Kent J. Thiry","Okay. It's a fair question and I don't know that we -- if we ask everyone in the room or in the rooms that question, you'd get the same answer because I think different people had different expectations. Overall, if you look at the expectations we talked about when we made the announcement of the combination, we still have a shot of being on track with that here in the first couple of years, which we always said were years that had some headwinds, both because of the integration of the 2 companies and because of what was going to go on in the reimbursement environment. So I think, in that sense, there is no surprise. But then if you ask, have we performed superbly, excellently, medium, average or terribly? Unfortunately, we're not yet operating at the excellent level just because it is a new muscle. So I think how you net those 2 facts together, we're probably a little bit behind in capability and still okay in the game with respect to the numbers themselves because for the first x quarters of our time after the announcement, the operating performance was so much stronger than we expected.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So is there -- I mean, can you lay out any details on kind of the plan going forward or timing? Is it a manpower issue? Is it finding sort of the right integration or the right structure for the organization?","Kent J. Thiry","It's primarily a resource question and you can't, of course, just go out and hire 2 people and have them be wonderful at day 1 or 20 people and you can't suddenly take 10 people and shift them from one job to another. So it's all the normal nitty-gritty operating stuff. But at the core of it is just having enough of the right bodies in order to deliver that which we know how to deliver with partners who want us to deliver it. So lots of good news if we can drive ourselves to a new level of capability quickly.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Jim, could you explain the earn-out contingent fair value in a little bit more detail? If I'm doing the math correctly, it looks like it declined from $126 million to $57 million, which would seem like a relatively big change in the fair value of something, so maybe walk us through the math there.","James K. Hilger","Sure. Actually, you got to the numbers pretty much spot on, Gary. The -- when we acquired HCP in our purchase accounting, we had to estimate the fair value at that time. We had thought the likelihood that they would achieve their 2013 earn-out being quite high and we had initially valued it in purchase accounting at roughly the $125 million number. Our assessment at the end of the second quarter was it was more of a 50-50 matter and so the value of it is approximately 50% of the total earn-out, which is $137.5 million.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And is that -- forgive me for not knowing this but -- so is that the earn-out for 2013 or is that over a longer period of time?","James K. Hilger","It's for 2013. If you recall in the original architecture of the transaction, there was a $275 million potential earn-out related to the achievement of EBITDA in 2012 and 2013. HCP achieved the earn-out in 2012 and that's been paid. And then in 2013, the other 50% of the $275 million is the opportunity for HCP and we are handicapping the likelihood that they'll achieve that at roughly 50%.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the goal there was -- that was $600 million of EBITDA, is -- was -- is that the number that's the target?","James K. Hilger","That is the target.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe if I could get one more question in on HCP and I'll jump in -- back in the queue. Could we maybe get a little bit more detail on the update in New Mexico?","Kent J. Thiry","Sure. We continue to -- what are the right words? We have not yet nailed down a sustainable partnership there. That's the bad news. It'd be good if that was done. The good news is there are multiple people who want us to be their long-term partner, and we're making good progress in figuring out who is going to be the right one. But in the meantime, we're taking some hits in the context of the overall enterprise. Not huge, but nonetheless, versus what we expected when we were developing the guidance for 2013, they're higher than what we had planned on. Is that responsive?","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful and then maybe just a follow-up. It's essentially the same issue that's been fairly well documented in the press or has there been any change in that dynamic?","Kent J. Thiry","It's pretty much the same.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake at JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, let's start on HCP. You mentioned on your last call that approximately half of the rate pressure in Medicare Advantage next year could be mitigated by whole-plan bidding. Given those bids were filed in June, I'm hoping you can give us an update here on how we should think about HCP going into next year in this regard.","Robert J. Margolis","Justin, Bob Margolis here. We won't know that, unfortunately, until the plans officially are approved by CMS and that's not until the October timeframe. So as you may know, the plans hold, fairly close to the vest, their decisions on benefits for competitive reasons, give us some indications that they may or may not be moving to greater beneficiary responsibility and we continue to estimate, as we said before, that perhaps, half of that allowable portion of the MA cuts could be mitigated through benefit changes but we do not have new information at this point.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So this isn't a two-way discussion between you and the plans in terms of how they're going to accept benefits. At the end of the day, they are going to set them where they feel like they need to and you'll respond in terms of either accepting them or not, how do -- is that the way to think about it?","Robert J. Margolis","That is generally a true statement. I wouldn't say we did not have significant conversations and input with our plan partners, more with the ones where we have our large penetration in their membership and less when we have a smaller penetration. But ultimately, for competitive reasons, they make decisions about margin versus market share that are broader than their relationship just with us.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then my follow up question, I just wanted to go back to the interactions with DC and CMS. If we -- clearly, I think, Kent, you gave a lot of color on how these rate cuts have iterated and -- in and of themselves, it's clear that dialysis isn't the only industry going through this in terms of CMS looking for dollars. And when you add it on top of the oral meds being delayed by Congress, the integrated care demo been disappointing, curious if you can expand a little bit in terms of how you feel with the relationship with DC is currently versus what I call, at least on my 10-plus years following the company, the partnership that the industry has kind of enjoyed with DC over time.","Kent J. Thiry","It's a fair question, Justin, and I guess, when you cite the facts as you just did and as we have, it's clear that they made some decisions that we really wish they hadn't and in particular, in a couple of cases, really affecting our ability to take the quality of care and the effectiveness of each taxpayer dollar to a whole nother new level so it's profoundly frustrating. I don't think there's been any big change in our effectiveness as a community or how we're viewed as a community. Maybe some change because sometimes when a couple of companies are successful then they become more tempting targets. But that -- also, we don't want to throw out at some sort of convenient excuse if we're not doing the right job of advocacy and doing it the right number of years ahead of time. So I -- as you know, it's kind of unanswerable question because there's so many different people in CMS. There's so many different people in Congress. There's so many different people in MedPAC. I -- I'm kind of stumbling here. So I think it's a fair question and certainly, we haven't done as well the last couple of years as we did the prior 10. But I don't think it's because of a dramatic shift in either of those 2 areas. But if someone asserted there had been some shift, I certainly couldn't prove them wrong.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck at Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I think that there's not many providers would feel like CMS is treating them terribly well nowadays. But maybe we'll go back to Justin's first question around how the bidding process actually works. And I guess I understand the concept of not being able to see the plan's full benefits, understanding how that flows through but I guess I'm just trying to understand to -- the way I interpreted your response to that question was that you would not really know what rate you're going to get paid until October from the health plans. And I would think that would make it very difficult for the health plans to bid appropriately, not knowing if a major provider's are going to be in their network or out of network and [indiscernible] -- they didn't vote [ph] for you to run your business for the following year without the kind of visibility until October. So I just want to make sure that I understood that dynamic correctly and to the extent that I did, in periods of rate volatility in the past, I guess, how outside of the expectations did the rate come? How often do you end up terminating in October when you finally see the rates?","Kent J. Thiry","So let me take a shot at that and perhaps Matthew will chime in as well. We do not generally need to renegotiate the contracts based on benefit changes because we prenegotiated that material benefit changes that have financial impact will be re-adjudicated and the benefit change is often just member responsibility or beneficiary responsibility versus plan. So we have the opportunity if there is a shift of copayments, et cetera, to the beneficiary to collect that directly, which has a bit of a neutral offset. So significant benefit changes that were detrimental to us would in almost all of our contracts require a negotiation, which, since we are major providers to the health plan and they have been traditionally excellent partners, I would say has low probability of the terminations that you suggested.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But do you have preliminary indications at this point? Or is that really still an October time period when you get that visibility?","Robert J. Margolis","We will not know the final benefit design of the plans until October.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Until then, you won't know your final rate until October. Okay. And then I guess you kind of alluded to the problems at EBQ [ph] , I guess, but is it purely an issue of volume shortfall that's creating the problem? Is -- or is there something on the medical management side that's falling short? I guess I am still not clear about what exactly is the shortfall there.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, I don't think we want to go into too much detail on one market and some of the competitive dynamics. It's just not in your best interest. But suffice it to say, when a leading physician group and a leading hospital get into a battle, it's expensive. And it's because of what happens with volume, what happens to the rates, what happens with referral patterns, what happens with also administrative expenses, legal expenses, PR expenses, lobbying expenses, so you put all those together and it means that everybody is distracted and not doing as well financially.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess going back to the commentary before about centers that aren't profitable and closing or potentially at risk for closing if the rate cut was to go through as proposed. Is there any way to get a ballpark number as to how much money is actually being lost in those centers? Is it $50 million? Or is it bigger than that? Or I mean, how do we think about the relative size of that?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. And I think I know we've not disclosed that and, at least for now, won't disclose it. In some cases, it's a tricky analysis because a center that loses money is part of a broader network of centers where we're strongly affiliated with a particular physician group or hospital and so talking about the losses of a particular center in the form of an exact number is kind of tricky in exactly what would happen if you closed it. And then many other centers are just much more pure-play, independent centers that lose money. So for right now, we've not gone through the exercise of trying to segment them into the different categories. We're just focused on looking at which ones we would very sadly have to close if reimbursement made that a necessity.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe last question on a very different topic, one that we haven't talked about this couple of quarters but I just want to make sure I'm not going to be surprised by this next year. Any thoughts on exchanges now that we've gone through exchange contracting? How has that been going for you? Are you getting rates close to commercial? Is there any reason to expect any kind of disruptions as far as whether dialysis is or is not covered under the, like I said earlier, the payer part on the exchange or that the rates are substantially different than in commercial at this point?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, in general, our position is that our commercial rates are commercial rates and exchanges are commercial patients and commercial enterprises. And as to the impact of exchanges, overall, of course, you know that nobody -- anybody who forecast that with uncertainty should not be trusted. But what we said, in general, is that if you look at the number of additional insured patients we might have but weren't insured before and the rates that they will be reimbursed at versus patients that are currently reimbursed high and move to an exchange where, for some reason, because of a change in plan or something else or plan design, have a lower reimbursement rates, that the net of those 4 different vectors, we think, for us is more likely to be a negative than a positive. But that's just repeating the same thing we've said for 2 years now. And beyond that, like everyone else, we're watching what's going on in every state and don't know what's going to happen. I do think -- I appreciate the questions and we can come back to you again a little bit later in the queue, if that's okay.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich at Piper Jaffray -- I'm sorry, Bank of America.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","No, he had it right, it was Piper Jaffray. I guess just going back to HealthCare Partners, Kent, did you say in your prepared remarks that you had exited a contract? And if so, I was just wondering, is that why the membership is down sequentially? How much of an impact did that have?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, that's exactly right. The sequential decline from Q1 was because we had bad rates in one arrangement and it wasn't going to change. In fact, it was going the wrong direction and so we exited. It just didn't make sense and it's so important, as you know, to maintain rate discipline.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Will you say -- can you tell us which market that was in?","Kent J. Thiry","Don't think that's a good idea for you, for us to get into too many individual market competitive dynamics. More often than that, that can actually impair our ability to execute on our strategy and do the arrangements that you want us to as much more likely than helping us.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then I was just wondering if you'd maybe talk about the utilization trends that you saw during the quarter and kind of the puts and takes and how that impacted the HCP business.","Kent J. Thiry","Before Bob or Matthew answer that, let me just go back because I was being a little tentative in one of my answers and I now know I don't need to be that, with respect to rates and exchanges, up to this point, for health plans that want access to our network where we've agreed on them having access to our network, we've been successful in getting commercial rates. That is the dominant reality in that sphere. And then I'll go back to one thing that Justin brought up too before they answer the question, which is, parts of that -- what was a little puzzling and surprising about the ESCO announcement is that very senior people at CMS, and I mean very senior, expressed a real desire to have integrated care happen for a lot more Medicare patients in the Kidney Care program. And to get a proposal back that's so inconsistent with that was -- is a little bit puzzling, although we've got our hypotheses. But now, as to the answer to your question, I'll turn to Bob or Matthew.","Robert J. Margolis","Nothing specific to add on utilization. There is volatility as Kent described in quarter-to-quarter numbers in HealthCare Partners. In the second quarter, we had higher-than-anticipated utilization. There's a variety of reasons why that happens but I don't think it's useful to go into great detail on that. And so long-term trend, we were higher than expected with our great expectation that our coordinated care services and attention to detail will get us back on trend.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Bob, I just kind of want to follow up on that. It seems like everyplace else where -- all the other providers are really talking about lower utilization and is it really just the patient population in the markets that you guys are in, which is why you're seeing higher-than-expected utilization trends?","Robert J. Margolis","I think this was a one -- a quarterly issue. And I think, overall, our utilization trends compare very favorably with what you're seeing in the market. We did have, which ultimately we believe will be good news, significant new member growth, which Kent described in those new members often come in with deferred health care needs, which, of course, we take care of as quickly as we can. So I think that may play a part of it. I'm not going to -- as you saw, a 20% year-over-year growth in MA in our legacy markets is very substantial and hopeful signs for future margins on that patient volume.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And then just one more on dialysis, if I could. Lot's been talked about with rebasing in the proposal. But I think Jim said LeAnne is on the call and I'm just curious what the conversations are like on The Hill and DC and how the efforts are going.","Kent J. Thiry","LeAnne, take it away.","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Yes, we have been working late in the last 3 weeks with the House. And we did get a letter in support of looking fairly at reimbursement from 205 signatories, so that was very good. We're also working with the Senate Finance Committee as we did before the rule was out to take a next step in pursuing appropriate reimbursement. We're also working with some non-Senate Finance Senate members until like we are getting good education and good response to help us work appropriately with the agency. Is that responsive?","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful.","Kent J. Thiry","And LeAnne, is it -- can you go ahead and disclose -- I know the entire community is scared and communicating proportionate to that fear. Can you -- is it fair to let the group know how many emails and letters have come from the DaVita community alone to people on The Hill?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Sure. We have topped the 80,000 mark. And as Kent said, a number of the other organizations and coalitions have letter-writing campaigns and advocacy campaigns and those numbers are getting quite significant as well. So very good, uniform effort through the community.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. There's never been such pervasive fear.","Operator","And your next question comes from Matthew Borsch at Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe if you can talk about how are you working with private payers on reimbursement in that front? Are you -- I guess the question I'm asking is, are you seeing any pushback there on their effective subsidization of the dialysis program? Or is the fact that they can also see this Medicare rate update scaring them away from even trying to impact the reimbursement on the commercial side?","Kent J. Thiry","The answer is they will push back on rates as aggressively as they always have and as we would if we were in their chairs. Now having said that, the laws of gravity can't be disputed. And if we take a reimbursement cut, that means we and all sorts of dialysis providers will have to draw a different line in the sand in trading off price versus volume because you can't survive otherwise. So they will push as vigorously as they always have. However, a cut does mean that everybody has to be even stronger in their resistance to that because it's so important.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And if I could ask a question on the pipeline for HealthCare Partners. As you think about those opportunities relative to opportunities that have come up since you closed or even before you closed, and in instances where hospitals and health plans have been willing maybe to offer higher amounts than you thought was prudent for some of these physician groups where they've come up for sale, is that dynamic something that you expect to change? Do you think that there are groups that are willing to think longer term than just the immediate price that they might get and think longer term about which model will work best?","Robert J. Margolis","Well, we certainly believe so and hope so. The attractiveness, we believe, of a patient- and physician-centric clinical model is very attractive to physicians everywhere. And as you referenced, the robustness of our pipeline is not just physician groups that we are talking to but payers that would like our model to be translated into markets that they have significant market share, shared participation arrangements with hospitals that are trying to learn how to take on and manage risk. And so I think there's a much broader universe than just the relative number of physician groups up for sale, some of whom will gravitate towards highest price and some of them towards sort of cultural alignment.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And is the challenge for the company now to have the -- to build up the business development assets to be able to simultaneously go at different complicated opportunities in many different geographic markets?","Robert J. Margolis","I think that's a fair statement and why Kent referenced the significant work we're doing to build the, as he puts it, the muscles of our business development team, using a lot of the growth and knowledge and experience of our DaVita teammates, who have done these for years successfully, and the HealthCare Partner capabilities translated into coordinated and accountable care in many, many more markets where, we believe, the country is moving inexorably away from fee-for-volume to fee-for-value.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And let me just, if I could, ask a question on the integrated care pilot. And you got this question before but have you considered where you could be maybe an MA-plan sponsor yourself, not in competition with payers generally, but just for the purposes of the dialysis patients and take it on that way?","Kent J. Thiry","We would love to. There's a whole bunch of structural obstacles to our being able to do that. However, we think about it every year because we know we have such a powerful value proposition to bring to bear. It's just that there's not a clear rifle shot, nothing close to it, in terms of an ability to have that manifest itself in a commercially, reasonable and sustainable way.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew at William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Maybe a question about the dual eligibles opportunity. With some of the states delaying implementation of their programs, it does seem like California might still be moving forward. Is there any update there, plans or how that may shake out for you guys over the next year or so?","James K. Hilger","You're absolutely right. The states are all in a state of negotiation and discussion. California does seem committed to rolling out a modified dual eligible program, meaning -- modified, meaning smaller than everybody in the counties that were approved. There is still intense discussion that we're told about but not participating in between the states and CMS over how this will be reimbursed and where the responsibility will lie for certain risks. We believe we are well positioned if the revenue meets the risk to be a very active participant in the dual program in the 2 largest counties, Los Angeles and Orange County, that are going to have approximately 200,000 dually eligible patients in the program.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Interesting, okay. And so can you talk a little bit about how they may affect the 2 different sides of the business? And so specifically, in dialysis, what -- that is -- is that what you're referring to there? Or is that a separate opportunity?","Kent J. Thiry","I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","The question is how that affects the different parts of the business because if I was talking about the 200,000 patients, is -- was this specifically referring to your overall HCP business and then how would that affect, perhaps, the dialysis side?","Robert J. Margolis","So let me speak to the 200,000. That 200,000 currently fee-for-service dually eligible patients, that will be eligible and will be assigned to a managed Medicaid and presumably, a managed Medicare program. So that's where the population helps the health care partner piece potentially in the future.","Kent J. Thiry","And then on the dual side for Kidney Care, about half of our patients are duals. And so to the extent any of them become a part of other programs that are risk programs, we become a very attractive subcontractor to whoever has the global risk. Having said that, there's been a lot of talk about duals for a while and the pace at which stuff is happening is pretty slow.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. So we shouldn't expect a meaningful update there; probably some time next year, perhaps?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, we hope. They're only a couple of decisions away but you never know when they're going to be made. I think that the net for you guys is -- the good news is the long-term potential is immense and quite sustainable because there's so much waste. But predicting when they're going to actually make final decisions and implement and how much the architecture will really reflect the need to create rational incentives for people to make the big investments, predicting those 2 things is sort of a level of speculation we're not comfortable with.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe a quick question for Jim on the expense side and on the international side. It looks like you lost a fair bit less money in international this quarter even as you are investing. How should we think about that, quarterly, over the next year in terms of the losses versus what you had projected before?","James K. Hilger","Well, we still expect our international losses to be in the range of $30 million for the year, and that's assuming that we don't do any large -- start up any large programs late in the year. If we do, then those numbers may change. But that's -- we were happy to see those losses trim down to $6 million in the quarter.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then another thing on the P&L we noticed was obviously the gross margin came down but SG&A kind of came down but in a commensurate amount. Do you feel like you have a fair bit more leverage to absorb some of the volatility in HCP to the extent that, that materializes? Or how should we think about those -- that margin opportunity as things shake out?","Kent J. Thiry","I'm not clear on the question whether it's HCP or Kidney Care or consolidated.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","It's really consolidated, Kent. I mean, it's thinking through kind of the moving pieces and you missed on gross margin but you also exceeded in terms of performance on controlling costs on the SG&A side. And how controllable that is versus things that are sort of, if you will, done to you each quarter?","Kent J. Thiry","Boy, I don't know how to answer. We certainly can't move G&A down quarter-by-quarter based on a retroactive recognition of what happened on the reimbursement side and utilization side. And so first, with respect to whatever happened coincidentally this quarter, I don't think want to draw any broad conclusions from that as to our ability to juggle these things. Second, are we going to look for SG&A savings in 2014 versus '13? On both sides of the house, the answer is yes. So the -- we will not come back to you with a 0 answer on that. Just on the HCP side, it's not going to be enough to offset all the cuts. In the Kidney Care side, we don't know yet if we have a cut to offset. But certainly, the one proposed would be impossible to come anywhere close to offsetting it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Ransom at Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I think we're all in discovery mode with HealthCare Partners. I know you're not going to have great information as you said until the fall. But maybe if you look back in history, what has happened historically when your major partners, let's say, Humana and United, people like that, end up getting 5% to 7% cuts sequentially. Have you ever seen anything of that magnitude in your history? And historically, how have they acted with their downstream partners versus their benefit design? That might be helpful.","Kent J. Thiry","John, Bob and Matthew will answer. But before they do, let me just announce that I've got a conversation booked with a former government official. It's important I go do that. The rest of the team will be here to continue to take questions. And if in any instance there's a question where someone feels that my perspective is important beyond that which the team offered, we can take care of that over the next week or 2. So thank you all for your consideration and interest in us, and we will do our best here in the quarters and years to come. But now, Bob and Matthew, the question.","Robert J. Margolis","I think the quick and easy answer is that the health plans have not been faced with this type of cut in the last many years, and so they're all reacting as well. And not being a health plan executive, I can't pretend to say what they're doing in their -- inside of their offices, but I think reflecting the past comments, they are trying to assess the market position relative to their competitors and whether they're going to lose market share if they trim benefits too much versus gain market share and have lower margins if they don't. And the fact is CMS puts some limits on how much they could push these benefit changes down to the beneficiary. The good news is that in the markets we serve, there remains a considerable difference between the value proposition for MA and Medicare fee-for-service and that none of our markets even have a MA premium, for instance, where that is prevalent in some of the lower-paid markets that you might be aware of. So there is a fair amount of room to maintain growth and continue at being a good product, even if some benefit changes to the beneficiaries are in the direction that the beneficiaries would rather not see.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And my other question, Humana has said they want to have much more of their book sub-capitated than they have today. Do you see any evidence of that downstream to you? Or if so, when might you see and what would that look like exactly, do you think?","Robert J. Margolis","Well, as -- I think it's a great question and a business opportunity. As you may now, in all of our markets, we are capitated with our major health plans. So when they make that kind of comment, it's not relative to the more sophisticated organizations such as HealthCare Partners, but to other parts of the country where they've not been able to find capable risk-bearing physician organizations. And of course, that is the formula that we plan to use to offer up to accountable organizations elsewhere. So when Humana or others talk to us about new market entry, it's very specifically because of the problem that they're trying to address, which is they would like to go to capitated relationships. To align the incentives, we're recognizing in capitated relationships the incentives are to keep the patients well, healthy, delay or prevent chronic disease, avoidable admissions, readmissions and the like, whereas fee-for-service, those incentives do not exist and it's one of the main drivers of the health care cost conundrum the country faces.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor at Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. The first, I was probably hoping to get Kent's perspective but I'm sure someone else can tackle it. I guess I was hoping you can maybe reconcile the thought that negative dialysis margins are an important part of the lobbying position of the industry with respect to the proposed rebasing cuts and I think this is an important part, so I just want to understand the reconciliation. If we go -- if we look at the MedPAC report based on the last analysis they did of 2010, they showed 2.3% positive margins for the whole industry. I'd presume, because of DaVita's scale, your margins might be a little better than that and then certainly, margins improved once the bundle was implemented in 2011. So how do we get back to negative overall Medicare margins? Is the MedPAC analysis just completely flawed in your opinion?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Yes, this is LeAnne. Yes, let me take that. Hey, no, the MedPAC analysis is based on the cost reports that we file. As Kent mentioned, one of the most significant drivers of our difference is the, let's call it, uncompensated care bucket, the unreimbursed coinsurance, which is therefore also not reimbursed through the bad debt policies. And so our biggest concern about any analysis that's done by the government, whether that be MedPAC or CMS itself, is that they're presumption is that primarily that the co-pay is 100% collected and it's not.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So even net of Medicaid contribution on dual eligible, that would net out to, overall negative, including that, that's the case?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Correct, that's a fair point. There's some other costs in the cost report, which are not recognized as we take exception for. But as a vehicle of how they do analysis, they strictly maintain the cost report filing data and don't consider these other factors.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And my second question is a little bit of a cleanup from last quarter when you booked the legal reserve for the issues with respect to the physician relationships. And I've had a few clients ask the question, so I thought I might pose it here. And the question is, is it contemplated once that settlement is reached, if it's reached, that there's any material change to physician ownership percentage in the JVs? Any material change to operating practices or if this really is, perhaps, paperwork-type changes, for lack of a better characterization?","James K. Hilger","Yes. Gary, this is Jim. And those conversations are ongoing right now on the settlement. Our goal, as we said last quarter is to ensure that we have clarification and that is a level-playing field going forward. But to talk about the nature of those discussions doesn't make sense until we have clarity on that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan at RBC Capital Markets.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions, maybe not answering this specifically, but maybe just a comment about directionally, can you talk about what your commercial mix of business is? How -- which way it's trending on the dialysis side, is it increasing, decreasing or flat?","James K. Hilger","Yes, I mentioned this earlier in my prepared remarks. This is Jim Hilger, Frank. Our commercial mix in the quarter improved slightly.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Secondly, on -- in terms of -- if there is a need to close centers as a result, let's just say, worst-case scenario, this proposed rule stands, is there anything, any type of -- what would be the characteristics of the centers you'd be more likely to close? I mean, are these that are presumably losing more money? Are they -- is it smaller markets, larger markets? Is there anything that we could look for in terms of those centers that might be closed?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Yes, this is LeAnne. The commonality of those facilities are that they are high Medicare, Medicaid share. So that could be a very inner city units and it can be the very rural units. Both of those frequently do not have sufficient private pay patients to cross-subsidize the Medicare shortfall.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So will there be a priority of one over the other in terms of the magnitude of wealth, albeit versus inner city versus rural?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","No. I think they're both on the list and each center will be evaluated independently.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dana Nenton [ph] at Deutsche Bank.","Unknown Analyst","Just wanted to clarify something from earlier, was the earn-out adjustment from the original HCP deal or were there any other subsequent deals in there?","James K. Hilger","No, that earn-out adjustment that we called out in our earnings release in our call today was related to the HCP acquisition, which closed in November of 2012, and just to make sure I got my numbers right, because I may have just supposed a number in there, we had initially recorded a fair value of approximately $125 million through our purchase accounting of HCP in that transaction. And that -- we have adjusted that by $57 million and are now -- the fair value that we are placing on that earn-out obligation is approximately $69 million.","And I believe --","Jim Gustafson","Yes, I'm going to say, I believe that's the last of the questions in the queue. So again, I want to thank everybody for your interest in the company. And as Kent always says, we will strive to continue to do well with your money over the next quarter and look forward to talking to you in the future. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"7290":["DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to DaVita's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference.","Jim Gustafson","Thank you Colene and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today in the room are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer, and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","Please note that during this call we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our fourth quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. ","Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent Thiry","Thank you, Jim. As you probably already noted, we had solid fourth quarter results that were consistent with prior communications and of course J.R. and Joel will discuss those in greater detail a little bit downstream. But we are first and foremost a caregiving company and so as usual we will start by talking about a clinical highlight today, Antibiotic Stewardship. ","As many of you know, dialysis patients are highly prone to infections. We have continued to get better at supporting evidenced based prescribing of antibiotics, which has a couple of benefits, including reducing harm to patients from excessive antibiotic use and also preventing the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. This is something that all caregivers should be doing across American and Global Health Care and we are proud that we are getting better.","In fact in 2018, among patients with symptoms of Blood Stream Infections, we actually decreased IV antibiotics starts by 12% while maintaining all clinical quality. This is important not only in terms of what we did this year, but we continue to collect data to improve our ability to do even better in the future. ","Now, a quick update on the DMG transaction. We are working closely with Optum to obtain FTC approval, which of course is necessary. The timing of the process was very negatively impacted by the government shutdown as it was for so many other transactions and we cannot speak definitively to the timing for all the reasons we haven't been able to do that up to this point and all the same reasons that other companies involved in other transactions cannot. But everybody's working very diligently to move that ball forward. ","In addition, some good news is that in 2019 the DMG Financial performance will improve \u2013 is expected to improve significantly. There are a number of very tangible reasons for this. One for example is significantly better Medicare advantage rates than in prior years; number two, the elimination of the health insurer fees, a dollar for dollar significant pick up; number three, the dollar for dollar elimination of considerable consulting expenses incurred in 2018 that will be gone in 2019; and fourth, the number of operating improvements, investments that we made in prior years that are bearing fruit. So the net is that 2019 DMG would be significantly better as is expected to be significantly better than 2018. ","Now over to Javier for a summary of our Kidney Care business. ","Javier Rodriguez ","Thank you, Kent and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll cover two topics. First, I'll provide a recap of our financial performance, and second, I will discuss the legislation recently introduced in California. ","For the fourth quarter 2018 our results are in line with our guidance. Adjusted operating income was $370 million for the quarter and $1.513 billion for the full year. Our 2018 operating cash flow from continuing operations also came in line with guidance at $1.48 billion. ","Related to cash flows, our 2018 CapEx spend came in better than our guidance and we are guiding to a lower spent in 2019. There are several drivers to this declining CapEx spend, two of which are worth calling out as they should decrease the CapEx spend on new centers in the next couple of years. ","First, we continue to focus on driving the right modality for our patient. For many of them dialyzing at home may be the best option. Now that we have a more secure supply on PD products, we anticipate more patients will be able to choose home dialysis. In fact, in 2018 we trained and educated over 13,000 new home patients. As you know, home growth has an incremental benefit of being more capital efficient. ","Second, as we mentioned earlier this year, some recent data suggests that ESRD industry growth may be slowing, but we don\u2019t know whether this is a short term impact of increased transplantation availability or whether there is a long term implication in the immediate term we plan to build fewer centers to keep pace with patient demand. ","Next, as many of you know Q4 includes open enrollment decisions for many of our patients. Overall we observe stable results from open enrollment, which is consistent with our expectations. In the individual markets in particular, we saw slightly higher reenrollment than we experienced over the last couple of years. We believe that these results set us up to deliver on 2019 guidance we shared last month, which Joel will cover later. ","Now, let me transition to a legislative update in California. A member of the assembly has reintroduced effectively the same legislation at last year's SB 1156, which was vetoed by the Governor because of the potential harm to patients. This new bill, AB 290, seeks to impose rate cuts on dialysis providers for their support of premium assistance charities and impose restrictions on charitable premium assistance for patients with pre-existing conditions and end-stage renal disease. Our coalition of dialysis patients, physicians and caregivers in California will of course fight to defeat this conceived bill. ","Finally, let me finish by saying that we continue to build our integrated care capabilities, which are helping us care for patients in a more holistic way. Let me provide a couple of examples; first, we developed a predictive model that incorporates lab data, dialysis, treatment data and claims data to determine which patients are at the highest risk of hospitalization over the following month. Second, we now have a team of nurse practitioners dedicated to addressing a broad range of primary care needs on a more real time basis for our patients. ","We believe that these capabilities will improve the quality of life of our patients, while reducing costs to the system, and of course we look forward to providing this coordinated care to many more patients in the future. ","So in summary, overall solid quarter and we continue to focus on delivering high quality care for our patients.","Now, on to Joel for financial details on our results. ","Joel Ackerman ","Thanks Javier. Let me walk you through some components of our U.S. Dialysis and Lab Segment. First, growth; our treatment per day growth in Q4 was 3.1% and normalized non acquired growth was 2.6% as we continue to see a decline in volume growth. We continue to expect non-acquired growth to range between 2.5% and 3.5% in 2019. ","Next on revenue; revenue per treatment was down $0.65 from Q3 to Q4. If you exclude the impact of calcimimetics, revenue was up a little more than $1 per treatment sequentially. To give some perspective on this for the full year, commercial RPT for the year was down approximately 1% as we shifted out of network business to in network, which offset commercial rate increases that we've achieved across much of the portfolio. ","For the year commercial mix was down approximately 10 basis points from 10.5% in 2017 to 10.4% in 2018. We believe that our decline in mix was consistent with the demographic headwind that we have previously outlined. ","Finally on revenue, our strategic initiative revenue was negatively impacted by our previously announced wind down of DaVita Rx. DaVita Rx revenue was down approximately $100 million quarter-over-quarter and Q4 is reflective of the go-forward run rate. ","On costs, patient care cost per treatment was up $1.26 quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to an increase in professional fees. Dialysis and Lab Segment G&A was down quarter-over-quarter approximately $4 per treatment, $2 driven by a decrease in advocacy spend and the remainder due to normal quarterly spending fluctuations. ","For international, we achieved a slightly positive adjusted operating profit for the quarter, excluding the FX impact of our joint venture in Asia. We expect positive operating income from international operations in 2019, excluding any FX impacts, which are incorporated in our enterprise guidance. For the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations was 24.3% and for the year it was 29.2%. ","The effective tax rate was unusually low for Q4 as a result of the positive quarterly true-ups for our federal, state and international accruals. It\u2019s unusual that all of these moved in the same direction in one quarter. ","Now on to cash flow. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $307 million for the quarter and $1.48 billion for the year, in line with our previous guidance. I'll conclude by reiterating our 2019 guidance. We expect operating income to be between $1.54 billion and $1.64 billion. As a reminder, the first quarter had seasonally low operating income as the quarter is shorter with 76.6 treatment days, meaning lower treatment volumes and fewer treatments over which to absorb the fixed costs. Also Q1 has higher seasonal payroll tax. ","Our 2019 guidance includes the following expectations; 3% to 4% U.S. total treatment volume growth. 0% to 1% U.S. revenue per treatment growth and 0.5% to 1.5% U.S. cost per treatment growth. ","We are initiating 2019 guidance for operating cash flow from continuing operations for the year to be $1.375 billion to $1.575 billion. In 2019 we expect $800 million to $840 million in CapEx from continuing operations. ","This range includes CapEx for self-developed real-estate projects that are offset by proceeds from the subsequent sale leaseback transactions. We expect approximately $100 million of proceeds from self-developed projects in 2019 leading to net spend of approximately $720 million at the midpoint. ","For comparison purposes, in 2018 our CapEx from continuing operations was $902 million and we received proceeds from sale leaseback transactions of $45 million for a net of $857 million. You can see the historical detail in section six of our supplemental financial data in our earnings release. ","Finally, we expect our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations to be 28.5% to 29.5%. As always, our guidance captures a majority of probabilistic outcomes, although there are scenarios in which we could end up above or below the estimates provided.","Now I'll turn it over to Kent for some closing remarks. ","Kent Thiry ","I like to just make a few comments for: Number one, please be reminded that the next few years Medicare year-over-year fee for service rate increases will be better than the almost zero increases over the last few years. ","Second, the international business now has a foundation on which we can expect year-over-year or like contributions rather than offsets. ","Number three, we continue to generate strong cash flows and they are fact incrementally better than some of the prior years. ","And four, we are very well positioned to be a differentiated high value added provider integrated care for these needy and expensive patients. ","Operator, lets switch to Q&A please. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck, Bank of America. Your line is now open. ","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, thanks. I guess we want to start of with DMG as a question. I appreciate if you can\u2019t say exactly when it\u2019s going to close, but I didn\u2019t see your comment review that you are still confident that it\u2019s going to close. Just want to make sure that from your perspective everything is still on track and it's just a matter of timing at this point. ","Kent Thiry","Yeah. ","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, great. And then I wanted to talk a little more about the slowdown in growth that you are seeing and expecting from a treatment perspective. I missed, I think you mentioned something about factors that may or may not be temporary. Can you talk a little bit about what those factors are and if there is anything else that you are thinking about or thinking about what organic growth should look like? ","Javier Rodriguez","Yeah, thanks Kevin. This is Javier. We started to see a bit of a slow down on new starts in the back end of the year and that's why when we provided guidance, you saw the number came down to 2.5 to 3.5 of non-acquired growth. Some of the factors that are still in play are what's happening upstream with other comorbid conditions and how that is impacting, how many patients have ESRD, and another dynamic is how many organs are gone into that transplant pool, as the number of organs has picked up due to the opioid crisis with many people being young and having healthy kidneys. So there is a lot inter played, many dynamic upstream and so we are trying to see if they are short term or if they are going to be longer term. ","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, from your perspective, the new starts that you are doing over the next year, is that going to position you for inline industry growth, market share gains, market share loses, how are you thinking about that?","Javier Rodriguez","I\u2019m sorry, are you asking how we are positioned within that growth? Is that the question?","Kevin Fischbeck","Yeah, your guidance of 2.5% to 3.5%, does that mean that you expect to gain share or are you going along with what you think the market overall should be growing. ","Javier Rodriguez","Yeah, in the last couple of years, actually not the last couple of years, maybe the last couple of decades we've outperformed a non-acquired growth. We believe that there's nothing in the data that would say that we would not do that and so right now we are just looking more at the market dynamics overall. ","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, and then maybe a last question for now. On the commercial mix, I think you said that you know mix was down 10 basis points year-over-year in line with kind of what you would expect in all demographic trends to kind of argue for. But I think your guidance assumes that actually mix will be relatively flat. So I\u2019m not sure if the demographics point to a decline each year, how you're thinking about being flat you know in 2019? ","Joel Ackerman ","So Kevin, its Joel here. The demographics are certainly a headwind, about 10 basis points a year. We see opportunities to offset the headwind through upstream, education of patients, as well as helping them with their insurance once they\u2019ve come on dialysis. So we see opportunities to offset the headwind, but we do see the headwind persisting. ","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, alright great. Thank you. ","Kent Thiry","Thank you, Kevin. ","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from that Justin Lake, Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. ","Justin Lake","Thanks, good morning. First, let me follow up on Kevin's question around the deal close. I understand the government shut down and delayed everything, but the last thing you had talked about was expecting the deal to close in the first quarter. ","So with the government shut down about 30 days, you know that would take us out to end of April. Is that still kind of where you would expect or do you feel like the first quarter, even ex the government shutdown, you know things have changed? ","Joel Ackerman ","Yeah, so Kevin its Joel here. We are certainly still trying for Q1, that is a real possibility, but the government shutdown has certainly lowered the odds of that happening. ","Justin Lake","Is there anything new besides the shutdown that would change that trajectory?","Kent Thiry","Justin, there is always a lot going on and [Audio Gap] nothing new would suggest that nobody's doing any work, nobody's asking any questions. But Joel\u2019s answer still applies, were we are hired with a goal that he cited. ","Justin Lake","No problem. And then on the California legislation, just given this is the second time they are coming here and they've got a Governor that you know might be more likely to actually sign this legislation if it gets past. Curious if you can help us, you know put a range around the potential financial impact that we should think about for 2020 if this legislation does pass. ","Kent Thiry","Yeah Justin, as you can imagine the legislation moves and there's different ways to interpret and of course you can never predict how it'll play out, but to try and be constructive and give you a range, I think it would be useful to have somewhere in that $25 million to $40 million as a range. ","Justin Lake","That is helpful. I will jump back in the queue. Thanks guys. ","Kent Thiry","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tanal, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. ","Steve Tanal","Thank you guys, good morning. I guess just on the slower normalized, non-acquire treatment growth in the quarter at 2.6, is any of that attributable to pick-up in home dialysis or is that capturing that? ","Kent Thiry","That is captured in there; the home growth is in the 2.6. ","Steve Tanal","Got it, okay. And how are you thinking about home hemo. It\u2019s just a comment of sort of growing in the home and making that more available. Is that \u2013 that\u2019s sort of the new technology in the market. Are you guys planning for growth in that business or how should we think about that? ","Kent Thiry","We\u2019ve been leading in home for as long as I can remember and we will continue to do what's appropriate for the patient and the right modality for each patient, so we of course assess technologies. There is a lot of talk of innovation, but if you really look carefully there's a lot of smoke in that innovation. It really is a lot of the same, and people are just trying to talk up their products. But we of course love it when there's something that's good for the patients and we will pursue whatever is best for them. ","Steve Tanal","Okay, got it. Then just on the slower De Novos, can you give us a sense for what you are planning for \u201919 and how you are thinking about sort of the number of opening of longer term at this point. ","Kent Thiry","Sure. So I\u2019ll preface the answer by highlighting the fact that there is a lag between the slowing of growth and the slowing of the De Novos. De Novos that are coming on now are decisions that were made, they are leases that were signed a year or two ago. So with that said, we are looking at a significant slowdown in De Novos in 2019 and we think that will continue going forward. I\u2019ll highlight that it's a function of two things. One, it\u2019s a function of the slowing NAG; it's also a function of the growing home. And you know as more and more patients are dialyzing at home, our need for the traditional in-center dialysis, De Novos, comes down. ","Steve Tanal","Understood, okay, got it. And then just lastly from me, just on the RPT side in calcimimetics, I think you had mentioned it was a $1 sort of headwind sequentially. Is that sort of calcimimetics in total added about $17. I think it was $18 in Q3 if I recall correctly? ","Kent Thiry","Yeah, that's about right.","Steve Tanal","Got it, okay, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you, Steve. And our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ","Pito Chickering","Good morning guys and thanks for taking my question. Two questions, first one of the review per treatment. You talked about bringing more revenues from outer network to in network. We sort of estimated about 3.4% of revenues now, out network for your book of business. Is that in the ballpark or can you talk about that?","Kent Thiry","I think that question has been asked for many years and I think we are not going to change our stance today to give more clarity on that. We try to be as useful as we could in January to provide some of the trends over the long haul and Kent talked about sort of a nine year trajectory of that number coming down, and I think that's as much as we can do right now. ","Pito Chickering","Right, fair enough. And then on the weaker growth in the quarter, can you sort of talk about any impact from wildfires or weather and then because it\u2019s sort of varied so much in fourth quarter versus what we saw through the rest of the year, is there any way of getting us any sort of monthly numbers, just so we can get a better feel for sort of what was the core growth rate and also the way you guys exited January. ","Kent Thiry","Yeah, so nothing to point out relating to wildfires or any sort of one time stuff like that. In terms of monthly numbers, I don't think we are going to go to that level of granularity. ","Pito Chickering","Okay, fair enough. And then last question from a leverage perspective. As the DMG business hopefully gets sold, I think by the next three years, what\u2019s the right leverage ratio we should think about you guys running? ","Kent Thiry","No real change to our thinking around that. 3 to 3.5 times is the range we expect to generally be in, although we have gone above that for a variety of reasons. Obviously we are well above that right now. But I think the 3 to 3.5 times is still the range to think about. ","Pito Chickering","Great. Thank you so much. ","Operator","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Healy with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Patrick Healy","Hey, good morning, thanks for taking the question. You mentioned in the past that as an industry you\u2019d be looking to introduce some proactive legislation in California. Can you just provide some color on what that legislation might look to do? ","Kent Thiry","Yes, thank you Patrick. Of course, we are trying to make sure that we educate the legislators to understand all the dynamics that are going on in an ecosystem that is not something that they normally are discussing. And so in our legislation what we want to make sure is that whatever guardrails are needed so that everybody understands that the right patient that have continuity of care are getting access to charitable premium assistance, and so it's clarity on that is what we are trying to do as opposed to the bill now, which goes beyond that. ","Patrick Healy","Got it, and the other thing is Kent I've heard you speak recently about desire to get more involved with the pre-dialysis CKD population. Any color on what kind of investment you may look to make there? Why you think there is opportunity for DaVita and just something that could better enable you to provide integrated care once patients are you know transitioning on to dialysis and you know better address the cost of the patients outside the clinic. Just any color around that would be helpful? Thanks. ","Kent Thiry","We will be able to add significant, really impressive clinical and economic value if we're allowed to move upstream and help take care of people who have kidney disease, but have not yet experienced kidney failure. ","And by intervening with those patients, in different ways we\u2019ll be able to delay the onset of dialysis and in some cases prevent it, and then not only delaying it, but also having people be healthier and have a healthier start to their dialysis. All of these improvements have big clinical and economic implications, but there's a bunch of regulatory work to be done, as well as contracting work to get there, and we are making some nice incremental progress, nothing to bake into any forecast yet, but we're working hard. ","Patrick Healy","Got it, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Ransom, Raymond James. Your lien is now open. ","John Ransom","Hi, good morning, I went back and looked at some of the qualitative comments about commercial contracting all of last year and it seems like we ended up in a place in 2019 that was a bit below at least what I was expecting. So was the thought that you would always end up here or did we get some kind of late breaking news that caused the needle to move. ","Kent Thiry","John, obviously I don't know what\u2019s in your assumptions, but it came in line with what we were seeing and of course on any given time there's pluses and minuses. But for the year it was in line with what we expected. ","John Ransom","I was just simply talking about the five to six large contracts being redone and you are pleased with the increases and I guess I was thinking zero to one wouldn't be what should be shooting for, but that's what I was referring to. Okay, that's it for me. Thank you. ","Kent Thiry","Thank you. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Gary Taylor of J. P. Morgan. Your line is now open. ","Gary Taylor","Hey, good morning, just a few quick ones. For 2019, is the expected advocacy spend still in the $30 million range? ","Kent Thiry","Gary, that is the additional spend from our regular advocacy spend, yes. ","Gary Taylor","Okay, that compares to the 93 extra last year, right? ","Kent Thiry","Correct. ","Gary Taylor","And then I just want to make sure I understood in response to Justin's question on the California legislation, the equivalent of 1156. So you are saying if every CPA patient in California moved to the Medicare rate, it would be a $25 million to $40 million revenue in OI hits or there is some offset between revenue and OI? ","Kent Thiry","I\u2019m glad you are asking it Gary, because basically we didn't provide much detail because there are so many assumptions that go into it around a lot of dynamics and so what we are trying to do is just be useful and give you the top line, which is basically there is a range of $25 million to $40 million, but we are not going into specific dynamics. ","Gary Taylor","And that would be every CPA patient going to Medicare, right? ","Kent Thiry","Like I said, patience and the way the system will work is yet to be seen. So it\u2019s probably not good to assume anything, rather be constructive and give you the range of all of the dynamics going in there. ","Gary Taylor","Okay, last one is for CapEx can you tell us and I apologize if it is on that last page, but CapEx for new centers in 2018 and what you think that looks like for 2019 and in 2020. Just if you talked about your new center openings, I was trying to get a sense of the impact on annual CapEx there. ","Kent Thiry","Gary, so we can't give you a specific number. There's a range built into that as we watch over the course of the year exactly how many De Novos get built, where they get built, what the cost per De Novo is. But it is safe to assume part of that significant decline from 2018 to 2019 will be the result of fewer De Novos getting built. ","But let me jump in and just correct something I said before. There was a question about calcimimetics RPT and I think what I confirmed was a number of $17 just to be clear. $17 was the number for the year, the number in Q4 was about $16 of RPT. ","Gary Taylor","That's it for me. Thank you. ","Kent Thiry","Thank you. ","Joel Ackerman","Thanks Gary.","Operator","And our next question comes from Whit Mayo, UBS. Your line is now open. ","Q - Whit Mayo","","Hey, thanks. On the commercial book, how much of your contract or how much of your book is set to reset in 2019. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of you know what your expectation is for renewals in 2019 and what the expectation is for revenue for treatment. Thanks. ","A - Kent Thiry","Thanks Whit. We don't disclose how many contracts are up on any given year and so I can't give you that. What we guided to at JPM was that the commercial book would be down 1% to up 0.5%. ","Q - Whit Mayo","","For 2019?","Kent Thiry","Correct.","Q - Whit Mayo","","Okay, looking at the deceleration in treatment growth, I know that we are all you know speculating and guessing on a lot of the contributing factors, whether it\u2019s better insurance management transplants or whatever. But have you been able to size maybe internally what do you think some of these contributing headwinds are, just to maybe help frame up for us how to get from Point A to Point B? ","A - Joel Ackerman","Yeah Whit, so we spend a lot of time on that. It's challenging because the data bounces around and a lot of the data we are using comes on a really long lag. So how to assess kind of current numbers is more challenging than we like. So I don't think we can be particularly helpful in trying to break down how this \u2013 how the deceleration comes about from the different components. ","Q - Whit Mayo","","I think we're all trying to do the same exercise. Looking at G&A in the fourth quarter, if we exclude the $30 million of advocacy costs in California, it would have been around $180 million and I know that there are quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, but it still stands up a little bit lower than I would have expected and I guess I'm just trying to think about the starting point into 2019. Is this the new run rate? You know just any color to put the G&A trend for this year into perspective. ","Kent Thiry","Yeah, it is \u2013 it does bounce around as you pointed out. I don't think there's anything major that we would call out for Q4 or in the year-over-year numbers, so roughly flattish would be a reasonable expectation for 2019, and that's on a per treatment basis. ","Q - Whit Mayo","","On a per treatment? Maybe two other quick ones and I don't know if you\u2019ve disclosed this metric before, but any idea how much of your total treatment mix is Medicare advantage today or you know maybe another way to get a more responsive answer is like I think CMS is five, the industry around 20% of total treatments. Any reason that you\u2019d be you know different one way or the other and I guess I'm trying to sort of gain some insight into 2021 and maybe where you think that that mix can go over time? ","Joel Ackerman","Yeah, thank you. We have not disclosed our MA mix and we're not going to disclose our MA mix, but as you try and look out at what happens into the future, it's difficult to predict, because as you can imagine individual\u2019s will make their own decisions. But maybe one reasonable assumption could be that it's in line with the overall market, which is around 35%. ","But as you know, individual decisions, there's going to be a consideration on co-pays and deductibles and out of pocket and coordination of care. They are going to try and see if physicians are in their network, etcetera. So to try and guess that on a total population is hard, so we of course have done some modeling and right now a reasonable assumption is it'll be in line with the overall market. ","Q - Whit Mayo","","Okay, thank you and just one last one. Joel, you decided to increase professional fees. Any more color there? Thanks. ","Joel Ackerman","Really nothing interesting there. Some legal stuff is probably the biggest component of that, but really it\u2019s just kind of normal fluctuations up and down. ","Q - Whit Mayo","","And that\u2019s in \u2013 is your professional fees, is that flowing through G&A?","Kent Thiry","No.","Q - Whit Mayo","","It\u2019s in your \u2013 it\u2019s in the cost number, patient care. ","Kent Thiry","Well, it\u2019s in both. I think my recollection, and I'll get an answer for you in a second is that most of the swing up is in the patient care side. ","Q - Whit Mayo","","Okay. So nothing in the ancillary segment that would be allocated? ","Kent Thiry","No. ","Q - Whit Mayo","","Okay, thanks guys. ","Kent Thiry","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Gate for Gates Capital. Your line is now open. ","Jeff Gate ","Yeah, I'm looking at the U.S. dialysis segment margins and if I exclude the so called incremental advocacy costs and if I exclude the calcimimetics \u2013 however you pronounce it, revenue, and then if I moved $25 million per quarter out of 2017 numbers. If I added back because of the, we\u2019re moving the 401 K benefit, I'm showing that underlying comparable U.S. dialysis margin was actually up for the year and I just wanted to confirm that that math was approximately correct. ","Kent Thiry","Yeah, I'd suggest we kind of take this offline. I'd be happy to walk it through with you. I'm not 100% following your math. So why don't you reach out to Jim Gustafson and we\u2019ll follow-up on this.","Jeff Gate ","Okay.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Justin Lake, Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. ","Justin Lake ","Thanks for taking another question, I just got a few more here. Commercial price, so just trying to come at this another way, you said 60% of the outlier water rates have normalized over nine years. Maybe you could tell us how much more normalization you are kind of assuming for 2019. Kind of where would we end this year at? ","Kent Thiry","Alright, Justin I just think talking about it year by year, it is just not reflective of reality, which is why we gave you the long term data. We pledged many years ago to work down the outlier part of the book in a constructive way and in some cases that can be easy-peasy. You got a payer that\u2019s got some really high rates and some really low rates and so you move everything to the middle on sort of a net neutrality basis. ","In other cases it's not so simple, but that's what we said at the historical data is, so that people know that over a period of many years it has not lead to any material disruption, although there have been give good quarters and bad quarters and good years and bad years, and it's quite unpredictable. And so once again we give you the empirical data, so you can see that it is relatively predictable over the long term, but not over the short term. ","So guessing and giving you a guess on a single year, we just think could be really a lot more noise than data. We do however are commit to our belief that over the next five, six, seven years, this trend towards fewer outliers will continue and there'll be some bumps that are positive and some bumps that are negative along the way, but it shouldn't be anything fundamental. ","Justin Lake ","Right. I guess you know I'm sure you can understand, investors are trying to figure out the potential impact and you know this year there was \u2013 you know you have zero kind of built in for commercial rate growth give or take. So you know given you normally get increases in contractors as you said, we\u2019re just trying to figure out like is this a nor \u2013 is this what we should consider a normal year over the next five to six that you talked about or is this a you know a bigger year of these outlier rates moving to normal. ","Kent Thiry","Yeah, I don't think we can say. We put a lot of work into giving the guidance for this year, we're going to put a lot of work into providing the three year outlook at our upcoming capital markets in 2019, but I\u2019m just spontaneously trying to figure out where in that the word normal applies to that particular number in the particular year of 2019. I don't think I want to say \u2013 we don't want to say either yes or no to what exactly is normal. Hopefully we really helped you understand that. ","Clearly there's some offsets in \u201819 that are offsetting the fact that in a lot of our books we're getting nice rate increases. So that is going on and we've done our best job at calibrating it for you, but I wouldn't want to characterize it as either normal or abnormal. If you look over the next, the last eight, nine years, it\u2019s not an outlier, it's just a tough year. ","Justin Lake ","Okay, and then just switching over to volume, you know obviously you've got a ton of medical directors who are nephrologists and I assume they are seeing upstream, their pre-ESRD patients, and so I'm curious what they are telling you in terms of this slowdown in you know patient growth. Are they saying that you know people are taking longer to you know \u2013 if they are able to prevent the kidneys from fully failing, so that's why it\u2019s slowing or are they seeing an actual slowdown in growth in pre-ESRD. I would have assumed that would be something that you would be able to you know see coming from a pretty long distance. ","Kent Thiry","It's a fair question and as you know there's a wide distribution of sophistication of the way that the practices are ran from very small practices to large practices. With the people that I'm talking to Justin, they have not seen their CKD practice slowdown in any significant way, but one can never put too much stake in that, because the reality is that many of these practitioners are not that sophisticated that their practice is busy and they don't segment, as well as a sort of a Fortune 500 would. But at the end of the day there's nothing that they are picking out. ","A - Joel Ackerman","And Justin, it\u2019s worth throwing out a few numbers to help explain why JR\u2019s answer is the appropriate one. You just take a typical mythology group and say there's three doctors and say they've got 100 dialysis patients each, that\u2019s 300, and then there's a 13% mortality rate let's say. So that's 39 patients to replace the ones that passed away. And then you have 3% growth and so you add another nine patients on, and so you\u2019re talking about 48 new patients per year spread across three doctors. ","When you have a 1% change in the organic population, you are talking about two patients difference over the course of an entire year and settle up whether or not a group has 48 new patients or whatever number spread across 12 months or 50 or 46, that is not something a practice can notice, because year-by-year they are going to have those fluctuations. It\u2019s not going to have anything to do with the aggregate CKD incidence or advancement and so that's why JR\u2019s answer to the practice wouldn't pick up on this, unless it was way, way, way more than 1%. ","For us in aggregate and for you we pay a lot of attention to 1%, because there's some incremental EPS math attached to it, but it's highly, highly incremental and not discernible at the practice level with rare exceptions. ","Justin Lake ","Okay. Just a few other numbers questions here. You mention international as getting to profitability. Can you give us any kind of trajectory there, maybe a margin kind of target over the next few years that we think, you know you think would be a reasonable range to think about where this business can operate. ","Kent Thiry","Yeah Justin, we're not going to \u2013 we're no longer going to call out specific guidance for international. We will continue to report on it every quarter, but given the magnitude in the context of the whole company, we don't think guiding on it as a specific number is something we're going to do. ","Joel Ackerman","But we will add just to try to be a little responsive without going into misleading details there. We've had three consecutive years of improving the EBITDA margin by 2% per year. So just to give you a sense of the incremental operating improvements and mix improvements, so things are moving in the right direction, we can say that right now. ","Justin Lake ","Okay, but no even target margins? ","A - Kent Thiry","I don't think that would be a good idea right now given the different country mix. It\u2019s heavily influenced by which countries grow the most and sometimes you might have a lower margin country, but in fact it's got higher return on capital and so it \u2013 I don't think \u2013 it wouldn't yet be a useful number for you Justin. ","Justin Lake ","Okay, and then two more here. The CapEx, you know that\u2019s before where your CapEx can go and Joel you said CapEx couldn't you know materially decline over you know some period of your time if your De Novo\u2019s moderate. Can you give us an idea of what kind of you know \u2013 you know if you had to look today and obviously this takes years to kind of play out because of how far you have to plan them ahead, but two or three years from now, given the growth you are seeing in the business, what kind of CapEx moderation do you think can happen here from that net you know seven and change number that you are reporting for this year. ","Joel Ackerman","It's hard to predict Justin. We're just not in a position right now to give kind of multiyear guidance on this. It will depend on a bunch of things, including growth and depending on what happened to the growth, whether this decline is temporary or not, as well as what happens to home penetration and other things. There can be some real impact on that number, but we are not in a position to give longer term guide. ","Justin Lake ","No, I apologize, but I thought you said it was material. You know it could be a material decline if the growth continues and you continue moving towards home, which it sounds like you are trying to, so I\u2019m just trying to get some order of magnitude. I understand if it were to re-accelerate you\u2019d have to spend more money. But just at this growth rate, in both of those factors, where do you \u2013 you know what would you call material? ","Kent Thiry","Yeah, we're not in a position to quantify what exactly that would mean right now. ","Justin Lake ","Okay, last one on Medicare advantage. I know to which question you \u2013 it was helpful to say that you \u2013 that you think you can get to an industry average over time in Medicare advantage penetration. But obviously the starting point is pretty important and I just recollect you guys having said 10% to 15%. That was kind of the range of where you were today. Am I wrong in picking that number up? ","A - Kent Thiry","We're looking around the table Justin and no one remembers ever having shared that number, which is not to say it didn't happen, but there's just a bunch of blank stares across the table. ","Justin Lake ","Okay well, then I'll come out with a different way. You know obviously we\u2019ve talked about this being a potential meaningful positive. To get in getting the 35%, 40% where the industry is going to be a few years from now, it obviously could be significant, but not understanding where the starting point is. There's no way to say whether that\u2019s even going to be a benefit or not, unless we understand the starting point. Is there any way you can give us you know even a round number, 10%, 20%, 30% of where you are today? ","A - Kent Thiry","Yeah, hey Justin, I want to predict this, because we weren't prepared to do that for today but you are making a fair point. So this is obviously a multiyear issue and we do expect our MA to grow in a non-trivial way and it's going to be great for patients and we think great for the system, because it will also bring down total cost. But none of that is responsive to the specific starting point question. So if you just let us not make a spontaneous decision here, instead think about it and then maybe next quarter we'll provide that number. ","Justin Lake ","I appreciate it. Thanks for all the questions.","A - Kent Thiry","Yeah, thanks Justin. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","John Ransom ","Hi, let me just go back one more time on something. So you mentioned wanting to get more involved in pre-CSRD and it would involve some contracting. Is it you know the commercial payer has only been on the hook for 18 months and then Medicare being kind of slow. Are we talking probably the Medicare advantage payers would be most receptive to do some different type of contracting that would actually incentivize you to keep people from crashing into dialysis or nothing about that long? ","Kent Thiry","No, you are thinking about it correctly. You were already doing that work with some payers and both they and we believe were having quite an impact clinically and economically and so we would expect that to increase over time. However, right now there's not math associated with it that's exciting enough for you to bake it into any near term forecast. Hopefully the future rolls on and we get better and better at it and have more data to prove how good we are at it, it'll be more relevant to your model. ","John Ransom ","And is this part of the tuition from DMG or does this accelerate your learning curve in some of these risk based types of contracts. ","Kent Thiry","Yes, there was some very good learning in both directions where DaVita Kidney Care was able to help DaVita medical group do better on kidney care patients, both dialysis and pre-dialysis and similarly DMG was able to help DaVita kidney care do better at managing down the total cost, and managing the economics of our dialysis patients. So it was a good, mutual, and it continues to be a good, mutual learning highway. ","John Ransom ","The other question I had is our D.C. BC folks think that CMMI might do some different payment structures for home dialysis. So two questions; one, are you hearing any of that, number one; and then number two. Let's just waive a wand for example and say three years from now you've got a set of 12% of your patients, let's say it's 25%. How do you think about that at a high level from a return on capital or contribution margin total economic today across. Thanks. ","A - Kent Thiry","Yeah, I'll take a stab at it. Number one, CMMI is looking at a bunch of kidney care stuff, including eliminating some of the obstacles to home and PD growth and we are supporters of that and we're on regular constructive conversations with them about the best way to do it. We've had a series of meetings. We've also talked with other people and so we applaud a bunch of the stuff that they are looking at, and hope that they go ahead and put it in. I think there's a good chance that they will. ","And then second, if you waive that wand, that is a good world in a couple of different ways. One, it just significantly reduces the capital intensity of our business. Number two, there are some patients in America who would be happier or healthier on home that are not on it today, because of local practice patterns, nephrology group preferences, etcetera, and we've been growing homes steadily. ","Javier referred to the fact that we've been the leader for a long time in this and intend to remain the leader, but that doesn't mean that every single patient that should be on home or might be happier at home, is on it now. And so implication number one is that a step outside of capital intensity excuse me would be happier and in some cases healthier patients. ","Having said all of that, that right now when people walk around saying that home is almost uniformly a better form of care for dialysis patients, it\u2019s factually incorrect and so for a lot of patients it leads to a better life. For a subset of patients it leads to better clinical outcomes, but not for everyone and what you tend to have is that the type of people who take the initiative and have the desire to dialyze at home are a fundamentally different type of patient on average than those who stay in the center. ","So it's very, very difficult to do an apples-to-apples clinical comparison, because of the type of population you have that is willing to take on the burden and responsibility and risk of dialyzing at home. ","John Ransom ","So thanks for that and last one for me. Just at a very high level for home, how much of the relatively minor mix in your opinion is qualitative factors around physician practice patterns versus quantitative and clinical factors? ","A - Kent Thiry","Could you say the question again please? ","John Ransom ","Probably not, but I'll try. So what we have been told is that some of the shortfall and the growth has been kind of tiny, 20, 30 bips a year. What we've been told is that some of that is just physicians, not being trained physicians, not being in the rhythm of thinking about home and just the default answer is the clinic. You know whereas others, you know some patients don't belong at home as you mentioned. ","So if you had to guess \u2013 if we normalize physician practice patterns across the country and everybody was thinking about it like this is the first option, look to the patient, how much we can, where can the mix go to just with the qualitative physician decision making versus some of the other factors you know around the famous structures and you know clinical offsets. ","Javier Rodriguez","John, this is Javier. I think when we look around and we see the most, let's call it home champions, the most dedicated physicians that have a good education program and are really trying to champion the right modality for the right patient, you get into a low you know 20 or so mix. Maybe you get it up to 25 if they are really, really good, but that's on the high end and as you look around the world, that\u2019s probably also a good number to use. ","John Ransom ","Thanks, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s all from me. ","Kent Thiry","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is now open. ","Kevin Fischbeck ","Hey, just a few more from me. I guess I might have missed it, but did you say that the guidance for 2019 includes additional advocacy costs or is that included in the normal run rate spend? ","Kent Thiry","No, it includes this $30 million which is consistent with what we\u2019ve said before and think of it as you know $60-ish million less than the $90 million something that we had in 2018. The point I think Javier was trying to make is that we\u2019ve always had advocacy costs built into our cost structure. It went up significantly in 2018 as a result of the California stop. So this $30 million is kind of the remnant of that California piece that will roll through. There is other stuff that\u2019s always been in there and that that hasn\u2019t changed. ","Kevin Fischbeck ","Okay, great, and then some on home health commentary, obviously home health that you guys have talked about from time to time and have been supportive off it. But this is just \u2013 I don\u2019t know, this feels a little bit more of a discussion that I\u2019m used to hearing from you guys. ","Is there anything, so obviously lower cap on density is good; it\u2019s good for some subset of the patients. So that\u2019s good, probably better for commercial patients, so that\u2019s good, but is there anything that you have to worry about as you move the home hemo, because one of the things that structurally I would think that you and Fresenius have. ","There is some varied entry and that you guys already have you know bricks and mortar across the country to the extent that we create and push towards a less capital intensive model probably speaking. Does that create the potential for disruption or more competition that you were \u2013 so (a) am I off base on that concern and (b) is there any downside that you can think of as now that is towards home hemo getting bigger. ","Kent Thiry","Yeah, so one of the most important things to remember is that our patients are big consumers of the entire healthcare system and by definition when your kidneys fail, you are fragile and you\u2019re quite sick. And so one of the things that\u2019s not discussed when discussing home is that the peritoneal cavity (a) there is an high infection and two that sometimes it doesn\u2019t last and sometimes it\u2019s probably not the right world. ","Most times it actually gives within two years or so and so if you were to look at a patient of ours, they are (a) hospitalized; home patients that are hospitalized and of course DaVita and Fresenius serve in the acute setting and then number (2) is approximately 85% of patients that treat at home will have to use an in-center at some point in their care. And so having the entire suite meaning the hospital, the clinic, and the home service is a very important part of the value proposition for a patient, because they want the continuity of care, they want their doctor to go from the hospital to the center to the clinic and then of course home. ","So is that responsive to your answer. ","Kevin Fischbeck ","Yeah, no, that\u2019s good, that\u2019s \u2013 the bricks and motors always going to have an important role even if home hemo becomes a bit bigger than what it is now. ","And then, the other question I wanted to understand a bit more about the sale leaseback dynamic. Are you signaling that you plan on owning you rights as a percentage going forward through these sale lease backs or is this more just a method of financing that disruption and that you wouldn\u2019t expect to be leasing a higher percentage of your facilities going forward. ","Kent Thiry","So Kevin, there is no real change in the amount of real-estate we are planning on owning, which is extremely low. What the dynamic here is that we have found rather than having someone else build the center for us and us leasing it, it is more cost effective for us both in terms of the capital and the ultimate lease expense for us to build the center and then sell the already constructed center. ","So the impact on our cash flow is that we are \u2013 we have an increase in CapEx as a result of this which flows through the normal CapEx line. There is a net benefit which doesn\u2019t flow through the CapEx line, but is effectively, economically an offset to our CapEx when we sell this, when we sell the center. ","So no real change in how the ultimate ownership of the center, but it does create a little noise on our cash flow that we wanted to really clarify and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve added over the last few quarters how this plays out in table six, what the net kind of bring back against the CapEx is. We understand it\u2019s a little bit confusing, but we thought it was important to lay it out to make sure everyone has the clearest view of what the real CapEx and cash flow of the businesses is. ","Kevin Fischbeck ","Alright, great. Thanks. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Whit Mayo, UBS. Your line is now open. ","Whit Mayo","Thanks. I just had a couple quick ones on those numbers kind of moving around versus my notes. So just want to make sure I\u2019ve got the correct headwinds and tailwinds written down. On the tailwind side for this year, I\u2019ve got DaVita Rx losses reversing to be a $25 million tailwind. I think Joel you cited now a net $60 million tailwind in California on advocacy and then maybe a $35 million pickup on Medicare rates. Are those the big buckets? Are those the right numbers, are we missing anything?","Joel Ackerman","I think the sizes are about right, the Medicare is actually a headwind. I\u2019m getting puzzled here what was you\u2019re\u2026","Whit Mayo","I guess I was thinking more just on the rate update. ","Kent Thiry","Oh on the rate update, yes. I thought you were talking about the Medicare bad debt issue which is going to bring positive revenue.","Whit Mayo","Yeah okay, is that in the ballpark, you know $35 million just incremental tailwind from the rate update. ","Kent Thiry","That\u2019s about right. ","Whit Mayo","Okay and then on the headwinds as you mentioned that you\u2019ve got a $36 million headwind from the Medicare bad debt recoveries and may be a $17 million reversal from DaVita Healthy Solutions. Any other major headwinds and are those the right numbers? ","Joel Ackerman","Those are about right. DHS I wouldn\u2019t call it a reversal in an accounting standpoint. It was a -.it\u2019s the lack of, yes.","Whit Mayo","Okay. And so that implies\u2026","Kent Thiry","The one other thing I would point to was the retirement cost that we had in Q3. The number was roughly $25 million, $23 million precisely.","Whit Mayo","Got it. Okay.","Kent Thiry","Add that to the tailwind category.","Whit Mayo","Yes. Got it, okay. And then one last one, just the calcimimetics landscape is like fairly fluid right now, some drugs coming on\/off at the market. Just what\u2019s the expectation for 2019 and I\u2019ll get off, thanks?","Kent Thiry","Yes. So I think you\u2019re exactly right. It is a very fluid situation. It is one of the largest components of the swing in our $100 million of OI guidance given the different ways it could play out. But roughly speaking kind of if you think about the middle of the range it\u2019s not a big change year-over-year, but again a lot of variability in terms of how it plays out.","Whit Mayo","So, what would be the scenarios that would play out that would get you toward the low end versus the high end? Is there any way to share what would have to happen with calcimimetics to be within that range?","Javier Rodriguez","The couple of dynamics that you have to consider are one, prescription patterns. In there you have the oral come down or go up or do physicians prefer IV or oral, so there is a mix in there. In addition then you have to consider whether more generics come in t0 market. ","So if it\u2019s one player versus five players and what happens to pricing and so then of course you have a calculation on ASP that has got a lag, and has got a six-month lag in that. So those are the dynamics in play.","Whit Mayo","Okay. I lied, one last one just on ASP. Can you comment how ASP has trended the last six to 12 months, and what that implies for the next six months, and I promise I\u2019m off now.","Joel Ackerman","ASP has trended down. And then as it relates to prediction, you can\u2019t have one because of all the things I just went through.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Gary Taylor, J. P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Gary Taylor","See what happens when you move your call to the morning. Nobody knows how to get off the phone. Everybody is double dipping. ","I just had a quick one. I just want to go back to, while I had you, kind of this question about slower growth in the industry, and looking at the U.S. RDF data maybe there\u2019s a good reason why it\u2019s not good or comprehensive. But if you look at prevalent population growth before 2000 it was in the fives, from 2010 it was in the fours, since 2010 it\u2019s been in the threes. You know it\u2019s a couple of years lag, but it looks like it is poised to drop into the two\u2019s. ","So when you look at kind of that bigger picture, the industry maturing, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re seeing something that looks more step function-ish than sort of that that long decline we\u2019ve seen over the last 30 years?","Kent Thiry","No. I would say the opposite probably is that the data is quite clear that nothing dramatic happens quickly, and yet the trend is the trend and we\u2019re not predicting any significant change in either direction of the trend. But recognize that there is an awful lot of dynamism underneath that number. ","On the one hand treatment for diabetes and hypertension, some of the primary causes of kidney failure are getting better. So you could argue that that would lead to a reduction in dialysis patients. On the other hand the African-American and Hispanic populations are growing significantly in America, and they are far more likely to have kidney disease and kidney failure. So that pushes exactly the opposite direction and I could cite two or three or four other variables.","So under the surface of that long-term trend, which we think may very well continue without any significant discontinuity up or down, but underneath that are a lot of basic fundamental forces in American healthcare and American demographics and so it\u2019s very difficult to get too confident, because if any of those underlying trends change, that would in fact create some sort of discontinuity in the trend. It just hasn\u2019t for the past 25 years.","Gary Taylor","Got you. I just thought the opioids transplant commentary was perhaps suggesting you thought you were seeing something more onerous or steeper. So I appreciate the clarification. Thanks.","Kent Thiry","Let\u2019s stay on that for one second, because that is a perfect example of a new discontinuity, but we would also predict probably relatively temporary one and that we would say that five years from now the incidence of opioid abuse and people getting to the point where their kidneys fail because of the lack of treatment is going to be reduced dramatically, because already the leading indicators for that things like prescription patterns, prescription limitations, prescription oversight, clinic availability to help these people, all of that is fundamentally changing throughout America and is quite well-funded in many cases.","So that\u2019s a classic example of a new thing that has had a negative impact in some ways on us in the short term, but will probably on a relative basis become an incrementally positive one over the next five, six, seven, eight years. But it\u2019s once again very difficult to quantify and calibrate, because it has do with fundamental demographic issues and fundamental healthcare system issues.","Gary Taylor","Understood! Thank you.","Kent Thiry","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pito Chickering, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Pito Chickering","Hey, thanks, and thanks for taking all these, you know extra questions here. I want to take another crack at the organic treatment growth that you guys are \u2013 I mean where you guys have guided to versus what you did in the fourth quarter. Are they 2.6% in the fourth quarter guidance of 2.5% to 3.5 % for 2019? ","So the new point of guidance is implying an upside versus what is it you\u2019re supporting and in fact they are calling the fourth quarter as the bottom of what the ranges can be. Can you give any additional color in terms of so why this has improved to the midpoint of your guidance for \u201819?","Joel Ackerman","I\u2019ll take a crack at that, although I don\u2019t think I got much to add. The number does bounce around a bit, and we tend to look at things, you know some thing\u2019s purely on a quarterly basis; other with a little bit of blending over time. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re blending the Q4 data point with some prior data and our go-forward model, so we come up with something that\u2019s in the 2.5% to 3.5% range.","Pito Chickering","Alright, it is worth a try. Thanks so much.","Operator","And speakers, we show no further questions at this time.","Kent Thiry","Alright, thank you all very much for your interest in DaVita. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may disconnect at this time."],"7113":["DaVita HealthCare Partners (NYSE:DVA) Q3 2014 Earnings Call November  6, 2014  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Jim Gustafson - Vice President of Investor Relations","Kent J.

My name is Kim, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita HealthCare Partners Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference.","Jim Gustafson","Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Garry Menzel, our CFO; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn over the call to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry","Thank you, Jim, and greetings to all. Thank you for your consideration of our company. In Q3, we had solid results in Kidney Care, in HealthCare Partners and overall. Kidney Care OI being $408 million, adjusted for nonrecurring items, and HealthCare Partners being $47 million. As always, we'll talk about clinical outcomes first, because we are, first and foremost, a caregiving entity.","On the Kidney Care side in America, we take care of 35% of all the dialysis patients. 98% of our patients achieved a Kt\/V of 1.2 or better and 73% of patients have a fistula in place.","Turning to HealthCare Partners and our 836,000 human beings for whom we provide integrated care. I'd like to talk a little bit about 2013 HEDIS clinical metrics, which most of you are familiar with.","There are 12 clinical measures in HEDIS, all of which feed into the Star rating system. And I'm looking at a page right now that has those 12 rows and it has 3 columns, one for each of our legacy markets. So a total of 36 cells. 24 of those 36 are 5-star rankings, 7 of them are 4. And then there's only 5 left that are 3, with none below. There are very few providers of any scale in the entire MA program that would have anywhere close to a rating system like that, and we're proud of it. It's good for patients and it's good for our payer partners.","The clinical outcomes for both Kidney Care and HealthCare Partners compare very favorable -- very favorably, excuse me, to national averages. We have healthier patients. We have higher patient satisfaction. And both of those things, besides being good in and of themselves, saves money for taxpayers and employers.","Now a little elaboration on HCP's operating performance, which was solid. You'll note that the guidance assumes lower margins in the fourth quarter. This is a normal trend because of the fact that sicker patients with higher risk scores expire as the year proceeds. Younger, healthier patients age into MA, and there's typically some uptick in medical utilization as we enter the winter months.","On the HealthCare Partners business development. We've increased the level of activity modestly. And it's a lot of high-quality conversations that have been started. We still have a long way to go in terms of capabilities, and the sales cycle itself is long. But the way we think about it is pretty much divided in 2 categories: mainstream and new models partnership. On the mainstream front, as most of you know, we recently announced an exciting acquisition of Colorado Springs Health Partners, the leading group in Colorado Springs, Colorado. And we look forward to growing with them, not only leading them into a world of coordinated care, but also growing on the fee-for-service side.","And then, separately, we've got a number of creative and exciting hospital partnerships at the very serious stage, one of which was announced today. A 50\/50 joint venture with the Centura Health system here in Colorado. It's a leading health system in the state.","These 2 different Colorado deals are entirely separate. We are the 100% owner of the Colorado Springs health care partner group, but we look forward to having our group work with the joint venture with Centura and, moving forward, pursuing and managing global contracts.","We'd also like to initiate 2015 guidance. The enterprise guidance is $1.75 billion to $1.9 billion. In other words, relatively flat to the current reality. Underneath that, the Kidney Care operating income, $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion. This reflects the sad fact that it'll be the second year in a row with no Medicare increase, and we'll face normal cost increases. Things are getting more intense because of stuff like this. We expect to have 15 center closures by the end of the year. That's more than any other year I can remember. And we are still carrying 200 unprofitable centers after that point, and that's excluding any new de novos.","It's also a tougher commercial pay environment. The growth in more restrictive narrow-network plans means that we may very well lose some market share on the commercial side, as we will be unwilling to accept lower commercial rates. We need, unfortunately, high commercial rates to subsidize the losses that we incur in the 90% of our patients that are government.","Moving on to HealthCare Partners and guidance of $225 million to $275 million. This also reflects relatively flat MA reimbursement in the face of normal cost increases. And on top of that, we are investing in infrastructure and capability improvements. And finally, we will, once again, always have some losses in new markets, or at least hopefully always, as we hope to enter some new markets each year. And in many cases, the most capital efficient way to do that is with low-capital models that therefore have losses, operating losses, in their early years.","Moving on to 2016. We'd like to go beyond providing 2015 guidance in this case, because we have 2 serious headwinds that are potentially quite material. The first of those and the biggest is Medicare reimbursement on both sides of the house. And then, secondarily, the tough commercial pay environment, that I already cited on the Kidney Care side, is not going to go away in 2015. And so, that -- or those 2, combined with the earnings headwinds that will come from the new markets we hope to enter, means that while it's too early to provide any specific guidance for 2016, the factors I just mentioned lead us to need to communicate to you that there is a real risk that 2016 operating income could be lower than 2015.","I'd like to segue into a quick editorial on Medicare Advantage, in particular, and just the incredible importance of CMS needing to get those rates correct. America needs the sickest patients to join Medicare Advantage and those likely to become the sickest, because those are the patients where we add the most clinical value for the patient and economic value for the country. And we are at risk of moving into a danger zone, where the economics of making the right investments in those 2 sets of patients become unsustainable.","If I step back from 2015 and '16 for a moment and just quickly look at the strategic position of our primary businesses.","U.S. Kidney Care is well positioned, as we've talked about in the past. We have strong clinical outcomes and that increasingly matters. We're growing faster than the market. It's a life-saving therapy. And our ability to manage total patient costs, not just dialysis costs, is increasingly differentiated. However, we do live in the uncomfortable world where we rely on higher private pay rates to subsidize the government.","On the HealthCare Partners front, despite a rocky first 18 months, the fundamental value proposition remains intact. Integrated care and population health management are what we do well, and that's what lots of people want to move to. We have a solid foundation in our legacy markets. And I'd like to talk about what I'm focused on in the near term, since I've now been quite engaged for 4 or 5 months. Not in order of importance, but number one, adding to the team; number two, adding to the capabilities; number three, fix the problem spots; number four, explore new partnership models, a couple of which I've already talked about; and number five is pursue selective growth. All of this is, in the context for HealthCare Partners, good news, which is that everyone expects MA growth to continue because it is a superior way of taking care of people and taking care of America's economics.","On the international front, I'll just say we're continuing to make solid progress. Of course, there is risk in that venture, but the potential is huge as health care service is a growth industry across the globe.","Now Garry Menzel, our CFO, will cover some more stuff.","Garry E. Menzel","Thank you, KT. Starting with Kidney Care. Non-acquired dialysis treatment growth in the quarter was 4.9% when normalized for days of the week. Profitability was up $6 million sequentially. Our international losses were $13 million for the quarter and we now expect those losses for 2014 to be slightly above $40 million.","For the overall enterprise, our debt expense was $100 million in the third quarter. This is a good run rate for debt expense going forward. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $36 million in the third quarter, which is also a good run rate going forward.","Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners was 38.7% in the quarter, and we now expect the full year rate for 2014 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40%.","Turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows, as operating cash flow was $848 million in the third quarter and $1.88 billion over the last 12 months. This was unusually high due to: one, the timing of cash tax payments; and two, the timing of various working capital items, in particular a reduction in accounts receivable DSO, which we do not expect to repeat next year. We now expect operating cash flow to be between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion in 2014, excluding any payments associated with the settlement with the government.","We expect 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, lower than 2014, but in line with our historical trends.","The reason for this year-on-year decline is that 2015 will not benefit from the 2 factors that helped 2014: number one, the cash tax benefit related to our refinancing; and again, number two, the timing of various working capital items, in particular the reduction in accounts receivable DSO. As always, this guidance range captures the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range.","Finally, some comments on capital deployment. Even after making the $400 million government payment last week, we have a very strong cash balance today. We are in the fortunate position of having various opportunities, where we may be able to deploy our capital in each of our business lines. We are constantly reviewing our capital allocation to make sure that we sustain the long-term health of the organization and achieve appropriate aftertax cash returns on capital.","To put our historical practices in context, in the 5-year period prior to the HealthCare Partners transaction, we allocated 40% of our capital to acquisitions, 23% to internal development, 26% to share repurchases and 11% to debt repayments. We favor a situational approach to capital deployment and will continue to review our options.","And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q and A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Zimmerman with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess my first question is around 2015 guidance. And just hoping to get a bit more color on what sort of assumptions you're making in heading into next year. And just especially, if you look at that dialysis side, guiding down year-over-year. Just curious to get a bit more insight into what's behind that number.","Kent J. Thiry","I don't know that we have much to add because it really is driven by the stuff we mentioned, the absence of a Medicare increase for the second consecutive year. We did an awful lot of expense squeezing in the face of the first flat year and can't do that again with the same kind of return, and then just what's happening on the commercial pay side and some of that dynamics there. Those are the big issues. Those are the drivers. It's not a lot more complicated than that.","Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can you remind us what percentage of your commercial volumes are -- what percentage is commercial volumes on the dialysis side?","Kent J. Thiry","About 10%.","Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","About 10%. And then you mentioned some on the issues on the HCP side. And since taking over leadership, you've identified some areas you want to address. Could you give us a bit more on just sort of what you mean by fixing problem spots and pursuing selected growth?","Kent J. Thiry","Sure. In the case of fixing problem spots, I'm referring to the 2 deals that were done right after the close by some of the prior executives that didn't work out well. And we've, in fact, made strong progress in the last 5 months on each of those. And we referred to that in our last call, where we said we're going to be -- we're still confident that we're highly likely to be more than $25 million better in '15 versus '14. I should say, $25 million more or better, but $25 million is probably the best number to remember. So that's the fixing problem spots I was referring to and that's going quite well. On the selective growth, I think the 2 best examples to make that more tangible are the deals that we've talked about this week, which is, one, the purchase of a leading physician group in a substantial American metro area. And second, a health system joint venture, where we still have to sort through all the terms of the definitive but we're -- both sides are very committed to driving it to closure and moving forward. So those are 2 examples of selective growth. Am I answering the right question?","Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. I'm just curious to get a bit more detail behind that -- those initiatives.","Operator","And our next question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wanted to follow up on the question on dialysis and maybe come at it from just a different angle in terms of 2015 outlook. Kent, over the last few years, your actual dialysis results have been significantly better than what you've guided to initially. I'm just curious if you could look back at the actual versus expectations, and give us any color around what those upside drivers were, if there's any consistency there.","Kent J. Thiry","A fair question. I don't know that I can spontaneously do a good job of going back 2 or 3 years, but let's play with it for a moment and see if we can add some value. I know in these past 12 months, the concerns we had about exchanges turned out to be much greater than the reality. And so that was one very big dynamic and one very big variance. I'm trying to go back to the prior year and I'm just not sure on that one, Justin.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So in the -- I guess you're saying that -- and I think payer mix and just private pay, whether it's mix issues or reimbursement pressure in general, seems to have been -- in addition to whatever rate pressure you're facing on Medicare, has been something that the company has faced and obviously done a good job over time. And we'll see if you -- we'll see how we go for 2015. I guess my question is, when you look at those, if we just direct it at the commercial pay side, that's been an area of potential pressure and ended up being better than expected or less significant than expected, if we're going to use those words. Then, is there any reason for us to believe -- is there a higher level of conviction that this time it's going to be different versus the last 2 or 3 years, where it's been less meaningful than you thought? Or do you feel like this is just the typical level of prudent posture going into a new year?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, very fair question. Maybe let me use an analogy. If you win the first 2 games of the World Series and you're about to start game 3 and you're up against a superb team that made it all the way to World Series, you don't look at the rearview mirror and say, \"Well, we won the first 2 and therefore it's 80% probable we're going to win game 3.\" You say, \"Against a tough competitor, you win some, you lose some, but you don't win them all.\" And I think we have to look at our never-ending battle, if you want to call it that, with private payers to say that, \"Yes, we've been able to hold the line,\" in part because our entire industry needs to subsidize the government, and so it's a common plight. But whatever the reason, we've had a couple of good years. We just think it would be inappropriate to, therefore, by -- based on that rearview mirror, pretty view, get overly confident about next year. Separate from that metaphor, which I think is important, but beyond that, it is also just a case that there's a lot going on in the commercial sector and many of you are more facile in discussing it than me. But it's -- and players are getting more and more creative with what they're doing on benefit design. They're getting much more open to doing different things, with exchanges and narrow networks just being one example. And so when 10% of your patients drive, whatever, 115% of your profitability, I'm not going to get the exact number right, but the subsidization of the Medicare program is substantial from the private sector, that you've got to pay a lot of attention, because relatively small changes can wreak a lot of havoc in your year-over-year momentum. And so I would posit and we would posit that the world is different in '15 versus what it was in '14. And if you had to say, does it lean different harder or easier? You would lean harder. And in particular, for us, because the way it could show up is that not we lose rate, it's that we lose share to other people who are willing to cut rates. And that's something that we can't control.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Garry, maybe could you give us a little bit more color on the reduction in the DSOs? Is that just a timing thing? Or was there one specific payer or something that's going on?","Garry E. Menzel","It isn't one specific thing, Gary. It's just a trend that we've had over the last 18 months or so, but it's not something that we expect to continue.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Is it around a specific item or a specific dynamic? Or is it just a whole bunch of different things?","James K. Hilger","Gary, this is Jim Hilger. It is a number of different things. It's improved collection processes and results. We've also had high write-offs. You can see our Medicare bad debt expense percentage was increased in the quarter. But we feel very good about the quality of our AR. But in aggregate, all of these things are driving our DSO down.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Wouldn't collection -- more proficiency with collections, wouldn't that carry forward, though?","James K. Hilger","Yes. But the structural impediments to improving DSO from 50 days are quite large when you look at the fact that our biggest payer, Medicare, pays us about 22 days after the end of the month. So when you factor that into the math, it's going to be very hard to significantly lower DSO from here. But it doesn't mean that we can't try, but it will be hard to do big strides.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then, Kent, the other large national dialysis provider said they'd begin doing tests with Mircera in the U.S. this quarter. Do you guys have any plans to do that?","Kent J. Thiry","Not right now, but we're very open-minded on the topic.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then assuming that, that drug is available in the U.S. at some point in 2015, have you baked that into the guidance at all?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, I'd say that we bake everything into our guidance. And trying to predict -- and especially the history in this arena, trying to predict when something, in fact, is going to be introduced and how it's going to be introduced and how it will be priced and how penetration will evolve is really hard. So I don't think we presumed anything particularly bullish or world-changing in that regard. However, we do think the fact that competition is highly likely in the near and intermediate term is a good thing for everybody.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess even as you go into 2016, the potential for perhaps 3 competitors on the market for the drug, have you taken that into account when you're thinking about 2016?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. We've taken it into account. But, again, while we're not sharing our different probabilistic scenarios and the math associated with the each, because obviously there's a range of outcomes and all the variables I cited before, that we are hopeful for a meaningful change. But within the time frame of 1 year, or 15, 18 months, we're not presuming that life is fundamentally altered in a dramatic way.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I mean, maybe just to go down that route a little bit more. I mean, if in 2016, there were 3 drugs available and you -- isn't it conceivable you could see a 20% decrease to price on costs that's over $1 billion for you?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, we do think that new entrants are going to have to offer lower prices to get penetration, just period. There's no 2 ways around it, and it's going to have to be significant. We also think strategically that Amgen is going to want to stay competitive, as they have in other countries around the world in similar situations. And so that all, directionally, is very good news. And at the same time, we just want to remind people that if the entire community realizes certain benefits from cost reduction that, ultimately, that will appropriately be reflected in Medicare reimbursement. Now since we're at a deficit, we still should come out ahead, because part of what Medicare hopefully will do is start to reduce the deficit. But the notion that they would let anything along the lines of what you mentioned just flow through permanently, I think that's unlikely.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe could we get an update on the Tandigm partnership and how that's doing?","Kent J. Thiry","It's doing fine, but it's so early that it doesn't mean so much. We've got a wonderful response from the physicians in the community. We're in high-quality conversations with a bunch of the hospitals. IBC and us and Tandigm are working very well together, but it's a little bit like the preseason. The real tackling doesn't start until January 1, so we don't want to get too excited about winning some of the preseason games.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Joanna Gajuk - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is actually Joanna Gajuk, filling in for Kevin today. Just question -- follow-up on the comment around 2015 guidance again. I guess, just specifically the comments around the loss from, I guess, new deals. So are you including additional transactions on top of what you just recently did? And I guess in relation to that, can you comment on your comments from prior calls around trying to enter 2, 3 new markets next year and more after that? So is that what you sort of bake into your outlook when you talk about '15 and then, I guess, '16 as well?","Kent J. Thiry","We would be disappointed if we didn't do, on the HealthCare Partners side, 2 good new deals next year. And by saying new, that probably means in new markets as opposed to an additional one, an existing market. Anything done on those places will probably be less material. And then we're presuming that one or both of them could be of a similar structure to the ones we're doing now, where we are launching a substantial population health management initiative. And therefore, in the beginning, you've got operating losses, just like when we build a de novo on the dialysis side. So that's how we think those 2016 losses will emerge.","Joanna Gajuk - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then on, again, on HCP. I guess on the quarter that you just reported, the G&A costs of I guess $86 million versus $77 million in Q2, and I guess as a percentage of revenues also increased. So any comment on that?","Garry E. Menzel","Yes, it's Garry. First of all, on the margin, you have to remember it varies by quarter because of a number of different factors: seasonality, there are nonrecurring items in there, there are government true-ups. And so I will point out, though, that across the year, we have maintained consistent cost trends.","Operator","And our next question comes from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren Perkin Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I did want to just come back to part of what you were asked before about the investment that you're making in some of these activities. And I guess I was just hoping if you could bucket them a little bit better for us for 2015, just so we can maybe isolate some of the underlying trends in both segments. So just taking them apart. In international, can you give us some flavor for how you're thinking about the investment there? And duals, I know that that's something that you'll be ramping up your lives in California, I think. So is that an investment? Is that a positive? And then to the extent that JVs in other new markets that you've just announced here with HCP require investment, what does that look like?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. Fair question, Darren. And maybe we'll lay out more math next time. I don't think I'm well prepared to do that right now. But I would say international in '15 will be comparable to '14, with the ramp-up in Saudi and the rest of our growth, so that'll be comparable. And then, duals, I wish we could tell you exactly what that number is going to be, but we've got to watch that population very carefully, and we'll keep you posted. But right now, it wouldn't be right to speculate. And then, on the joint venture side, given they're so young, it's really hard for us to go very far in a satisfactory way because there's so many variables, and we just don't know. We can feel good about where it's going to be 2 years from now, 3 years from now, 4 years from now. But the notion that we can predict operating losses in months 1 through 15, that would be -- while we have our pro formas that we're managing against, there's a pretty significant range of possible outcomes.","Darren Perkin Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So well, I guess, the follow-up then is just when we think about maybe how you've communicated around Tandigm, and I think there have been some numbers floating around. But the sizing of that, so 50,000-or-so lives, in that type of JV versus what we're reading about today, Centura, 1.2 million lives over time. Obviously, a very different type of situation. But just trying to understand a little bit more about how some of the investments flows might be related to these different types of JVs so we can at least just frame that in the model from a new market perspective.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. I think we have to get better at working with you on that, Darren, you and your peers. And I will not make any great progress in that area on this call today. And then, on the Centura, we cherish our partner's optimism, and they have far more experience in this market than we do. Nonetheless, our pro forma does not have 1.2 million lives in year 5, and so we would hate to have you bake that in. But we sure as heck hope they're smarter than we are.","Darren Perkin Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right, last thing for me. Just you brought up 2016, you're obviously cautioning us. I guess what is it about 2016? If you could, maybe, list 1 or 2 things that keep you up the most and that we ought to be rethinking about in our models?","Kent J. Thiry","Okay. I'll be redundant and then we can go back and forth and see if we add some incremental value. Game 1 is just Medicare on both sides of the house. What are they going to do with rates? And in some cases, what are they going to do with certain architectural rules and regs that equate to significant math? But it's Medicare and it's rates. And then, second is this commercial side, just given how darn leveraged it is. And when there's so many things going on in that space, it's just a little nerve-wracking for us, particularly when it could come down to us, as I mentioned before, losing share out of our control because we can't run around offering discounts.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vijay Malik with Everest.","Vijay Malik","I just wanted to circle back on capital allocation, which you discussed earlier. Specifically, you mentioned, prior to the HCP acquisition, 26% of your free cash flow was used for repurchases. About 6 months ago on the call, I highlighted, at the end of the year, you might have $2 billion of cash in the balance sheet. And the question of capital allocation, what to do with that cash is becoming increasingly important every quarter. Could you talk a little bit about how you evaluate share repurchases? Obvious, relative to other opportunities you see out there, but it's hard to believe that a company trading x cash at 10x free cash flow might not be -- your best investment opportunity is just repurchasing stock.","Garry E. Menzel","So thank you. It's Garry. First of all, I do want to point out, we won't have $2 billion in cash at the end of the year. So I'll highlight that. Secondly, I think it's important as you listen to the call that whenever you enter into a period of uncertainty, which we are flagging today, that you do owe it to the shareholders to ensure that you maintain a strong cash reserve to go through that period of uncertainty. So that's certainly informing our thinking. And then, beyond that, we look at all of the opportunities that we have in front of us, both for internal development, both for acquisition growth, and then as you point out, share repurchases or debt paydowns. And we take a very situational approach with each one of those to determine what is the appropriate option for us to follow. I don't think we can disclose much beyond that, other than to let you know that this is something that we do, month-by-month, intensely study.","Kent J. Thiry","And the only thing I'll add to that is when we talk about times of uncertainty, mean logically that you should hold more cash -- very simplistic, obviously -- that's not just for defensive reasons. It's also in times of uncertainty that there's a way-above-average probability of offensive opportunities popping up. And so we're equally defense- and offensive-minded as we stare at that decision.","Vijay Malik","Understandable. When I see the cash on the balance sheet and I don't see share repurchases, it makes me excited about the opportunities you must be evaluating. I, obviously, think very highly of the management team. And frankly, I think it's an asset that Wall Street might be missing.","Kent J. Thiry","We hope you are right, and we will do our best to make you right. Please don't put anything in your model.","Vijay Malik","There's no model. It's in my head.","Operator","Your next question comes from -- I'm sorry, the next question comes from Gary Taylor with Citi.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, I just want to go back to EPO unit cost for a minute. Everyone knows you have the exclusive contract with Amgen through 2017. It seems obvious there's no EPO unit price reduction in the Kidney operating income guidance that it could be flat 2 years in a row. So I guess to get to it, what is the scenario that you can benefit from EPO unit price declines before the Amgen contract expires?","Kent J. Thiry","There's some elements of the contract that we're not allowed to disclose. What is publicly known is that we have the right to buy 10% elsewhere, and what is known in the sense of sort of common sense and business wisdom is that they are going to want to remain competitive. And in a contract, in either direction, if one party takes excessive advantage of a short-term provision, that typically has really fundamental implications for the long-term relationship. And so the contract has certain things that we like and certain things that they like and separate from that, we have a long-standing business relationship. And in general, it's our expectation that they'll remain competitive. Do you want to -- I don't know that I can shed any more light on it than that. Do you want to come back at it, again?","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No. I won't. I mean, it sounds like you to hope to renegotiate, by I won't put words in your mouth. And I don't know if you want to respond to that or not, probably not.","Kent J. Thiry","No. Thank you.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If not, I will -- my next question, just going into the commercial rates. A couple of questions. So it's November 6, today, when do you -- when are 2015 commercial rates finalized? Don't you have pretty significant visibility as we stand today?","Kent J. Thiry","No. The way it works is we're negotiating contracts all year long, every week, every month, every year. And lots of times, a contract expires and people just extend it because the negotiations go on another month to 12 months. A lot of times, there's notice provisions and so they automatically renew for a certain period of time, but it's not another year. We have agreements that end every month of the year, even if they're 1-year contracts. So the practical reality is that we are negotiating with payers all the time. And often, it goes months past the technical expiration of the prior contract and we just -- everything is just held in the steady-state while the to-ing and fro-ing is going on. So there's never really a time when you say, \"Okay, we've now sort of nailed down what's happening next year.\" I bet it's only a tiny fraction of our contracts that even have a January 1 effective date or renewal date.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And my one follow-on on that will just be, it sounds like you're suggesting competitors willing to discount rates. I guess kind of our view of the construct of the industry is that you might have 1\/3 national market share, but your local market shares are actually often significantly higher than that and, generally, the industry operates at pretty high capacity utilization. So the opportunity for discounters to move share would suggest perhaps there's some significant capacity adds in the industry, although maybe that just means being open on Saturday and Sunday. But are you suggesting that you're seeing capacity adds and that's going to create this opportunity for competitors to provide the service at a lower rate? Or is there something else?","Kent J. Thiry","The short answer to the question you asked is no. We're not positing any immense capacity adds. Having said that, incremental capacity is quite straightforward to add because you add a third shift or you add a Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday to your Monday, Wednesday, Friday. But more often, it's adding a shift or, in some cases, adding another station or 2 to an existing shift. So there's a lot of capacity that can be added quickly at relatively low cost. But that's actually not the #1 issue. The #1 issue is when private pay is only 10% of your patients, it doesn't take very many bodies to be moved to someone discounting before you materially affect your year-over-year contribution but don't put any serious incremental burden of capacity on the system.","Operator","The next will come from Lisa Clive with Bernstein.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two questions. Just another on the private rates on the dialysis side. A year ago, you had mentioned your frustration that a competitor was apparently giving a bit more in price. It sounded like it was around one particularly large contract. And when we last got a comment on this, I think your words were something along the lines that both sides were particularly unhappy, and it sounded like you'd sort of stuck to the status quo. Can you just give us an update on that particular situation? And is that perhaps part of your seemingly more downbeat view on commercial pricing for 2015? And then, a second question on private rates, actually not commercial rates, but Medicare Advantage. You talk a lot about MA in your HealthCare Partners business. But as MA overall has increased as a proportion of all seniors, I would imagine this should have some potentially positive mix effect for the dialysis business. Could just perhaps talk about MA patient count? How that's changed? And whether that does, in fact, have a bit of a margin benefit?","Kent J. Thiry","Let me answer the second one first, and I mean I'll probably ask you to ask the first one again because it had sort of 2 parts to it. I want to make sure I don't ramble here, or at least reduce the probability. But on MA, MA growth is good for HealthCare Partners and it's good for Kidney Care. We love it in Kidney Care because those customers, talking about MA plans as customers, care about total costs, and we're really good at that. And so -- both from an immediate margin point of view and from a value-added point of view, and therefore, that informs future rates. We really do like MA growth in the ESRD population. That answered your second question, correct?","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes.","Kent J. Thiry","And then -- go ahead.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, I was just -- actually one second -- maybe a second add-on to that second question is, you mentioned the -- MA's focus on total costs. Could you also just provide a comment on Fresenius' recent agreement with Aetna on their MA patients? And is that something that you could see moving forward with, with any major commercial players?","Kent J. Thiry","We don't know all the details of what they did with Aetna. We know some stuff, and we certainly believe in integrated care and pay-for-performance. And so we're in those sorts of conversations as well, and we would expect FMC to be continuing to do that sort of stuff. And the good news in it is more and more payers are interested and willing to spend the time in actually going through all the hours of discussion and negotiation that are required. A few years ago, Kidney Care just wasn't high enough on the radar screen to get the attention to actually do more sophisticated contracts where everybody can win. So that's the community-wide good news inherent in announcements like that. And beyond that, I would just have to guess that we're both doing similar things.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And yes, my first question, it's really -- I guess a way of rephrasing it is you seem a bit more downbeat on commercial pricing. Clearly, exchanges are one part of that. But I remember you very specifically had mentioned a year ago that there was one major contract, where it sounded like your big competitor had taken a bit of a rate cut. And you had resolved that issue by sort of sticking with the status quo. And I'm wondering whether you've had to shift away from that status quo, and that's one of the reasons why you're potentially a bit more negative in the commercial outlook for the next 12 months.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. We did have a situation, as we talked about and had an obligation to inform you of, where we had serious concerns about a competitor offering serious volume-related discounts, and that would affect industry structure in the way that shareholders would need to know about it. So that did happen. And then, second and totally separate, we've maintained pricing discipline, rate discipline. And we're willing to give up market share in order to do that, because it's very difficult to see a path where we're able to continue to innovate and drive the transformative parts of what we're about in terms of reducing total costs. We just can't do that without some margin.","Operator","At this time, I show no further questions.","Kent J. Thiry","Okay. Well, thanks very much. I mean, I will add I guess one other point that -- because it's related to what we were just talking about with Lisa. That it is, our patients are uniquely discriminated against. American dialysis patients are uniquely discriminated against in 2 ways, that if their kidney has already failed, they cannot join an MA plan, which is an absolute terrible policy, because it robs them of extra services that improve health and save the system money. So it's an artifact, but a legitimate concern from 25 years ago that doesn't apply anymore, and we really hope it gets changed. And secondarily, our patients are uniquely discriminated against in that they, no matter how many years they pay private insurance premiums, because they wanted insurance in case they got quite sick, they're kicked off of it after 30 months. A situation that no other American faces. And so those are 2 policy areas where we do hope for change.","And thanks, everyone, for your kind consideration, and we'll do our best for you between now and the next earnings call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and this concludes today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita HealthCare Partners Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]","Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference.","Jim Gustafson","Thank you, Laportia, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Bob Margolis, the CEO of Healthcare Partners; Matthew Mazdyasni, HealthCare Partners' Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Hilger, our interim CFO of DaVita HealthCare Partners; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements.

All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

Thiry","Okay. Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all of you out there for your interest in DaVita HealthCare Partners. Fourth quarter was a momentous one in one important respect, in that we completed the acquisition of HealthCare Partners to become our new company. That's transformational for us and hopefully, over time, transformational for many markets in American health care. I'll talk about kidney care a bit, then I'll make a couple of quick comments on HealthCare Partners and then talk about our near-term outlook, followed by a summary of things to feel good about, things to worry about.","So kidney care first. It was another solid quarter. We performed well both clinically and operationally. Let me elaborate on the clinical side. We will present these outcomes first because that is what comes first. We are first and foremost a caregiving company which, on the kidney care side alone, serves approximately 153,000 dialysis patients in the United States. With respect to adequacy, which is essentially how well we're doing in removing toxins from our patients' blood, once again, we hit the 98% level in terms of a Kt\/V greater than 1.2.","With respect to vascular access, we set yet another personal best, with 71% of our patients having fistulas, which is the preferred form of access, not only better clinically but saving taxpayers' money. Third, vaccinations, this year, over 91% of our patients were vaccinated for influenza and pneumonia, once again improving health care and reducing taxpayer cost. And number four is just a moment's reflection. Since 2009, we have reduced the use of catheters by 43% among our substantial population, 1\/3 out of all the dialysis patients in America. Once again, that constitutes wonderful clinical improvement, wonderful taxpayer savings.","For these and virtually all other clinical measures, our patient outcomes compare very favorably to national averages, and this quality not only results in healthier patients but drives reductions in hospitalizations, surgical procedures and costs. So good news on the clinical front. We think that's not only good news for our patients and the taxpayers, but it's good news for you.","On to public policy on the kidney care side. As part of the fiscal cliff negotiations, as most of you know, Congress mandated a rebasement of part of the bundle for 2014. It's sort of a bogus way to do it, but that is what they did. This could create a headwind for providers in 2014. So let's just revisit the core facts surrounding this issue: number one, we and the rest of the community still lose money on Medicare; number two, many of the dialysis centers in America are in a fragile financial states already, including a bunch of ours; number three, the legislation did not mandate a savings level, therefore, a, while CMS is directed to rebase a portion of the bundle, they have both the authority and the obligation to ensure overall payments are adequate to take care of these human beings, and so we'll have to wait and see what they do.","But in order for you to think about some of the facts that they will be thinking about, while it is true that pharma utilization, particularly ESAs, has gone down over the past 2 years, it's good to remember the following. We took a 2% cut going into the bundle because of the changing clinical science and physicians' points of view on ESAs. We took a 2% cut going in because people knew physicians were going to start prescribing fewer of them, and since pharma was about 25% of our costs, that meant you would need an 8% cost reduction in pharma to offset that 2% cut on the overall bundle.","Fact number two, industry pricing for EPO is up about 15% since the bundle went into effect. So if you put those 2 things together, 15% higher pricing, more or less, on average and the 2% cut on the total bundle going into it, you need pharma utilization reductions of around 23%, which is right about what has happened. So there has been no tick-up on an aggregate basis in the industry. These are facts that CMS must take into account.","In addition, there were other unexpected cuts, at least by us, included in the bundle because of what happened with the case-mix adjusters, outlier payments, et cetera, and so the net economics were actually worse than what I just summarized. And of course, on top of this is any additional sequestration that will further strain a lot of the centers across the country. And if they get it wrong, the centers will close, patient access will be hurt. So we'll have to wait and see what happens.","Second significant bit of policy news on the kidney care side is that we were excited that CMMI released an RFA for a renal-specific integrated care program. We have waited for years for the opportunity to give the gift of integrated care to every kidney care patient in America. Unfortunately, based on our current understanding of the terms, we would not participate in this program. The proposal is incomplete, first of all. But second, some of the stuff that is there and is definitive is sufficiently negative to make the program unattractive, and we'll have to hope that there are some changes.","We are, as I said, absolutely eager to take our proven capability -- we have proven that we can reduce total cost while simultaneously improving quality in an incredibly transparent fashion. It is and will be so frustrating if we're not allowed to bring the gift of integrated care to our patients and to our taxpayers on a broader basis, and we've done so much and proven so much for so many years in so many ways in so many places, so we remain hopeful. And it will be stunningly frustrating if we're prevented from spreading that good work.","A couple of comments on HealthCare Partners. I think the short summary is that the performance, economically and clinically, continues to be solid in their core markets, in line with our and presumably your expectations. On the growth front, our pipeline continues to be robust, and we closed some tuck-in acquisitions in existing markets in the fourth quarter.","Now on to our near-term outlook. We are going to maintain our 2013 OI guidance of $1.75 billion to $1.9 billion, and this includes, on the kidney care side, $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion; and on the HealthCare Partners side, $400 million to $450 million. This guidance captures the majority of probabilistic outcomes, taking into account all swing factors. But as we all know, these are very dynamic times on multiple dimensions, and we all must acknowledge the risk that we could fall outside that range.","I'd also like to take a minute now and wrap up by just stepping back and staring at what one should be worried about in investing in our shares and what one should feel good about. The most abbreviated summary would just say we think there is big upside, and we know there are serious risks.","Things to worry about on the kidney care side. Of course, the longstanding concern of our reliance on commercial rate and mix; and second, the often-discussed government investigations and private lawsuit risks, which are substantial. And then to those 2, we need to add government reimbursement risk being incrementally higher these days because of everything going on. And then on top of that the uncertainty of exchanges. So these are serious things to be concerned about on the kidney care side.","Things to feel good about on the kidney care side. First and foremost, excellent quality, a transparent attitude about it and quality that reduces cost. But beyond that, stable demand growth. We are well positioned with scale that matters when you're talking about managing a large patient population, transparent economics with significant share of government accountability because most of our centers do only one thing. So these are really good things to feel good about.","On the HealthCare Partners side, what should you worry about? Well, you should worry about how quickly we can develop a stronger new market capability that, by strategic design, was not well developed up to this point. In addition, Medicare Advantage has its own reimbursement pressures, and because it is a hot space, there's a lot of competition, so these are significant things to worry about, as we do.","On the other hand, things to feel good about from a HealthCare Partners point of view is that they are very good at what America needs to have happen in a lot more markets in terms of health-oriented population management pragmatically delivered, the physician\/caregiver centric model. In addition, as you all know, better than we, the market opportunity is stunning, and that's not even counting potential new markets and things like duals and ACOs.","If you look at the combined enterprise, what you can feel good about is, a, it's already been mentioned twice, a high-quality clinical focus and the philosophy of transparency around it; second, a very attractive place to work. Lots of good people, because of the substantial potential and because of the goodness of what we do, are interested in coming to work for our new combined enterprise; and third, our strong and consistent cash flows. Hopefully, you feel good about our historical and critical decision-making with respect to deploying those cash flows.","So that's it for me until Q&A. I'll turn it over to Jim Hilger now.","James K. Hilger","Thanks, Kent. First, a few more dialysis operating metrics. Non-acquired growth was 4.4% when normalized for days of the week, and our commercial mix remained flat in the quarter. U.S. dialysis revenue per treatment was down $1.77 from the prior quarter, driven by, one, a decline in revenues related to immunizations, which are seasonally highest in the third quarter when most annual vaccines are given; two, small declines in pharma utilization; and three, a decline in lab revenues. Dialysis patient care cost per treatment was down $1.52 from the prior quarter, driven primarily by the items I just mentioned.","Dialysis G&A per treatment was up $0.70 from the prior quarter. As we indicated last quarter, we anticipated higher G&A in the fourth quarter due to increased IT spend and the timing of legal costs. We experienced $12 million in international losses in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher transaction-related costs associated with our acquisitions in Poland and Portugal. International losses for the full year of 2012 were $38 million, in line with our prior guidance.","We are continuing to make operating progress internationally, and right now, we expect operating losses in 2013 will be less than $30 million, with a caveat that these could be greater in 2013 if we receive some government tender contracts on which we are bidding. Please note that if we successfully obtain these contracts, we will have to make some upfront infrastructure investments in 2013, but we expect this will lead to solid contributions in 2014 and beyond.","Next, a few details on HCP. Performance was solid in the quarter, with operating income of $67 million for the 2 months following the completion of the DaVita HealthCare Partners merger. We note that this is slightly above our previous guidance for the fourth quarter, although $3 million of this is due to amortization expense related to the acquisition being lower than previously expected. The fourth quarter is typically the weakest quarter of the year. It is a seasonally higher utilization and lower PMPM revenue. And as we discussed before, while HCP is a fairly steady business, you should expect greater quarter-to-quarter operating income volatility than you are used to in the dialysis business.","Now on to the overall enterprise. Our debt expense was $98 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the completion of the HCP acquisition on November 1 and simultaneous funding of our term loans. We benefited from an effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners of 38.5% in the quarter, which is below the 40.1% effective tax rate for the full year.","In our earnings release, we did call out some onetime items in the quarter, including transaction-related expenses, refinancing charges and expenses related to legal settlement that had been announced in the second quarter. The details of these are included in our non-GAAP reconciliations in the back of our press release.","Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $200 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our operating cash flow for the fiscal year 2012 to $1,101,000,000, modestly above our prior guidance range. 2013 operating cash flow guidance remains at $1.35 billion to $1.5 billion.","A few more details as you model the impact of the HCP transaction this year. We continue to expect our total debt and costs in 2013 to be about $425 million, but this could vary depending on any hedging we might do and the LIBOR impact of unhedged debt. At this time, we anticipate HCP amortization expense to be approximately $134 million in 2013. And the combined company tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners for 2013 should be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%.","And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Matt Weight.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Kent, you spent years working on an integrated care model, so I wonder if you could provide a little bit more specifics where the actual shortcomings are that would cause you not to participate.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, I'd be happy to. And you're right. I've been waiting for and hoping for this for a long time. Let me list off a couple of the issues: Number one -- and these are not in order of importance. And again, in some instances, their language is ambiguous, and so we need to clarify, on the other hand, so it's not so ambiguous. Their methodology penalizes those people who had better outcomes and therefore lower costs in the past. And of course, for us, that's a big problem, given how differentiated our quality is in some of the areas. Number two, the actual benchmark methodology they use in how they treat the baseline groups and how they think about mortality appears to be flawed in a way that doesn't work in a population like kidney care. Third, they're talking about rebasing in the very near term. And given the investment required, particularly on a subscale set of pilots like they appear to be contemplating, you don't have time to make the investment and get a return before they're talking about rebasing. And fourth, they also have some explicit economic discrimination against the larger organizations, which we think makes no philosophical or pragmatic sense, and penalizes the physicians that we're associated with and penalizes the patients that we take care of and just doesn't make philosophical sense either. So there's 4 examples. Now given the thoughtfulness that they've brought to so much of this for so long, we hope that through constructive conversation with them, they'll realize that what they have here could get in the way of thousands of human beings getting better care in a totally transparent fashion, that would save the taxpayers, in a very quantifiable and demonstrable way, a lot of money. So I want to emphasize, we're not giving up hope at all. After 10 years of working on it, we're not going to give up that quickly. But we were a little bummed out by some of the -- well, a little. We were very bummed out by some of the provisions.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, it didn't sound like there was going to be a comment period. So how can I square that with kind of what conversations you guys are having with the CMS?","Kent J. Thiry","Even if there's not an official comment period, they have the right to make adjustments if they decide to, and we hope they do.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Switching over a little bit to HCP. Can you give us an update on the ABQ acquisition and maybe kind of shed some -- what you may have learned with some of the difficulties you've had over there?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, it's a fair question, Matt. We don't want to go into a lot of detail, despite the legitimacy of the question, because it isn't that big a deal. And we've already acknowledged that it exposed the fact that we -- as we had already indicated before it happened, knew we had to work on our new market capability. And so you've got sort of the macro point, and there's been a lot of learnings on a micro point basis. But it's not really in, I think, our shareholders' best interest that we go into all sorts of detail to talk about an ongoing market bet.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. With that said, would that slow -- does that impact how you think about future new market acquisitions?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, yes, I guess, yes and no. Yes in the sense that we are now having to spend more time there than we thought, and that chews up some of the people that would otherwise be working on other new markets because we've had so many people contact us and want to talk to us. So yes, in that sense, it changes our deployment of scarce resources. No, in the longer-term sense, not one bit.","Matthew J. Weight - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Last question here, I'll jump off. With the orals being delayed until 2016, I've heard some talk about trying to get some momentum to bring that in potentially a little earlier than 2016. Anything possible with that? And how disappointed were you with that getting pushed out to 2016?","Kent J. Thiry","The answer to the second question is we were very disappointed, not because of reimbursement because we didn't even know what reimbursement was going to be, rather because that we know that we've proven that we can improve the care of our patients and save taxpayers' money even if you held reimbursement equal to cost. So we were disappointed. And then, as to whether or not some of the stuff going on in D.C. about changing it will get any traction, I think that's anyone's guess. We don't have any particular insight, and we're actually much more focused on all these other things. Thanks a lot, Matt, and sorry it doesn't make sense to go into more detail on the Albuquerque situation.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kevin Ellich.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I guess first, starting off with HCP. I was just wondering in the other revenue segment, which was $24 million, what does that consist of? And then, on top of that, do you guys still own the Camden Group?","Matthew Mazdyasni","Yes, this is Matthew Mazdyasni. That is -- the answer to your second question is yes, we do own Camden Group, and that revenue -- some of that is in that line, plus we have other management fees with the joint venture we have. So that's all reflected in that line item.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Can you -- is Camden the majority of that $24 million? Do you want to get to that level of specificity?","Matthew Mazdyasni","No.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then what percent of clinics, Kent, do you think would shut down or close if rebasing goes through as is in 2014?","Kent J. Thiry","A fair question but impossible to answer without knowing the actual number of rebasing. It is just literally impossible to answer.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Understood, okay. Jim Hilger made a comment on the international discussion saying that you guys are bidding on some more contracts. Just wondering if you could provide any more color behind that.","Kent J. Thiry","What's happening across the globe and part of why we decided to do this -- and I'll hasten to add, if I was a better CEO, we would have started doing this 6 or 7 years ago. But one of the reasons we decided to do it now is because there's a lot of governments deciding that they need to guarantee funding for dialysis because the global transparency around health care is leading a lot of people to find out it exists. And with it, you live, and without it, you die, and when it's low quality, it's not nearly as good as when it's high quality, and so that creates a lot of pressure. And then as soon as governments realize that there's going to be a fair amount of it, and they've got to figure out a way to fund it. They want to get out of the business of actually providing it for all sorts of reasons, including the fact that they're not that good at it and they don't like being accountable for things like that. And so across the globe, you have more governments focused on creating a supply of quality dialysis as a real policy objective. In the same way that in America, 20 and 30 years ago, you had similar thoughts and similar actions. And so in those cases sometimes when government hospitals have been providing a lot of this care, they issue outsourcing contract proposals, where they will make a decision to transfer a whole bunch of patients from their organization to someone else's. Those are the kind of things that we're competing on.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Understood. And then 2 last questions on HCP. First off, the ratio of patient care cost as a percent of total segment net revenues, which was 71.1%, should we think about that as kind of a medical loss ratio? Is that the right way to think about it?","Matthew Mazdyasni","Kevin, no, because that does not reflect all the institutional revenue and cost, because we are showing, in some of our markets, the net number. So I wouldn't want that to be confused with the medical loss ratio.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Okay, appreciate that, just trying to get a better understanding. And then I think tonight ends the Medicare Advantage, I guess, disenrollment period. Are you guys expecting any changes or many changes?","Matthew Mazdyasni","We don't. We usually -- there is that 45-day period that the patients can disenroll, but we have not seen, since the open enrollment was instituted a few years ago, a significant drop. As a matter fact, in some of our markets, we -- it's close to none.","Kent J. Thiry","Let me just add, while we are in conversations with several governments across the globe, I wouldn't want anyone getting overly optimistic about the timing. Often governments, separate from our own, miss their deadlines, so we needed to highlight to you the fact that there might be one in particular that has some significant investment. But if history is any guide, it's more likely that it won't happen.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Justin Lake.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, Kent, you've mentioned the competition in the M&A space for new physician groups is intense. We've seen them get taken out recently. Can you give us some more color around what you're seeing out there? And any kind of guidance in terms of what would you be -- what you would think is the most likely outcome, from an M&A perspective, for yourself on the HCP side?","Kent J. Thiry","Okay, Justin. I mean it's a very, very important and fair question, and our answer is going to be relatively worthless, that it is so difficult to predict who in fact is going to cross the line and decide to sell, as opposed to think about it, and then whether or not we're going to win versus some of the other people that are bidding. So on the one hand, if we went to the next 15, 18 months without closing another noteworthy transaction, I would be sad. Unfortunately, I could end up being sad. And on the other hand, there's no way we're going to close 4 or 5 big deals in 2013. So I can bracket it in that way, to go further is just kind of impossible given the dynamic of the deal process itself.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe I can ask the question this way then, in terms of the larger deals that are going -- that have taken place, there've been a few. In your mind, are the larger deals being done at multiples that are just you can't get to from a reasonable return perspective? And so should we think about maybe the size of the deals being on the smaller side in terms of groups that might be pre-risk or pre-capitation and therefore, being smaller deals but with significant upside in terms of the ROI longer term, like, let's say, in Nevada?","Kent J. Thiry","That's very thoughtful. Yes, it is true that we may do some deals where groups do not currently have a lot of what we're very good at, and therefore, they'll be less expensive but also take longer to develop. And so that is one category, and I'd be surprised if we don't do something in that category in the next 18 months. And then, as to whether or not multiples on some of the other stuff that's taken place, some of the big stuff were out of line, I guess maybe the evidence says, in our mind, it was since we were a part of some of those processes and we stopped bidding before someone else. And if we thought going higher was a good idea, we would've. Now that's a little bit not fair because at some point the process just ends and maybe you would've gone further, so I'm not trying to be cute. I think it's the classic situation, the more you pay, the more risk you expose your shareholders to. And we think we're going to have a lot of quality growth opportunities with lower risk profiles than some of the other stuff that's happened. And maybe we also just got outperformed, so you've got to take that into account, too. So I can't give you a clear answer on whether or not we think those multiples were out of line other than saying that we stopped bidding before other people did, and that certainly implies that, to some extent, that's what we think.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And so if I just take that question to kind of the endpoint, which is capital deployment then. It sounds like the -- maybe investors should expect that the deals that are being done, obviously, you can't put as much capital to work. Returns will be great on Nevada type of deals, but the dollars that are spent there are less significant. If that ends up being the case, where do you see capital deployment opportunities? Dialysis feels like it's mature. If it's not in HCP, is it share repurchase? And how should we think about your thoughts there?","Kent J. Thiry","Okay, Justin. You could answer the question that you have asked, and so I'll go through it, that we, every quarter of every year, look at our alternatives for cash deployment and our overall capital structure. And at different times in our history, we've bought back a lot of shares, we've paid down debt and we've done acquisitions, and sometimes, we've also just held a fair amount of cash. And then on the capital structure side, as you know, our long-term stated goal is to be between 3 and 3.5x in terms of a leverage ratio, and there are times that we have gone much higher, when we thought that we weren't exposing our shareholders to inappropriate risk for the near term because the probabilities that we were going to quickly move it back in line were exceptionally high. And there's times that we've gone under, and in some cases, that was because we wanted to prepare for doing a large deal. And so we haven't changed one bit in terms of our analytical discipline around thinking about what to do with cash. If we don't spend -- and this would be sad, but if we don't have enough opportunities to spend our cash in growth, then we will stare at share repurchase versus debt repayment. And so much of that will be driven by what we've hedged and what we haven't, what's going on with interest rates and what's going on with our share price and markets' expectations for the future vis\u2013\u00e0\u2013vis ours. So I know that's a pretty comprehensive yet generic answer, and if you want to push back on some part of it, feel free. But otherwise, it's sort of same practice we've always had.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess maybe I will push back on that last answer then. I guess when I think about the cash on the balance sheet right now, I mean historically DaVita operated somewhere between $300 million and $500 million cash on the balance sheet. And when you got above $500 million, it kind of felt like you were closer to doing something with that cash, in that realm of moving towards share repurchase or debt paydown, what have you. Is that the same way to think about it after HealthCare Partners? Or as a bigger company, do you need more cash on the balance sheet to run the business? Or does that not really change your view about...","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, I think you wouldn't want to use the same number going forward as you've used in the past just because the number is more a question of proportion, and our larger size and some of the dynamics around being a new enterprise with a new line of business would also affect that answer. But directionally, we might very well carry more cash in the future than we have in the past, just because we're a lot bigger, and because on the HealthCare Partners side of the business, there might be some very serious deals on the table in the years to come.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. The counterargument could be you're more diversified, and therefore, the risk of having a situation where you had a cash flow situation in a given quarter or year would be less as well. You might not need to change that, but it sounds like it's partly just being a bigger company, but partly also flexibility and the opportunity set that you see. Is that correct?","Kent J. Thiry","Your point is very well taken, and then you've got to factor that -- in addition to what you just said, you need to factor in the capital structure at the time because if our leverage ratio is unusually low, then we might be even more comfortable with having less cash. If our leverage ratio is relatively high, then it goes the other way. I already referred to sort of the outlook on near-term scale acquisitions and then, of course, also just our expectation of what's going on in the debt markets. So it's -- that's why we revisit it so holistically every 3 to 6 months because there's so many variables to take into account in order that we get you guys the right risk-reward relationship on that cash.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just thinking about the quarter and the guidance. I mean obviously, it's early in the year, so that could explain the rationale for kind of keeping the guidance where it is. But given how good the quarter was versus your early expectations on it, why isn't there more flow-through into the 2013 numbers?","Kent J. Thiry","Okay. Say that question one more time, so I try to [indiscernible]","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division",".","Well, you exceeded both the dialysis operating income and the physician operating income and -- but you kept the outlook for 2013 intact, so why wasn't the better Q4 run rate annualized into the following year?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, I guess a little bit like if your quarterback has a really good game and completes a very high percentage of their passes and doesn't have any interceptions, you applaud them because the game was the game and you won, but you don't necessarily predict that for the next game or for the rest of the season. The fact is both enterprises operated really well in 2012. And part of that was good scale and hard work, and there's always an element of luck in tailwinds and headwinds. And so I think we had a really good game, and we're proud of it. And it goes in the books, and the cash goes in the bank. And the clinical outcomes go to our patients, and the savings go to the taxpayer. And 2013 is a new game, and we're playing against some formidable opponents. And we've got to wait and see how we do.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So -- but there's nothing unusual in that Q4 number that would argue against you completing 70% of your passes next year per se?","Kent J. Thiry","I don't have a good answer to that. I'll give other people a moment to think. What I would say to you is that even if the answer is no, there was nothing unusual, nonetheless, extrapolation from a strong year is a dangerous thing to do.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, there were 2 things that you guys mentioned in your comments. I don't know if they have any impact on this. I guess you sold your -- obviously you are selling your home infusion. I don't think that deal has closed yet. Does that have any impact on operating income versus your original guidance?","Kent J. Thiry","We closed it. That is a good thing for shareholders, basically got our money back, mas o menos a little, and it doesn't have any impact on our income.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I think you mentioned that D&A came in $3 million lower than what you were thinking. I mean, I guess you guys gave a -- you gave the guidance for D&A, but does that -- wouldn't that flow through to 2013 as another $20 million tailwind to the number, annualized?","Kent J. Thiry","Let me just amend my HomeChoice comment. It would have no material impact on our operating income, very, very tiny. On your other question, I'll turn that over to Jim.","James K. Hilger","The D&A impact in -- against what we have previously guided to is more in the range of $12 million to $15 million, not $20 million. And that is -- that adjustment was in the range of our guidance, although, of course, it moves us -- our point estimate then would move within that range because of that, but other factors could play against it.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and then last, last question -- or maybe 2 questions on this. I think, Kent, you talked about the CMS demo as being subscale, and I guess wanted to understand what that comment was referring to. I guess it looked like there was a minimum of 500 patients, and I guess in a geographic region, the way CMS is defining it here, what is a reasonable population to think of if you were to participate in a region and what number do you think that needs to be to be a \"scale\" demonstration?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, there's 2 different issues there. One is what's minimum scale. And the second is what is the scale that we think we could handle and dramatically improve clinical care a lot of people get and the economic performance that the taxpayer gets. So those are 2 very different answers. But they're talking about 10 to 15 markets, and the way they've defined market is such that if you assume -- if we decided to do this, which, again, right now we wouldn't, and if we were granted 4 of them out of the 15, so this is all just setting up a scenario, that we probably couldn't do more than 6,000 or 7,000 patients, which is a lot better than 600, but frustrating given we could do so much more.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And is that -- but that's still not the -- I guess when you say scale, you talked about the scale necessary to recoup the investments that you'd be making after the 3-year kind of rebasing of things. Is there a size that you have in mind where it has to be x or y before you get to that tipping point?","Kent J. Thiry","Given their current provision, the -- it would take infinite scale because it looks like the model doesn't really work. So we can't -- until there's some clarification and unless there's some changes, there may not be enough patients in America to reach the scale required to get a return.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question, I think you just answered it. But when I was reading that 10 to 15 participants, I wasn't sure whether they meant markets or whether they meant actual participants, whether DaVita would be one participant or 5 markets in that analysis. Your understanding is that it would be markets and that DaVita can be multiple markets or multiple participants in that 10 to 15?","Kent J. Thiry","Exactly.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Borsch.","Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Brian Zimmerman in for Matt. Now that 2014 is drawing near, can you give us a refresher on how coverage expansion under health care reform will affect your top and bottom lines from a directional standpoint?","Kent J. Thiry","I'll comment on it for kidney care, and then I'll ask Bob or Matthew to comment on it for HealthCare Partners. On the kidney care side, it's impossible to know right now, and there's probably more downside than upside. That the variables are how many patients that we currently take care of or would otherwise take care of at private rates that are higher than what the exchange will reimburse will move into exchanges because each one of those who does is, of course, an incremental negative, versus how many people are currently uninsured and\/or in some form of reimbursement like Medicaid or other special program who move into being covered by private insurance and are at higher rates. And so it's a question of volume moving each direction and the average differential rate. And of course, our point of view is we don't want to be doing dialysis for lower rates in the exchanges than we do for our current private payers. Some of them will want us to do that at a lower rate, and from our point of view, there'd be no reason to. So it's going to be quite the tussle for everyone. And so on the kidney care side, those are the elements of the equation, and you'll have to plug in your own assumptions. Our current range of estimates is way too wide to be useful to you. You'd just get frustrated if we shared it. I'll now turn it to Bob.","Robert J. Margolis","I think on the HealthCare Partners side, I can reflect a lot of the same uncertainty you just heard from Kent. Some of the variables are that we believe that as an organization that wants to serve all of the members of our communities, that it's a big opportunity to learn how to, in a high-quality manner and with some margin, be able to serve folks that don't have insurance. There'll be millions more under Medicaid. As you well know, under health reform, this is outside the exchange, but we are honing our capabilities in -- by acquiring affiliate networks, as we've announced, that have some experience in successfully managing the Medicaid population. So we think that's a bit of an upside opportunity, though it's yet to be determined whether that will have any margin. On the exchange piece, it's very much the same unknowns. The rates have not been defined as to how the exchange will contract with organizations and at what rates, be they Medicare or more towards Medicaid. If there are newly insured patients at reasonable reimbursement, it could be a nice upside. On the other hand, if a lot of employers choose to move their employees from fully insured products into the exchange and drop the employer-based benefits, that could be a negative drag, if the rates don't support good care. So I think for modeling, it's still way too early to make a firm determination.","Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I know you guys mentioned the exchange rates are pretty wide. But I guess, we're just trying to make some assumptions around that, would you say that they're going to be closer towards commercial rates or more towards Medicare-type rates on the dialysis side?","Kent J. Thiry","If the government steps into the world of mandating them, then they're going to be closer to Medicare. It doesn't appear likely that, that's going to happen. But if the government mandates premiums, it creates some real derivative pressure on anybody who's subject to that. And then you move to predicting what other providers will do. And I don't think a lot of providers in the kidney care area are going to want to offer lower private rates to the exchanges except to the extent that they can because you've got some people at lower rates now that are moving in, and therefore, you could offer a lower private rate because the net keeps you whole. In a world where the 10% of our patients that are private subsidize the 90% that are in the government, there's very little room for providers to move, any provider. So I always have to add that you can never predict for sure what the government will do and what other kidney care providers will do. But everybody operates within the same economic reality, and so you're going to have payers trying to push for lower rates and providers pushing back, and it's pretty hard to say who's going to win. And Bob, on HCP?","Robert J. Margolis","It's very much the same. As we just said, rates are, you've seen one exchange, you've seen one exchange. Unfortunately, as you well know, the government -- the federal government punted the essential benefit package back to the states, so every state and every exchange is defining whether they're going to have a rich benefit package and how they balance that against the affordability requirement of the Affordable Care Act. And as we all know, about half the states are waiting for the federal government to set up the exchange, so we don't have any idea how that will get, the timing of that and the effectiveness of it and the membership within the exchange. So I think you can take to the bank, at the moment, that there's so much uncertainty that you can't take much to the bank.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Darren Lehrich.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I did have some questions on HCP. And given that this is our first opportunity to see how you're going to be reporting some of the business metrics there, I guess I just want to understand exactly what we'll be seeing here. And so the disclosure around capitated membership, first, I guess the question would be, can you just maybe clarify for us what is there? I mean, it seems like some of the acquisitions that had tens of thousands patients in the fourth quarter are included in that number. So should we be thinking about those patients on a path-to-risk basis? And maybe can you just help us think about the sort of the scope and scale of HCP in relation to the patient numbers we're getting now?","Kent J. Thiry","Darren, could you please repeat your question so we don't ramble all over?","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sure, okay. So I think you've given us, in some of the S-4 filings, enrollment numbers for HCP. And what we have here in the December period was 723,999 capitated members. But there were, I don't know, I think 180,000 patients in ABQ. In Arta, they were -- there was another number. So I'm just trying to foot to the membership numbers just to understand what we're going to get on a quarterly basis and then how some of these other patients fit in?","Matthew Mazdyasni","I hate to say it, but it's a little bit complicated for us to report because each member is different. For example, in some of our commercial revenues or membership, we have point-of-services members that we're not capitated for it. What we try to do here, we tried to only report the members that we are either receiving global cap or we're managing global capitation for it. So it does not include, as far as that number is concerned, any of our fee-for-service members or patients and any members that we have that we are either not receiving global capitation for it or managing global capitation. Just to give you an example, in Nevada, we have some commercial members that they were based on professional capitation. So that's what we reported here at this time. And then, we separated our revenue by sources because Medicaid member capitation is very different from a Medicare Advantage, very different from a commercial.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's exactly what I thought. I just -- I wanted to be perfectly clear about this it will obviously be in your press releases going forward. So if we think about just the patients that fall outside of this enrollment metric, I mean, can you maybe size that for us and give us a sense for the numbers, maybe broadly speaking that might be on a path to some global cap?","Kent J. Thiry","We'll think about that, Darren. We're still noodling over what are the most useful set of metrics to provide to help you guys assess risk and reward and performance, so it's a good thought. We're playing with it. The math, the shareholder math is dominated by the global population numbers, which is why we've put that out there. And how we refine that or add to it, gets tricky because some of the numbers could be quite misleading as they go up or down in terms of any impact on your equation. So let's just keep discussing it every quarter, and we'll try to get to the right place.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Understood, okay. So just on the point of membership, I think a prior question had asked about the 45-day period. I'm actually curious just to know what your health plan partners did experience in terms of open enrollment. Can you just maybe comment broadly on membership growth in the legacy business?","Kent J. Thiry","Hold 1 sec just so we get our act together in terms of what we've already disclosed and what we haven't. So given this is our first time, we want to make sure we don't confuse anyone.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gary Lieberman.","Jim Gustafson","Just on the last question, Darren, we haven't made any disclosure to this point on what's happened so far in January and this year, and we're not in a position to do so. Go ahead, Gary. Sorry about that.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Maybe just ask a couple more questions on HCP. So in the second quarter of 2012, I think the reported member number was 620,000. Is that a comparable number to the 600 -- to the 724,000 that was reported this quarter?","Matthew Mazdyasni","That's accurate, yes.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And so is most of that increase from acquisition? Or could you tell us the percentage of increase that was from acquisition versus organic growth?","Matthew Mazdyasni","I think most of it was from acquisition, and that's why we're also showing you member months because, for example, we had an acquisition in southern California effective September 1, so the member months for that acquisition is only for 4 months during 2012 versus our legacy member that has 12 months.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So if we're thinking about member months on a -- sort of on a run-rate basis, quarterly, is there a way you can sort of give us a range of kind of the number we should be thinking about? Is it sort of 2.1 million or 2.2 million?","Matthew Mazdyasni","I think, as Kent said, we'll continue thinking about how we can best report all of our membership numbers that would be useful to all of you.","Jim Gustafson","Gary, the member months in there represent 2 months because that's the time period during which this has been a combined entity, and this reporting reflects the November, December time period. So hopefully, that helps you pro forma that.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's useful. And then, I guess, just going back to the guidance of the $400 million to $450 million for HealthCare Partners, maybe you've said this before. Does that assume some number of acquisitions? Or does that assume no acquisitions?","Kent J. Thiry","We do incorporate our acquisition expectations into our forecasts. And of course, it's always a prediction that has a wide range of potential outcomes below or above what we predict.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So then, and you may have answered some of this with a previous question, but given that HealthCare Partners did $67 million of EBIT in the quarter, combined with the statement that fourth quarter is usually a light quarter, it's already on a run rate of over $400 million of EBIT. So is that a fair way to look at it? And so are you guys just being conservative? Or is there something else that we should be taking into consideration?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, I'll repeat what I've said, and then any of my partners here might want to add to it. 2012 was an outstanding operating year for both companies. Anybody want to add anything?","James K. Hilger","I would just say that it's an operating income, not an EBITDA range of $400 million to $450 million, Gary.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Sorry if I misstated that. Okay. And then I guess moving on to a couple of kidney care questions. Did you guys have any EPO price increase on the beginning of January as you typically do?","Kent J. Thiry","I don't know that we've disclosed anything about what's going on with EPO pricing. So let us think about that, and you can ask again next quarter. But up to this point, we have not disclosed anything. And to everyone, please do share your thoughts with Jim Gustafson about what other quarterly reporting you think we should add in order to be useful.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ben Andrew.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First question for me is has there been any directional change in behavior or magnitude of change on the part of the commercial payers, given some of the changing backdrops? Or is this more anticipatory commentary?","Kent J. Thiry","I think, on both sides, we're experiencing the normal intense debates and discussions with commercial payers about our rates and other terms, that it's always been intense. It will always be intense, and there's nothing dramatically different. Maybe on the margin, you say exchanges -- exchanges create more conversations, but the intensity is the same as it always has been and always will be.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then, maybe a question on HCP more generally. Have you noticed a difference in the behavior pattern aside from maybe what's going on in Albuquerque with the different constituents that HCP interacts with after the execution of the transaction? Has there been sort of a change in tone or behavior pattern that is noticeable or meaningful?","Robert J. Margolis","I'll try to answer that. We've not seen anything that's dramatic. I think that as you might expect, folks noticed that this transaction was large and that our historical financials were now transparent. But we deal primarily or often with plans and with big systems that are also for-profit. So to them, that's not a giant change. And our conversations with physicians, with other constituents have been pretty much on line with what we had before. So pretty much everyone is aware that we're part of a bigger enterprise, that we have a great opportunity to transform American health care in a positive view, and we're pushing forward with that conversation and that mission in all these discussions, and I think folks view us now as a more larger and more credible partner in that transformation.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then, Kent, just briefly, in terms of the ACO project, is there a time frame that you have in mind where perhaps you could influence and lead to a change in what that structure of the program might look like? Is that 6 months, 3 months, another 3 years? I mean how do you think about that internally?","Kent J. Thiry","I think the time frame is -- a fair question. The time frame is quite short. They're interested in feedback from not just us but from the community very quickly, and they may change nothing and they may change a lot. They have total freedom. But I think it's all going to happen relatively quickly, so it's not years, it's months.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","At this point, it appears both LDOs don't have a lot of interest in the program. Would you suggest that they would fail to the extent that, that doesn't change?","Kent J. Thiry","I -- you'd have to ask them, of course, but even if you just get a couple small players to do it, you're really putting at risk having this proven technology established and standardized in the way that it could benefit everyone. So I think from a policy point of view, it would be hugely disappointing, given everyone's objective is to improve the care and reduce the cost. So -- but who knows, they may be just fine if 2 LDOs don't do anything. And they get some smaller players to do smaller things in some parts of the country, maybe they would be happy with that. I think a lot of other people would be really disappointed, but I think you'd just have to ask them.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gary Taylor.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have a few quick ones.  First, I think at least 2 of the last 3 quarters, you've given us kind of a full quarter pro forma HCP EBITDA figure. Would you provide that for the fourth quarter?","Kent J. Thiry","Can you repeat the question?","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Do you have a fourth quarter 2012 HCP EBITDA figure for the full 3 months?","Jim Gustafson","We don't have that in front of us. I'd have to -- I don't know if we've disclosed it before. If we have, I can give it to you later.","James K. Hilger","We haven't disclosed it, but there were a number of distinct charges in the fourth quarter that make that number difficult to be comparable.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I know we've had it at least 2 of the last 3 quarters, but I'll move on. Another question, I know the L.A. Times last week reported that HCP was applying for limited Knox-Keene license in California. I presume there'd be some increased capital requirements it looks like you could easily handle. But I have 2 questions. One, would this in any way make your California business subject to the minimum MLR ratios? And two, why are you pursuing that limited license?","Robert J. Margolis","Great question. We, as we previously reported, are a Pioneer ACO in 3 states, including California. We are in the second year of the Pioneer ACO. According to the rules of the Pioneer ACO, we can, if we're successful in the first 2 years and it makes economic sense, apply for full global capitation for that capitated -- for that population that's in that ACO. According to the state, in order to take full capitation, including institutional, we have to apply and obtain a limited Knox-Keene license. Now let me just describe what we call limited Knox-Keene. I think it's called a Knox-Keene with certain limitations, it's not officially called that. It's a requirement by the state, but it does not put us in the position where we are a fully licensed insurer. We're not in the position nor do we plan to be in the position to market and sell directly to employers. It's just a requirement of the movement to the Pioneer ACO. At the same time, you have seen that we have all of this global capitation, including some that's under management, as opposed to direct, and we would have the opportunity in the Knox-Keene, should we choose to take that direct global capitation in California instead of just under management. So those are 2 reasons that the Knox-Keene makes good sense. There are capital requirements, but those are minimal and actually no greater than the reserves that we have in place for this managed global capitation or global risk that we manage now.","Matthew Mazdyasni","Let me try to also answer the first part of your question. Would that make us subject to MLR? That's not the case because we're not receiving premium from payers or employers. We are -- it's a plan-to-plan, so we as a limited Knox-Keene will be contracting with full Knox-Keene plans who are receiving. So those entities are subject to MLR. We are not because we're not directly receiving from the payer, with exception of Pioneer ACO.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And would you anticipate pursuing any other limited license in other states you operate in as part of the Pioneer ACO or for other reasons? Is that foreseeable?","Robert J. Margolis","Only if it makes sense because of the market requirements in order to produce the kind of global management that we think benefits patients and coordinates care. At this point, we do not intend to become an insurance company, if that's the question that you're asking.","Matthew Mazdyasni","Also the other 2 markets that we have Pioneer ACO, which is Nevada and Florida, do not require any special license because these are Medicare. So it is allowable, without any special license, to receive global capitation from CMMI, which is part of CMS.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. Appreciate it. Last question is for Kent. My actual question is, I'm not sure if you saw it, you probably did this morning, but Affymax had put out a release today about Fresenius, I guess, discontinuing the -- I guess, the demonstration they were doing, and they cited -- Fresenius, in a letter to physicians, had cited some potential allergic reactions that patients were having. The question I have is, if this proves to be problematic for AFFY and we have less ESA price competition in the future, does that have any implications for your existing 7-year contract with Amgen?","Kent J. Thiry","This is news to me. And so please take that into account as I grope for a response. If AFFY is less credible, I don't know that, that implies less credible in the near term, I don't know that, that implies anything for us. As we've said many times, the reason we did the 7-year partnership with Amgen is -- was heavily influenced by the fact that it's the gold standard of ESAs in the world. And so I can't think of anything that would change in anything that we've said. But I know so little, I only know what you just told me, that I have to reserve the right to change that answer in the future.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. I think some analysts have speculated there was perhaps some sort of price guarantees in the Amgen contract, and I thought there was some commentary from a conference earlier this year where you had stated that, that equivocally was not the case. But I didn't presume this would change anything. I don't know if you'd care to comment on that or just let it go.","Kent J. Thiry","To the best of my knowledge, everything I've said on the subject has been true. Whatever I said, I think, still applies. I couldn't tell exactly what you were saying, which is why I'm wording my sentence...","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, I think you're -- I think everything you've said is consistent, so I was just giving you a chance to elaborate on that but I get it. I appreciate it.","Kent J. Thiry","Thanks a lot.","Jim Gustafson","And let me break in with one thing, Gary. I think we can report that normalized for nonrecurring deal items for HealthCare Partners, the full year EBITDA was $583 million for 2012. So we're comfortable disclosing that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Ransom.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","As I think about you going into new markets, what are the dynamics now versus maybe a couple of years ago? Are hospitals, in particular, already rounding up the big physician groups and trying to engineer these risk-sharing models? Is there less oxygen in the room? And how do you think about the various players in the, let's say, the top 100 markets, hospitals versus insurance companies? They seem to be taking the lead. And how is the role for HealthCare Partners different, the same versus a couple of years ago when this was kind of novel?","Robert J. Margolis","Well, let me take a shot at it. It's the kind of question that we -- provokes a lot of strategic discussion internally. As you aptly stated, hospitals are the center of the universe in a lot of communities for the physician networks. Hospitals in our view, and I don't think this is in all cases, but in many cases, have chosen to employ or buy practices of a lot of physicians, especially specialists that would provide the high reimbursement procedures. And in our view, in most cases, the hospital consolidation has caused increases, which, as you may have read, caused a bunch of inquiries as to whether it's appropriate. So that is going on and reduces the number of physicians in certain communities. Certain health plans, most notably, Optum, United as well as Humana, have announced deals and so on. So competition is a reality, but the facts of the matter are that it's a vast country. Most of health care in America is in the atomized or fragmented fee-for-service individual and small group practice. There are a lot of practices, both large and small, that don't see linking up with a hospital and\/or a health plan as in their best strategic interest. And as we've previously described, our pipeline is strong. And so it's a big America, and I don't think that the oxygen has been sucked out of the room, as you say. But you're right, there's competition, and as Kent mentioned earlier, there may be price competition that we think is not in our best interest and some acquisitions.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I'm either -- again, we're just still learning basic things. But let's say, for example, that the Medicare Advantage rates in your market next year are down 6.2% or something. Is it a straight line? I know it's not a straight line, but how should we extrapolate the MA rates to the rates that you get? Or is it just straight one for one, and it is a straight line and you've got to find ways to offset it?","Robert J. Margolis","The parity that is demanded under the Medicare Advantage changes that was passed a few years ago is baked into all of our analyses and assumptions, and varies, as you know, state to state. But it is specifically mitigated, in some cases and in many cases, by the fact that benefits are extremely rich relative to fee-for-service Medicare in all of the markets that we're currently in, so there's some shift in benefits that reduces the impact of those direct cuts, in other words, making the benefits a little bit less rich for the patient, but still significantly rich enough to encourage patients to choose Medicare Advantage. There's the risk adjustment, which is based on accurate and good documentation, that is a significant and has been a significant offset of the Medicare cost rebasing. And last of all, there's the opportunity to significantly continue to improve clinical performance and reduce the cost of the care that we deliver. So while we think we do it quite well, we know there's still significant variation in the results across networks and certainly across America. So those are headwinds, there's no doubt, that's been told in many of these conferences up until now. But there are offsetting factors. And the last one, which I should mention, of course, is the quality ratings, the star ratings of the health plan. While the star rating is at the health plan level, not at the HealthCare Partners level, certainly in markets where we're a significant portion of that health plan, our quality ratings are usually higher than their network average and help bring up their star rating and therefore their reimbursement. And actually, it's another reason that health plans like working with us and potentially helping to consolidate their networks with HealthCare Partners and DaVita to improve their quality ratings.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Do you still think about something in the neighborhood of a 40% apples-to-apples difference between what you can do and what an unmanaged population looks like? I remember that number, maybe it was hospital-based, but is that -- how do you think about today the apples-to-apples cost differences between identical populations?","Robert J. Margolis","I don't [indiscernible] specific cost of care but -- because I don't have that off the top of my head. But you're right, in the Medicare Advantage space, our utilization of hospital days have been traditionally about 40% less than national average.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Lisa Crye [ph] .","Unknown Analyst","Just going back to the discussion around exchange rates. One thing that's just confused me about the discussion here is, historically, insurance companies have been competing against one another for big contracts from employers. And under the exchanges, they're simply going to be competing with each other, albeit on a different type of playing field, but still it's a similar head-to-head competition nonetheless. So in my view, I think the only thing that really gives them more leverage is, as you said, the government does get involved in terms of setting premiums, et cetera. But in the absence of that, do you think that just the structure of the exchanges somehow gives insurance companies more leverage with health care providers like hospitals, like dialysis clinics? I just figure it's really that change in negotiating power that can potentially change rates.","Kent J. Thiry","I think if you posit that plan can offer a provider incremental volume because there is increased market fluidity prompted by the exchanges, then I think there is linear logic to support the notion that a payer would pick up some new leverage.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. That makes sense. And then, just one second question. Just looking at the health care business, the dollars under management that you reported of $614 million, I just want to make sure I'm comparing figures sort of apples to apples. It looks like it was down on what you reported as a 2011 full year figure. Could you just comment on that?","Matthew Mazdyasni","I have the 2011, but this is obviously -- the 2 months you're referring to, you're extrapolating from the 2 months?","Unknown Analyst","Yes, it was just a little bit unclear whether it was sort of -- whether it was just a figure for 2 months or whether it could be compared on a full year basis?","Matthew Mazdyasni","I'm sorry, so that's only for 2 months. That number is only for 2 months.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Whit Mayo.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Kent, this question really relates to the comments you made earlier on exchanges. Do you have a sense of what percent of your dialysis commercial patients are actually small group? I just have to believe that it's relatively small.","Kent J. Thiry","We do know that number. We've never disclosed it. So why don't you let us think about whether or not we would disclose it over the next quarter.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. That might just be helpful to sort of help us size up what any exposure could be if, obviously, employers in the small group market did dump their employees, but I think it is small. The other question that I had is, I guess, for Bob. Looking back at 2012 and recognizing that there's a lot of moving pieces here, what do you think that the organic revenue and EBITDA growth was? I'm just trying to get a sense of really what the business growth profile is. I know it's kind of a complicated question, but would be helpful.","Robert J. Margolis","Could you repeat the question, please?","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, I guess if you just made a guess and said looking back at 2012, we take out some of the acquisitions, take out some of the outlier items, what the organic revenue and EBITDA growth would've been.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, that -- okay. No, we cannot answer that now. Should we think about answering that in the future is a good question. It gets to be pretty seriously definitional, however, because tuck-in acquisitions are really an important part of our HealthCare Partners model, and we almost think of that as organic growth, because so much of it is -- might be IPAs with whom we worked for 5 years or practices with whom we worked for 5 years, et cetera, et cetera. So it's a little different than our kidney care model. Although even the kidney care, de novos, to some extent, are very linked to our existing positions in many markets, which is why we provide non-acquired growth that combines both classic same-store growth with de novo growth, as opposed to reporting same-store by itself because often we cannibalize our same-store growth in order to secure greater overall market positioning. So I don't know if we can come up with a metric there that's going to work for you, but let us think about it, because it's a very fair question.","Matthew Mazdyasni","Just to add to that, I think this growth will become interesting because we are not only experiencing the groups who are talking to us, we are also working with health plans who want us to go to new markets, and that's not going to be something that we are acquiring. We're just going to new markets and growing that way, too. So this whole issue of organic versus growth is going to get even more complicated.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, I understand. And I guess one last one here. I think if I recall, there's been some historical discrimination with the Medicare Advantage that I think a lot of the dialysis patients cannot be enrolled in an MA plan if they already have ESRD. And I guess I'm just wondering if there's any movement from an advocacy perspective to try to alter some of that discrimination, I know if LeAnne's around -- so just kind of curious where that stands.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, the fact is it's a historical artifact, when HMOs were invented and people were, in some cases, legitimately very concerned about caregivers and owners of HMO plans withholding care, because of that concern, dialysis patients were excluded from signing up for a plan in order to protect them from their own selection, if they already had, had kidney failure. So that's the historical logic for it. Now it is quite the ridiculous provision that actually hurts these patients because often in our work with Medicare Advantage plans, we're able to provide additional services consistent with the Medicare Advantage plan, offering additional services in many other areas, most prominently by working with people like our HealthCare Partners team, in order to do a lot of extra stuff and save in total cost. And so it's gone from something that was to protect the patient to something that hurts thousands of patients. Having said that, we've had so many other policy fish to fry the last several years that we've never mounted, and the patients have never mounted a serious attack on this quite ridiculous discriminatory -- uniquely discriminatory provision. And so maybe that's something that we'll work on in the next year or 2 or 3 because there really is terrible, terrible policy.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Kevin Ellich.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to Gary's comment or question on AFFY. It sounds like Fresenius actually just paused the trial, they didn't discontinue it. But nonetheless, have you guys given any consideration in using other ESAs as an option, Kent?","Kent J. Thiry","The answer to the question you asked is, yes, we have given a lot of consideration to this, and we'll continue to.

Is there any update on the CFO position? I know Jim is still interim. We like working with him, but just wondering if there was any movement on that front.","Kent J.

My name is Chris, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the DaVita HealthCare Partners Fourth Quarter 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Jim Gustafson, you may begin your conference.","Jim Gustafson","Thank you, Chris, and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company.","I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations; and with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Bob Margolis, CEO of HealthCare Partners; Craig Samitt, President of HealthCare Partners; Garry Menzel, our CFO; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason. Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry","Okay. Thank you, Jim. We had solid clinical and operating performance in the fourth quarter. I'll cover 4 topics: clinical performance, operating performance, an update on our government settlement and our outlook.","First, clinical outcomes, which we always present first, because that is what comes first. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. On the DaVita Kidney Care side, we serve approximately 163,000 dialysis patients in America, about 1 out of every 3. On the adequacy front, 98% of our hemo patients had a Kt\/V greater than 1.2.","On vascular access front, 72% of our patients have fistulas; and 2013 was our best year ever in catheter rates with about 13% of our patients only using catheters.","With respect to clinical metrics for HealthCare Partners, MA plans are benchmarked against national clinical outcome measures from the Healthcare Effectiveness Data Information Set, commonly called HEDIS. In the last 2 quarters, we discussed our 2012 performance in California and Florida. This quarter, we'll compare our results in Nevada, our third legacy market to that national data from Medicare HMO patients.","Our Nevada MA patients once again scored near the top across a wide variety of metrics, including being above the 75th percentile with respect to the percentage of patients screened for colorectal cancer and the percentage of diabetics with LDL less than 100 and being right underneath the 75th percentile, at 74%, in terms of female patients screened for breast cancer during the measurement period. So you can see, for these clinical outcomes across both Kidney Care and HealthCare Partners, our outcomes compare very favorably to national averages and this quality care results, not only in healthier patients, but higher patient satisfaction and substantial taxpayer savings.","Next, I'll move on to operating performance. Of course, we report on the 2 major components of the enterprise: Kidney Care on the one hand, HealthCare Partners on the other. Kidney Care 2013 adjusted OI, $1.513 billion; and HealthCare Partners 2013 OI, $385 million. Both of those in line with our most recent guidance for 2013.","Dialysis G&A in the fourth quarter included $8.5 million in dialysis center level impairments. This was required by Medicare rebasing, which requires us to impair certain assets that were no longer -- no longer had any hopes for being profitable. In addition to this impairment, it looks like we will be closing some centers. As most of you know, we carry quite a few money-losing centers but there does have to be some limit; and with the breadth and depth of the Medicare cuts, both incurred and contemplated, we simply have no choice in markets where there aren't enough private patients to subsidize the federal government with respect to the Medicare patients.","Next, on to our settlement with the government. As most of you saw today in our press release, we have agreed to a framework for a global resolution with the government. We are pleased to have this framework in place. And the final settlement remains subject to negotiating specific terms, but we do anticipate it will be finalized in the coming months as they do. The settlement amount is the same as we have talked about in the past. In addition, we will unwind a limited number of joint ventures and face some other business restrictions. Gary will describe those in more detail in his section. But we repeat, we are pleased to have this framework in place and think you should be as well.","Finally, our outlook. We are updating our 2014 operating income guidance. We now expect Kidney Care OI to be between $1.475 billion and $1.550 billion. This is an increase of $50 million at the bottom end and $10 million at the top end. The primary driver of this change is the slower rollout of exchanges and so that will create less rate headwind for us, we think. Over the long term, we still see more downside than upside in the exchanges.","On the HCP front, guidance remains unchanged at $250 million to $310 million, but we are now more likely to be at the lower end of that guidance range than we are to be in the middle or higher end. The primary driver of that new reality is the New Mexico merger of the Lovelace-Blue Cross Blue Shield combination that, that approval by the government has been delayed and that has a negative effect on our economics. Our outlook is unchanged in the 3 HCP legacy geographies. And in general, the guidance excludes the potential impact of entering new geographies, which, depending on the type and structure of new marketing entries, could either be a positive contributor or a negative contributor to OI, depending on the nature of the beast.","As always, our guidance captures a majority of the probabilistic outcomes, but not all and the actual outcome could be higher or lower. An additional thought on HCP is that we have had some positive signs in our open enrollment. We're looking at mid- to high-single-digit growth in our major geographies, which is good news directionally although, of course, we need to prove that over the next 1 or 2 or 3 years, that we can improve the care of those patients such that we capture, not only the clinical benefits for our patients, but the economic benefits for our shareholders.","I'd like to now turn the mic over to Dr. Bob Margolis.","Robert J. Margolis","Thank you, Kent. Good afternoon. I've had just the great honor and privilege to lead HCP for almost 40 years. But as has been previously announced, I'll be stepping down as of March 1 and my role will be handed over to Dr. Craig Samitt. Craig's been learning, listening hard, orienting, leading the HCP teammates in all of our markets for close to 6 months now and we are now ready to proceed with this planned transition, as I say, on March 1. Craig has an enormous background in both M.D. training and business training, a great commitment to our clinical leadership culture necessary to move HCP to even greater heights. And I personally look forward to supporting him in my new role as a strategic adviser to the company, as I remain actively involved, especially in growth initiatives, as well as remaining Co-Chairman of the board of DaVita HealthCare Partners.","I'll now turn it over to Garry Menzel, our CFO, for more detail on the numbers.","Garry E. Menzel","Thank you, Bob. First, some additional comments on our Kidney Care operating metrics. Non-acquired growth in the quarter was 5.2% when normalized for days of the week. Kidney Care adjusted operating income was $386 million, which was flat sequentially to the fourth quarter as U.S. dialysis revenue per treatment, dialysis patient care costs and G&A were all in line with the prior quarter. During the quarter, we experienced $11 million in international losses, slightly higher than our expectations. As previously communicated, we expect international losses in 2014 to be around $25 million, excluding any ramp-up costs for new government tenders.","Next, we know some of the questions you no doubt have on the government settlement, so we will now ask and answer them proactively.","Question: What does it mean to unwind a joint venture?","Answer: It means that we will have to buy out or sell to our joint venture partner at fair market value. In most cases, we would anticipate being the purchaser.","Question: How many joint ventures have we agreed to unwind?","Answer: Most likely 11 transactions containing 28 centers. Nothing is remarkably different about the size or operations of these centers.","Question: Were there any allegations relating to quality of patient care?","Answer: No.","Question: Is our business model reliant on joint ventures?","Answer: No. More than 70% of our centers are wholly owned.","Question: Will we still be able to do joint ventures that are not partial divestitures?","Answer: Yes. And we look forward to working collaboratively with the government to ensure we are doing joint ventures in a way in which the government is comfortable.","Next, HealthCare Partners. HCP operating income was also flat sequentially in the fourth quarter at $98 million. For the overall enterprise, our debt expense was $108 million in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate was 39% in the quarter, although we expect this to be in the range of 40% to 41% for 2014.","I would also like to provide a few reminders as you model the normal seasonality for the first quarter of 2014 in our business. In Kidney Care, the first quarter of 2014 contains 3 fewer treatment days than this past quarter, so you should expect lower revenues and higher fixed cost per treatment. Also, our payroll tax cuts reset at the beginning of the year, which leads to higher cost of approximately $1 to $1.50 per treatment. At HCP, the severity of a flu season can have a material impact on medical costs.","Finally, turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was solid at $354 million and operating cash flow for the year was particularly strong at $1.77 billion. The strong cash flow in 2013 was due in part to favorable working capital, which borrowed from 2014. We have initiated operating cash flow guidance for 2014. This coming year, we expect operating cash flow to be between $1.45 billion and $1.55 billion, excluding any payments associated with the government settlement.","With that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from Goldman Sachs.","Bo Brandt - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Bo Brandt on for Matt. Just had a question on HCP. And I was wondering how you are positioning yourself with payors to handle the potential rate update in 1.5 weeks?","Craig E. Samitt","This is Craig Samitt. Afternoon, everyone. We are certainly waiting for feedback from the government regarding the impact of rates in 2015. As we discussed in December, we've been renegotiating contract terms that provide us greater protections and inputs in plan design. We've renegotiated a contract with a large payor partner in one of our legacy markets that provides us new protections in 3 dimensions: first, in the event that benefits are increased, revenue to HCP will be increased by an independently determined value of the enhanced benefit. Second, in the event that benefits are decreased, we and the payor will seek to mutually agree on any reductions of revenue to HCP. And third, in the event that there is a material change in CMS funding or funding structure, HCP will have a 90-day notice period to drive a renegotiation of the revenue terms with the payor prior to arbitration. The third scenario is more in line with the circumstance that we faced in 2014 in terms of rates and benefit preservation. And so this is where we find our efforts in renegotiating contract terms with payors going into 2015.","Kent J. Thiry","But Matthew, let me hasten to add, that is an example of the type of work we will do going forward. We still have a number of legacy contracts that do not have those provisions and exactly what we do and what the payors do if and when there are additional rate cuts is unclear and will be determined out in the marketplace.","Bo Brandt - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just looking at sort of the 2014 HCP guidance and you mentioned how it will tend to be towards the lower end, is that based off of uncertainty around these -- the 2014 preliminary rates? Or have you sort of seen, sort of have a view into 2014 as to what's driving that?","Kent J. Thiry","No. Brian, the change in our perspective on '14 is almost entirely driven by the fact that the FTC has been slow on approving merger to plans in that market and some of our new contractual provisions are not triggered until that deal is consummated. That's why there's the adjustment in our thoughts on '14.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank.","Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a few things here. First, just given that you received the restricted Knox-Keene license status from California, should we expect to see some of your California business get recorded as full risk on the P&L this year?","Kent J. Thiry","Short answer is yes. But moving things over -- moving the contracts over takes time and so we can't give you a specific schedule. But over time, some of that will happen. Is that right, Jim?","James K. Hilger","That's right. And Darren, the net is that there won't be a bottom line impact. It is simply a revenue impact of moving from a net to gross booking for some of that revenue.","Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, but didn't you share in the risk with other parties, such that when you take full risk, the economics might, over time, be different? Just want to clarify that, Jim.","Kent J. Thiry","No. There's no change. We've always managed comprehensive populations in a comprehensive way. All that's changing here is how it gets accounted for.","Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. Okay, that's helpful. And then, wanted to also just ask about the duals opportunity and you've discussed it a lot. We're starting to see a little bit more in terms of the development around plan announcements. Do you still see your plan relationships and market share as positioning you well in California around the duals? And anything to add just based on some of this recent activity?","Kent J. Thiry","It's a moving target. As you probably know, if you've been following the releases, LA County, which is the biggest opportunity as far as numbers in dual has now announced the additions of 3 new plans. We have excellent relationships with those 2, not with CareMore. The revenue associated with the duals has not been formalized and so everybody continues to look at it as an opportunity if the revenue matches the risk. But at this point, it's hard to predict that.","Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just based on what you're hearing about plan pricing, do you think it'll be good enough to manage the population effectively?","Kent J. Thiry","We hope so. And we are certainly in active discussions with all of the relevant health plans. You may have also noted that in Orange County, they've delayed the rollout of the duals, so this will be an LA County-specific issue with those several plans that were announced.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, I just want to follow up on the Medicare Advantage commentary. I appreciate all the detail. What -- if you kind of think of about a target for -- if the bids go in for 2015 in June, Craig, what's your target there in terms of these new contractual arrangements? What percentage of members would be on those arrangements if -- in a reasonable view?","Craig E. Samitt","Well, in terms of the renegotiation of the contracts that KT and I have referenced...","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes.","Craig E. Samitt","Right now, the renegotiated contract that I referenced represents a minor subset of our overall MA population. And we will grow from there over the course of the coming years as we renegotiate the contracts.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Is there a number that, in terms of -- is 20% of members reasonable to think of on these types of contracts going into 2015 or it's just too early?","Kent J. Thiry","I think this is a little bit like as we move to bundling in the Kidney Care side, Justin, where -- I don't think it's in your best interest for us to provide quarterly updates on what percent of the contacted book falls into what categories. So suffice it to say, we're working the issue, as we pledged to you we would. And I think you'll just have to accept the fact it's incorporated into our guidance beyond that, at least for now.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And on the economic side, clearly, these are going to be a mitigator to some of the headwind. Any way to think about how much so relative to the headwind you're facing in 2014 when you didn't have these?","Kent J. Thiry","Say the question again, please, Justin?","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure. So if I do some back-of-the-envelope math, it looks like you've got a few 100-basis-point headwind in Medicare Advantage margins in HealthCare Partners this year, given the rate environment. So if we just kind of look out to 2015 and say, \"Okay, that rate environment is going to be similar,\" how much would these -- would the margins -- how much better would the margins look under these types of contracts? Just trying to understand in terms of how much you think the offset would be. Do you think margins will be flat in these types of contracts and you would get to a reasonable outcome, or down less but still down?","Kent J. Thiry","The -- it's a fair question and we are not prepared to answer that right now. So let us just play with that, Justin, and see if that's something we want to be talking about so publicly next quarter. And it won't be in the end, of course, an analytically precise number because of some of the specific variables in some of the contracts. But I hear what you're saying that with -- if we had more of what we have now with respect to that contract, how much would that mitigate. I hear the question and right now, you know it's in a minority of our contracts and so you can take that as a directional answer. And beyond that, let's wait until next quarter.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just a couple of quickies. One, the -- on the exchanges, you talked about that being less of a headwind because there's less membership there, totally understandable. But have you seen any evidence of the membership that is on the exchanges yet, having an impact on rates or where the choice of dialysis center for these patients and these exchange products?","Kent J. Thiry","As to rates, we know that we only agreed to our normal commercial rates with respect to any exchanges. At least I don't know of any exceptions to that and so if there are any, it would be very minor but it could be literally 0. We know of other people who make the same statements. We don't know where some of these patients are going to be taken care of. Some of these narrow networks do not have quality dialysis providers in them. And we have not noticed any material outflow of patients from our centers. But it's so early in the year and we don't get data from every center right away. And so, I think we have to wait a couple more months before we can comment more analytically on your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was wondering if you just had a sense of where your physician competitors are operating from a margin perspective, either when you do due diligence on a potential acquisition or just industry kind of information, how you think about HCP's margins and how they stack up versus the peers?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, I think we have limited insight into a lot of the other groups out there. So it'd be a pretty speculative answer and I think, therefore, probably not that valuable to you. I don't know, Bob, can you offer anything more definitive than that?","Robert J. Margolis","I think that's a complete answer. We do a lot of M&A due diligence and many groups are struggling, especially with the MA cut. And it's an opportunity for us when it comes to consolidation and growth.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. I mean -- and that kind of gets to the point of my question. I guess, like when we normally evaluate a health care provider, we kind of say, \"Well, what are the industry margins?\" Where can Medicare rates go from a floor perspective because they can't go to a point where they push a large sum of the providers into real crisis mode? And so I was just trying to get a sense of whether the peer margins -- because the way I understand how you thought about 2014, originally, the thought was MCOs won't be able to -- will cut benefits rather than pass the cuts on to you. And then as the year went on, you realized that they were not cutting benefits and that since your peers were taking the rate cut passed through to them, you'd kind of had to follow suit and I was just wondering whether we're getting to a point in 2015 where the peer margins are getting to a point where they really can't afford to take another rate cut the size that they took this year and that maybe your margins were better than the peers and that was going to be a sustainable point. I don't know if you have any sense of that. It sounds like, to some degree, you see that happening now, at least some of your competitor that you're evaluating it for as deals go are reaching that point. I just wasn't sure if you had a sense of where we are in that cycle.","Robert J. Margolis","Clearly, last year, we thought that the health plans would trade some growth for margin. They didn't. There's a lot of belief that they may this year, but I don't think we're ready to speculate based on our experience last year. But there's no question that the pressure on physician groups with the revenue cuts is, in some cases, going to put them in a position where they have to do something to survive.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then the protection, as you mentioned in that one contract, that's very helpful. Are these protections that you found to be somewhat standard from other practices and you're playing catch-up to that? Or are you kind of leading the way in trying to get these things to become more standard with industry practice?","Robert J. Margolis","One thing you can say about us is we learn. And so we are leading the way in what we believe is an unusual rate environment. Recognized that the last couple of years of parity and rough rescaling is a new environment compared to the many years ahead of before that. So this kind of issue was not raised frequently in contract discussions. And I'd say we are smarter now than we were a year ago and we're making good progress.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then last question for me. Just going back to the other question within Knox-Keene license, if that doesn't really help your profitability overall, what was the strategic rationale for getting a license?","Kent J. Thiry","I think, from a -- just working with the government point of view, that enough government folks preferred us to take that path. And in general, we like to work as collaboratively as possible with all government agencies. And so that was the primary motivator.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But it's not like a step towards integrated care or ACOs or anything else like that. It was just kind of to continue what you've always been doing?","Kent J. Thiry","I think on a secondary basis, it does, in some cases, create some more flexibility for doing different types of business. Although, in all of those cases, we could have entered into shared savings relationships of the same type that we had in Southern California before we did the Knox-Keene. And so it was not essential, but it will make some of those other things easier. Are those the words that would use, too, Bob?","Robert J. Margolis","Yes. I think that's -- that will give us greater flexibility.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich from Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a couple of questions, first on HCP. Kent, I was wondering if you could give us an update on your outlook for acquisitions. I guess, dependent upon what the -- how the rates look when they come out for 2015, do you think that's going to accelerate the pace of deals that you'll get done?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. It's a fair question, Kevin. But you know as well as we do, it is so hard to predict what deals are going to come out and with what pricing expectations, what your competitors are going to do. So it is logical to think that there might be some increase in M&A activity because of the squeeze going on economically. But boy, there's so many variables that I would be really hesitant to throw anything into a model.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Sure. And then does the settlement, that -- the $389 million that you guys have reserved, does that change how much you're willing to spend on deals in the next 1 to 2 years? Or I guess, how does that play into the equation?","Kent J. Thiry","The short answer is no. The types of joint ventures that are the focus of the settlement with the government are not a material part of our past nor our future and not a big part of the industry overall. And so it really has no impact on our or anybody else's acquisition thinking, would be my guess.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. You said that you'll unwind 11 JVs. How many will you have remaining after you unwind those?","Kent J. Thiry","I don't think we've ever disclosed that publicly. But suffice it to say, it's a small percentage.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then last question on the dialysis side. Just wondering if, looking at your cost structure, from supplies and other expenses, is there anything in the next 1 to 2 years that you can call out or think -- help us out with that, that could help you reduce that?","Kent J. Thiry","I would just say on both sides of the house when reimbursement gets cut, you got to look for savings and the notion of finding 0 just doesn't feel like a high-performing organization. And so while we, on both sides of the house, feel quite good about our economic prudence in the past, we will be looking at everything again with the fresh perspective that's forced by reimbursement cuts. But there's nothing -- there's no big straightforward lever to pull that we've been just sitting around not pulling before.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If I could follow up on that last comment, Kent, about the cost containment. How do you feel HCP's talked about some of what you'll be doing in face of the rate cuts to try cut costs and how would you characterize where you are in that process?","Kent J. Thiry","I think the answer would be disappointing. We don't have anything dramatic to say. We haven't had any stunning insights and the numbers that we have come up with are incorporated into our guidance. And beyond that, nothing noteworthy enough to mention. Is that -- am I answering the question, or did I blow it?","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","No, I think that's an answer. Maybe another question. You mentioned closing of some dialysis centers. Could you give us any kind of data, either number of centers or amount of revenue or EBITDA impact?","Kent J. Thiry","We haven't decided yet. And it's a, as you might guess and as many of you know, for us, an incredibly painful decision. There's a reason we carry a lot of money-losing centers, not counting de novo centers, which, of course, you expect to lose money for a while. And that is that we were a successful enterprise. We love taking care of our patients. And the notion of closing centers where we're taking care of people is just not what we're about. At the same time, there have to be limits and if the government is going to cut rates as they have and as they're contemplating, doing nothing is just not appropriate, although anything we would do would always be in careful collaboration with other people in the local market in order to maintain continuity of care. So we can't give a number right now because we haven't decided and we're agonizing as we look. But we felt it was important to let you know that the number wasn't going to be 0.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Would it be reasonable to assume that there would not be much EBITDA impact, if any?","Kent J. Thiry","Correct.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe my final question, in terms of unwinding some of the joint ventures. Does that potentially have any impact on the medical directors at those centers, or how do you manage that?","Kent J. Thiry","Could you ask that question again, please?","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","As you unwind some of the joint ventures, could that potentially impact any of the medical directors that you have at those centers? And so could it be any kind of operational issue for you?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, I appreciate it. The short answer, yes, it could. But it's unlikely that most of the relevant transactions were with groups with whom we have larger and multifaceted relationships and, therefore, not expected to change. And even in the couple of cases where it might be a smaller relationship, in most of those instances it shouldn't make a difference either. As someone mentioned earlier, over 70% of our centers already are wholly owned. And so it's not that us owning 100% or something is somehow a destabilizing element. For the most part. Of course, there could be an exception or 2, but not the rule.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","On the subject of those JVs, could you describe to us exactly what is the characteristic of the JVs that you're having to unwind? What is it the government doesn't like versus the other JVs you have where there's no problem?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. And let me first go backwards a moment because someone asked a few moments ago how many JVs we have. And that's not something we've disclosed before. But we have disclosed the percent of our revenue that comes from JVs and that's right in the ballpark of 21%. So from that, you can pretty well infer how many there are out there and be in the right strategic ballpark. The type of JVs that we're focused on are JVs where we did a partial divestiture, which is to say that we owned 100% and then sold a percentage of that -- a minority percentage of that 100% to local nephrologists.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Versus your other ones, you're just -- these are new partnerships and so it's just that simple?","Kent J. Thiry","It's pretty much that simple. And because we are in the process of finalizing all aspects of the agreement, I just don't think it's a good idea to start parsing things any further. So I think we'll leave it at that for today.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. In terms of the kidney side of the business, the operating income guidance going up here, would you characterize that as more top line driven or is this more something you got on the expense side?","Kent J. Thiry","It's more top line driven because of the lower enrollment in the exchanges.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So more a function of pricing. And then in terms of external growth, obviously, you did a few acquisitions this year in the U.S. and internationally, as well as some de novos. What's -- what are you embedding in your guidance for 2014 on the subject of either de novos or acquisitions?","Kent J. Thiry","I don't think we've broken that out. Suffice it to say, we anticipate doing more acquisitions. Whether it will be a little more, a little less than the prior year, impossible to predict. Could there be a significant dropoff in acquisitions? Maybe. Just don't know, too early in the year. Could there be a significant increase in acquisitions on the Kidney Care side? That's unlikely. There's nothing out there that would provoke that. On the de novo front, we once again expect to have a robust year of building de novos in areas where there's enough private patients to subsidize the federal government, but we don't go beyond that and give a specific number. It's always a little hard to nail down.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then the last one and I'll hop. The operating income being up nicely, your cash flow from ops down, you highlighted the one item on just timing of working capital. Is there anything else that would cause that disparity?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, the change in working capital was one of the major drivers. Was anything else noteworthy that we should mention, Jim or Jim?","James K. Hilger","Yes. This is Jim Hilger. We've had some tax preference items in 2013 that won't be reported -- or repeated in '14, accelerated depreciation being the most notable one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.","Margaret Kaczor - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First, just to get back to exchanges. How many exchanges have you guys decided to participate in versus not participate? And kind of what drove that decision? Was it pricing or was it something else?","Kent J. Thiry","I don't know the number and I don't know that we've tracked. Because in general, any exchange that's willing to pay our normal commercial rates, we sign up for; and those that don't, we don't. So it's been a pretty simple decision filter and I don't know that anybody's added them up.","Margaret Kaczor - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Do you know if anyone actually accepted the kind of the lower rate contracts or any of the private guys or kind of the smaller guys?","Kent J. Thiry","I'm sure that some people have and we have no way of knowing how many. But given we're all in the same situation where the 10% of our patients that are private subsidize the 90% that are government, there are limits to how much of that you can do before you put your entire survival at risk. So I'm sure the answer is yes and only time will tell how many it was.","Margaret Kaczor - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then could you guys talk a little bit more about HCP acquisition targets. In the past, you've kind of talked about kind of a 2- to 3-year time horizon as the result starts to materialize. Is that still accurate? And then also, can you talk about the acquisition candidates that you've done diligence on? How many was that? Why wouldn't things pan out there? Or is it just you guys are overloaded right now in the Q, with people interested in acquiring -- in getting acquired?","Kent J. Thiry","Let me take a quick stab and we'll see then if Craig or Bob want to amend. With respect to organic growth in patient numbers, that's where there's a time lag as we work to familiarize ourselves to the patient's condition and provide coordinated care and, as we succeed in doing so, bringing down the cost of that care through better health. So that's one of the references to the 2- and 3-year time frame that you mentioned. When we buy something, if, in fact, it has a mature Medicare Advantage population that it's been working with, then there could be profits immediately and, of course, we would be paying a multiple for that. And then as to the pipeline of M&A opportunities, it is -- there is one. It is so impossible to predict with any accuracy which organizations will, in fact, decide to sell and whether or not we'll be the winning bidder that helping you do a better job of forecasting is unfortunately not something we're able to do. And we've also mentioned in the past how we had to build a business development capability pretty much from scratch with respect to new markets, that we were necessarily going to be a little awkward and slow in the early going and we're making some good progress. But that certainly has slowed us down. Have I covered it, Margaret?","Margaret Kaczor - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes. So I guess, the acquisitions that maybe did or did not pan out, it doesn't sound like that was big number maybe. But those that maybe didn't have a higher price premium than you guys were willing to pay, did those go to hospitals largely? Or what other players, insurers?","Kent J. Thiry","On the ones we've lost that are of size, I can think of a couple, maybe 3. 2 went to payors and 1 went to a health system, a hospital health system. So and that I worry that, that \"n\" is so small that could be misleading. But that is the factual answer to your question of the 3 that I can think of offhand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Clive from Sanford Bernstein.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Three questions. First, on the dialysis business. Integrated care, obviously, the rate cut slowed down the progress of the development of the ESCO program and potentially changed the decision around participating. Can you give us an update on where you stand with Medicare on this? And can you give us any insight into how Medicare is thinking about the size and duration of the program? And then second question, if a new ESA enters the market this year, is it safe to assume, given that you signed a pretty long-term contract with Amgen, that, that allows for some sort of automatic price step-down? And how should we think about the potential impact on your cost structure from any changes in the ESA competitive landscape?","Kent J. Thiry","Okay. On ESCOs, we do not know when CMS will come out with the version 2 or version 3, depending on how you're counting. And we still have high hopes because we know they want to do it and we know that we and other providers can improve quality significantly and dramatically and transparently while, at the same time, saving literally billions of dollars. So we're incredibly enthusiastic about it but just don't know when the next version will come out. The good news is that there's more and more recognition to the fact that this type of integrated care is the answer. And then on ESAs, I have to admit, I did not get a refresher on the stipulations in our contract as to what we can disclose and what we cannot. And so on any kind of auto step-down in price and the other issues you mentioned, we just, I think, are not allowed to disclose.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And a final question, given the Medicare rate cut that went through spread out over 4 years, are you seeing any increase in activity of small providers who are interested in selling themselves, given the headwinds they're facing now?","Kent J. Thiry","Not anything significant yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I had a couple of questions, but I guess I wanted to come back to this ESA question. Because I thought, Kent, you had publicly pretty firmly said before that there was no automatic sort of price step-down in the long-term contract with Amgen.","Kent J. Thiry","If I'd said it before, then it was true and is still true. But I just couldn't remember offhand the terms of the contract and what we had been allowed to disclose or not and we just didn't do a refresher on that one leading into this call and so we had to err on the side of being safe. But if it was disclosed before, it must have been true and if it was true, it still is true.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. On HCP for the duals in California that we're talking about earlier, is there anything explicitly in the 2014 guidance in terms of revenue or operating income contribution in '14?","Kent J. Thiry","Answer is no. It's 0.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And which -- there was a quick discussion kind of where the rates are shaking out, so forth. Is that a program where strategically you'd be willing to absorb losses initially to be involved in the rollout of that program?","Kent J. Thiry","Only if we thought the program was stable enough and long term enough that we could get our shareholders a return on the capital that we were investing. What is so often the case is that if you take that risk upfront and succeed right at the point that you might be expecting to earn the fruits of your labor, the rules change and, therefore, you're not allowed the return what you invested to get. So you got to be awfully cautious on that sort of thing and, therefore, can't answer with a definitive yes or no.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Last question. At the Investor Day, Kent, I believe you said if you saw a similar Medicare Advantage cut in 2015, HCP's operating income would be down or you might have said likely would be down again, I believe. Is there enough happening in terms of these renegotiated MA contracts that you talked about a little bit today, that you'd want to revise that outlook? Or would you still stick to that?","Kent J. Thiry","I absolutely stick to what was said at the capital markets, that if we get hit with the rate decreases, OI will be down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from Robert Baird.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just had a couple of quick ones. And you've referenced 2014 being an investment year for HCP, I think on this call and also at the Capital Markets Day. And I think I heard you referenced business development earlier as an area that you were particularly focused on now. But is there anything specifically to call out at this point in time in terms of systems or other capabilities that you've identified as a priority going forward?","Craig E. Samitt","This is Craig again. Our primary focus for investment, thus far in 2014, has been in the business development and integration arena. So we've added resources with the business development team. We're leveraging our legacy HealthCare Partners and DaVita expertise in existing and new markets. And we're laying the groundwork for successful post-acquisition integration. So that's where a majority of our resources are thus far. In terms of your question about other systems and processes, I would say that we're in the evaluation phase of each of those to determine if additional investment should be made in technologies or processes that would further enhance our capabilities in the future. Does that answer your question?","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, it does. But I mean, can you be maybe a little bit more specific about what those capabilities are? I mean, is it actuarial capabilities? I mean, I didn't know if you'd be willing to comment a little bit further.","Craig E. Samitt","There are no particular capabilities that I would call out at this point. I think we're looking at broad-based opportunities for improvement.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And my last question just relates to buybacks. You hit the pause button on that a while ago and it might just be helpful to hear your latest thoughts on what -- where the internal discussion is around rethinking share repurchase at this point.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. Our thinking on share buybacks and just in general, our capital deployment is as robust as ever. And over the last 14 years, as some of you can attest, we've been active along the entire spectrum of having a higher leverage ratio, having a lower leverage ratio; doing a lot of buybacks, doing no buybacks; spending a lot of money on acquisitions, spending no money on acquisitions. And so we look at that full spectrum every single quarter. And of course, with respect to share buybacks, we look at what our alternative uses of capital are, what our current valuation is, what are the risk dynamics as you look out in the near and intermediate term. And so we play with it all the time. And right now, we don't have anything interesting to say about any conclusions in that realm.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time.","Jim Gustafson","All right.

Sir, you may begin your conference.","Jim Gustafson","Thank you, Jamaria, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Luis Borgen, our CFO; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry","Okay. Greetings. Let me first repeat Jim's thanks for your interest in our\/your company. The fourth quarter was a strong one, and 2011 was a strong year, both clinically, operationally and financially. Because we just completed a fiscal year, I'll cover a few more topics than usual: ","Number one, as always, clinical outcomes; number two, 2011 acquisitions; number three, a brief investigations update; number four, a little snippet of info on DaVita Rx, our specialty pharmacy group; number five, the concept and potential reality of integrated care; number six, our outlook going forward; and number seven, discuss a little bit of recent organizational announcement. I'll try to be crisp [ph] since there's more than usual. ","First, our clinical outcomes. We always present those first because that is what comes first. We are, first and foremost, a caregiver company serving now approximately 142,000 patients, about 1 out of 3 in America. With respect to adequacy, which is essentially how well we're doing at removing toxins from our patient's blood, this quarter, 97% of our hemodialysis patients had a Kt\/V greater than 1.2. ","And with respect to vascular access, 69% of our patients have fistulas, the preferred form of vascular access. For these and virtually all other clinical measures, our patient outcomes compare very favorably to national averages. And I'll take a moment to say that in 2011, for the 11th year in a row, we're able to state unambiguously that we had better clinical outcomes in the prior year, which means also our best ones ever. We hope we can repeat those words to you in one more year at the beginning of 2013. ","Moving on to number two, on the acquisition front. As you know, most of you, we closed and are integrating DSI, which added 83 centers, net of divestitures. The integration is going solidly. But in addition to that, we closed acquisitions of an additional 65 centers. All of these transactions added more than 10,000 new patients who are entrusting us with their essential care, and we are very focused on providing that great care, as well as ensuring good returns on a significant amount of your capital that we deployed in that fashion in that year. ","Third, I'd like to give you a brief update on one of the litigation investigations, the 2011 U.S. Attorney Physician Relationship Investigation that we have discussed with you before. The investigation, as expected, is continuing and they\u2019ve now asked for testimony by some executives of the company and some current and former members of the board through subpoenas. Asking for some live testimonies was to be expected. We have cooperated with their historical requests. We will continue to cooperate. At this point, they are collecting information. No charges have been filed, and we look forward to beginning substantive discussions with the government and are hoping that happens soon. ","Number four, DaVita Rx had a very successful year. They grew revenue about 45% to over $300 million and are modestly in the black. They are now providing important oral medication management services for over 41,000 patients and providing strong clinical benefits to our patients and strong support services and information to our physicians. ","On to number five, the substantive integrated care, which we've talked about a little bit more lately. For those of you who are new to the concept, it's essentially a kidney-care-focused ACO, to use some of the modern-day hospital jargon. It means we're going to hopefully manage the full $88,000 a year of total medical costs per Medicare dialysis patients instead of just the $33,000 or so that is consumed by dialysis. We've had very serious and constructive discussions with CMS, discussing this and it is being seriously considered. ","If we get the opportunity to do this, it will be a major opportunity to increase our value proposition to America. Higher quality, more services for patients, lower total costs primarily through reduced hospitalizations and we think a very, very attractive return on capital to our shareholders because of that dramatically enhanced value proposition for the government and to society. Too soon to tell, always difficult to handicap, but we've never before been having conversations this specific and this serious. ","Number six, moving on to our outlook. The message here is simple. We're maintaining our 2012 operating income guidance range, which is $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, and that range captures a majority of the powalistic [ph] outcomes when you take into account all the various swing factors with which many of you are quite familiar at this point. ","And finally, number seven, the board, Dennis Kogod, our Chief Operating Officer and me, were very excited to announce the recent promotion of Javier Rodriguez to the title of President of DaVita. He will serve as a full tier to Dennis Kogod, and the 3 of us will work together in the future, as we have in the past, as a tight team. This promotion, not surprisingly, reflects the strong performance and leadership and growth that JR, Javier that is, has demonstrated in recent years, in fact, for many years. ","And with that happy ending note, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Luis Borgen. Thank you.","Luis A. Borgen","Thanks, Kent. We had strong operating income and cash flow in the quarter, driven by strong treatment growth and improved cost per treatment. Offsetting these factors are lower revenue per treatment and a continued decline in commercial mix. ","Here's some specifics on the quarter. Non-acquired growth was 4.8% when normalized for days of the week. Dialysis revenue per treatment was down about $5. The primary drivers were a decline in commercial mix, our new agreements with the VA and a declining utilization of physician-prescribed pharmaceuticals and finally, declined revenue from vaccinations, which were seasonally high in the third quarter. Dialysis patient care cost per treatment was down about $7 from the prior quarter due to 2 main factors: one, a reduction in utilization of physician-prescribed pharmaceuticals, mainly Epogen; and two, seasonally lower payroll costs. Note that EPO utilization was consistent throughout the fourth quarter, and based on our conversations with physicians, we expect utilization to be at current or slightly higher levels going forward. ","Our fourth quarter dialysis G&A per treatment was up slightly from the prior quarter, primarily due to IT projects and legal and compliance spend. This fourth quarter G&A includes approximately $8 million for DSI integration, which was similar to the amount we incurred in the third quarter. We expect some continued spending on DSI in the first quarter of 2012. ","International losses were about $20 million for the year, in line with our previous guidance. Note that in the fourth quarter, we changed the presentation of internal spending on our financial statements, moving our international results out of the U.S. dialysis segment to be reported as a part of our strategic initiatives. Previous quarters of 2011 were recast to reflect this reporting as well. We made this reporting change to provide more clarity in the economics of our core U.S. dialysis business. ","Operating cash flow for 2011 was unusually strong at $1.18 billion. We are guiding 2012 operating cash flow to be lower, with a range of $950 million to $1.05 billion. This is because 2011 cash flow benefited from the favorability in the timing of a number of working capital items primarily related to the timing of cash tax payments due to the bonus tax depreciation. ","As we look to the first quarter of 2012, operating income is likely to be down sequentially, as operating costs will increase due to fewer treatment days, over which the spreads fixed cost in the quarter, seasonally higher payroll taxes and an increase in pharma cost due to reduced rebates in our new Amgen contract and some increased G&A investments. ","Looking at our guidance for the full year 2012 compared to our Q4 2011 run rate, you should consider a number of factors. Tailwinds include the Medicare market basket increase and a continued treatment volume growth, coupled with the impact of integrating DSI. These above factors will be offset by some headwinds, including higher EPO unit costs and increased G&A investments. We expect G&A per treatment to be about $2 higher in 2012 versus 2011, reflecting increased spending in various areas including IT, international, legal and compliance, growth in DaVita Rx and some investments in VillageHealth. In addition, payor mix remains uncertain into 2012. ","Operator, let's go ahead and open up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you just talk a little bit more about the integrated care opportunity? And what do you think might be the fastest timeline along which that could progress? And what do you think you -- what capabilities do you think you'd need to build or partnerships you'd need to have, I don't know, with managed care or other, to be successful there?","Kent J. Thiry","Certainly. We're a little bit schizophrenic on this issue, on the one hand, so excited, we've been working on it a long time. And on the other hand, we have great trepidation in talking about it since you can never predict for sure what the government will decide to do and when. And even if they come out with a request for proposal, will it be a quality one that we can participate in? So with all those caveats, we'll attempt to answer your question. As to timing, the soonest request for proposal might come out for comment would be in a couple of months. We're not predicting that, but that's answering the question. As to how late it could happen, it could be never, but we think we've got a good shot. As to capabilities, we've been preparing for some time, in part through our demonstration pilot, which we did with Medicare, with CMS, sharing all the data to define rules along the way, and so they've seen it in action. They know that medical costs go down, clinical quality goes up and patient satisfaction goes up, as well as physician satisfaction as a matter of fact. And they've seen some of the results from the work Fresenius has done, our competitor in the same area. And so in terms of capabilities, we can pretty much do it on our own, and while there will be some exceptions to that, we think they'll be relatively modest. Of course, I have to qualify that by saying since we haven't seen the RFP yet, well, we can't be sure that, that answer's correct. Did I hear every part of your question?","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I think you did. Just on the last answer there. I gather you have the capability to do it with what's within your company in terms of maybe taking it to the optimal level, with everything that's involved in population health management if you're responsible for that cohort. Again, do you think, primarily, you have that in-house, you don't have to do significant investment to get there?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, 2 different things. We have the capabilities in-house. It will take investment to scale those activities if we get the kind of pilot that we're hoping for. So big, big distinction to make there.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And if I could just one more on the commercial mix. Are you -- would you say that there is incrementally more pressure from the commercial payers on reimbursement? Is dialysis something that they seem to be more focusing on more heavily? And how are your negotiations, if any, proceeding along that front?","Kent J. Thiry","Okay, I'll tackle that one too. Before I do, as you refined your question, I feel I should add one additional note to my answer, which is in the beginning of scaling for a big integrated care undertaking, it could be we would do some outsourcing as we build our scale, so I was giving you a longer-term answer and recognize that you might have in part been asking about the scaling period. And if we get the scale, we are not sure which parts we'll be able to scale on our own versus temporary use of others. But now on to your question. On the private payer side, it's super, super intense, which is the same way it was last year and the year before and the year before that. It doesn't seem like that ever changes.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And so in terms of the rate of increase, you're not really seeing differences in terms of outcomes with a greater, I don't know, whether we can even call it, maybe it isn't a greater focus on cost containment, it's the same focus on cost containment. The dynamic is about the same. Is that fair?","Kent J. Thiry","I think the dynamic is about the same. And what we've always said is every year, we win some victories, we suffer some defeats, there are a bunch of ties, and it's a little bit like one football season to the next. It's real dangerous to extrapolate because you got tough opponents out there. And so while we wouldn\u2019t posit any particular structural change in the world nor any sort of systematic change in intensity, nonetheless, you never want to get complacent and certainly, we don't.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Kent, going back to your prepared comments or maybe it was Luis. I think you indicated the physicians have stated that Epogen use or the physician-prescribed drugs would be either flat to maybe slightly higher in 2012. Just wondering what type of visibility or why that would -- why it would go up.","Luis A. Borgen","That remains dynamic. We have rolled out various protocols, and as we settle on the final one, we think that flat to up is the most likely scenario at this point in conversations with physicians and the data we're seeing.","Kent J. Thiry","It's so difficult to predict because there's been such change in the science, in the government guidance, in the debates, in the articles on the anemia management that you have a lot of doctors making some changes to their prescription pattern for any of those number of reasons, and then waiting a month or 2 or 3 to see what the results are and see if they're content as they stare at their patient population and look at the percent that's between 10 and 12, sub-10, between 12 and 13, above 13. And so what we do is the best we can in incorporating all their opinions into any amendments into the protocol, so they essentially end up being the physicians on protocols, and then helping facilitating, supporting them as they stare at their results and the results of the broader population and continue to fine tune what they think is right for their patients. So it's pretty dynamic, but the general drift of what we hear from our doctors is exactly what Luis said.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then, I guess, just shifting back to the integrated care. I think maybe a month ago, we noticed that you guys opened up a primary care clinic in Tacoma, Washington. Just wondering what the strategic rationale is behind that. Is that a revenue driver or a way for you guys to curb your own health care expenses? And then, what's the expansion plans for other primary care clinics?","Kent J. Thiry","The short answer is both. We have about 1,000 citizens of what we call the DaVita village in the Tacoma area, and there, as is happening elsewhere in the country, our medical costs continue to go up and up and up, placing whatever burden on our people and on us, and we're hoping this clinic can be a way to change that trend, while simultaneously providing better service to our people and their families. Having said that, we think there could be a real business model there that we can provide to other employers of different sizes, but way too soon to make any forecasts. I would characterize it as very spirited new business R&D right now.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Understood. And then just thinking about home hemodialysis. Earlier this month, UnitedHealthcare issued a medical policy for home hemo. Just wondering if that's changed your opinion. Or I guess, what's your take on home hemodialysis at this point?","Kent J. Thiry","I'm not familiar with the new United policies so perhaps you could fill me in there or certainly, I'm sure 6 or 7 people will, once the call is over. But our posture on HHD, home hemodialysis, and we do more of it than anyone in the world at last look, is unchanged, which is there's -- what we always say is people who say that it's going to grow, grow, grow dramatically, it should be right for lots and lots of patients. We don't see yet the data to support that conclusion at all. On the other hand, those who say that it should apply to no patients our data doesn't support that either. As to what percentage of patients it will be a superior form of care for is not clear yet. And then, in addition, there's all the complexities and subtleties around government reimbursement, what they allow, what they don't, what constitutes evidence to them, et cetera. And so the picture is pretty murky once you combine those 2. We remain very, very committed to the work we're doing in that area, and our collaboration with the federal government to try to figure out what the right policies are based on high quality, objective, nonpartisan, if you will, analysis.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Well, United's policy basically says that HHD is a proven therapy as an alternative to facility-based hemodialysis for patients who apply to -- for the criteria. So basically, I think they're basically saying the clinical data is good enough.","Kent J. Thiry","That is good, and again, there's an entire spectrum of opinions on this subject, which is why we advise you to be careful about paying too much attention to people at either end of the distribution. And clearly, by the number of patients we have on it, we think it's very, very justified for some patients and better for them, either in terms of quality or life convenience, the ability to keep on working and the ability to integrate dialysis care more into their lives and their families' lives. So we're clearly supportive, but we wouldn't be doing everything we're doing.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Understood. And then just one last quick question for maybe LeAnne. Just wondering if -- what's the latest on the doc fix? Is there anything such as the bad debt coverage that could impact you guys?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Yes. As a matter of fact, the preliminary analysis or information is out. We're reviewing that and it would appear that dialysis bad debt reimbursement will be part of the pay-for, for the policy.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Do we know how much it will impact you guys? I mean, your bad debt is only what, 3% , if that?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","You're speaking to the provision on the income statement? Yes, 2.9%. Yes, that is a much -- that number encompasses more than the Medicare bad debt.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Maybe just a follow-up on that last question, LeAnne. In terms of thinking about the bad debt provision in the doc fix deal. So the way -- could you just maybe give us a refresher on the way it works now? So 20% of the composite rate is a co-pay? And is that the piece that's going to be affected by this potentially?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Yes. So it's a little complicated. Let me see if I can be clear. Right now, we're able to claim Medicare bad debt in certain circumstances on what used to be the old composite rate, so not on the drugs. And yes, that would be the 20% that would not be paid by a third -- or second party or third party. And that calculation is further reviewed in a way that if the dialysis facility was profitable or lost money on a Medicare basis. So couple of filters that you have to go through before you're determined to be eligible for the bad debt.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that composite rate is it around -- it's like $135 or somewhere in that range, so is that the story number and the way to think about it?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Yes. I'd like to track it probably to $150. I can't remember if -- of the \u2013 drug add-on was in there or not. Maybe Jim Hillter [ph] or someone could help us out with the exact number, but it's in that $135 to $150 range.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then what are the additional filters? So if we were to kind of just walk through the process to filter it down, so if we were to try to estimate an impact, what would some of those filters be?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Yes, the filter -- the primary filter is whether or not that facility lost money or made money on a Medicare basis. And so if it's making money, you're going to be limited as to what you could claim, and you may not be able to claim any of it.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And so that's how it currently works?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Correct.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And any estimate in terms of what percentage of your facilities wouldn't be able to claim anything since they're making money?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","I don't have that number handy for me.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the -- I guess, just on the income statement. The bad debt expense that you're currently reporting, is that primarily -- is there a split? Is it 1\/2 commercial, 1\/2 Medicare? Or how should we think about that?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","Again, I don't have that data right in front of me.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I guess maybe on another topic, Kent. There's -- for the first time this year, I guess, there's the potential that a competing ESA might come to market, and you all have signed a long-term contract with Amgen. But how should we think about the, I guess -- I would assume it's a potential benefit to you still, if a potential drug -- competing drug comes to market. How should we think about that?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, very fair question. And the answer is it's not clear in the short term, whether it's in our best interest or not for something new to come out. We signed a long-term agreement as you know. We signed it with Amgen for EPO, which is the gold standard for anemia management. And we walked through kind of the strategic and logical filters for the decision we made and said that over the 7 years and on a net basis, this could work to our advantage or our disadvantage. But one thing that is very clear is that Amgen and our interests are aligned for the most part, and so I can't give you a generic answer whether a new entrant coming out soon is good or bad for us without waiting to see what happens and at what price, what pickup there is, et cetera, et cetera.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Justin Lake with UBS.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess I'll just take a quick shot at this bad debt first. Can you just give us the number in terms of, LeAnne, that 100% goes to the 65%, I believe? How much does that impact you by? Maybe just tell us how much you collect right now in Medicare bad debt.","Kent J. Thiry","LeAnne, do you know the number? And for the folks out there, I just want to apologize. LeAnne's actually in a different city and so there might be some awkward handoffs back and forth. But LeAnne, do you know the number?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","I can give an estimate, and that estimate would impact us about $4 million in the first year. And it does -- it phases from 100% of recovery to 65% of recovery over the 3-year period.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So if it goes at 32% early on, that might be $12 million to, maybe with some growth, $15 million by year 3?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt","That would be reasonable estimate.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. Second question, Kent, on the integrated care, you talked about specific serious conversations. Just wanted to focus on a couple of issues there. In terms of if -- could you help us -- it sounds like you're as close as you've ever been, clearly an exciting concept. Can you tell us would -- what you think maybe the 2 or 3 kind of key issues that are keeping CMS from having published this or that you're working on with them? What's keeping this from having come out now that they\u2019re past the 8 pioneer ACOs.","Kent J. Thiry","Certainly. Before I do that, LeAnne did take her best cut in the spirit of trying to be responsive on the bad debt estimate, and so what you got was our absolute best estimate. I just want to emphasize that. It -- the thing came out so recently, my understanding is just today or yesterday or something, and so we're still processing away, and if those -- if the estimate that LeAnne gave in good faith turns out to be materially wrong, we'll get back to you as soon we can. But it is our first cut at it. Then second, on what's keeping them from coming out with it, it really is that they were so consumed by all the pioneer ACO work and related hospital stuff. And then they turn to all the rest, and they've got to finish comparing and deciding on which subset of all the rest they're actually going to take action on, and so that takes some time. We do have it on assurance from many, many people that we're among the finalists. But whether or not that means we make it into the next round, which would be imminent or whether we don't make it into the first round and have to wait for the second round or some other subsequent round, we just can't handicap. But it really is just them managing their workflow.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. So do you expect in the next several months, there'll be another announcement with these kind of integrated care, like you said kind of vertical ACOs in different disease states and the question is not really in your mind around whether it's going to happen or not, more so are you going to be a part of it and you think will?","Kent J. Thiry","That's too definitive. They may opt to do no verticals. That is still potentially the case. And remember, even if they issue out RFPs in the vertical, they may be so unattractive that no one does them. So while the odds are they're going to come out with some other types of ACOs beyond the hospital, it's unfortunately not 100%. So we\u2019re excited because we're in the red zone, but that's a long way from starting.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then just 2 more questions on this. In terms of the timing between a release and when you think this would actually go into place, if you can help us there. And if it came in the next few months, could it start by 2013? And maybe how many patients you think it would start with.","Kent J. Thiry","So all fair questions, and I'll throw out guesses as long as everyone appreciates that's what they are, but we're striving to be useful. If it comes out in the next few months, which would be the best case, and if it's a proposal that actually can work where we can add the value for society and share in it, there is a chance it could be implemented in January 1, '13. There's also a good chance that they would do a later date halfway through '13 or the beginning of '14. In our favor is the fact that we've been working so closely with them, and our industry works collaboratively in a very different way than many others. And so our ability to dance with them, to get something done where they feel they're going to get the right level of reporting, the right level of transparency, the right amount of accountability, the right amount of systems integration, our ability to deliver that is really superior to most other health care segments. All of that says maybe it could happen January 1, 2013, and then you know all the reasons why it might not.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And number of patients?","Kent J. Thiry","Number of patients, that's anybody's guess, Justin. I'm sorry, that one even I can't go venture in guessing on that.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And the biggest, I think, push back I get when talking to people about this, Kent, is that in terms of just the timing, right? If this starts in '13, by the time it becomes material, it's fairly far out in the future. And so I think the key in terms of kind of investor interest will probably be the level of transparency there is to further growth in the RFP, meaning this is not just going to be x number of patients and we'll take another look at for 3 to 5 years and come back. Do you expect that there's going to -- it's going to be fairly explicit in the contract that regardless of how many patients you start with, if the industry hits x outcomes data and y savings targets, then it will be very explicit that this will scale to something more meaningful without having to go back and request it, it will be kind of explicit in the contract?","Kent J. Thiry","It's the right question, I cannot handicap the answer. I do think that if we get something good, we and Fresenius and others will do such good stuff with it that independent of what is contractually or regulatory stipulated, we're going to have a heck of a good story to tell. And even though penetration can take a while, if it's penetration of a relatively proven capability, valuing it becomes simpler.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And one last question on mix. Can you tell us where you are now in terms of percentage of patients in commercial, how much that changed sequentially? Is it getting worse or better? And for 2012, can you walk me through -- the economy seems to be getting a little better from a jobs perspective, and then you have COBRA kind of expiring for some people and maybe talk to us about what you're expecting for '12 and that will be it for me.","Luis A. Borgen","Sure, Justin. This is Luis. Where we are at the end of Q4 is that we are at 10% commercial mix. On a sequential basis in Q3 to Q4, we saw a similar rate of decline. And on your third question, it is one of our swing factors. It's highly uncertain where that's going to shake out, so it's difficult to predict.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Do you expect it to go down in 2012, to continue moderating or...","Luis A. Borgen","Our guidance includes several scenarios. It's difficult to predict. And so it is something that we have factored into our overall guidance. Just one clarification, Justin, which may help you think about it, we are rounding down to 10% as of Q4 to be clear on that point.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ben Andrew, who's a sales research analyst (sic) [William Blair].","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Ben Andrew with William Blair. I don't know if I changed affiliations, but I wanted to ask Kent briefly about your thoughts on the risk profile of the integrated care model. Obviously, the demonstration work you've already done has given you some pretty good visibility that you\u2019ve communicated. But how would you hope to treat outlier patients? And are there other parameters of an RFP that would make it more attractive or less attractive to you, you could walk us through please?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, the larger the scale that they allow, the more open we can be on accepting versus not accepting outlier risk. And calibrating, regulating and administering outlier risk is actually something that CMS has to do a fair amount of, including in the bundle, under which we now operate. And so that will be a highly analytical exercise between us and Medicare if it happens. And so we're not at all worried about it as long as we bring the right attention to it and they share the numbers. It should be a case where both sides can win, and they want to give us enough scale so that the outlier pool is smaller and they capture more of our potential value. And we work collaboratively with them, and so they see the upside for them. But it's pretty impossible to predict ahead of time until you're doing that final serious number crunching.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe talk about any other aspects of the RFP beyond that one that would be important to you as an organization to wanting to accept or to bid for an RFP.","Kent J. Thiry","I would say the most important one is our ability to work with all Medicare patients in a clinic. What\u2019s very, very difficult in terms of achieving the kind of systemic, dramatic change that we're contemplating here is when a subset of the patients in a given center are involved. Because without the upside, you cannot afford to add all the additional integrative services. And without that investment, you can't generate the results. And it's much, much more expensive if you're dealing with small pockets of fragmented patients who stretch across an entire country, as opposed to much more concentrated patient populations within a given geography. That's one of the primary fulcrums.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And then as you think about, again, scale getting at this, are the sizes of the demonstration projects that you undertook, would those be compelling enough to, again, to want to participate? Or is that just wouldn't be enough to compel you?","Kent J. Thiry","Could you say the question again, please, Ben?","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes. Given the size of the demonstration programs that you did and the cost savings that you appear to have seen and more importantly, the improvements in patient outcome, satisfaction and physician outcome, are those scale of projects sufficient for you as an organization at this point to want to participate if they try to severely limit the scale? Would it still be compelling just to, again, collect more, to get more experience and then hope that they would expand it over time?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, I guess the answer -- Let me grope for a moment. If we got to do -- our existing demonstration project is in one geographic area. And if they allowed us to do that same thing in 20 geographic areas, we would absolutely do it. So there is enough local scale where if we've got to do multiple local things of that size and spread the fixed overhead above it, that would be attractive. Is that -- am I answering the right question?","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. I know you're not going to give a number. I'm just trying to get a flavor for kind of where your interests are there. And then as you think about the skill sets that DaVita has today, and you talked about a transition period perhaps into a fully-integrated model over time, what would be the most critical aspects for you to outsource or to add, on kind of a transitional basis, if gave you the go ahead, say, for Jan 1, 2013?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, I'm not prepared to answer that so I will try, and you'll have to recognize that my answer could be pretty feeble. But if they were going to give us the opportunity to take care of a lot of patients, we'd probably have some call center issues. We might have some technology and technology development issues just in terms of interconnectedness. Those are the 2 areas where we might have to outsource on a transitional basis.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt Weight [ph], who's a private analyst.","Unknown Analyst","One -- couple of questions here, going back to the EPO supply contract with Amgen. If you looked out in potentially 2 to 3 years, there was price compression from competing ESA drugs. Would the contract at all allow you to benefit from that?","Kent J. Thiry","Matt, we can't, for all sorts of obvious reasons, disclose precise contract terms. And so maybe let me stumble my way through sort of the filters we went through in thinking about this contract, and we do feel very good about the new partnership we have with Amgen, and that's an important context within which to think about this. But you have to assess the probability that a new drug comes out in the market. Then you have to predict what price it will be at, how different from Amgen's price. Then you have to predict what percent of physicians will actually take the risk of moving off the gold standard, given the price. Then you have to take into account the pace at which they will do that. Then you have to take into account the price those providers have to pay for EPO on the patients and with the physicians for whom they still have to use EPO because not all their affiliated doctors are going to want to switch to a new and unproven drug. Then you have to take into account the fact that if a new drug successfully clears all those filters and how long it takes, you finally must incorporate the fact that, at that point, it is strongly in Amgen's long-term best interest to come back and work with us rather than become too noncompetitive because this is a very significant net present value drug for them no matter what because it's so important and so proven. So if you kind run through that gauntlet, then you can kind of answer your own question about what dynamics might exist 3 or 4 years downstream without me talking about exactly what the paragraphs of the contracts say. Is that helpful?","Unknown Analyst","Yes, it is. I appreciate that. That's helpful. Two other quick questions here. Did you guys, looking back in 2011 here, notice -- was there any noticeable increase in blood transfusions relative to what you've experienced in the past?","Kent J. Thiry","First of all, we don't have a good transfusion data, no dialysis provider does because we don't get to capture it. Almost all of that stuff happens outside our centers, and as much as we would love to get all that data, no one has an obligation to share it with us. So we look forward to working collaboratively with CMS, with Medicare in order to see if that's happening, and if so, to address it. As you know, doctors have this tough task in a world of very fluid science and very fluid clinical consensus on anemia management of, on the one hand, managing the risk on the downside, which means people get anemic and need a transfusion against the risk, on the high side, of having too high a hematocrit or hemoglobin and the potential for harm in that area. And so they have to balance those 2 and the exact science, an exact formula, is exact reality, exact analysis to drive a formulaic answer to that, that you can apply to each patient doesn't exist. And so you have thousands of docs out there using their best judgment to balance those 2 things. It's a long way of saying but hopefully, a helpful way of saying that we don't have the data. We'll work with Medicare to evaluate the data, and then we'll work with docs so that they can strike that balance.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then last question just switching back to integrated care. Can you talk -- how do you see VillageHealth and DaVita Rx fitting in there? And what kind of potential synergies would you expect?","Kent J. Thiry","So the question was how will DaVita Rx fit into integrated care?","Kent J. Thiry","Right. Well, VillageHealth is, for those of you who don't know, the name of our integrated care group team effort, initiative, however you want to label it. And so it was founded based on the belief that one day, we'd be able to do truly integrated care. And in fact, it's the vehicle through which we've done the demonstrations and other analysis to show that it is the right path for American ESRD. So for VillageHealth, it is hand-in-glove if they give us the right architecture. And then DaVita Rx is a powerhouse capability that fits within it because once you're managing that total patient, you want to do integrated medication management. And that's what DaVita Rx does right now for our VillageHealth patients and would for any patients that came in under a pilot.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A few questions here. Could you just talk a little bit about your international growth plan? Obviously, you guys have chosen the route of de novo startups but I've been a little bit surprised that you have done a number of things across a number of different countries all at the same time rather than focusing on a couple of geographies. Can you just tell us your thought process around that expansion?","Kent J. Thiry","Very fair question. What has been safer to just go into 1 or 2 spots and focus and do that for a few years, stub our toes inevitably since we haven't done this stuff overseas before, so that would've been safer. We decided we would rather put incremental capital and talent at risk or in play in order to be more aggressive, recognizing we probably will make more mistakes, but in the end, hopefully put ourselves in a position where it's relevant sooner. In addition, in some parts of the world, we're worried that if we just sat out for the next 6 years in order to be conservative, that we would have significantly impaired our ability to become a leader or a co-leader, and so the extra cost and risk of doing more sooner has to be compared to the additional benefit if we pull it off.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I mean, I guess given that thought process and the willingness to deploy some additional capital, I mean, would you expect that 2012 might be a little bit faster deployment than what you kind of would've thought when you first announced this initiative? Or do you still feel like that kind of annual spend is the right spend?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, first of all, right now, things are so uncertain, and there's so many swing factors. Since we're so tiny in a number of these countries, that is very difficult to forecast. We talked about this year, we'd be in the neighborhood of a $20 million loss, and we were at about $22 million. Right now, if we had to estimate, we'd say that we'll lose in the high 20s in this next year. Now that's actually a disappointment because we wanted to be at the same level of loss. And for us, that kind of percentage difference in what looks like it's going to happen versus what we expected is really embarrassing and unacceptable but that's where we are, and it gives you some flavor for right now the variability in our performance and accomplishments since we learned our way into the international world.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, I guess what is the delta to that? Is that because you're doing more revenue and therefore, more losses? Are you saying that actually, the actual performance, at -- the revenue has been in line, it's just the performance on that revenue has been disappointing?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, I think that's a level of detail I won't go to since the forecast is still so lively for such a small chunk of the business. I think that level of detail just wouldn't be very educational for you. But it's the net number, so it takes into account the overhead spending and the actual operating revenue and expenses. And to start parsing through it when it's so tiny, I think could be really misleading precision.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned that the VA rates were a headwind here, I guess, in the quarter. Are we now done with that? I mean, I guess obviously, VA kind of just come back and open things up again. But to your knowledge, are we done with that for the near term? Or is it more to come?","Kent J. Thiry","Appreciate the question. And first, I was just advised that I gave you some wrong information that our international losses in 2011 were $20 million, not $22 million, which then makes the difference between the high 20s in '12 versus our actual in 2011 even worse. And now that I gave you that correction, your question was what?","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It was the VA, and I guess you mentioned that was a little bit of a headwind.","Kent J. Thiry","I've got it. I've got the question. Now this was, \"What is the answer?\". It's hard to know what they might do when and how we might respond. So there's nothing dramatic happening right now. But I wouldn't want to say to you we think it's going to be stable all year because we just don't know. And on the one hand, we take care of a lot of vets and they don't want that to change. They, on the other hand, have a lot of power. So how it plays out, I just think giving a micro-prediction would not be helpful because it would presume a level of insight on our part that we don't have. Suffice it to say that we are investing a bunch and trying to develop a stable, high value-added relationship with them where both sides feel that we're at a reasonable equilibrium. Maybe we are there now, maybe not.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, I guess everyone's focused on budget deficits and when the next debt ceiling is going to be hit and what might be a result. I mean, how do you think about your ability to offset rate cuts going forward? I mean, have you -- do you feel like your business is kind of fully adjusted to the bundled rate? Or are there more opportunity over time to become more efficient that might allow you to help mitigate what seems like inevitable rate cuts to most sectors going forward?","Kent J. Thiry","I'd say 3 things. Number one, from an expense point of view, I think we're more or less in a post-bundle equilibrium. Number two, having said that, we strive for productivity improvements every single year. We always try to select some parts of our cost structure to focus on and see if we can innovate our way to savings. So when i say equilibrium, you need to evaluate the use of that word in that perspective. And then -- well maybe, I would just leave it at those 2 comments. Did I miss a part of your question?","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","No, I think that covers it.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Gary Taylor with Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of questions. I'm sorry, I must have missed right at the very beginning. I assume Luis kind of went through the change in revenue per treatment, sequentially, and obviously, the VA was part of that. Did you say the VA was the biggest part of that sequential decline?","Luis A. Borgen","Gary, let me repeat those phrases for you. The 4 factors that we cited were first, decline in commercial mix. The second one was at new lower VA rates. Those rates came into effect on 10\/1 of 2011, and so we had the full impact in Q4 versus just 1 month in Q3. The third factor was a decline in physician-prescribed pharmaceuticals, i.e. utilization. And finally, we had a quarter-over-quarter decrease in the amount of revenue related to vaccinations. So those are the main factors that reflect all our drop from Q3 to Q4.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then the impact of pharma on the top line under bundling is what? Which pharma would be driving that?","Luis A. Borgen","It will be the unbundled contracts.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On the commercial side?","Luis A. Borgen","That's correct.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And anything on just commercial bundled contracts in general? Any -- I know your competitors talked the last couple of quarters about some that has kind of weighed on sequential results moving unbundled commercial contracts into bundling. You guys haven't talked a lot about that. That doesn't sound like it was a material factor.","Luis A. Borgen","That's correct.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And on, Kent, just on your comment about the investigation. You were referring to Colorado, correct?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, sir.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, just want to make sure. And then on integrated care, I guess I have 2 questions. One, you would agree that the savings opportunity is on the incremental $50,000 or so of spend primarily, right?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And is there, I guess when we look at -- we only have the benefit as far as I know of seeing publicly the first 3 years of those demonstration projects, and we didn't see kind of what the savings amounted to in years 4 and 5. And I know for example, in the Fresenius data, they saved more in year 2 than year 1. They saved more in year 3 to year 2. I think they've implied to the markets they saved even more in years 4 and 5. So the question is, if this was rolled out, is there still the effect that the amount of intervention and integration you're doing means that the savings grow cumulatively? Or is it that you're learning through the 5 years of that demonstration and the savings upfront could be more impactful than were able to be demonstrated through the demonstration project?","Kent J. Thiry","Very fair question. Statement A, we have gotten better every year and that continues. Answer B, actually, in my mind, our way of learning has been disappointing, and we can get a lot better than we are. And so unfortunately, answer C is the impact, both because of the challenges of scaling and because we've not done as well as we should have in terms of being more creative, more aggressive, more innovative, that we've still got a lot more learning than I wish we had, enough to see great results, exacting results and be optimistic. But when you think about scaling it and executing, we don't give ourselves impressive grades for how well we've done in the last few years.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Do you have an estimate on that $50,000, what a reasonable savings percentage might be? Or do you not want to go there yet?","Kent J. Thiry","I don't think it's a good idea to talk about that.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Very last question. Luis, on the tax rate for '12, is that primarily state local income tax effect that's bumping that up a little bit?","Luis A. Borgen","Yes, it's 2 factors. It is partially state. It also has to relate with the international losses, deductibility of those. We can't do this in the current year, and so that puts up pressure on yields in the overall ETR.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm sorry, I lied. I have one more quick question. You talked about kind of the pharmaceutical run rate having stabilized. Any additional thoughts to subcu? We've seen some data suggesting some of the small providers have moved a little bit more towards subcu dosing on EPO. Where are you -- where's DaVita at in terms of considering the possibility of that?","Kent J. Thiry","I don't know of any significant movement among our physicians to use subcu, nor has there been any discussion that I've been a part of. So I don't have an answer other than probably there's nothing going on because none of our doctors are talking about it. If some of our doctors start to talk about that and move in that direction, we would certainly report back to folks. But I just haven't seen or heard of anything like it, and so that's where we stand.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn this call back over to the panel for closing remarks.","Kent J. Thiry","I'll just pick up on one issue that came up, which was Medicare rate cuts. That while it is true that we have a lot of Medicare patients and it's rational to expect that Congress may do something with Medicare rates, it is also true that we are about the most discreet health care service there is, with 85% to 95% of our centers freestanding. They only do one thing and all the expenses are submitted in a cost report to the government every year. We personally have about 150 centers that currently lose money as it is. And so in our segment, if the government will get inappropriately aggressive and cut rates, they could be faced with some serious center closures in centers that didn't have enough private patients to sustain the subsidy on the Medicare side. And so while all Medicare providers have to be worried about rate cuts, we, in some ways, have arguments of clarity of data and consequences of a mistake that other segments do not have. ","With that final comment, I want to thank everyone for paying attention to our company, and we will do our best for you in the next 3 months until we talk again. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's DaVita Q4 2011 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."],"7287":["DaVita, Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to DaVita's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Thank you.","Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference.","Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Marie, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in the company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our first quarter earnings release of earlier today and our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to our most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release filed with the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Jim, and welcome to all on this call. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. Therefore, I will start, as always, with some of our clinical results. CMS recently released the latest five-star results for the kidney care community in April, in fact, and the industry mix of four-and-five-star centers increased from 41% in 2015 to 53% in 2016. It says wonderful things about our community overall in terms of improving care year after year after year.","In addition, DaVita's mix increased in the same period from 42% to 56% and we still long for the days of yore when there was a forced curve for these rankings, but very happy with our leadership position with respect to the current system as well. And if we hasten to add and remind people that these improvements in quality of care are not only good for our patients and their families, but they're also great for the taxpayer and that they lead to improved health and reduced hospitalizations.","Now onto the three summary points of this call from a pure business point of view. JR will talk about it in more detail, but the quarter, as many of you have no doubt already observed was a strong one for U.S. Kidney Care. Second, the DMG sale process continues to progress on track. And third and finally and equally significantly, we deployed significant amounts of your cash towards share repurchases.","I'll come back a little later with another thought or two, but now over to Javier for U.S. Kidney Care.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. The first quarter was a good start to the year with solid operating performance in our Kidney Care business. Aside from changes in calcimimetics, which I will discuss shortly, it was a pretty straightforward quarter operationally. Normalized non-acquired growth was 3.4%. Net revenue per treatment was up slightly excluding the positive impact of calcimimetics and the additional Medicare bad debt revenues of $24 million, open enrollment in commercial and ACA plans were stable, and we had good performance in operational cost and G&A, offset by the increase in our workforce costs and seasonal payroll taxes.","Now for some detail on calcimimetics, starting in January of 2018, this class of drug was included in our Medicare reimbursement on a cost-plus basis. This is our first transition of a drug class from Part D to Part B reimbursement. The transition introduced significant operational changes in our clinic, billing and contracting teams. We spent the second half of 2017 developing processes and systems and training teammates for this change. While it is early, I am encouraged with the transition to date. As you know, there are still several open matters, in particular timing of when the generics to be introduced, physicians prescribing patterns between the oral and injectable product, and the future transition of calcimimetics into the bundle.","Now, let me transition into union-backed initiatives we are facing. These initiatives attempt to cap reimbursement by ignoring the costs actually required to operate a clinic. They have already led us to cancel and postpone new clinics in California despite the need due to an already high capacity utilization in the state.","If the initiatives were to pass, we believe a legal or regulatory intervention will be needed to prevent negative impact on access to care for this vulnerable patient population and could have a broader impact on utilization of hospitals and emergency room resources in the state. To counter these initiatives, the dialysis industry and other healthcare groups are working together and have hired experienced advisers. We're committed to advocate and represent the voice of our patients, our teammates, and our shareholders, and do what is necessary to educate voters on the risks and flaws we see in these initiatives.","Finally, I know you're looking for us to handicap the outcome, but at this juncture, it is difficult to predict. I will note, however, that if the ballot initiative fails, unfortunately, it is not likely to end the union's corporate campaign.","Now moving on to policies that benefit patients, we continue to be excited about the prospect of transforming patient care in the dialysis industry through the PATIENTS Act. We have an unusual amount of bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress with 178 co-sponsors. While it will be a significant lift to get this transformative legislation approved this year, we believe we have a real shot.","During the quarter, we made progress on other important issues to the kidney care community, including legislative provisions that authorize private accreditation for dialysis providers, which could lead us to open new facilities faster in certain states. We also got reauthorization on Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plans, including C-SNPs, which have been set to expire January 1, 2019.","And lastly, we also have now allowed PD and HHD patients and their physicians to substitute two of the three monthly in-person physician visits with a telehealth visit, which we expect to facilitate growth in the home modality. These are all good steps forward for patients and providers.","Now, on to Joel for financial details on our results.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Javier. Operating income from continuing operations for the first quarter was $411 million. The quarter contained a few items that are outside our run rate. First, we recognized $24 million in Medicare bad debt recoveries relating to the change in revenue recognition standards. This is in line with what we mentioned last quarter. In the second quarter, we expect to recognize another $6 million to $8 million. Second, we recognized $17 million related to prior period shared savings revenue from our DaVita Health Solutions business. We do not expect this to recur next quarter.","Net dialysis revenue per treatment was up approximately $23 from Q4. Approximately $19 of this came from the calcimimetics change and $3 is from the Medicare bad debt recoveries I mentioned before. Adjusting for these factors, RPT was up about $1 versus Q4.","Our dialysis patient care cost per treatment was up approximately $25 from Q4. Most of this was the result of the addition of calcimimetics to our dialysis cost structure. Other smaller items were the headwind for the 401(k) match we implemented this year, increases in salaries and wages, seasonally higher payroll taxes, and one fewer treatment day in the quarter.","The overall impact on operating income from the reimbursement change for calcimimetics was roughly breakeven, as a small positive margin in the dialysis and lab segment was offset by indirect costs and operating income declines in our strategic initiatives and corporate segment.","Dialysis segment G&A cost per treatment were largely in line with both the first quarter of 2017 and with the full year 2017 average. We continue to expect dialysis segment G&A per treatment to be roughly in line with last year's levels.","Looking at the full year, we're continuing to expect our Kidney Care operating income to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion.","A few words on the DMG sale. We continue to be on track to close the transaction in 2018. As disclosed in March, we and Optum received a second request from the FTC, and we are working diligently to respond.","On to international. In the first quarter, our operating profit in international was $1 million, excluding a $3 million foreign exchange loss from the cash balance in our Asia Pacific joint venture. We continue to expect to achieve sustainable profitability by Q4 2018, excluding any foreign exchange gains or losses. This is incorporated in our enterprise guidance for continuing operations for 2018.","Regarding taxes, our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations was 27% in the quarter. We continue to expect our effective tax rate from continuing operations in 2018 to be between 26.5% and 27.5%.","Now, cash flow. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $206 million for the quarter. This was lower than our expected full-year 2018 run rate, due primarily to an increase in AR from calcimimetics and seasonal decreases in accrued compensation in the quarter. I will note that our DSOs were down one day quarter-over-quarter in U.S. dialysis and lab segment. We continue to expect operating cash flow from continuing operations for the year to be $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.","Now, on to CapEx. First, I wanted to add some detail to our disclosure about our development CapEx. Included in the development CapEx in Table 7 of our press release is capital that we spend for buildings we develop from the ground-up, which we then sell and lease back, as well as the full CapEx amount for clinics that are owned with JV partners.","For both these items, a portion of the capital outlay is temporary and eventually covered by either the buyers of the building or our JV partners. To ensure you have the details to take these factors into consideration when evaluating our cash flow, I would point you to a new line we added to Table 7 called sale of self-developed real estate projects, and to the contributions from non-controlling interest line in our cash flow statement. We hope these will help bridge an accounting view of CapEx to more economic view of cash generation of the business. We continue to expect total CapEx for continuing operations to be around $925 million for 2018. This includes some non-recurring capital spend in 2018. We still expect 2019 CapEx to be more in line with 2017 spend of approximately $800 million.","Looking forward, we are evaluating opportunities that could lower the capital intensity of our business and are working with physicians, patient groups, payers, and regulators to increase capacity utilization, lower the cost of center construction, and grow home dialysis. If successful, we think these efforts could lead to a stronger ecosystem that works better for all stakeholders.","Finally, on share repurchases. Through May 2, 2018, year-to-date, we have repurchased 8.5 million shares for $574 million, representing nearly 5% of our shares outstanding. This includes approximately $500 million of stock repurchase since our last earnings call. We view this as an early deployment of the enhanced liquidity we expect following the close of the DMG sale. To facilitate these buybacks, we have taken on higher leverage in the short term and have put in place an incremental Term Loan A as an extension of our current credit agreement. We expect to enter into new financing arrangements subsequent to the close of the pending DMG transaction.","Now, I'll turn it over to Kent for some closing remarks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Joel. Before we transition to Q&A, please allow me six quick restatements. Number one and perhaps most important, U.S. dialysis operations are once again strong in every regard. Number two, the DMG sale continues to be on track. Number three, we do have some active swing factors on both sides of the fence, negative things like the union corporate campaign and positive things like the good shot at the PATIENTS Act in integrated care.","Number four, we continue to be very well-positioned long term to provide integrated care to the large American kidney disease population. Number five, we're seeing some nice improvement in our international results. And finally, number six, we continue to generate strong cash flows, which we continue to deploy with discretion towards growing our business and towards significant share repurchases.","And with that, operator, can we please move to Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. As of the moment, we have four questions on queue. Let's start with Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. So, on the \u2013 couple clarification questions first, the Medicare bad debt number, I guess as the way to think of the quarter from a normalized basis is it's kind of just take out that $24 million number to kind of see what a clean quarter would be. Is that the way to think about it?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","I think that's fair. And I'd also point to the $17 million from the DHS as a non-recurring item. So if you really wanted to normalize, you'd take out both of those.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. But both of those things were already contemplated in the guidance, so that's not a back-out versus the guidance. It's just more kind of back out to a clean base number.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","That's fair.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And I guess, I'm trying to figure out how to think about the calcimimetics for the rest of the year. I just had to model it. My guess is the answer is that it's not going to be a big earnings driver no matter how it plays out. But is the assumption that that number should kind of decline over time throughout the year as the company gets better at kind of moving to generics and managing the utilization of that drug, so we should be kind of assuming less of a boost to revenue and also less of a cost (17:20) number be relatively stable to Q1?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","I think the beginning, Kevin, is \u2013 where you started out is the right way to think about it, which is in aggregate, it'll be economic neutral to slight positive, and there would be a temporary up if generics come out. So, that's probably the best way to think about it.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. But we should kind of think of a revenue cost effectively it comes down a little bit as the year goes on?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","I think, right now, we don't have visibility of that because the best way to think of it is we've had some operational changes in where it goes and what line item. But clinically, we're not seeing any change of yet, so hard to predict what you're asking.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, maybe the last question. It's in the commentary around the CapEx spending and it seemed like for the first time \u2013 I don't know if you guys were ever against home hemo certainly. I think you always viewed it as an important part of the benefit. But it almost sounded like you were planning on doing it a lot more prospectively and that was a maybe initiative that we haven't really seen from you in the past. Has something changed there about your view about the need for \u2013 or the opportunity in home hemo over the next few years versus how you thought about it over the last few years?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","I don't know. Kevin, this is KT. We have been a leader in growing PD and HHD for the last decade relative to most of the community, big or small, for profit or not for profit. And so, it's been a significant part of our last decade. It's had an impact on de novo decisions and CapEx decisions, et cetera. And so, we are continuing to consider it as one of the very important variables in making regional strategic decisions. And so, maybe it's a slight change, but it's actually just pretty darn consistent with what we've been doing for a decade, and we're going to maintain the same intensity level going forward as far as to where we are today compared to ten years ago.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Any reaction to the CVS announcement around they're trying to push into home hemo on dialysis?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Kevin, this is Javier. I've gotten the question asked by many people, and the reality is that we don't know exactly what they're going to do since there's not a lot of details out there. As you know, we've had intense competition in the past, and we are working hard and we will do so to compete effectively going forward.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. So just want to go back and make sure I'm crystal clear on the $47 million. So you're saying whatever number you end up with this year in terms of EBIT or operating income, I should take $47 million out of that number as the right jump-off rate to go into 2019?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","I'm sorry, Justin. It's Joel. I apologize. Can you say that again? You're asking about the annual run rate against which you would compare 2019?","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, Joel. Basically, what I'm asking here is if you do $1.5 billion in operating income, right, Kidney Care income, I need to back $47 million out of that to think about the right jump-off rate for growth in 2019, because that $47 million is not going to recur next year.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's $41 million. It's $24 million plus $17 million. But I think you're thinking about it correctly that these are non-recurring, not...","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Well, there's going to be another $6 million to $8 million next quarter.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","I'm sorry. Yeah. So that's fair. Yeah.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Just wanted to make double sure I'm clear there. So then in terms of commercial mix, can you give us an update there on any changes in the quarter? And maybe even tell us the impact on revenue per treatment, either sequentially or year-over-year from commercial mix change?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Justin, as you know, we don't guide quarterly on mix. What I can sort of state because it feels so important is that we are in a normal environment, and in the past quarters we tried to give you a little sense of what that meant in our portfolio. And right now we're in a stable period, and that's reflected in our revenue per treatment and in our guidance.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So stable commercial mix?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","There's nothing that I'm \u2013 that I would give you additional detail. How's that? It's embedded in our guidance.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So \u2013 okay. So maybe I can come at it another way, then Kent. I think you talked fairly positively about commercial pricing and contracting coming into 2018. So I just want to try to understand how this squares up to, it looks like about a $1 increase in core revenue per treatment. I know the Medicare rates are almost zip, but I think you get $1 there. So why is the commercial price driving a little bit more of an increase there if mix is stable?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","I'm going to take a stab at it, Justin, although there's a lot of puts and takes, of course, but I think the primary point that we made last quarter or last quarter and the prior quarter was that we had an unusual and positive level of long-term stability baked into five out of the six largest contracts we have. And so it was more about the stability at what we think are reasonable rates. That was a distinction from much of their prior year's history.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And when you talk about reasonable rates, I always have thought about those as more like 2% to 3%. Is that what we're seeing there, kind of inflationary-type rates?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think we want to start giving answers on specific percentage changes, given we're always involved with all sorts of negotiations with all sorts of payers.","And again, the point we made, which was a positive one for shareholders, was about the longer-term nature of a lot of the contracts, especially the big contracts, and at rates that we think are reasonable and fair. So those were words we hadn't been able to say for the prior year or two or maybe even three. And so it was good for you all to know that.","But we really have never gone quarter-by-quarter or year-by-year talking about weighted average commercial increases, because that then can get in the way of our negotiations.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks, guys.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Justin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. I just want to go to the shared savings in the quarter. Maybe could you just remind us a little bit, what participation you have that's driving that? Because I know it added about $14 million in the fourth quarter, and I guess technically you said, don't assume that would recur in the fourth quarter. You didn't necessarily say it may not recur ever. So was this quarter a surprise? But just kind of remind us where you're participating and the scale of that? And why you don't think you might have equivalent earnings from the program next year?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","I'm sorry, Gary. Could you repeat?","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. On the shared savings, earnings contribution, the $17 million you're talking about. In the fourth quarter, you had about $14 million and you suggested we probably shouldn't assume that recur. So it looks like this came in better. Could you just kind of remind us the scale of your participation and why you don't think these types of earnings would continue going forward?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Those were non-recurring settlements with one of our clients. And so they don't reflect any sort of ongoing profit flow. And that's why we used the phrase non-recurring. So that reflects some good business success, but it's not a regular operating result. It was more a negotiated result after the first phase of a big project.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Two more quick ones. I thought Joel said excluding \u2013 I presume this is what he meant \u2013 excluding the calcimimetics impact that dialysis segment revenue per treatment would be in line with last year. Were you speaking to the quarter or were you talking about 2018 overall versus 2017?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","So, Gary, I said it would be up about $1, which is Q1 2018 over Q4 2017. That's backing out calcimimetics as well as the Medicare bad debt recovery.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. You didn't make a comment about the full year of 2018? Maybe I just didn't understand that correctly.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","No, I didn't.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Last question. So you called about $19 of revenue per treatment impact from calcimimetics. Fresenius this morning said $11. Any thoughts on why your number is more sizable than theirs? I know you guys do plenty of market intelligence.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","No. We obviously were told of their number, but we don't have a good reason for the difference.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Clive at Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Hi. A few questions. First, just on the California situation, thank you for the detail on that. We heard from Fresenius earlier today that it sounds like Arizona may not be moving forward. It would be great to just hear your views on where things stand on whether a question gets on the ballot in Arizona and Ohio. And also SEIU has apparently budgeted about $15 million to push the initiative at least in California. I believe Javier mentioned that it wasn't just the dialysis industry joining the fight on this. So I assume that means you'll get sort of financial help from other interested parties, but it would just be helpful to understand the approach here.","And second, you mentioned the Dialysis PATIENTS Care Act is getting a lot of attention. Do you have any specific piece of legislation that you have your sights on as a vehicle for this? Do you think there's enough time before election season and campaigning really kicks off? Or will this more likely be a 2019 event?","And then just lastly, could you just give us an update on the acute market in U.S. Dialysis? FMC seemed to allude to, I think, losing a contract in acute care. I was just wondering if you've picked up anything in particular there and whether that was part of your fairly strong organic growth in the quarter.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Okay, Lisa. Let's take them in order. The first one on Arizona and Ohio and what's going on with the ballot initiatives. While we hear rumors, there's no real confirmation whether it has dropped out in Arizona and Ohio. So we continue to be optimistic in both states. And as it relates to the size of the investment, of course, we're going to try and get as many people to participate economically, and we will do what it takes to make sure that our patients' and our teammates' voice, shareholders' voice is represented. So too early to tell. As you know, these campaigns can have major fluctuations in the size of the investment depending on how they play out. And so I don't know. Did I get to all the points on the ballot there?","Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Yeah. Actually, just one follow-up, there is still no real major costs for fighting these initiatives included in the guidance. Correct?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","That's correct.","Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Okay.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Okay. On the last one, and I think I'll let Kent talk about the policy point. Let me just take on the acute. We have worked very hard in our acute business to make sure that we keep pricing discipline and we work hard to stay profitable. We win and obviously sometimes we lose accounts, but the business continues to be a good contributor for us. And this high flu season actually had some give and takes from our center into the hospital, but it is a good business for us.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","And on PATIENTS Act, it's just really hard for all the reasons you know to guess what might be available as a vehicle. There's certainly going to be some legislation that passes before January 1, 2019, because they have to do certain things, although sometimes they seem to be able to avoid doing even what they have to do. So I say that without total certainty but certainly very high probability, and we'll be competing with other people for whatever vehicles exist. And whether that's in the second half of 2018 or the first half of 2019 is just pretty difficult to handicap.","Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Okay, thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. One more numbers question in terms of the revenue per treatment. Just want to confirm that the shared savings dollars don't flow through revenue per treatment, that $17 million, right. That flows through ancillary?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Correct.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then getting back to the SEIU and, Javier, I know you said they're coming on multiple avenues, so maybe we could just talk about a couple of the other ones. The SEIU and some plans joined to send a letter to CMS on patient assistance. Curious if there's any feedback from CMS here on their thoughts regarding their willingness to reengage here.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Justin. As it relates to the letter to the Secretary, I would just say that it is normal for the new Secretary to get involved and for some of the people to try to respin-up the story because of their special interest. We, of course, have responded, and the AKF has responded because that letter has a lot of misleading allegations and a lot of things that had been debunked by the community, just factual things that need to be debunked.","So in general, we have not heard back from them, but we know that the counter-response that the American Kidney Fund letter has on their website is very, very good and very clear. And so we're happy at the response, and we have not heard whether they're engaged.","The other thing that's important to consider is that the numbers speak for themselves. The individual market medical cost attributable to ESRD is just lower now than the group market. And so what that means is that the risk distribution is now in favor of the plan. And so the numbers speak for themselves that there's no there-there. And so I'm hoping that when they look at the facts, they will reach the same conclusion.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. And then just in California, on the legislative side, looked like there was some legislation introduced to, I guess, force the dialysis community or the AKF, I guess, to disclose any patients that are getting charitable assistance.","So I want to make sure I'm understanding that correctly, and what you think the potential impact? I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether it passes or not. But if we just assume that it did, what would the potential impact be that you should think we should consider?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","I think, Justin, you're talking about SB 1156, the Senate Bill, which is again a payer and a union with a different agenda and trying to put some kind of restriction on CPA and sort of the typical thing that we've disclosed where the payer is wanting to avoid coverage for the sick, and the union is trying to lever the dialysis industry. So what we're trying to do is obviously, work with the legislation to educate them.","And this bill is more extensive than dialysis, not just the AKF. And so we will be working with other constituents to make sure that legislators are educated.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And just following up on Gary's question around the run rate, or this $17 million or the run rate on the shared savings, is there a run rate that we could think about as being a reasonable contribution for your participation in these plans that we should think? And maybe it's not $17 million. Or \u2013 but should we assume that they're zero next year?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. I think zero is a safer assumption going forward.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","And given that you're participating in these, are you saying that you don't see yourself participating going forward? Or you don't think there will be any savings to share? Why would it be zero?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","It's a very small startup operation, Justin, with disproportionate expenses relative to its business base. And so there's going to be ups and downs and puts and takes. In the context of the broader enterprise, they're going to be really tiny. And so it just, I think, makes sense to call it a neutral, and then we'll wait and see if at some point it starts to generate numbers that are worthy of your attention.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Got it. In terms of, Joel, you gave us some helpful numbers in understanding what your true economic CapEx was, and I really appreciated that. You mentioned you're evaluating opportunities to lower CapEx. You talked about center construction cost by adding capacity. I assume you mean you're going to increase capacity at existing centers? Meaning almost knock down a wall and put another set of chairs in there, relative to building an entire another center? Decreasing...","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","I'm sorry, Justin. My comment was about increasing capacity utilization, not about increasing capacity. So it actually would not require any marginal CapEx.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So I guess what I was really trying to get to here is just if you saw yourself as being successful there, relative to the $800 million run rate that you talked about for next year, if you hit on all of these things, how much of a dent in CapEx do you think that could make?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","So I appreciate the question. I know exactly where you're coming from. It is just too early for us to speculate on if this initiative will be successful and at what magnitude.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. I apologize. I'm rambling off because I think I'm the last person to ask a question here. So I won't get back to jump in the queue. So I got one more for you. In terms of \u2013 it's good to see that you're looking at your stock as an attractive investment. You're buying it ahead of the expected DMG close. So, one, it makes everyone, I assume, think that you feel pretty confident that this deal is going to close despite the regulatory timeline.","But as importantly, when this does close, it sounds like it's going to close before we might have clarity on the ballot initiative. Do you see yourself potentially stepping forward and doing something even more material once you have full visibility on the close and have access to that cash while the stock is in this limbo, or do you think that's not something that you could see yourself doing?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Justin, we're not going to speculate on timing and process and methodology for the share buybacks. We're committed to the buybacks as we've talked about in the past. How exactly those will play out is very hard to predict.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there then. Thanks, guys.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We show no further questions on queue.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay. Thank you all very much for your time, attention and questions. And we'll work hard for you in between now and our next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of this conference.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jim Gustafson. Jim, you may begin.","Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Ann, and welcome everyone to our first quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our new CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Vijay Kotte, Chief Financial Officer (sic) [Chief Value Officer] (00:54) of DaVita Medical Group; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no delay to update these statements for any reason.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release filed with the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Jim, and welcome everyone to this quarterly call. On a summary basis, at the enterprise level, it was a solid performance in a pretty dynamic environment, as you all well know. And at this point, we are on plan to deliver within our guidance, all the normal risks associated therewith.","Before we get into any more specifics of our Q1 performance, we will start, as we always do, with our clinical performance. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. First, within the DaVita Medical Group, we have a program called Ride the Wave where we attempt to reach out to each and every one of our senior members, that's 360,000 human beings and we hit our goal of just over 95% of these seniors seen at least once during the past year in 2016. This is radically different from the level of care that Medicare patients and Fee-For-Service ever get, and radically different than many other MA plans as well.","On to Kidney Care with an equally significant factoid, one-third of our commercial contracts now contain a value-based component. And under these contracts, we typically have catheter targets. And within those targets, we had a 15% improvement in the catheter rate through our improved clinical processes in coordination with payers, et cetera. As many of you know, patients with catheters are nine times more likely to contract a bloodstream infection, and that leads to serious hospitalizations and a lot of other bad stuff. As always, we hasten to emphasize that our quality care, a differentially high quality care not only results in healthier patients, but also drives down healthcare costs.","Now, I'll turn it over to Javier for Kidney Care.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. Q1 was in line with what we expected in Kidney Care. I'll summarize the financial performance and discuss some of the key business drivers. Non-acquired growth for the quarter was 3.8%, which is within the range of our long-term expectation of 3.5% to 4.5% on an annual basis. Our adjusted operating income was $380 million for the quarter. The decrease versus fourth quarter of 2016 was driven by both normal seasonal factors and other factors that we outlined as part of our 2017 guidance.","Let me elaborate on each. First, there were normal seasonal factors, including higher EPO utilization due to the flu season, higher payroll taxes in the first quarter of each year and two fewer treatment days. Second, we faced some swing factors that we've previously disclosed. Let me repeat them and provide some additional color. We'll start with the four headwinds.","Number one, we experienced lower enrollment on patients on the ACA plans. Number two, we continue to see an increase of clinical teammate wages. Number three, there was a decline in adjusted operating income in our pharmacy operations. You won't be able to see this in our segment breakout for the first quarter because improvements in other ancillary businesses helped offset this decrease, but you will see the decrease in future quarters. Finally, revenue was higher in the first quarter of 2017, as our forecasted commercial rate decreases take place later in the year.","Now let me shift to a couple of the tailwinds. As discussed previously, we have temporarily decreased our compensation accruals in 2017 due to a switch from profit share programs to a 401(k) match program, and we benefited from lower EPO pricing from our recent renegotiated contract with Amgen. The primary adjustment to our Kidney Care adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2017 was a government settlement that we previously disclosed. As a reminder, we received $538 million in March.","Next, we're happy to announce the closing of the acquisition of Renal Ventures effective May 1. We acquired 38 centers in six states. As part of the deal, we had to divest seven centers. The partial year financial impact of this acquisition is already incorporated into our 2017 guidance. Keep in mind that we'll incur some one-time costs to integrate the business.","Finally, we just executed an extension to our partnership with Humana to provide integrated care services to approximately 7,500 Humana members with late-stage CKD and ESRD. The ESRD industry continues to move in the direction of integrated care due to the number of comorbid conditions that ESRD patients have. Our strong clinical performance improves the quality of life for patients and puts us in a good position to partner with payers to reduce costs to the healthcare system.","As to outlook, we're reaffirming our 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance of $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion. As Kent mentioned on our last earnings call, we're in a period of greater uncertainty than is usual for our Kidney Care business given the efforts around repeal and replace and the impact those efforts will have on healthcare in our country and on our business. We will continue to monitor political landscape and represent dialysis patients in those discussions.","Now, on to Vijay Kotte to discuss DMG.","Vijay Kotte - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Javier.","For the first quarter of 2017, DaVita Medical Group had an operating income of $12 million. These results include a few things: first, $10 million of expected rate headwind; second, nearly $7 million of previously described accelerated non-cash brand amortization for the transition from HCP to DMG; and third, $50 million of depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter.","Finally, reflected in our performance were some higher-than-expected medical expenses in the quarter, driven in part by a more intense flu season in both California and Florida. These expenses were partially offset by composite results from true-ups to existing shared savings pools. As we look at the full year, it is too early to make any changes to the operating income guidance range of $110 million to $150 million, though it is more likely than not to be in the lower half of the range. We'll have more to say about this during the second quarter earnings call after we have visibility from the prior year and the mid-year revenue true-ups that typically occur during summer.","Looking beyond 2017, in April, CMS issued the final Medicare Advantage rate notice for the 2018 payment year. Our analysis results in projected rates to be flat from 2017 to 2018. As you may recall, during our Capital Markets Day last year, we communicated an expectation that Medicare rates would track with medical expenses trend over the long term. As a result, we expected approximately 1.5% improvement or $30 million in rate increases for 2018, which we no longer expect to materialize, though we will do our best to mitigate some of it. We will go into further detail regarding our longer-term expectations at our Capital Markets Day later this month.","Now, to Joel to discuss international and some other financial items.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Vijay. To everyone on the phone, as you probably know, this is my first earnings call, and it is a pleasure to be here. I look forward to meeting many of you at Capital Markets Day in a few weeks.","First, I will address our international operations. The adjusted operating loss from our international business was $11 million. This result includes a $3.5 million currency loss within the Asia Pacific joint venture. A $6 million non-cash gain on the creation of our Asia JV has been excluded from the adjusted operating income. We continue to expect adjusted international operating losses to be approximately $20 million in 2017, excluding any currency gains or losses. We are also excited to welcome Robert Lang as the President of our International Operations. He started with us in April. Robert joins us with extensive experience growing international healthcare and insurance businesses. Next, a few financial details for the enterprise.","In the quarter, we generated strong operating cash flow of $865 million, positively impacted by the settlement payment received from the government. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 remains $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. Our adjusted tax rate attributable to DaVita, Inc. was 40% in the quarter, after non-GAAP adjustments highlighted in the press release. We continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate attributable to DaVita, Inc. in 2017 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%. We, like other U.S.-centric healthcare service providers, pay among the highest tax rates in corporate America. Finally, our debt expense for the quarter was $104 million.","Now over to Kent for a few closing comments.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. I'll get to Q&A in one second, but just a couple of thoughts.","With respect to DaVita Kidney Care, three points: number one, we are undoubtedly going through a period of regulatory turbulence; number two, the foundation, however, for this business is distinctively strong; and number three, we continue to be excited about the prospect of integrated care upside.","On to the DaVita Medical Group: number one, certainly short-term operating income disappointment; but number two, we enjoy formidable market positions; and number three, have maintained a very healthy cash flow.","And then lastly, with respect to international: number one, this is a controlled adventure; and number two, the long-term growth upside is really quite striking.","Operator, can we move on to Q&A, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck. Kevin, your line is now open.","Catherine Anderson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. This is Catherine Anderson on for Kevin. You highlighted a $100 million headwind to guidance from commercial pricing. The last quarter, you indicated that you think it wouldn't continue into 2018. Can you talk a little bit about your managed care contracting over the past few months and how confident you are that it's a one-time reset?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, Catherine, let me see if I get the \u2013 what you're going for in your question. The short answer is you have not seen the hit because they're in the back end of the year. And how we're feeling about the environment is that the environment is very active on the one topic of charitable premium assistance, but the relationship with our payers continue to be what they have been for years. And as you see from the announcement on Humana, we continue to negotiate all of our contracts. And actually, we are in a situation where right now we are as contracted as we've been for quite some time. I don't believe we said $100 million in headwind is incorporated in our guidance. So, we'll have to check that.","Catherine Anderson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then in your guidance, were you assuming that all of the Medicaid-eligible patients who moved out of exchange funds, they were going into Medicaid this year? Has that been working out? And how much of your commercial revenue is getting support from the AKF today?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. On the first part of your question, yes, those patients have gone back to Medicaid. And as to the second part of your question, I'm not going to provide any additional details than what we've already provided.","Catherine Anderson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.","This is Jim Gustafson. I just want to confirm, we have not given a number to the commercial rate headwind. It's incorporated in our guidance, but we didn't say $100 million.","Catherine Anderson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Catherine.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary. Gary, your line is now open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi Jim, (14:48) it's me.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Hi, Gary.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. So I guess, maybe just to follow-up on the last question, Javier, regarding the commercial pricing. Is the expectation still that the pressure is going to be on the small number of, I guess, out of network rates that you expect to see decreases on?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, Gary. As you know, there's a wide distribution of rate. And what we want to do is make sure that we do what's right for the long term. So sometimes, we have some of their outliers that we need to bring in, and we do have a small set of out-of-network rates, and so those are sometimes the one we're discussing here.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe you mentioned EPO, I guess, utilization being up a little bit in response to flu. Can you discuss, to whatever extent that you're willing, kind of impact it had in the quarter? Or is the new contract in place? And, I guess, are you seeing the benefit from it as you would have expected?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yes. We are seeing the benefit as we expected. And of course, we had to go down, wind down some inventory that we had, but we are experiencing the contract as we anticipated. As it relates to the spike on the seasonal, of course, it's very hard to predict and isolate because of the flu season, it's sort of a moving target, if you will. And with the prescriptions the way they are, meaning every physician gets to make their own, it's almost impossible to diagnose a number. But if you had to put it in a range or you had to bracket it, I'd put it anywhere from $5 million to $15 million or so.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then is there any way to give us any color on how the inventory issue, I guess, will benefit you to a greater extent in future quarters?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","On that, it's just basically we're winding down from inventory that was purchased at the previous contract. So, it's probably not worth worrying about.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa. Lisa, your line is now open.","Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Hi. I just wanted to get some clarification on the current guidance with regards to the premium support issues. So the 2,000 patients who are Medicaid-eligible, as the question earlier alluded to, so it's my understanding those have disappeared, so that's a $140 million headwind. But then you also gave guidance for another $90 million headwind from the non-Medicaid patients on the exchanges who have premium support and then also the non-Medicaid patients off the exchanges who have premium support. I'm just wondering particularly in between those two buckets, have you seen further erosion of the exchange-based book in addition to those 2,000 Medicaid-eligible? And then also separately, has there been any impact on the off-exchange individual plans?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. So, I'll try to give you as much as I know and then let me know if that answers the question. We did see those 2,000 patients that you alluded to, which is $140 million. It's probably not worth going to the detail on the $90 million, but at the end of the day, we did some handicapping as to what would happen, and the number worked out to be in the right range. And so as opposed to the journey, the destination ended up being the right one. How many patients are on and off exchange? We're kind of combining them, and there's approximately 2,500, which is, of course, give or take, half of the 3,000 plus 2,000 that we alluded to last year. Does that answer your question?","Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Okay. I'm a bit confused, because I thought there are 2,500 on exchange, 2,000 of whom are Medicaid eligible. So that leaves you with 500 who are on exchange. And you would know by now whether they've re-enrolled or not. And then there was about 1,000 who are off exchange in individual plans with premium support. At least that was my understanding of what the numbers looked like. So clearly, bucket number one, the Medicaid eligible goes away but then the others, if it's still a $90 million headwind, does that also include the impact from any rate pressure on your sort of broader private book of business?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. I think the confusion might be \u2013 we did not, to my recollection, provide detail on, on and off exchange. We basically just said that there was 5,000 patients on the exchanges. And so maybe that's where the confusion is coming from. And so we have not disclosed any additional detail. And so what I am telling you is that we have 2,500 patients that are both the addition of on and off exchange.","Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin. Justin, your line is now open.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Hi, Justin.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. A bunch of questions here. So I'll just ask a few and jump back into the queue. So first, just to follow up on a couple of numbers. The commercial contracting pressure, Javier, can you repeat what you said there? I apologize. I thought I caught it. But did you say that most of that hasn't actually developed yet, and that it's more of a back half of the year issue?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","I did. And we did not provide additional detail on the numbers. We were just clarifying a number that was thrown out. That wasn't a number that we had cited in the past.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So, you haven't actually agreed to any rate cuts on these out of network? It's just something that you anticipate could happen given what's going on in the world?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","There are some that are handicapped, which we always do for you. We try to give the best stab in anticipating what's going to transpire during the year. And then there are some that have been agreed to and have an effective date that hasn't been incorporated in Q1.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. So effectively, the stuff that's been agreed to at least, that's going to be in the back half of the year, would be an incremental headwind to 2018 as they are annualized (21:43)?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Correct, it will be in our run rate. Correct.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then remind me the patients that you had, the 5,000 patients on exchanges. Can you tell me the number of patients that were in Medicaid? Was that number 2,000?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then the patients that made up the $90 million that you expected also to lose. Can you give me that number out of the 5,000?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Let me see. I don't think I could give you any additional detail on that, Justin.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. I figured I'd take a shot. So then, while we're on commercial, can you update your commercial mix now?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","What have we disclosed?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","We're still at 11%, Justin.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","You're still at 11% even after losing 2,500 patients that had commercial individual insurance?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","So at the end of the fourth quarter, we were rounding down to 11%, now we're rounding up.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, so it's down about 100 basis points. And if you were to exclude what happened in the individual market, can you give me the underlying trends?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","The trends on what, Justin?","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","I'm sorry, if you were to exclude this one-time change in the individual market, right, if we were to call it that.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. What we...","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","If you pull those numbers out, did commercial mix improve or moderate, Q4 to Q1?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, we're seeing it moderate, I guess, to use your word, flat.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, last question before I jump back in. Just the international segment, international and other, I should say, together lost $25 million. Can you give us an idea of what you expect that \u2013 I mean I know you told us $20 million on international, can you give us a number or ballpark in the other segment for the year?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Give us one second, Justin, or maybe let's move on and we'll come back to it. That's not a number we typically are prepped on. I mean, of course, it's incorporated within our guidance and we try to do the additional service of carving out international here for the last several quarters, but the other number you're asking for is not something we've classically calculated and forecasted, so let us reflect a little bit.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Is that mostly Part D? And is that like a reasonable run rate to think about at least, this quarter is at a reasonable run rate then? You can't give us the guidance for the year?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think we want to throw out a spontaneous answer because again, you're asking for a parsing we've never done.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","So, give us a little time to stare at it. It's not an unreasonable question. It's just not something we've ever parsed that way before.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Thanks guys.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Justin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Margaret. Margaret, your line is now open.","Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. This is actually Scott Schaper on for Margaret. I wanted to ask just briefly, anything going on in the rumored new push for healthcare reform and do you see that could help or hurt DaVita and its patients?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Well, there's just so much speculation, Scott. I think we could talk about what's been talked about yesterday, but it will probably be different tomorrow. And so I think it's not good to speculate.","Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And you closed a deal this morning in the DMG group. Maybe just talk about the changes the team has made over the last two years or so in identifying quality assets that can contribute to that group. And maybe if you could, you could touch on a number of quality assets that you currently view as compelling in the way you see that going?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay. Scott, could you just repeat the question so I don't ramble around?","Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. It's just basically, what have you guys done from a management team perspective that you can point to towards identifying quality assets that can contribute almost immediately or in the near term in the DMG group versus historical where it's taken sometime or have not been great purchases at least at the start?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yes. Well, I guess, I'd give a two-part answer, and then you can come back for more. Number one, we said, think about a year ago that because we were still digesting some of the acquisitions we had made in the prior year-and-a-half that we were going to have a tighter filter on doing any new market large deals. And since that time, we haven't done any. There's always a chance that over the next year, we will do one, but there's also a very good chance we won't do any because we've got a bunch of opportunities in our existing markets and we want to focus on those.","The second dimension of looking for quality assets is in our existing markets. And here, we are looking at a nice steady space of what we call tuck-in deals where we're buying or merging in small practices or medium-sized practices and attaching them to some of our existing assets. And that process is moving along quite nicely.","Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. So that's how we should think about it, kind of smaller tuck-ins versus anything that's done on larger scale, at least for the near term?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","The odds are that that's the case. Again, every now and then, the quality new asset and a new market that's big pops up. In general, we're not price competitive on those. But you never know, maybe one day, we'll get one.","Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just quickly for \u2013 probably for Javier. Last quarter, you guys said I think it was $10 million included in OI for Renal Ventures. Is that still how you guys are thinking about that for the remainder of the year?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","It's in the range but as we disclosed, it's not a very significant number for the year.","Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa. Lisa, your line is now open.","Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Hi. Thanks for giving me the follow-up question. I was just going back to my numbers, and one thing that you did disclose in your October 31 press release was that out of that 5,000, you had 2,000 Medicaid eligible. But then of the remaining 3,000, about 1,500 were on some sort of premium support. So I suppose my question is, given that the regulations are on premium support haven't actually changed, are you seeing losses from those patients because insurance companies are successfully denying acceptance of premium support? And is there any difference in their sort of ability to do that whether it's an on-exchange or off-exchange individual plan?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. It's really hard to parse through what's going on. And so why patients are doing what they're doing with plans, exiting and other things around it. So instead of giving you a specific answer, let me just give you the total. We're at 3,000, and we're at 2,500. And so we can't parse through with clarity as to why the number changed, but that's probably better just to give you where it ends \u2013 well, where it is as opposed to where it ends.","Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Okay. That's fair enough. And then I suppose just on the disclosure generally, because it's ultimately just up to the patient whether they're getting the premium support and buying the private insurance or not, so you don't really have much visibility on the ins and outs of it. Is that fair?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","It's fair. Yes.","Lisa Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Great. Thanks.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin. Justin, your line is now open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. So a few more here. I'll just follow up here to see if I could try this one more time, this individual stuff. Just going through the numbers, it does seem interesting. So the 2,000 Medicaid lives that you said were on individual plans are now \u2013 are back on Medicaid, right? And that costs $140 million. Is that the correct way to think about those?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Let's just be clear about one thing. It's important. They never left Medicaid.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","No, I apologize. You're right.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","So they lost supplemental coverage, which in most cases, was a beautiful thing for improved coverage and care. And they lost that in the midst of all the controversy, but they were never off of Medicaid.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. I'll move on from the subject. If we could just talk a little bit about DMG, you talked about there was \u2013 you had expected a $30 million improvement in rates for 2018, and now it looks like you're not going to get those. Given the rates looked pretty benign at least on the high-end, I know there is rate changes at the accounting level as well from rebasing. Can you just tell us what changed in your mind that took that $30 million to zero?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, Justin, I think the basic premise is that we expected over time that the rate setting process with CMS would more or less have the rates track with the market medical expense trend in the markets that we operate in. And we didn't know if we would have them one year, two years or what the longer timeframe would be, but we expected it to track more or less.","And the bottom line is that we now know the 2018 rates will not do that because they're going to be relatively flat. And it's about 0.5% difference versus what CMS expected overall, and that is the geographic differential. But ultimately, the $30 million is a headwind because we do expect the medical expense trend next year, and it won't be covered through rates.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. So when you think about that, does it put a risk on your ability to hit that $250 million target that you put out there for 2019 for DMG?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. No doubt, the $30 million is a headwind, and we're going to work with our payers and our providers to do our best to mitigate as much of that as possible. But on the other hand, I do think that we are more confident about our ability to increase the savings and efficiencies in administration between now and then.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","But Justin, Kent Thiry here. It was an assumption we had that turned out to be incorrect. And so it's definitely a reduction. And now the challenge becomes how many other places can we find anything incremental for a partial offset.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. And then you mentioned this Humana contract on Integrated Care, certainly sounds interesting. Can you give us any more color in terms of how this is set up? For instance, this is a full capitation, or is it risk sharing on these numbers?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Sure. It is a mix of both of those. So we have some set fees, and we have some things that relate against value based, in particular, in CKD. And so there's a whole bunch of things that are trying to reward good transitions into ESRD and savings around the transition around that.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And so you had talked about obviously the opportunity for Medicaid to actually make a profit in Medicare by offering these capabilities to managed care. And I think you had even talked about there's a number that's been thought of in terms of the potential upside versus just providing a Medicare treatment. Is it fair to think of the economics here as similar to that upside that you typically have in Medicare Advantage in terms of what you get paid for in treatment? Or is it better or worse than that?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Well, Justin, I'll go first on this one. It varies all over the map and not only by a private payer does it vary by contract, but also even within Medicare and Medicare Advantage, it differs geographically and it differs by what the baselines are that you start with. So it's a wide distribution curve.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. I can see that must be tough to nail down. Okay. I will leave it there. Thanks for all the questions, guys. Appreciate it.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Justin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary. Gary, your line is now open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Maybe just \u2013 on a similar topic. At the end of last year, the industry, it sounded like felt pretty good about moving some legislation or trying to get some legislation moved through Congress that would make it easier to move towards an accountable care model. Any comments on what you think the chances are for something to get attached in the current Congress?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","I'd make two points. First, a generic one, that in a world where Congress is passing very little of anything, it makes it very difficult to find a vehicle to attach to because there's lots of people with lots of attachments and very few vehicles, and so that's an environmental problem that exists for us and others.","Second, as to the particulars of our Patient Act that we have a real shot. You never know how this works, you would never say the odds are on your side, because in a world where little is being passed, you just can never say that. But it's a highly respected piece of legislation with broad bipartisan support. I'll remind everyone that we passed the House Ways & Means Committee late last fall with one dissenting vote in a year when that virtually never happened in any piece of substantive legislation in the House.","Having said that, it's a real battle each new year to try to rise above the noise. And so, I think, I just have to leave it as we have a real shot, and we're working hard and it would be a tremendous victory for both patients and the taxpayers and that's increasingly known and increasingly attractive, but that doesn't mean it's in the home stretch.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","You're welcome, Gary.","Operator","We show no further questions on queue at this time.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","All right. Thank you all for your continued interest in DaVita, and we will do our best for you between now and Capital Markets in a few weeks. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's conference.

P. Morgan","John Ransom - Raymond James","Operator","Good evening. My name is Darren, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to DaVita's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. ","Mr. Gustafson, you may begin.","Jim Gustafson","Thank you. Darren and welcome everyone to our first quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today in the room are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; and Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer.","Please note that during this call we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our first quarter earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.","Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent Thiry","Thank you and greetings to all of you. And thank you for your interest in DaVita. The first quarter results as many of you've already seen were slightly ahead of our expectations. Javier and Joel will elaborate on that but as we are first and foremost a care given company, I'll start as we always have with the clinical highlights. In this case, readmissions, hospital readmissions of course remain the top priority. The normal 30-day hospitalization readmit rate via 30 patients is about 35% that's more than double for the normal patient population in Medicare.","Our Q1 readmit rate was 31.8% so significantly lower also continuing to improve versus the prior quarter and prior year. And our readmit rate is steadily trended down since we launched a number of transitions of care initiatives really but pretty much starting in 2017, which focused on delivering the right care to patients when they are discharged. If you do the math just to get a sense of the impact on the overall system and the savings and quality improvements associated there with, that improvement of the last two years equates alone to about 45,000 fewer patient days in the hospital. Good for patients; good for taxpayers, good for their families and we're all they going to get better.","Moving on this is just shy my 20 year anniversary here at DaVita. I think it's my 102nd earnings call, when I combine that with my time at Vivra where some of you were with me\/us there as well. It's nice to finish in a call we're going to reaffirm our annual guidance. And I was told the other day by one of the capital markets players that we have in fact hit our annual guidance and every one of the 20 years, Javier and I together.","It is also a good thing about this call that I'm turning over the ranks to Javier whom some of you know and all of you will soon know. We work together as friends and partners for over 20 years. It's been my heir apparent for several years, but this was a board directed process really according to all contemporary best demonstrated practices. But it's nice that both the board and I feel like we're leaving you in very, very good hands.","A quick DMG update. There are really three positive things to say about DMG before I turn things over to JR figuratively, as well as substantively. But the three positive points on DMG, number one, we do have a clear path to obtaining FTC approval, which is the exact same perspective that was shared by United quite recently. Good fact number two is that since those statements, there have been a number of recent developments that have moved us along that path, and I was feeling even more positive. And then third, DMG itself has had a solid flash strong operating performance in the first quarter.","The rest of the year looks even stronger, making the close all the more attractive to United. Now over to JR.","Javier Rodriguez"," Thank you Kent, and good afternoon, everyone. I am humbled and I am excited about the opportunity to serve as CEO of DaVita where I have been for 22 years. I look forward to giving you all detailed view on my plans for the company at our Capital Markets Day which we are in the process of finalizing and scheduling for August or September. That said; let me reassure you that I do not expect any major changes in our strategic direction.","So let me reaffirm six elements of that. First, we're a caring company and our focus on clinical excellence will remain at the core of everything we do. Second, we will use our strong platform of over 2.900 clinics including 1,400 home programs and 900 hospitals of hospital relationships and a network of over 5,000 nephrologists to help provides continuity of care for the patient as they transition between the sites of care. Third, we will continue to pursue integrated care with the intensity that is deserved. Four, we will plan a robust set of patient data and innovative analytic tools that will help improve patient care, while lowering overall cost.","Fifth, we will continue to build our unique DaVita culture. And finally, we will continue to be disciplined with our capital.","Now let me transition to first quarter results. First, our adjusted operating income for the kidney care business is off to a good start for the year, generating $382 million for the first quarter. As you've seen our results, we're experiencing slower trends in unit growth than we expected a few months ago. There are many variables that contribute to the non acquired growth and they're difficult to individually quantify. That said; let me call out a couple of those factors.","One, the growth of transplant volumes continued in the first quarter, is talked about in the past about the opioid crisis driving much of this. Is that what will happen in the future? It is hard to say. It is tragic there is an increase in the deaths due to the opioid crisis yet it is a gift for our patients with kidney disease who benefit from the organ donors. Two, we have seen an increase in competitive activity. For example, in the back half of 2018 there was a pickup a number of competitive de novo.","Despite the slowdown in volume, we are reaffirming our guidance for both adjusted operating income and cash flow from the year. Regarding calcimimetic, you may recall that we mentioned that this would be one of the biggest string factors in our adjusted operating income for the year. We expect that things will remain quite dynamic as a number of generic entrance and pricing remains fluid, making it hard to predict the full-year financial impact.","Before I turn it over to Joe, let me make a few comments on policy. Over the last few months, HHS secretary, Azar has articulated four priorities to focus the department's work. One of which is transform the healthcare system from one that pays for procedures and sickness to one that pays for outcomes and health. Starting with some bold proposals in primary care and given the comments he's made about the dialysis industry, we are optimistic about the opportunities to transform the kidney care sector.","Overall, we support his vision to slow the incidence and progression of kidney speeds, broaden the availability and uptick of home dialysis and transplantation and support the continuity evolution and adoption of value-based care delivery models. We have advocated for these policies and have implemented innovative programs towards each of these objectives over the years. We are philosophically aligned and are eager to learn more about the specific.","Now on to Joe to provide some additional details on the quarter.","Joel Ackerman","Thank you Javier. First, I will walk you through some components of our US dialysis and lab segment. Non acquired growth for the quarter was 2.4%, absent a turnaround in future quarters in the underlying metrics Javier referenced; we expect to come in below our non acquired guidance range of 2.5% to 3.5%. Revenue per treatment for the quarter was in line with our guidance, and was up sequentially by $0.40. Before I move on to cost per treatment, I did want to address a question that came up last quarter about our Medicare Advantage mix.","For context, the MA mix for all dialysis patients with Medicare as disclosed in the most recent US RDF data was 21% in 2016. In 2016, our percent of MA in Medicare was in line with the rest of the dialysis industry. As you would expect that number has grown for us and we assumed for the industry as well given the secular shift to MA in the broader marketplace. In Q1 of 2019, our MA mix stood at 24% of Medicare patients. We expect this number to continue to grow roughly in proportion to the MA market growth before the 21st century Cures Act in 2021.","Patient costs were down a $1.52 per treatment quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower drug costs, partially offset by higher employee benefit costs and seasonally higher payroll taxes. Dialysis and lab segment G&A was down quarter-over-quarter $0.86 per treatment as a roughly $3.00 per treatment decrease in advocacy spend was largely offset by higher compensation and benefit expense.","Now some details on calcimimetic. In Q1, 2019, we generated revenue about $17 per treatment with costs of about $11 per treatment from calcimimetic creating a temporary quarter-over-quarter tailwind of just over $20 million. For the rest of 2019, we continue to expect calcimimetic to be one of the biggest swing factors in our OI forecast. Longer term, we continue to expect that calcimimetic will be margin neutral to slightly negative depending on how reimbursement is set.","As a reminder, the first quarter tends to be the seasonally weakest quarter of the year due to fewer treatment days, higher payroll taxes and the impact of the flu season. Moving to internationals, we generated a $2 million adjusted operating loss in the quarter, which included a currency loss of approximately $1 million, but excluded the $41 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in our German dialysis business. The small decline in adjusted operating income from last quarter was a result of approximately three fewer treatment days.","For the full year, we continue to expect to achieve profitable adjusted operating income internationally before any currency gains or losses from our APAC joint venture. For the quarter, our effective tax rate on adjusted income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations excluding the goodwill impairment charge was 30.1%. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate attributable to DaVita for the full year to be 28.5% to 29.5%. Our adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations were $0.91.","Now on to cash flow. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the first quarter was $73 million .This cash flow was adversely impacted by the timing of working capital. It was an increase in accounts receivable as DSOs for the US dialysis and lab business increased sequentially by four days to 64 days in Q1, 2019 due to some temporary factors that we expect to normalize over the next couple of quarters. We also saw a reduction of accrued compensation due to timing of 401-k contribution, bonus payments and a reduction in accounts payable.","CapEx for continuing operations for the quarter was a $179 million excluding the impact of $12 million of proceeds from sale leased backed transactions. In light of the changes in our growth rate, we continue to scrutinize our capital deployment. Keep in mind that the timeline from inception of a project to signing a lease and eventually providing a dialysis treatment is nearly two years. So much of this impact will be felt in 2020 and beyond. We are reaffirming our adjusted operating income guidance for the year of $1.54 billion to $1.64 billion. And our guidance on cash flow from continuing operations of $1.375 billion to $1.575 billion.","As always, our guidance is built to incorporate the impact of expected swing factors, although there are scenarios in which we could end up above or below this range.","Now, I'll turn it over to Kent for closing comments.","Kent Thiry","Before we go to Q&A, I just like to share a few of my perspectives on the industry, on the community looking back over the 20 years in the hope that that might be useful, particularly to a number the people who are much newer shareholders to the space. Please allow me eight points. Number one, we never want to forget that we're providing an essential therapy. It's not disputable; it's not debatable; it's not controversial. Who needs dialysis or why the value it provides that is a good thing for people. It's a good thing for shareholders.","Number two, the presence of an uncomfortable cost subsidy, perhaps one of the most extreme in American healthcare where the private sector has to subsidize the roughly 90% of our patients that our government pay. This is bad. It's a bad way to organize the healthcare system, but it's been this way now for thirty years and the good news about it is it's the same for every single player in the space. At number three, we've never been without intense productivity pressure. The derivative benefit of that is we are perhaps the most productive healthcare service segment in all of America, in all of the Medicare program.","Number four; there's been a continuous stream over the 20 years of existential threats towards the business model. By that I mean existential threats that people said would either dramatically impair or destroy the economic viability of the business model, things like everybody is going to be able to do a wearable kidney things like diabetes incidence is going to plummet with a new drug, or stop advancing. I could list example after example through the course of the last 20 years. Of course, none of those existential threats have ever materialized, which is not to say there haven't been activities in all those realms, but never have they done anything like what some people feared and always we've been able to adjust and ride those new waves successfully and sustain our leadership.","Number five of eight, DaVita in particular excellent, clinical performance and a fervent belief in transparency around clinical outcomes. In addition, our entire industry has improved care and the productivity care in ways that most of the rest of chronic health care America would envy. Number six, periodic policy opportunities and threats. We are and we work in very close concert with the federal government and to some extent the states, will always be the case. For sometimes they will do things that temporarily repairs there will also be opportunities where we can improve our value alignment with the government.","So just give one example of how significant the math can be. We recently had to endure five years of essentially flat Medicare reimbursement. Cumulatively that made it $386 million per year difference in incremental revenue versus not. The resiliency of the business model to endure that over the prior five years, the recent five years and now entering back into a period of rate normalcy is quite noteworthy. Number seven, the inexorable march towards integrated care. And this is relevant on a couple different levels. First, the degree, the depth and breadth and fervency of policy support from both these and ours for integrated care not only for our patients but for all chronic care patients is really at an all-time high and shows no signs of reversing.","So from a policy point of view that march is picking up speed. Let's also not forget, however, that we are in a unique pole position to take care of these very expensive and needy patients, who just happen to have dialysis is a common denominator because what they also have are diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, anxiety and depression et cetera, et cetera. And therefore our pole position, our unique position of relationship combined with all the capabilities that we've invested in, put us in a great spot for what is an emerging tidal wave we hope for America and for its patients.","And finally number eight, the ability of this business model to convert operating income into free cash flow and free cash flow into sustainable earnings per share accomplishments. In the context of all that those eight points, we have moved equity value from $150 million 20 years ago to over $9 million today and hopefully significantly more value for you soon, for our patients soon and for our taxpayers soon. And if I were to just step back for a second and stare at the current platform, sweet things are quite striking. The resiliency of us and our community is noteworthy. Second, our relative performance within that world consistently over the last 20 years.","And third and finally, our opportunity for increased differentiation moves up with every rise of integrated care. And so we're looking forward to being evermore differentiated in ways that are ever more driven by our historic capabilities, our historic investments in our current market position.","With that operator, if we could please turn it over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","KevinFischbeck","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to see I guess, Kent, I think you said that the quarter came in slightly ahead of your expectations but then when Javier was talking about the revenue number, you talked about volumes coming in later. Can you just go into what was it that came in better than your expectations to get the operating income number I guess little bit better. ","JoelAckerman","Sure. Hi, Kevin. It's Joel. I'll take that. Our internal number was a bit lower than the streets, largely driven I think by timing related to seasonality. So that's I think the genesis of that comment. I would say the single biggest thing that drove the number stronger was calcimimetic. And I mentioned in my script about a $20 million tailwind in calcimimetic in Q1 versus Q4. ","KevinFischbeck","And can you kind of remind us what you think the pace of that? You talked about ultimately that becoming a neutral or maybe even slightly negative thing. Is that slowly by yearend or is that a two-year? How to think about that process?","JoelAckerman","Yes. So I think you have to think about the margin in calcimimetic in two buckets. So start with what we had last year which we've called out as mid to high single digit which is kind of where we were as 2018, think of that as the baseline that will go away over time probably measured in years but not many years as the whole dynamic of generic entrance plays through, and that gives the temporary tailwind which is the $20 million that's the second piece.","But then ultimately plays through to ASP. So the $20 million that extra tailwind that we saw in Q1, we don't know how that will play out over the rest of the year. There's certainly a possibility that we will be able to continue to buy at generic rates in Q2 before ASP falls, and there'll be a continued tailwind in Q2. We don't know what will happen in the second half of the year. There is a scenario where that completely reverses where generic availability in the market disappears, while ASP is falling and what was a tailwind in Q1 will turn into a headwind in the back of it, half of the year. ","So I think to try and sum this up, I think the mid to high single digit number that we called out in 2018, we think that will persist through 2019. How long it lasts after that is a question mark. This added $20 million tailwind could persist for a little bit while longer although it could flatten out, and it could potentially turn into a headwind in the back half of the year, all depending on what happens with generics supply and ultimately what happens with ASP.","KevinFischbeck","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess, as I said I'm not sure if you said I didn't catch it, but commercial mix in the quarter, any comment on how that trended?","KentThiry","Yes. The mix was slightly higher quarter-over-quarter and now this add since you asked, as we step back and look over what we said at JPMorgan, I wish the range was a little wider because that number sort of pops up and down. But in general, we were slightly up and there's nothing in the mix that would change or impact our guidance.","KevinFischbeck","Can you talk about a little bit about some of the things that you mentioned as far as volume headwinds? Is there anything within the volume headwinds that would have a directional impact on mix? Are the things that are -- some of the things you mentioned as far as transplant facility, I think that might actually be more of a headwind to commercial mix than to Medicare mix for example. I don't know how you think about that but love to hear your comments on those pressures and how they apply to mix.","KentThiry","Sure. Let me take a stab and see if I'm answering your question. First, I just want to say, embarrass, we got it wrong at JPMorgan. And we gave and we missed the numbers so quickly after that. Two is that we have a track record about performing on non acquired growth. And we've had some episodic quarters where our competitors about performance. And three, is that there's a lot going into this number. There's an incident. There's mortality. There are transplants; there are competitors; there's peered dynamic and they're all moving in opposite direction.","Sometimes so it's very hard to pinpoint the number, but at the end what we're trying to do is work really hard to make sure that we get the right trade-off between growth rate and capital deployment. And that's really what it's all about,","KevinFischbeck","All right. Then maybe just my last question. Clearly, you're seeing a slowdown in volume because your competitors are ramping up de novo, is there any way to kind of quantify in your view, market share I guess losses maybe that are happening which you have said that real numbers should have been 2.5, 3.5, it was just a market share that pushed you down below that or how do you think about market share?","KentThiry","Yes. It's a good question. I mean if you look at market share and you look at what that 1% difference is over a year. This is only a quarter but over a year it'd be about 2,000 patients. So you got to look at in the base that we have roughly 200,000 and so does FMC. But we don't take it lightly of course compounding is very powerful, but again our track record that will outperform over time. But when you look at it sometimes you would rather have a lower growth. If it's got an impact on your deployment of capital. And so you can't isolate each one of these and micro but you got to look at the sort of overall portfolio. Because we could give you a higher nag number but it might be with lower returns on certain de novo and so we're being quite disciplined and scrutinizing that number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","JustinLake","Thanks. Good late afternoon I guess. First off, congrats, Kent on 20 years and retirement and Javier no surprise, but congrats on you taking the reign for exciting stuff. The first question I had, Javier, you kind of step in here, I feel like a big part of Kent's role as you take, as you've kind of been running the dialysis business for a while. And Kent's role has been in a very much kind of strategy and capital deployment and the move to international for instance, the DMG. So I'd love to hear your kind of thoughts on how you see the next kind of three to five years from a capital deployment perspective that might have been different than Kent's.","And specifically given this deal looks like it's moving towards closed, your thoughts on how to deploy that capital especially given where the stock is?","JavierRodriguez","Well, as Kent articulated, Justin, we worked together in partnership for 20 years. So I've gotten that question asked a fair amount and what I've said it's not like I've been shelving my idea is waiting for the time where I got to home and now I get to execute on them. We've been partners and we think a lot of like is it relate to the discipline on capital. And as I said in my opening remark, there's more that's going to look the same than anything that's going to look different. Things that would likely look different will be more around the evolution of time, technology and the needs of the business and a greater care policy and those things that we will be driving.","As it relates to capital, we have and we will continue to have a very strong discipline around capital. And we are going to be sharing our three year plan and capital market in August or September. I don't want to provide any more detail at this point.","JustinLake","Got it. And then you talked about calcimimetic and the $20 million of benefit versus the fourth quarter. Can you give me that the total benefits in the quarter here?","KentThiry","I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand the question, Justin. Are you saying the total calcimimetic profit in the quarter? So, it's roughly double $20 million. So it's a $20 million headwind combined with the number we had called out in the past which you recall it $80 million. So $38 million would be the total Q1 profit from calcimimetic.","JustinLake"," Got it. And is your view that that calcimimetic potentially will not be a benefit next year, so we should think about that as a headwind year-over-year to numbers?","KentThiry","I think it's hard to call out the timing. We think ultimately most if not all of this will go away; don't know whether it's a 2020 event or 2021.","JustinLake","Got it. Is there anything you could share with us in terms of how, so if you're at a $40 million run rate, it sounded like the answer to Kevin's question was that you thought that could continue in the quarter, in the second quarter and then could moderate in the back half of the year. But what do you have baked in the guidance for the full year in terms of the calcimimetic benefit even if it's a range? It'd be helpful to kind of understand.","KentThiry","Yes, we -- there are a lot of scenarios that play through the ranges is in the forecast. So I don't think I'd be comfortable articulating just a single number that flows through. But I think it is safe to say what we've said in the past, which is some of this variability in the near term around calcimimetic is the single biggest swing factor in the $100 million of OI I range that we gave in our guidance. ","JustinLake","Okay. And if I think I had obviously it's early for 2020 but is there anything that if this does start to moderate? Is there anything that you can think of that could kind of an offsetting benefit in 2020 some kind of tailwind like maybe the your EPO contract could potentially help offset that. Anything that you want to point us to before we think about-- as we think about 2020 headwinds and tailwinds?","KentThiry","Yes. So, I think there's a lot going on in pharma in general and that applies to unit price, it applies to unit volume. It applies across a number of the drugs we use. So I wouldn't point out a specific headwind or tailwind, but I don't think you can look at this as one isolated factor in the P&L and just handle it as its own issue. ","JustinLake","Got it. If I could sneak in one more. I know last year and I apologize for not having run these numbers myself but just kind of thinking it through. Last year, I remember your first quarter had a benefit from a Medicare receivable true-up of some sort and this year obviously as a calcimimetic benefit. If I remember correctly last year did not have much of a benefit from calcimimetic. I think it\u2019s sort of ramping slowly. Is that correct?","KentThiry","That is correct. I believe, yes.","JustinLake","Got it. So if I net the two right and if I kind of think about growth year-over-year in the first quarter excluding calcimimetic and the Medicare true-up. Can you do that math top of your head and give us an idea of what they year-over-year first quarter looked like?","KentThiry","So, if you went back to Q1 last year, you'd have to take out the Medicare bad debt. You also have to take out the DHS $70 million one-time pick up that we called out back then. If you looked at that number relative to where we came out this quarter, I believe it would be up a bit. But that would not be adjusting for calcimimetic.","JoelAckerman","I think that math would be somewhere at 371 to 382 and we had one less treatment day year-over-year.","JeffreyMeuler","So [Multiple Speakers] 382 and then I would back out $38 million for calcimimetic. Is that what you're saying?","KentThiry","I think that 38 would be high. I don't remember what we had in there. What we what exactly we called out but the 38 would be high. We can take it offline, Justin, and get you a better number. We've just got to look back at what we --what we disclosed.","JavierRodriguez","Yes. I just offer a cautionary note on two levels here. One when we start this around too many variables on a live call. There's a lot of room for potential confusion on exactly how people are defining different numbers and then second, it sort of stating the obvious but worthwhile that in any given year we've got lots of variables that move $15 million - $20 million recurring, non-recurring up down and so it gets pretty tricky to start paying too much attention to one or two of them because there's a lot of them all the time.","Operator","Thank you. Next in queue we have Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","SteveTanal","Good afternoon, guys. Congrats to Kent, Javier as well. I guess just the first question just in light of the updates on DMG and the commentary around the industry growth and more de novo from competitors. Could you kind of give us your latest thoughts on the potential deployment of DMG proceeds? Or what is your thought processes around that at this point?","KentThiry","Yes. So our thinking on that hasn't changed. The DMG proceeds will go to pay down debt after the deal closes. We're going to do a subsequent financing and we'll use those proceeds to bring us back to our historical leverage range 3x to 3.5x, and use that to buy back stock. So nothing really has changed around our thinking there,","SteveTanal","Perfect, thank you. And a couple more sort of granular ones. I guess I'm just on calcimimetic discussion just to round that out the $11 cost per treatment, would you be able to give us that figure sort of for your last quarters? If you think about the houses of development.","KentThiry","Yes. It was --it was, hold on, bear with me one second. It was about $13.","SteveTanal","Got it, okay. So it really does sort of seem like I guess the generic availability is maybe what changed here. Just thinking broader about patient care costs per treatment. It was considerably lower there. Are there any other drivers that you could talk about in that line that we should think about as potentially a more sustainable?","KentThiry","Are you talking about the calcimimetic question? I'm sorry.","SteveTanal","No. I am sorry. Just inside of patient care costs sort of --like a per treatment basis came in quite a bit better, just trying to understand some of the other moving pieces as well.","KentThiry","Yes. So the other piece is EPO.","SteveTanal","EPO is better.","KentThiry","Yes. ","SteveTanal","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then just one more maybe on the commercial side. Sounds like mixes up a little bit, maybe if you just comment on rate as well just as we think about RPTs in the quarter?","KentThiry","I think there's no headline on the rate side. Basically in line with where we expected it.","SteveTanal","Got it, okay. And sort of a continuation I suppose is like what was laid out at the JPM day. Just I think there's a decline in that network rates and sort of the outlier stuff but an increase on the rest of the book like that's all still pretty much what's playing out.","KentThiry","Yes. Nothing to call out.","SteveTanal","Great, okay, all right, thanks. Actually I guess just one last one. Just on the advocacy side is anything to note there just with AV290 or anything else on your minds. Are you still really comfortable with the $60 million step-down in the guide sort of sounds like it but just want to check in there?","KentThiry","Yes. The short answer is we continue to work with AV290 baby and we are comfortable with our advocacy spend and our progress in our relationships in Sacramento and another state capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from Whit Mayo from UBS. Your line is now open.","WhitMayo","Hey, thanks. Congrats Kent and Javier, both well-deserved. Maybe just wanted to follow up on the competitive dynamics one more time. Just might be helpful to define competition a little bit more. Is this just new competitor that you're seeing or is this de novo activity from existing competition within your markets? And do you have any view on last year's AKI regulatory changes with sniff reimbursement and whether or not you're seeing any activity on that side?","KentThiry","Yes. On the first part, it is not the new entrants. We are not seeing any significant activity there. So it is with the existing competitors. On the AKI, for those people that are not familiar, it stands for acute kidney injury and basically that's before a doctor concludes that your kidneys are end-stage meaning they could come back. And so there was a change in philosophy there because they wanted to get the patients out of the hospital and into the most efficient side of care, which is our centers and so there are more diagnoses now AKI because it's system adjusted to that. I think that volume has gone through the system and I don't think it's relevant for nag factors.","WhitMayo","Okay. And maybe one more on the calcimimetic. Is there any way to maybe frame up what percent in the quarter was generic versus branded since apart just in terms of dosing and did anything really surprise you positively or negatively since your last call on this one topic?","KentThiry","On the mix, the majority of the mix ended up being on the generic side. And as it relates to surprise, I would never call it a surprise. We just knew it was going to be a fluid and dynamic time. And so we're going through a bit of the waves, if you will. In this particular quarter, it was helpful and that we were able to purchase some at a discount and then of course Joel already explained that could be reversed at anytime depend how it plays out, ventures and how the pricing curve drops.","WhitMayo","Got it. In any way to maybe frame-up what the inventory looks like going forward just to get a sense of how much visibility you have into additional generic opportunities?","KentThiry","No. It is very --it's been very hard to tell because of dynamics in the legal system as to what inventory is available on who's going to enter. And then of course that will drive the price to have any entrance and how much inventory. So we are just as interested as you are in those numbers, but they're very hard to find.","WhitMayo","Yes, no, totally got it. Maybe just one last one and just curious Javier as you make the rounds and talk to your medical directors and nephrologist. Are you hearing anything new from clinical protocols therapies just anything aside from since, I am just trying to think from an upstream perspective if there's any change you're seeing within the nephrology practice setting? Thanks. ","JavierRodriguez","No. There's nothing to call out. The physicians are continuing to prescribe as they have in the past. Of course, they're always looking at the journals and the studies to see if there's anything in the science that indicates anything new, but there's nothing that I would call out right now.","Operator","Next in queue we have Gary Taylor from J. P. Morgan. ","GaryTaylor","Hi, guys. Just a few quick ones. I think Joel mentioned in terms of patient expenses that our EPO cost, I was just wondering if that was price or utilization. ","JavierRodriguez","Price.","GaryTaylor","Thank you. And I wanted to ask, I've been on the call for long time, not 20 years, but a long time, haven't heard you talk about competitor de novo activity a lot. I understand you're saying it's existing competitors. But wanted to see if you had any comment on some of the new startups that are focused on CKD market like cricket and cricket is modest that is basically saying not enough resources have been expended. At CKD, we spend all our resources once the person hits ESRD and I think Azar comments were hinted at that or alluded to that a little bit as well. But how do you see that developing as positive, negative, hospital risk, the ESRD volumes, et cetera?","KentThiry","Sure. Thanks for the question. As it relates to competition, the first thing I'll say is competition makes us sharper. And we respect all competitors and so it's with that approach that we go paranoid at it because we want to make sure that our patients get the best. And we believe that we are best prepared to deliver that in a platform with all the types of care. That said, of course, when you are small and you're getting capitalized, you need to generate a story and so the provocative story is one that says that they're going to disrupt and innovate.","And we believe that we've been self disrupting and innovating for quite some time when we do a lot of patient education more than anyone else. We send more patients to the proper modality than anyone else. We have amazing transplant education and so we know we have the entire suite, but of course they can't compete with that platform and so what they want to do is create a narrative that we are by definition of being big that we somehow or other not innovative which is of course not the entrepreneurial spirit of DaVita.","So again we want to be sharp and we want to take them on and we respect it.","JavierRodriguez","And Gary I would go ahead and add on a little bit here, giving us up a question that that number one, it's easy to say I found a thousand CKD patients, people with kidney disease, but the kidneys haven't failed yet. It is tough to say which ones of those are most likely to have kidney failure and when. And it is impossible to say what would have happened otherwise. So in order for anyone to pay you other anything other than a low unsatisfactory fee-for-service rate means you need to have sufficient data to be able to take a scaled population, know what they would have cost, so you can give someone a share the savings of what they did cost after you intervened.","There is no one better positioned than we are to turn those unknowns into knowns and none of the new entrants have that capability currently, which is not to say they're smart and they, and if they get enough money, it's a very, it's a doable thing. It's not an easy thing. It's not a cheap thing. I appreciate the comments. ","GaryTaylor","I appreciate the comments. One more quick one for Joel, if I could. You alluded to the fact that if not a core treatment growth stated this level, you be at risk of missing the treatment growth guidance for the year. Obviously, this quarter despite the weaker volume, you made it up on the OI side. So when you look at the year, you're contemplating the possibility could come at low end on of treatment, but you reiterated OI guidance. So is the messaging just from that. Are there are enough other puts and takes that even at the low end or slightly below and on volume you hit the OI range?","JoelAckerman","That's exactly right, Gary. We've got enough other things that week that were not worried about the OI range even if we come in below on that.","Operator","Our next question from John Ransom of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","JohnRansom","Hi. Just wondering when you think you might get some color from CMMI on the reimbursement changes relative to home reimbursement versus clinic reimbursement.","KentThiry","This is KT here. It's difficult to predict these things and they have a couple of times predicted when they'll have stuffs done and they haven't been able to get it done. Not because they're not smart and hardworking, don't have good ideas. We applaud so much of what they're working on and so much what they're creating, but they have to go through a multi-agency approval process over which they do not have total control. So it's very difficult to know and sometimes they can't even know. If someone gets to it in the next two weeks, it's done in two weeks.","If they don't get to in 10 weeks, it's not done for 10 weeks even though the elapsed time of the work might only be a week or two, things get pretty busy there. So unfortunately we can't give you a helpful response.","JohnRansom","So those of us who get paid to speculate with zero information which would you wildly object to the notion of let's say today we have 100 treatments and 88 in the clinic and 12 at the home. I guess they're going to pull some money out of the total pie, but it would it be as perhaps the straightforward is saying, well, maybe we'll pay 5% less at the clinic and we'll pay 20% more for home and those dollars kind of roughly balance out. Or do you think it'll be a lot more dramatic and complicated and hard to figure out?","KentThiry","Yes. I don't think speculating is a good idea because that's literally what the accurate verb would be. And so it'll just have to wait. I'm very, very sorry but we can't predict.","Operator","Next in queue we have Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","UnidentifiedAnalyst","Hey, good afternoon. It's Justin Bowers on for Pedo. And congratulations Kent for moving on and Javier for assuming the reign. Just in terms of some of the moving pieces with the receivables, what --can you provide us a little more detail on why the jump there and in terms of timing, how --should we expect that to go back to where you ended it 4Q towards the end of the year, in the middle of the year? A little better sense of [Technical Difficult] it would be helpful.","KentThiry","Sure. So Peter, there wasn't any individual thing. It was a bunch of things. Some of which are operational, some of which are seasonal, but all of which are temporary. We would expect in the next couple of quarters that this will all play through and we'll be back to the range where we were and kind of the back half of 2018 and to give you a flavor. I'll call out one thing we did a system change in one of our smaller businesses. A billing system change and that led to some operational complexity that led to some just temporary spike in the AR but we've worked that through. Now we're just catching up. That was the single biggest thing that was roughly 40% of the four days.","UnidentifiedAnalyst","Okay, that's helpful, Joel. And was any of that related to not the 40% but let's say the other 60% related to any of your contracts made on the commercial side? And then in light of kind of the improvement and mix quarter-over-quarter is there any way that we can narrow the range there from the guidance you gave earlier in the year in terms of commercial RPT?","KentThiry","Yes. Justin, first I apologize for getting your name wrong. I don't see any linkage there; I don't think you can connect the two.","UnidentifiedAnalyst","Okay. And then in terms of the commercial RPT for where we are, you guys still-- are you sticking to your guns there in terms of the guidance that you provided or?","KentThiry"," Yes. No change on that. ","UnidentifiedAnalyst","Okay. And then just shifting gears a bit looking towards like 2020 and an MA and the opportunity there, any kind of color you can provide on some of the discussions that you're having with the payers, maybe in terms of some of the different programs you'd set up and maybe some of the programs that you can run with them, thinking of the comment you made on the hospital readmissions and overall like what's the rate environment there from MA?","KentThiry","Yes. Justin, as you can imagine there's interest because people are trying to run their models as to what's going to happen to that population. The reality is, it's got a lot of variables and at the end, and it ends up in being a patient choice as to what product they have. And so as it relates to the actual negotiation, we're continuing to have very constructive conversations with the payers as to how we can take risk on the MA business. And we're actually innovating quite a lot in that book of business. So it's a constructive productive conversation.","Operator","Next in queue we have [Indiscernible]. Your line is open.","UnidentifiedAnalyst","Hi. Just a quick one for me. Looks like you had $400 million revolver draw sequentially. Just wondering what the use of proceeds was for that?","KentThiry","I think you should tie that to some of the comments we've made about DSOs and the move in AP, so it was just largely around working capital.","UnidentifiedAnalyst","Okay. So, then that's expected to come down then in the interim quarters?","KentThiry"," Yes. ","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. Speakers, we show no further questions in queue at this time. ","Kent Thiry","All right. Thank you all very much for your kind attention. We'll talk to you again soon. ","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. "],"7286":["DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc.

My name is Eric, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","And, Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference.","Jim Gustafson","Thank you, Eric, and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","Please note that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our third quarter earnings release out earlier today and our SEC filings including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q.","Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release filed with the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent Thiry","Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all of you out there for your continued interest in our enterprise. We are first and foremost a clinical care-giving company. And as is our custom, I'll start with talking about clinical spotlight before I move into a high-level summary; and then, Joel and Javier will take care of the follow-up.","Flu, as we've seen in all the major media is the leading cause of hospitalizations in general and even more so in the ESRD population. The current flu season is especially severe, vaccinations significantly reduce the risk even in a difficult year like this and we vaccinated over 94% percent of our patients, which is a very distinctive percentage, and many years in a row where we have outperformed the norm in this all-important category.","Now, onto a high-level summary of the quarter itself. It was a good quarter for DaVita Kidney Care. And we carry solid amount into 2018 and 2019. There's a lot of noise in this quarter's numbers due to a bunch of factors including the DMG sale and tax reform, and Joel will step through a bunch of that to help you navigate.","But the bottom line is it was a good quarter. We have good operating momentum. And we continue to generate strong cash flows and we will deploy a significant amount of those cash flows towards share repurchases as the quarters roll on. Onto Javier, for DaVita Kidney Care.","Javier Rodriguez","Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. Let me dive right in. I'll provide some details on the main drivers of the business and Joel will cover the financial results in more detail. First, our non-acquired growth for the quarter was 3.5%, approximately flat versus the third quarter of 2017 after normalizing for the impact of the hurricanes.","Next, net dialysis revenue per treatment came in consistent with recent quarters, as we think about 2018. I'd break it down between government and commercial revenues. As you know, 2018 Medicare rates updates is essentially flat and will be a headwind for margins for all dialysis providers.","As it relates to commercial revenues, there tends to be two questions: is there anything new on charitable premium assistance and how is the commercial environment? We believe that there's very little going on around the country on charitable premium assistance. And as it relates to the contracting environment, the conversations are back to their normal puts and takes.","Onto the cost side, like many other companies, we are experiencing a tight labor market with upward wage pressure. We continue to expect a 2% to 3% annual increase and don't see significant opportunity to offset this with productivity improvement in the near term. With labor cost inflation - sorry, with labor cost inflation continuing to outpace Medicare reimbursement, we will continue to feel margin pressure in the traditional Medicare fee-for-service business in 2018. With normal Medicare updates scheduled to resume in 2019, we expect these margin pressures to subside.","Finally, we continue to be excited at the prospect of transforming patient care in the dialysis industry through PATIENTS Act. We currently have an unusual amount of bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress with more than 150 Cosponsors. We believe we have a real shot in getting this bill passed this year, but as always a significant lift to get transformative legislation passed.","To wrap up 2017, we ended the year with adjusted operating income for kidney care of $1.616 billion, above our most recent 2017 adjusted guidance of $1.57 billion to $1.6 billion. Joel, will go into more detail on this in a moment.","On to 2018 guidance, because of the pending DaVita Medical Group transaction, our Kidney Care guidance effectively becomes our guidance for operating income from continuing operations. For 2018, we continue to expect operating income of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for Kidney Care business.","As a reminder, we have a one year over year accounting headwind of up to $100 million, as we finish the transition from profit share program to a 401(k) match program. With the old program, we accrued for the expenses in the calendar year before the pay-up. With the new program, we will accrue for the expenses as we pay it out.","This accounting change created a one-year gap in 2017, when we did not need to accrue for such payout. To close out my remarks, I would like to follow-up on three variables that we discussed last quarter that could swing 2018 forecast. First, open enrollment period was in line with our initial expectations, we'll continue to monitor as the numbers slope throughout the year, and we'll keep you posted.","Second, onto pharmaceuticals, as we have discussed before, calcimimetics, a drug, which taken by many ESRD patients to treat mineral bone disease just moved into our dialysis reimbursement with introduction of an injectable drug called Presibib [ph].","Reimbursement in the cost of calcimimetics are coming in line with expectations, but it's still too early to understand the full picture, until we get more data and volume and product mix. Physicians make individual prescription physicians based on each of the patients' needs to how they'll view the new drug option is very difficult to predict. Our view of the most probable range of outcomes continues to be included in our guidance and we plan to provide an update when we gain better visibility.","Third, onto the ballot initiative being pursued by the union in California, we won't have much to report into later this year, and we have not included potential advocacy costs, in our guidance range. If initial - if the initiative does pass, we believe that it would have material adverse impact on the entire industry in California, it would likely make a large number of centers in California, financially unsustainable, which would severely limit patient access to outpatient dialysis care. We have also become aware that the unions pursuing a similar initiative in Ohio. We have not included any potential advocacy costs in Ohio in our guidance range either.","Now onto our CFO Joel for financial results and details.","Joel Ackerman","Thank you, Javier. I will start with an overview of the financial results for the Kidney Care business as reflected in our continuing operations. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter plus $430 million, up approximately $26 million or 6% versus the third quarter, although, the fourth quarter benefited from a couple of items that are outside our run rate. First, we've recognized $14 million shared savings revenue that our DaVita Health Solutions business earned throughout 2017.","Second, we had $9 million onetime benefit in insurance expenses due to revaluation our reserves. As a reminder, adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $404 million, but this figure was negatively impacted by approximately $14 million due to the hurricane season. The fourth quarter was shorter by one-half treatment day relative to the third quarter, which accounts for most of this difference.","For our U.S. dialysis and lab business, our reported revenue per treatment net of provision for bad debt was up $0.49 per treatment quarter-over-quarter. Underlying this are two largely offsetting unusual items. First, we've recognized approximately $20 million in cash receipts that we have previously reserved that flow through the gross revenue line. This was offset by $23 million increase in our provision for bad debts to address our higher estimates of patient pay receivable write-offs for all of 2017.","To comply with the new revenue accounting standard, starting with the first quarter of 2018, you'll start to see a few changes and additions to our disclosures. I want to highlight two in particular. First, we will only be reporting revenue per treatment net of provision for bad debt. Second, we expect to recognize the benefit of approximately $30 million in the first four months of 2018 from a change and how we account for Medicare bad debt recoveries.","Prior to 2018, we've recognized these recoveries only after attempting to collect, which takes approximately four months. Under the new rules, we will estimate and recognize estimated Medicare bad debt recoveries at the time of treatment. I refer you to our Form 10-K to be filed later this month for additional details.","Our patient care costs were down approximately a $0.11 per treatment quarter-over-quarter. As a reminder, our patient care cost in the third quarter of 2017 was higher by approximately $1 per treatment due to the hurricane impact.","U.S. dialysis and lab segment G&A costs were down approximately $1.69 per treatment sequentially due to lower outside professional fee expense and normal quarterly fluctuations. For fiscal 2017, G&A was approximately 3% per treatment - was down approximately 3% per treatment year-on-year. As G&A always had some quarterly variability, the annual G&A per treatment is a better result to use for your go-forward modeling.","Lastly, please keep in mind that our first quarter tends to be the weakest quarter of the each year due to seasonality with two fewer treatment days in Q4 flu impacts and higher payroll taxes. A few words on the DMG sale, as a reminder we announced in December that we entered into an agreement to sell DaVita Medical Group to Optum.","We are working with Optum on required regulatory approvals and continue to target closing in 2018. It has been a very productive working relationship and we look forward post close to the additional long-term benefit that the business will get from our relationship with Optum and United. Because of the pending transaction, the DMG business has been reclassified as held for sale and the results of operations are reported as discontinued operations. In addition, prior period presentations have been revised to conform to current year presentation.","In the fourth quarter, DMG generated operating loss of $23 million. This includes operating results, which were negatively impacted by a bad flu season and both direct and indirect financial impact from the transaction, including the shift to held for sale accounting. In addition, we recognized the tax benefit of $164 million in order to recognize deferred tax assets require upon the classification of DMG as held for sale. The net impact of all these items is that we reported $144 million gain as one line on the income statement as discontinued operation.","On to international, our strategy is evolving under the direction of the new leadership, the result has an increased focus on core markets, where we are well positioned to achieve scale and drive clinical and financial value. Also, as we discussed last quarter, we restructured our international organization to streamline our reporting structure and reduce administrative cost, and anticipate this will save $6.5 million in annual G&A expense in 2018.","As a result of these strategic changes, including changes in expectations concerning the JVs available market opportunities. We are taking a non-cash write-down of our investment in the Asia Pacific JV up $280 million, which reverse is much of the $381 million non-cash gain we booked in 2016 and 2017 from the creation of this joint venture.","Adjusted operating losses from our international business was $46 million for fiscal year 2017, which included $2 million in impairment charges, $4 million in prior period adjustments and $8 million in foreign currency losses. This was in line with revised guidance that we had provide - previously provided for 2017. As we have discussed in recent quarter, we expect to achieve breakeven operating income in late 2018. This is incorporated in our enterprise guidance for continuing operations for 2018.","Next some information on taxes, to account for the impact of U.S. tax reform legislation passed in December, we've recognized one-time reduction of tax expense of $252 million in the quarter. This is the net gain to remeasured our deferred assets and liabilities to reflect our expected go forward tax rate. Excluding this and other one-time items, our adjusted effective tax rate on continuing operations was 40.4% in the quarter and 39.1% for 2017.","As we continue to review the impact of the recently announced tax reform, we now expect our effective tax rate from continuing operations in 2018 to be 26.5% to 27.5%. Despite moving up to bottom end of the range by 50 basis points, we continue to expect 2018 income tax expense reduction of $110 million to $130 million from tax reform.","Now cash flow, enterprise operating cash flow for 2017 was $1.907 billion, within our previously provided guidance. For 2018, we will provide cash flow guidance for continuing operations in light of our expectation that the DMG sale will close this year.","We expect operating cash flow from continuing operations to be $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. This guidance reflects the benefit of tax reform from both the lower effective tax rate and the accelerated depreciation of certain capital expenditures. This cash flow guidance excludes any cash flows from DaVita Medical Group, although investors should keep in mind that we will still own the cash flows from this business, up until the date the transaction closes.","In 2018, we expect to spend $925 million in CapEx on continuing operations, roughly evenly split across maintenance and development CapEx. This is an increase of approximately $100 million from 2017. But most of this increase is due to expenditures we do not expect to recur in 2019. So holding all else equal, we expect our CapEx in 2019 to be closer to our 2017 levels.","For the full year 2017, we repurchased 13 million shares of our common stock or nearly 7% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. During Q4 2017, we re-purchased 7.4 million shares. We have also repurchased approximately 900,000 shares this year through February 12, 2018.","Now, I'll turn it over Kent for some closing remarks.","Kent Thiry","If you'll excuse a little bit of redundancy, I'll make three points before we turn to Q&A. Number one, it's early in the process, but the DMG transaction is proceeding on track. Number two, it was a good quarter for DaVita Kidney Care, and they have good operating momentum. And this reflects the fact that we continue to have a very solid platform in DaVita Kidney Care, our U.S. Kidney Care business.","Third and finally, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows and we expect to be thoughtful in the deployment of this cash to benefit you, through a combination of share repurchases, substantial continued Kidney Care growth and a limited number of investments in other healthcare service areas.","On to Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck. Your line is open.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. I wanted to maybe follow up on the last comment about capital priorities, I guess, specifically the commentary about investments on the healthcare services. Any color you can provide there about the types of things that you might be looking at or how limited those investments might be? I think it's an area of some questions based upon how DMG didn't play out. We're trying to understand how far field you might be looking to go with these other investments.","Joel Ackerman","Sure. So, I'll take that. Kevin, it's Joel here. So a few thoughts, first, we're thinking about this from a sector perspective, not from a deal perspective. We want to find sectors where we think we can evolve them over the next few decades, the way we have helped shape the Kidney Care sector over the past few decades.","Second, we are hyper-focused on opportunities where we can add value, where we can take the core competencies we have developed over many decades and apply them to new sectors and new businesses.","Third, we know some things we don't want to do. We are not going to become a health insurance company. We're not going to get into drugs or devices. We're not going to get into the hospital business, so healthcare service is a bit more narrowly defined than you might otherwise think.","And finally, in terms of your question about scale, we're not looking at multi-billion-dollar deal, so we don't have a specific range. But I think it is safe to say, you're not going to see something at or near the scale of the DMG transaction.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. That's helpful. I guess, is there a way to think about it from the DMG proceeds. Is there - say, that the majority of it would be spent on share repurchase or is that not something that you can really definitely say at this point?","Joel Ackerman","Sure, so what we have said and continue to believe, first is we will pay down debt. We haven't changed our guidance around the range. And we expect to pay debt down to get back into the - our traditional range. Second, the majority of the remainder will be used for share repurchases.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, I think you talked about 3, 3.5 times leverage. But then I think you also talked about being comfortable at the higher end of that range. Is that - is it 3.5 that you're talking about or the midpoint of that range? How do we think about that?","Joel Ackerman","So it's a complicated number, because after the deal closes there may be a period of distortion. How the share buybacks play out in reality remains to be seen and there's certainly a possibility that we will keep cash on the balance sheet to facilitate that over time, because the leverage level that we've talked about are always net, net of cash that excess cash on the balance sheet could create some distortion. But normalizing for that, we - again, we expect to be in that 3 to 3.5 range. Where exactly in that range we wind up remains to be determined over time.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And then, last question for me, the sale of DMG. Is there anything that we should think about as far as stranded costs or things that couldn't be put as discontinued operations that either cost that can come out once that sale actually happens or that might be a drag prospectively after the sale happens?","Joel Ackerman","So I think it is safe to think of the continuing operation number that we are guiding you to as the forward runway - forward run rate, excuse me. We have worked hard and we will continue to work hard to ensure that there are no material stranded costs or dissynergies associated with the sale of DMG.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Kent Thiry","And, Kevin, I would add on the leverage ratio that we have made statements over the prior six months, nine months, whatever, saying within the context of our historical statements and guidance that we were leaning in a more positive way towards being higher and lower within that range. I think at this point, given everything that's going on in the markets the last month or two with respect to interest rates et cetera, I don't know if that particular refinement to the guidance is really still - is really still in place.","So I think what you're looking at is, basically we're going to bring the same attitude and flexibility to it that we brought for a long time.","Kevin Fischbeck","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake. Your line is open. Justin Lake, please check your\u2026","Justin Lake","Sorry about that. Yeah, sorry about that. So first question, I just wanted to try to get as much color as I can on CapEx. Now, that you've got or in the process of divesting DMG, you talked about CapEx of $925 million, I guess, $825 million is more the run rate you want us to think about longer term. I compare that to a depreciation number that's closer to $500 million. And I just want to understand the use of cash here.","Can you break that down, that $825 million, let's say, run rate too for us in any way in terms of maybe U.S. versus international, maybe some numbers around the - with the cost to develop new centers verses just other areas beyond maintenance and developing new centers that we should be thinking about?","Kent Thiry","Sure, so let me see if I can help out. We're not going to break out international. But as I said in the script, that number splits roughly evenly between maintenance and development. I think an important component to understand about the development is we have done more and more self-development of our clinics over time. And what that means is we build the clinic and then we sell it. We believe that drives a cost savings on the construction of the clinic.","What I would point you to in the cash flow statement is a line called proceeds from asset sales, which is a positive cash flow number associated with the sale of the self-developed clinics. And as you are thinking about the total picture of our cash flow, I think, it is fair to incorporate that positive complete piece of the cash flow in to the overall thinking.","Justin Lake","Okay, Joel. Is there - in terms of the development dollars, can you tell us what those development dollars? I'm just trying to understand - what like - how do you think of our capital from the perspective of returns on capital? Just given how much more significant the CapEx is here versus your run rate depreciation, and relative to your total cash flow you're generating?","Joel Ackerman","So in terms of how we think about capital deployment, look, we've got a very structured approach to how we think about capital and whether it drives a wide growth and appropriate return on capital. The development is the biggest component of that is building new clinics. And those historically have been a high return on capital investment for us. So I don't know that a whole lot has changed around that.","Justin Lake","Okay. Just last question on this. What is the cost for developing new clinic, right now?","Joel Ackerman","Roughly $2 million.","Justin Lake","Okay. So that's what runs through CapEx for new clinic development?","Joel Ackerman","Roughly.","Justin Lake","Okay, great. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Frank Morgan. Your line is open.","Frank Morgan","Good afternoon. My question surrounds the growth in the international. Obviously, you had the charge on the Asia Pacific JV, but does that in any way change your view over international growth and when do you really start to see the international business growth? Thanks.","Joel Ackerman","So no. It doesn't change the view of international growth. I would split the growth into two components, revenue growth and OI growth. The revenue growth as you can see from the reported results continues to be relatively high from an OI perspective, which is probably what you're more interesting of, and we standby what we've said last quarter, which is we expect to get to breakeven in the later part of 2018. So from a year-over-year perspective, you'll see significant growth.","Frank Morgan","Got you. Maybe one more, as Kent made referenced to commercial pricing. And I'm just curious as you go through the commercial pricing and contracting, are there any significant contracts that are left out there that need to be negotiated? And then are you seeing any change in the appetite of these commercial players to look at value based elements in their contracting? Thank you.","Javier Rodriguez","Thank you. There is nothing to highlight as unresolved on the payor contracting, we have normal renewals that come up, but I wouldn't point anything out. If anything, we are more contracted right now, meaning that there's less renewals than usual. And as it relates to value-based - it really depends on the payor and their appetite of how to structure the contracts that we are seeing the wide range of nothing all the way to P4P et cetera. So there's not been a material change in the structure of our contracts.","Frank Morgan","Okay. Thank you.","Javier Rodriguez","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Whit Mayo. Your line is open.","Whit Mayo","Hey, thanks. Maybe just starting on the Kidney Care business, the cost per treatment was down over $4 year-over-year, one of the lowest numbers we've seen in two years and besides from perhaps the Amgen purchasing contracts. Are there any other factors worth mentioning, I think you referenced some hurricane distortion from the third quarter? But is there anything else to call out?","Javier Rodriguez","There is two pieces. The Amgen thing that you mentioned on EPOGEN in the 401(k) $100 million that we discussed on the front end of the call, we did not incur approximately $100 million of what we used to call profit share in our 401(k).","Whit Mayo","Great. Okay, helpful. And then G&A same thing down 10% year-over-year on a per treatment basis, and I think, I heard you referenced lower professional fees. Any more color you can share and just how sustainable that number is as we look at 2018?","Javier Rodriguez","The number we have is a little different on a per treatment basis, but we're seeing is that when you annualize the number, it's roughly in the $27 per treatment, and we expect that to be in that range. I don't think there is anything to call out on professional fees.","Whit Mayo","Okay. Must just be having a bad number here and maybe two other quick ones real quick. On the topic of calcimimetics, I'm just kind of curious what the feedback has been from your nephrology partners at this point, and you have any sense of reference at this point, were they're leaning, what the pros and cons of the IV versus the oral drugs are?","Javier Rodriguez","We do not. We have very little data right now. And as you know, there is going to be a lot of variables in this one category, because we have both an oral going into IV. It's going to go from Part D as in dog to Part B as in boy. And then the oral is going to have an introduction of generics. So there is going to be a lot of moving pieces right now, and I think physicians are wanting to see publications, and seeing how this plays out in the marketplace. So right now, we are not seeing a lot of change yet.","Whit Mayo","And when this - because the drug is now reimbursed under Part B, can DaVita Rx play a role in dispensing this drug?","Javier Rodriguez","DaVita Rx is dispensing the drug now.","Whit Mayo","Okay. And - that's it. That's all I got. Thanks, guys.","Javier Rodriguez","And just to clarify, that's the oral drug\u2026","Whit Mayo","That's dispensing?","Javier Rodriguez","\u2026that's dispensing.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Ransom. Your line is open.","John Ransom","Hey, good afternoon. A couple of things for me, I may have missed it. But did you call of this pharmacy? How should we think about the pharmacy year-over-year comparisons, and your 2018 guidance versus your 2017? You mentioned that was a tough year for that business.","Joel Ackerman","Yeah, I think the way that we've talked about Rx right now will hold, which is the changes we had from 2016 to 2017 will be in our run rate. And then of course, because of all the things that we've explained in the past, I won't go through each and every other category. And so we - of course, we're monitoring all the things are happening in the pharma space, and as you know some drugs will go generic and so on and so forth.","So we will monitor what that does to our economic model. But we of course keep going back to the clinical piece of it, and how much we like it when our patients have 10 prescriptions and 20 pills medication management is a real gift to us. But of course, we have to make the economic model work.","John Ransom","So in other words very minimal EBITDA in 2018 not much 2017, so the macro environment, you're really not able to may contribute that, just given some of the issues in the macro environment? I don't mean to put words in your mouth, but that's what I think I heard you saying.","Joel Ackerman","No. What I'm saying is that the environment is quite dynamic. And we will continue to monitor it and adjust, but we continue to like the story that it's for the patient and managing this, and of course, we have to make the economics works for all our constituents.","John Ransom","Okay. The second question is, I mean, this is a tougher sounding question and I mean it, but just looking at the pharmacy, looking at international, looking at DMG, looking at international - yeah, I said international. It's hard to conclude that any of that has just been wonderful success. So when you stray outside your core.","So I guess, I'm just wondering why you think the aforetime will be the charm as you start looking at other areas of healthcare service? I know you rolled out a bunch of stuff, but it doesn't look like that has been a great experience so far. But, look, I know people who have been married five times. So there's always hope. I just was wondering what lessons learned, and why you want to go back to that particularly well.","Kent Thiry","Yeah. It's Kent here, John. That's a very fair question, and I mean, go ahead and throw some thoughts and then you feel free to further follow-up. First, the DMG was a very disappointing performance. Having said that, we took a lot of cash out along the way, and also had some nice benefits from the Kidney Care side during the period in which we owned it in terms of enhancing our integrated care capability. But it doesn't change the fact that it was disappointing in the end. The - it's important to remind people, by far, the primary driver the disappointing performance were reimbursement reductions, not operating performance.","And clearly very thoughtful other people felt it was still a very valuable asset with a live upside potential. And people who know the business as well or better than anyone. But the short-term, and the immediate operating performance was what it was, largely driven by the reimbursement cuts, and then, we decided was in your best interest rather than continue to pursue what we still think was very substantial long-term potential in which several other people thought had a lot of long-term potential, because it was reflected in the multiple they paid. But rather than do that, it was in a risk adjusted basis better for us to do take the return on capital now in addition to the return on capital we earned along the way.","And then, on Rx it has been a big clinical success, and has had around of several profitable years in addition to being a strategic asset, we will see what happens now, but by many measures up to this point, it's been a very good success and a very important part of our Kidney Care portfolio. And now there's an awful lot going on in the pharma space that wouldn't have been predictable three, four, five years ago.","And then just as a more conceptual question without going into international in detail then we do think, we've learned a lot from the experiences we've had, and it's important to look at the root cause of why they turned out, where they did. And just as there are times you can buy something, have it do quite well, and it's not a reflection of exactly what your deal premises were, what's your operating performance was, and you don't want to persuade yourself that you're brilliant at that point.","So we think it's in the best interest - the best long-term interest of our shareholders to deploy a fraction of our cash flow towards, so you're looking at new long-term growth opportunities. In the same way that, 18 years ago, we decided that dialysis despite the fact it had a lot of works and some people had lost a bunch of money was worth sticking with, and our business model was worth sticking within. And we are very happy that we made that call 16, 17, 18 years ago, where it would have been easy to cut our losses and leave it.","John Ransom","Thanks, Kent. My other question is, just going back to the question on CapEx. I guess, I was thinking wrongly as it turns out, but given that you're selling DMG and give that you're kind of narrowing your focus on international. We have thought maybe CapEx would perhaps step down a bit from where it had been. So should we think about you're taking what your spending international and DMG. And you're doubling down on those things. Just because it looks like CapEx - I mean, obviously, your sales going up this year. The significant [ph] stay flat. It just surprising to me this staying flat given that you're paring down in there in your focus?","Kent Thiry","Well, let me just make one comment. Just recall that DMG was a business with very positive cash flow characteristics, meaning they're net cash flow relative to CapEx, et cetera.","Joel Ackerman","Yeah. So I don't think we commented from that angle of saying, how are we going to redeploy cash that we might have deployed somewhere else. It's much more of a question of what are the options for this cash flow between paying down debt returning to the shareholders making new investments or investing in Kidney Care. So that's the angle we commented from. And with all those angles we use kind of a similar lens, which says, is this kind of drive OI growth and is this going to drive attractive risk adjusted returns on capital.","John Ransom","So I mean, in the CapEx, that DMG was non-zero, I don't think you ever disclosed it. I don't know why I had $100 million number in my mind. Is that - am I thinking about that wrong?","Kent Thiry","I don't know that we disclosed it. And offhand, I don't think anyone of us know. And we wouldn't say anything without wanting to confirm its accuracy, and that we had the right definition. So I'm afraid for both the reason that we'd have to make sure we nailed down the definition and not sure what we've disclosed historically, we can't answer right off the cuff here.","John Ransom","It's a lot easier to [see it from the help without the regard for facts to get off it and in my life quite frankly] [ph]. All right, I understand. All right, thanks so much. That's all for me.","Kent Thiry","All right, thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Clive. Your line is open.","Lisa Clive","Hey, thanks. Two question for me. Could you give us just an update on where ACA sign-ups actually came in? How many were on the exchange? How many off the exchange? Am I right that you had about 3,000 patients on and off exchange, once the Medicaid patients sort of went away? And something like 1,800 of those had premium support.","I'm just curious as to what the latest numbers compare versus those historicals. And also, are you expecting any clarity through new rules from CMS on the guidelines around premium support for the ACA plans?","Joel Ackerman","Yeah, thanks, Lisa. Your numbers that you recited are the numbers that we disclosed several months ago. And we're not going to keep updating those. Those numbers are pretty stable. So there is not a big story in those numbers, is probably the right way to think about it. And as it relates to a rule, as I said in the earlier comments, we're not seeing a lot. The one thing, the one dynamic that really appears, that momentum is that both providers and government would like clarity as to how we provide the education.","And so, we all want to do it the right way. And so, we will see how - what vehicle that comes in. But we don't have any additional information as to whether there is going to be rule making or not.","Lisa Clive","Okay. Thanks. And then a final question. Could you just give us an update on your thinking about ESCO? Clearly, the financial structure is not deal. It's retrospective and Medicare has a lot of leeway in terms of what the benchmarks are. But the initial results you've achieved have been pretty good. And I know the Patient Care Act is making its way through D.C. But I'd imagine that probably wouldn't establish a new payment framework for several years. So what do you do in the meantime around integrated care?","Joel Ackerman","Yeah, and we would like the PATIENTS Act. And if the bill passes, actually it has to start in 2019. So it would be pretty much a very quick ramp-up. If the PATIENTS Act doesn't pass, we of course, will stare at the options, whether we want to grow the ESCOs or not. Right now, the ESCO enrollment is not open. And so, we will have to see what CMS guides us on and where we stand if we don't get the PATIENTS Act.","Lisa Clive","Great. Thanks very much.","Kent Thiry","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Taylor. Your line is open.","Gary Taylor","Hi, thank you. Just a couple of quick tie-ups and then one question. If I could parse a bit, is that in the 2018 guidance, there is a good guy?","Joel Ackerman","Yes.","Gary Taylor","And if, I mean, care to quantify or not?","Joel Ackerman","No, and for all the reasons I said it earlier in the conversation, which is there is a lot of variables right now for us to be helpful. But it is included in our guidance with all the normal handicapping we do to the numbers.","Gary Taylor","Thanks. So want to make sure, you were ripping through some numbers pretty quickly. I want to make sure I get them correct. But in the fourth quarter, you were saying OI benefited from insurance reserve adjustment of $9 million and the $14 million of shared savings. That was all 4Q numbers, right?","Joel Ackerman","That's right.","Gary Taylor","And have you ever had shared savings number that you quantified before. And I guess, we're just trying to think about, should we think about next year and the fourth quarter, contemplating there might be something there?","Kent Thiry","I would not. First, we have never reported anything like that before and I would not model in this as being a kind of a Q4 recurring event.","Gary Taylor","Okay. And then on the bad debt, I'm trying to understand. You said there was about $20 million guy to gross revenue and $23 million bad guy on bad debt, both from some reconciliations. Were those - is there any color on like what was driving those? Were those in commercial revenue accruals or any help?","Kent Thiry","Yeah, so the bad debt was associated with, largely driven by an increase in uninsured patients. The cash receipts, the offsetting item is associated with a reserve we typically take associated with commercial revenue. And it has proven that our reserve was a bit conservative, so we had a bit of - a onetime reserve release there.","Gary Taylor","Got it. And then my last one, I mean, given that you are saying, you think commercial mix is pretty stable and you're back to a normal commercial rate environment, can you share what your expectations are for revenue per treatment growth in 2018, what's built into the guidance? We know Medicare is basically flat, so an overall basis what are you looking for?","Joel Ackerman","Yeah, we have not guided on revenue per treatment and we're not going to start right now. So I think the best thing to do is just keep to the OI range for now.","Gary Taylor","All right. Understood. Thank you.","Kent Thiry","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake. Your line is open.","Justin Lake","Thanks. I appreciate it. Let me jump back in. Bunch of things here. First, just deployment of the cash, are you going to get a significant amount of proceeds? [Of course, the field closure could] [ph] generate some cash in 2019 or I should say 2018. And if you think about deploying at the share repurchase is there any way to do that, just given the magnitude of it in an accelerated manner, whether it's an ASR or Dutch or something like that, any contemplation there?","Kent Thiry","So, Justin, those are certainly two options available to us as well as open market purchases. We are thinking through our strategy now. It will depend on a whole bunch of factors. And I don't expect that we will be giving a whole lot of color on how we anticipate doing this. It's just something we'll report on after it's done.","Justin Lake","Okay. Any of those factors specifically that you - we should be thinking about going into the decision?","Kent Thiry","There - look, there are a lot of factors including price, timing, other use of proceeds. But I don't think we have a formula or an algorithm we can guide you to.","Justin Lake","Okay. Then you mentioned that $30 million onetime benefit on Medicare recoveries from a timing perspective, right? Is that going to be a benefit of $30 million to OI in 2018?","Kent Thiry","Correct.","Justin Lake","Okay. And that's a good guy versus what you previously expected. Moving there, obviously you gave a range. So is that the reasonable way to think about it? And is there any other bad guys that we think should be offsetting that or should this move us out to the higher end of the range, all else being equal?","Kent Thiry","So this isn't a good guy relative to what we have been talking about before. Given the magnitude a dollar of RPT, it's not something we would necessarily, typically, call out there a bunch of things like this that flow through from a year-to-year basis on any given year. The reason we wanted to call it out this quarter was because it will drive a roughly $3 RPT increase in Q1, because that $30 million will be concentrated largely in the first three or four quarters of the year. So we just wanted to make sure you and everyone else knew it was coming.","Justin Lake","Okay. And then, on the provision for doubtful accounts, can you tell us which drove the increase in the number of uninsured patients you're seeing in the quarter? And do you expect this to be the new run rate going into 2018?","Kent Thiry","Sure. So that flows through the bad debt line. The other adjustment that I referred to flows through the gross revenue line. And because they offset and because of the new revenue accounting standards going forward, we're no longer going to report that gross number nor the bad debt number. So you'll only see the net number. So it is - I think it is safe to use the net RPT that we delivered in Q4 as a starting point for modeling 2018.","Justin Lake","Got it. But you're saying - the two aren't correlated, right? One, they weren't delineated to do with each other, right? One is collection of commercial and the other is an increase in uninsured patients. So there are others what's driving the increase in uninsured patients or am I mistaken it?","Kent Thiry","They are not connected. And so far, they're not necessarily driven by similar underlying business dynamics, if that's your question.","Justin Lake","Oh, no, I'm just curious what's driving the increase in uninsured patients in the first place. Is that something that just you feel like it's happened that's white noise or do you feel like that's - it sounds like you feel like this is the new run rate, so you're going to collect commercial at a higher rate and you're going to have more uninsured patients going forward as well. Is that right?","Kent Thiry","Right, that is our view going forward. I think if you want to think about this bad debt number. It's a few things. It's underinsured, it's uninsured, it's higher patient pay deductible. So I think some of these are broad trends you're seeing within the health insurance industry. That's probably as helpful as I can get.","Justin Lake","Okay. And I just got a few other numbers questions here to run through. The advocacy cost, you said there was nothing in for California and Ohio. Is there a number that you can think of that we should be prepared for if you do need to start advocating against the stuff in the back half of the year?","Joel Ackerman","No, it's a little early. And of course, there's a lot of play out before now and then. And as you know, these things can heat up or die down. And so, the number could be quite drastically different depending on the scenario.","Justin Lake","Okay. And then, lastly on the PATIENTS Act, have you've gotten a CBO score yet on this?","Joel Ackerman","No, we have not.","Justin Lake","Any idea what's holding that up? I know the government - and there's a lot going on and they're passing stuff day by day erodes [ph]. Is there a reason why given how long has it been out there that we haven't got a CBO score?","Joel Ackerman","It really is a couple of reasons that are quite straightforward. First, the CBO prioritizes stuff and with all the major legislative disputes and issues with tax reform, and all the stuff around healthcare, and the summer and the rest, and these people coming up with proposal after proposal after proposal. Everyone one of those sucks all the oxygen out of the room.","And when there is not regular order, most of this stuff is typically done in very sort of a hectic, frenetic ways. And then, there's a huge amount of organizational fatigue and a huge queue of proposals. So that's one. The second is that the PATIENTS Act involves some pretty significant numbers and pretty significant complexity. It's really transforming an entire segment that has that potential. And so, it just deserves extra levels of rigor and sort of analyzing all the interdependencies about from both the policy and predicted behavioral point of view.","It's not as simple as a lot of other legislation about changing something with a drug or changing something on readmission, reimbursement or whatever else. And so, it requires a lot of iteration. And, I guess, that's the third thing I will say. It's not as if they haven't been working on it or they haven't been communicating. There's been a huge amount of interaction between our congressional champions and the CBO, and between us and our congressional champions.","And so, it's getting a huge amount of high quality of attention. It isn't sitting in the closet.","Justin Lake","That's great to hear. Just to hear, lastly, and is there any way that this has a cost component to it? Do you think it scores as a cost for the government over whatever period they're look at that, like 10 years?","Joel Ackerman","Justin, you've been around a long time also. Predicting what the CBO is going to do is not something that we're foolish enough to do. I mean, yeah, the answer to your question I guess is yes. It's not one can see a scenario where they presume cherry picking and some other stuff and say it would be a cost.","We think very much it's going to be a tremendous favor for the system over the relevant timeframe. But we're not the ones doing the ultimate model and they got to protect themselves and tend to lean a little bit conservative. So, yes, they could come out with a cost. No, we don't think they should. But it wouldn't necessarily be low quality shoddy work if they did, because they've got a tough job of predicting all this stuff, so is that helpful?","Justin Lake","It is. I appreciate it, Kent, thanks.","Kent Thiry","Alrighty.","Operator","We show no further questions in queue at this time. [Operator Instructions]","Kent Thiry","All right, operator, that's good. Thank you all very much. And we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Kim, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DaVita HealthCare Partners Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference.","Jim Gustafson","Thank you, Kim, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Garry Menzel, our CFO; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry","Okay. Thank you, Jim, and greetings to all. Thank you for your interest in our enterprise. In the fourth quarter, we had solid results, all sides of the house. Kidney Care OI, $419 million, but that includes the net $29 million benefit from recognizing the deferred Medi-Cal revenues, so $390 million without that. And HCP OI, $33 million, both results within our previously provided guidance ranges.","We'll cover clinical outcomes first, as we do every call. We are, first and foremost, a caregiving company. CMS issued final QIP results on the Kidney Care side of the house recently. Once again, we led industry. Only 1.5% of our clinics had a 2015 penalty versus the overall industry's 5.6%. In other words, 73% more. This means we've outperformed the rest of the industry each year since that program began 4 years ago and in fact, remained first in 3 of 4 QIP categories this time.","We also are leading the industry in 2015 Star rating results with over 50% of DaVita facilities receiving a Star rating of 4 or 5 versus 21% of the rest of the industry. So we're very proud of these results.","And while no particular clinical metric by itself or system by itself is perfect, in aggregate, this is indisputably a strong performance for our patients and for the system. And we hope CMS continues to report clinical metrics, and we'll work on them to do so -- and work with them to do so.","On the HealthCare Partners side, similarly strong news. Over 800,000 patients now for whom we take comprehensive care. If we just grab Nevada, 1 of our 3 largest markets, and look at cancer screening and diabetes. We have 4 or 5 Star across all of our Medicare Advantage patients, including some other factoid, 70% of our patients receiving colorectal cancer screenings compared to a national average of 65%, and 63% of our diabetic patients with cholesterol scores below 100. Both of those are 5 Star scores and that's compared also to a 55% national average. So for the clinical outcomes throughout the enterprise, very strong. We take it very seriously. And in all these cases, healthier patients leads to savings to America's taxpayers, hopefully a value-add that we can increasingly monetize for you.","Let's talk a little bit about HCP operating performance now and expected, and Garry will talk a little bit more about Kidney Care.","HCP, $33 million NOI, right in the middle of the guidance for the quarter. But let's hit the bad news right up front, and that is that CMS may make multiple changes to Medicare Advantage reimbursement. And in aggregate, this could mean that HealthCare Partners 2016 NOI could be below and even well below 2015, so unambiguous, potential bad news on that side.","We incorrectly handicapped the Medicare Advantage reimbursement cuts last year, and I apologize that -- for that. I got it wrong. This actually is becoming a strategic issue for Medicare Advantage in our minds that it is crucial for CMS to protect the incentive to innovate to create health where now there is sickness and reduce risk where it is high for these patients, and we hope they realize that in their near-term decision-making.","Now let's switch to the good news front and here, I'll make 4 significant points. One has already been referred to, the strong clinical outcomes. Two, in our legacy markets, MA enrollment was up 7% year-over-year, meaning January '15 over January '14, excluding acquisitions. And if you include in-market acquisitions, it goes up to 10%. So that's fact #2.","Fact #3 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, MA enrollment a year ago was 2,500. It's now about 11,000. And fee-for-service visits per provider are up 20% from last year's low point.","And then fact #4 on the positive side of the ledger. We told you 18 months ago that we were going to be exploring 4 different segments: growth through IPAs, growth through payer partners, growth through health system partners and growth through acquiring prominent medical groups. We did the Phoenix IPA back right around that time and since that time, we've done a significant payer partnership, a significant health system partnership and a significant acquisition of a prominent medical group.","On the payer's side, Tandigm was a 50\/50 JV with Independence Blue Cross in Philadelphia, the largest health plan in that region, now over 275 PCPs signed up, another 75 joining within about a month. We currently are taking care of 16,000 Medicare Advantage patients; 53,000 commercial patients, about $400 million in annualized revenue being managed in that partnership.","The next segment, health systems. We've got a 50\/50 JV with Centura, partnering in Colorado. And there it's a very substantial number of doctors. They alone have about 340 employed physicians, a mix of PCPs and specialists as well as a broader network. That's Centura, the largest health system in the State of Colorado.","And then the last segment, leading medical groups. As many of you recall, we did acquire a leading group in Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs Health Partners with 51 PCPs. So the message here is that 18 months ago, 20 months ago, we said that we're going to explore growth models in each of those 4 segments. Now 18 to 20 months later, we are doing just that with a strong entry in each one of those segments in order to explore the most capital-efficient, risk-adjusted, optimal ways of growing as the years go by.","We continue to be very modest in our business development investment, although it is growing incrementally. Having said that, however, the activities are quite robust. In particular we're in discussions with several major health systems and in particular, in Southern California in some very interesting discussions with a few different health systems, and we look forward to deciding which ones to actually drive to closure and may do some very interesting things.","And that's separate from health systems. We're also talking to several high-quality medical groups in a serious way. No one ever knows what's going to happen with the business pipeline, but the quality and quantity of the conversations we're having is better than ever before. Our business development capabilities, as I said, is still quite modest. And hopefully over the next year or so, that will change. Although right now we couldn't deal with any more effective business development, since we're pretty much at capacity.","With respect to overall guidance, it is $1.75 billion to $1.9 billion, which is relatively flat. It's made up of Kidney Care operating income. $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion; and HCP Operating income, $225 million to $275 million.","I would like to reiterate the comments I made last earnings call, and that is we face 2 serious headwinds right now for the enterprise. Medicare reimbursement on both sides of the house under a lot of pressure in different forms. And on the Kidney Care side, a tough commercial pay environment as you look out over the next few years. Not so much because of any change in negotiating dynamics or leverage, but because of architectural changes in the way the healthcare system is working.","When you put all that together, as we said, the last earnings call, there is real risk that 2016 OI could be down from 2015 at the enterprise level.","Now even in a scenario where OI is flat, if we just take that premise for a moment, if you look out over the next 2 years between our current cash balance and our free cash flow and then you take out maintenance CapEx, still assume very robust dialysis de novos, and we make our mandatory debt payments. So after doing those 3 things, business as usual, we will still have $2.4 billion in cash to deploy in whatever way we thought was best for you and for the long-term strategic value of the enterprise. So acquisitions, buybacks, et cetera.","We very much look forward to discussing our longer-term strategic positioning and our outlook at our Capital Markets Day in New York City on May 5, in conjunction with our Q1 earnings call. More details will come out soon, and we hope to see many of you there and satisfactorily answer all your questions.","Garry, our CFO, please take over.","Garry E. Menzel","Thanks, KT. Starting with Kidney Care. Non-acquired dialysis treatment growth in the quarter was 4.6% when normalized for days of the week. Kidney Care operating profitability was up $11 million sequentially, primarily as a result of 2 factors: first, the $29 million net favorable impact resulting from the revenue recognition of certain Medi-Cal payments received in prior periods; and second, an unfavorable impact from a $3-per-treatment increase in dialysis and lab segment G&A, which was caused by normal seasonal increases in G&A spending at the end of the year and intentional nonrecurring project investment in IT during the quarter.","It is worth noting that despite the higher G&A spend in the quarter, G&A per treatment was down nearly 9% in 2014 compared to the year before. International losses were $16 million for the quarter and $42 million for the year, in line with prior guidance. We continue to expect international losses in 2015 to be similar to those in 2014.","For the overall enterprise, our debt expense was $98 million in the fourth quarter. Our income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $42 million was approximately $5 million higher than our normalized run rate due to recognition of the Medi-Cal deferred revenue I discussed earlier.","Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners of 33.3% in the quarter was lower due to: one, a reduction in our tax reserves; and two, the incorporation of federal and state tax credits that were retroactively enacted by Congress in December 2014. We expect the full year tax rate for 2015 to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%.","I would also like to provide a few reminders as you model the normal seasonality for the first quarter of 2015 in our business.","In Kidney Care, first, Q1 2015 contains 3 fewer treatment days than this past quarter. So you should expect lower revenue and higher fixed costs per treatment. Second, our payroll tax cuts reset at the beginning of the year, which leads to higher costs of $1 to $1.50 per treatment. And third, Q1 will not benefit from the Medi-Cal revenue that was recognized in the fourth quarter.","At HCP, operating income fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonal needs of patients, and Q1 operating income tends to be a bit lighter than the full year average. Also, the severity of a flu season can have a material impact on medical costs. We are seeing higher utilization right now with the flu vaccine being only 23% effective according to the CDC. However, it is still too early to know how the flu season will play out, but we estimate that it impacted our operating income by $2 million to $4 million in Q4 2014 versus the comparable period in 2013.","Turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was $199 million in the fourth quarter and $1.728 billion for 2014, excluding the after-tax impact of payments made in connection with the previously announced settlement with the government. This was within our guidance range.","We expect 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, lower than 2014 but in line with our historical trends. As always, this guidance range captures a majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range.","Finally, some comments on capital deployment. We continue to have a very strong cash balance. We are in the fortunate position of having various opportunities where we could deploy our capital in each of our business lines. We are constantly reviewing our capital allocation to make sure that we sustain the long-term health of the organization and achieve appropriate after-tax cash returns on capital. We did not do any share repurchases in the fourth quarter nor have we done any to this point in 2015. We felt that it was prudent to wait until after next week's announcement about Medicare Advantage rates before making any large capital deployment decisions. As we have said before, we favor a situational approach to capital deployment, and we'll continue to review our options.","And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess we'll start with Medicare Advantage. Kent, you discussed the fact that OI could be down at HCP next year despite what seems like a robust Medicare Advantage membership growth environment. I'm just trying to understand, what kind of rate would it take for OI to be down next year as kind of we think about next week's rate release for HCP? And then can you give us an update on where you are with the contracting initiatives to get plans to give you some offset here on the benefit side?","Kent J. Thiry","Justin, on the rate front, I'm afraid there's not a simple answer because there's so many variables that they're playing with now. They're playing with coding intensity, they're playing with the benchmark rate, they're playing with the RAF coding, which we're particularly sensitive to because we have above-average RAF. They're playing with the Star system. And so there's 4, 5, 6 different levers that they are thinking about pulling. And of course, the economics are a result of that net number at the end. And so there's no magic sort of single line to draw and correlate it to 2016 outcomes. On the contracting front, we should have a better answer for you than we do. I know that we have picked up some significant incremental protection through the course of the year, but I can't translate it into sort of a percentage of the book of business or something like that. So why don't we just pledge Garry to have that for the next time around. I think it's been solid progress qualitatively, much better than where we were a year ago but not close to done yet. For example -- and Justin, just for example, the kind of thing, so one that we signed recently, for example, any benefit design changes we and the plan basically spit them 50\/50 up or down. The cost or the benefit of doing them is shared, and so we're aligned in terms of our microeconomic incentives.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And just maybe a -- a way to follow-up on the rate side before I ask my other question is the -- I know there are a lot of moving parts, as you said, but they're all going to net out to something. So I'm not asking for a -- to be clear, I'm not asking for a -- all 6 components, Kent. I'm just thinking about a range. Are you saying like -- can you say if the ultimate outcome is you have it all together and it's minus 5%, that's what's going to drive OI -- that kind of rate would drive OI negative? Or is it minus high-single digits like you had in 2014? The 7% to 9% I think you said. Just trying to put a ballpark around when we see this rate, how should we think about it for the data?","Kent J. Thiry","Okay. Very fair question to which we do not have a very fair answer. So why don't we take that under advisement. We've got Capital Markets in a couple of months. And by that time, we'll know what they've done across all those things and maybe going forward, we should always calculate that number. But I'm afraid right now spontaneously, cannot do that justice. I mean obviously our forecast is a product of a bottoms-up set of a mix of assumptions on every single one of those variables, but we don't have the magic sort of index number that you're talking about.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. My other was question was on the commercial mix. I'm just trying to get an idea, can you give us an update on where your commercial mix has trended through the year and kind of come out of 2014?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. It's with some little ups and downs. It's basically been flat for 3 years or so now, which is much better than what happened to it a couple of years before then. And we have hopes that if the economy continues to recover, that it will go up. But there's so much noise in the system now compared to before, with exchanges and narrow networks and everything else, that it's not as sort of linear a relationship as it used to be. But the answer to the narrow question you asked is it's been more or less flat for 12 quarters in a row.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so these impacts, as we've gone in -- we're 1.5 months into the quarter now, I assume you're seeing some further changes from narrow networks and such. Is there anything that you've seen over the last 3 months, let's say, including mid-February, that would give you any increase in line of sight versus where you were when you gave the guidance in terms of mix deterioration that seem to be embedded in your guidance?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, I hear you. Good question. The short answer is no. There's been no material development. We continue to get our normal commercial rates on the exchanges, but we worry about competitors being willing to discount for exchanges, at which point, we would suffer from a reduction in our incremental growth rate. And I could go kind of down a checklist. But the answer to your question is that if you think about the 5 or 6 or 7 variables that affect mix and rate, there have been no material developments that represent any kind of discontinuity from before. Is that responsive?","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's absolutely responsive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just really a follow up on that question there. I think the company is well known for outlining all the risks that are out there that appear reasonable but often times, you guys highlight things that don't actually come to happen, which is great to be aware of them. But at the same time -- just trying to really get to the point here of is there something specifically that you're seeing? Have you seen -- because it really takes 2 to tango in this case of someone has to accept the lower rate, some player has to be of the view that the business model that has historically served everyone is now upside down and now it makes sense to change it. And have you actually seen that happen in at least small instances that make you think that there's a bigger risk here? Or is this just, hey, it's a risk because we're seeing hospitals do it, but we haven't really seen any indication that's happening at all yet?","Kent J. Thiry","Fair. I think the answer's a little bit in between. Have we seen any clear irrefutable evidence? No. Are there rumors of 1 or 2 of some consequence? Yes. So it's a bit of a tweener. But no, we cannot point to anything that we know of that would represent -- well, that's the answer to the question.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess that's fair because we do not know how the competitors are necessarily priced. But do you feel like you're getting a lot more pressure from the managed care side? Is that there [ph] -- you have changed dramatically and you're doing all you can to hold the line or has that not really even changed much?","Kent J. Thiry","That's always been a pretty unvarnished fistfight and that continues. If anything, to some extent, in some cases, the conversations are less adversarial because we're bringing so much of their value to the table now with reducing hospitalization, reducing mortality and everything else that we're doing on the quality side. So you'd almost push it the other way. But then when you stare at the emergence of narrow networks, the emergence of ACOs, the emergence of exchanges, you look at all that stuff going on, you get -- you have to respect the fact that the architecture of the building is different. And to presume the same sort of outcome is just not prudent. But we are absolutely sticking to our commercial rates for exchange business.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And the data you gave about Albuquerque, I think you said 2,500 members going to 11,000. What was ABQ at when you bought them?","Kent J. Thiry","0. I mean they may have had some -- they certainly had some had Medicare fee-for-service [indiscernible].","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, I guess I'm just trying to think, I guess, where are we as far as them rebuilding the book of business or the revenue base? I guess you're right, it was more like fee-for-service even within the capitation. But where are you in rebuilding the revenue base that they had when you first bought them? Are we back to where they were? Or not there yet? How do you think about that?","Kent J. Thiry","Why don't we check and get back to you within 10, 15 minutes on this call, Kevin.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just to clarify something you said about the growth in the legacy markets being up 7% year-over-year. Do you characterize legacy being Southern California, Nevada and Florida? Or do you -- now that you've had New Mexico and Arizona, are they legacy now?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. Good point. Legacy is those 3 and then you sort of have Phase I of new, which were those 2 that were done right on the time of the deal that had fairly tempestuous beginnings in Phoenix and Albuquerque, and then Phase II new, which is the 3 that I referred to. So that's -- just from a terminology point of view, that's what we're talking about, and so the growth rate was in those 3. And let me go back for a second and just be clear on something, that ABQ had some MA patients but was just treating them on a fee-for-service basis. We're now treating the 11,000 on a partial-risk basis. And then at some point in the future, we'll move to full risk as soon as our payer partner is ready.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And this is my last question. Obviously, you've gone through ABQ in kind of the fix there. Can you talk a little bit about Arizona? What went wrong and where we are in the progress of fixing that?","Kent J. Thiry","All right. Say your question again, Kevin.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess -- historically talked about obviously New Mexico not going well. We've kind of covered a lot of what you've done there to fix that. I guess it sounds like Arizona has not gone as planned either. Can you just talk a little bit about what happened there and where we are in the progress of returning that to normalized profitability?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. Well, let me first just comment. In aggregate, we delivered what we said we would, I don't know, 6, 7 months ago, in that year-over-year there will be an improvement exceeding $25 million. So that's the aggregate net economic result as we committed to you. It would be -- and then specifically in Arizona, we worked out an arrangement whereby a couple unprofitable plan populations got pruned in a very significant way, reduced by about 65%, 70% of lives, which eliminated a huge amount of losses for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I guess Kent, starting off with the subpoenas that were announced after the close. Can you give us some more information? It kind of really sounds like this might be about something else. Do you have any color for us?","Kent J. Thiry","I can't really say anything other than our release said. It's literally all we know. So that's -- if I could read it to you, which, of course, would be terribly redundant, but we don't know anything else.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. See, last fall, I think it was November, Medicare held an ambulance open-door forum and dialysis patient transportation billing and coding was actually brought up on the call. I think there was confusion about the coding. So I'm wondering if they're trying to get information from you guys about that.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. There certainly was a lot of noise around transportation in general, and then including in the dialysis space. We've had very clear policies for our people on that front for a long time and do a very thorough job of reinforcing them all the time, and so we feel very good about that. And as you know, we don't do the transportation. We don't bill for the transportation, not our transportation. So what you're saying is all true. Nonetheless, we only know what we know and we'll have to keep you posted as things unfold.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Sure. Okay. Great. And then can you give us some updated thoughts on Medicare's continual shift to be value-based reimbursement models and how you're positioned? And kind of on top of that, we've seen you do a few deals over the last several months. You mentioned some on the call, but also the Camden Group acquired a small consulting business as well and wondering kind of what your view is in participating in the -- in Medicare's bundled payment for care improvement initiative and whether you think it has legs or not.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. We don't have any particular perspective on that program. So I won't waste your time with just saying some superficial pablum. Our Camden Group, which is for those of you who don't know, is a consulting firm, it does superb work. They have a number of clients who are participating in the program. And so we're watching and we'll continue to watch, but we're not, at this point, doing anything dramatic in that sphere.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great. And then going back to some of Garry's comments. I think you mentioned you saw a $3 per treatment increase. I guess how much of that's recurring? And then can you just recap again the $29 million Medi-Cal prior period increase? Where did that come from? And that's all I have.","Garry E. Menzel","So onto the first question. You may have to repeat the second question for me. The first question, as I pointed out in the per-treatment increase, some of it was -- we did intentional nonrecurring IT expenditures at the end of the year, and some of it were normal seasonal increases. We're not breaking out how much of that is recurring, but I think you can assume on a G&A perspective that the run rate that we have for the average of 2014 is likely to be the run rate that we will have in 2015.","Kent J. Thiry","And on the second subject, I think you asked about the $29 million, is that right?","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes, yes, that's right.","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. And what that is, is Medi-Cal, which is Medicaid in California, instituted significant cuts back a while ago. It became -- it was litigated and so in order to be appropriately conservative, prudent, we couldn't -- didn't want to realize that revenue. And recently, there were decisions which made it clear that the state would not claw back those dollars and hence, it was time to put them through the P&L. Is that correct, Jim?","James K. Hilger","Yes. That's correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Maybe just to pick up on the -- on that IT cost. Could you talk a little bit more maybe in detail about what it was and how you think about whether -- when the decision becomes whether or not to capitalize the cost versus running it through the income statement?","Garry E. Menzel","I don't think we're prepared at this point to highlight what the individual IT costs were, and we certainly haven't made any decisions on capitalizing versus running through the P&L. It depends, of course, on the nature of costs in terms of variable versus fixed.","James K. Hilger","Yes, that's right, Gary. We follow GAAP from a capitalization standpoint and the project spend in the fourth quarter was just more of an expense in maintenance type IT as opposed to long-lived assets. It was just necessary spend that, for the most part, was not capitalizable.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the revenue per treatment, you had some nice pickup. I don't recall if you said what that was from, but could you give us maybe more detail on what the growth in revenue per treatment was?","James K. Hilger","RPT, we call it RPT, revenue per treatment, that is principally -- the rise in the quarter was principally driven by the recognition of the previously discussed California Medi-Cal revenue.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That makes perfect sense. And then maybe moving on to HCP. Kent, I think you said that at this point, the contracts are structured so that if, I guess, what happened last time, where the managed care providers didn't pass along much or any of the increases to the beneficiaries, you guys would not take a disproportionate share of that. Is that on 100% of the contracts at this point? Or that's on a portion of HCP's contracts?","Kent J. Thiry","It's just a portion and then that's where I can see that I -- that we don't, around this table right now, know what the percentage is. And it tends to not be a monolithic number either because, while some of the contracts are now pure in that you're 50% aligned up and down, even-steven; other ones have much more complicated formulas or corridors and some have no protection. And so all I can say is we moved from no protection to having a decent subset of our contracts with some or good protection, alignment's almost a better word. But there's still a bunch that we -- where we are exposed. And it isn't that we suddenly wanted to reopen every single contract we had. First of all, from a capacity point of view, we couldn't do that. Second, you have some of our payers who don't want to do that and particularly, for 1 term of an entire contract. And so it's a bit of a process. So a little bit analogous to when we were starting to move to bundling in all sorts of our old Kidney Care contracts, that it took in the end 3 to 4 years for us to move from 0% to 10% that way to 70% to 80% that way, and I think we're on the same kind of journey.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So are we maybe halfway there? Or is there any way to kind of guess where we are in that process?","Kent J. Thiry","I'm looking around and nobody is confident enough to throw out an estimate. So I think we'll just have to tell you at Capital Markets with whatever precision we think's appropriate. But right now it's not a matter of our not being willing to disclose, it's that none of us knows the number right around the table.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you had said you incorrectly handicapped the potential changes to MA, and you mentioned a couple of the individual items. Is there any more detail you can give us? Was there one thing that was more than another? Or sort of what should we keep our eyes open for when the rates come out?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, I think it's the whole package. I mean, any one of the levers can add up to significant money over time. So whether it's the acuity coding, also called the RAF scores, whether it's the benchmark rate, whether it's the coding intensity, whether it's adjusting the Star system that -- on the margin, that math gets to be pretty significant of profits pretty quickly, which is why we are very worried that 2016 could be well below 2015. And then the other point we wanted to make very clearly is that we did not handicap the dynamism around Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates correctly. And for that, I wanted to apologize and make very clear that I got it wrong.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then once the rates come out, how long will it take you guys to go through that? And when could we expect to get some visibility from you on what the impact might be?","Kent J. Thiry","They'll come out with a preliminary rule on most, if not all, of those variables on February 20, and then a final on April 10. I think -- April 6, excuse me. So in between, there'll be a lot of drama.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I guess in terms of DaVita giving us some kind of guidance or direction in terms of where the proposed rates came out, when might we hear that?","Kent J. Thiry","Oh, for that, that will be at our Capital Markets on May 5.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Not to beat a dead horse, but maybe just staying with the topic here. I just want to understand, is there something that maybe shifted your view on the Medicare Advantage rates for 2016 in terms of industry chatter, consultants? The reason I'm asking, I guess, because the only really piece of hard information that we got in recent months, to my knowledge, is the trend -- preliminary trend factor, which as compared to a year ago when in December of 2013, it came out with very a worrisome number. This time around, it was actually slightly positive. So I'm just wondering, is it because of where we are in the calendar that you're raising the issue now or have there been things recently that have got you particularly concerned?","Kent J. Thiry","I don't think there's any clean answer to that because obviously in staring at it, there's a million different dots to connect from the conversations we're having with people in D.C. and what other people are saying and what people like you say and all the rest. So there's no magical source of data that we have. We do have more susceptibility than others on the RAF coding front because we have an above-average RAF, because we have slightly older patients and we've had them for longer periods of time. And we're more disciplined in both collecting diagnoses as well as acting on them, which is why we have superb clinical outcomes. And so we're more sensitive on that score than others. But then there's the other 3, 4, 5 variables. And right now, our concern is that the administration may not realize how close they are to actually reducing the incentive for people to invest in Medicare Advantage, which has been the source of tremendous innovation, cost reduction and clinical improvements. In a lot of markets, it's estimated now that once you get MA penetration up into that 35%, 40% range, the ripple effect into affecting fee-for-service expenses is quite substantial. There's a guy speaking in D.C. today who's well respected, he talked about as much as a 9% spillover effect. And so we worry that they -- some of them may be trying to, if not kill the goose that's laying the golden eggs, cut off a leg.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And as you look at the -- I mean, you talked to this and you've made some progress on renegotiating some contracts. But do you think that there is some fundamental unfairness in the way that the rate pain comes down between the plans and what you're facing as a delegated provider group? And is that something that might actually make you think differently about being delegated versus going on your own with your own MA plan?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, it's a very colorful question. I am sure that at some point in some markets, we will be a plan. And this is no different than what I said before. We prefer to work in alignment with existing plans and feel that's the best way to more quickly get to a good place for everyone, including the patient and the physician networks. But I predict with a high level of certainty that at some point, in some markets, we will be -- we'll be a plan. Did I answer enough of that or was there...","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, you did absolutely. And I just -- sorry, just one more follow-up, sticking with this theme, which is, where are your end markets? And there are -- this is happening in markets that you're not in, but major hospital systems that are forming their own plans. How are you working around that? Are you willing to subcontract with those plans versus that maybe shifting the landscape for you? I realize that's a very open question. So whatever color you can give on that would be great.","Kent J. Thiry","No, no. Your intuition is exactly right. I would think as the years unfold, we're going to have some health systems as our partners. And whether it's their plan and we're a subcontractor or it's our plan and they're a subcontractor or it's both our plans and we're fully partnered, that's going to happen. And for a lot of the health systems that are starting to put a plan on the shelf, we're one of the phone numbers they call. Because once you do that, you really get pretty intense about actually managing the population. And so you're absolutely right. And that's why 18 months ago, we said one of the sort of R&D segments we're going to play with from the perspective of developing growth models was the health system segment, and that's why we're working with Centura. It's why we're talking to 1 or 2 others already right now. And we may very well, in some of those cases, be doing a plan with them or a subcontractor to their plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Dana Syrune Nentin - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Dana Nentin in for Darren. As it relates to your outlook, I was wondering if you could confirm what, I guess, if at all, you're assuming on P&L investments as it relates to the HCP business as well as your international or ancillary businesses.","Kent J. Thiry","On international, I believe our guidance is that 2015 will be about flat to 2014. What you have going on underneath that calm exterior is some nice profitability improvements in some countries offset by the increased expenses as we ramp up in Saudi Arabia, where we won that huge government contract for 5,000 patients. So that's the mathematical answer to that. As to the dollars we're investing in new capabilities in HCP, I do not know the number offhand. It is not a small number because we think the potential for creating long-term competitive advantage is quite substantial. Of course, there's an element of subjectivity. If you add someone in cybersecurity, does that count as new capability that's strategic or is it just a new recurring normal operating expense or is it something in between? So I don't -- for Capital Markets perhaps, we can put something on the table that will give you a sense of what is incremental expenses that are very much tied to creating new capabilities for the future as opposed to just supporting existing. And by the way, if I can just break in, Dana, that someone asked a while ago about ABQ revenues. And they're back to approximately 80% of their peak, which is a significant improvement from 2 years ago at the low. But back to you, Dana.","Dana Syrune Nentin - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I guess just as it relates to a couple of your business segments. On the DaVita Rx business, can you update us on, I guess, the revenue in that business? Or maybe if you could size it in any way, like patients served?","Kent J. Thiry","We, Dana, up to this point, have not disclosed Rx revenue. And so I will not make a spontaneous decision to change that policy, but we'll take it under consideration before Capital Markets. It has grown, we will say that. It's not -- it's a material amount of revenue. And what was the related question?","Dana Syrune Nentin - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If you could size it in terms of maybe patients served?","Kent J. Thiry","Let me see if I can get permission to share that. Let me put it on mute for 1 second. We're going to -- it's approximately 65,000 patients, and people are going to check and see how out of date I am or how far off I am, but that gives you a ballpark sense.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with Citi.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had a couple of questions. The first, just going back to kind of the conversation on commercial reimbursement. Now that EPO is bundled on the government side and I think largely bundled on the commercial side, the government is giving you 0 on rate. This modest -- is it fair to say that this modest growth in revenue per treatment is purely being driven by 1\/3 of your revenue or so that's commercial revenue?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And so that seems to imply maybe your commercial rate growth is in the 2% range. Is that -- what did that look like a few years ago? Has that changed?","Kent J. Thiry","Well, I can't -- Garry is too new to know the past, and I am not going to be able to confidently say what year-over-year increases were 3 or 4 years ago. If I had to guess, I would say on a net basis, probably higher than that by a bit. That would be my -- the odds of that statement is directionality true, probably 80%.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right. I know that drug reimbursement was a driver on overall commercial revenue per treatment historically, so you have to parse that out. Is the -- this comment though about the narrow network, is that creating some pressure on your out-of-network revenue? Is that an element of the discussion at all?","Kent J. Thiry","Could you please repeat the question?","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. Kind of your general comment on commercial rate pressure driven by some structural changes in the industry, and I think you mentioned narrow networks. And I just wondered, is there -- DaVita still have a material portion of out-of-network revenue. And if so, is that something that's being pressured by the narrow networks?","Kent J. Thiry","Certainly, out-of-network business is always under pressure. I don't think we've ever disclosed our precise percentage. It is, in general, much lower today than it was before. And so I will probably leave it at that.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Just 2 other quick ones. On the $33 million HCP operating income, I think historically -- I'm not sure if you did this last quarter. It seems I remember maybe the 2Q, but you had talked about what the new market losses were. Is there an update for that number that's embedded in the $33 million?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes, I think we're trying to move away from some of that parsing. We did it because, at the time, it was necessary for you to have a fair picture of what was going on. And therefore, we did it. At this point, we think you've got a fair picture without us going into that kind of detail, which, a, can be misleading; and b, sometimes is counter to your interest in terms of how it affects those market dynamics.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. Last question. I just want to confirm the $11 million foreign currency headwind is only in other comprehensive income and doesn't impact the reported EPS or the reported operating income or the international operating income loss. Is that correct?","Jim Gustafson","Yes. There is some that ran through other income, which is the same line that interest income is in. And that was about $5 million for the year and about $2.5 million for the quarter of a headwind due to the strengthening dollar. The rest that you see runs through OCI.","Operator","And our next question comes from Trevor Walton [ph] with Advocate Health Care [ph].","Unknown Attendee","Can you guys provide an update on the hemodiafiltration trial that was supposed to end in the fall?","Jim Gustafson","Yes. We -- the hemodiafiltration trial is no longer going on. We stopped that, so we're not doing that anymore.","Unknown Attendee","Does that mean results are not favorable? And you don't see use of the product in the future?","Jim Gustafson","We did not see it promising and so, at this point, we decided to stop the trial. No details behind exactly why.","Operator","And our next question comes from Lisa Clive with Bernstein.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A follow-up question on your ancillary services business. It sounds like from a prior question that much of the growth in recent years has come from DaVita Rx, which is performing quite nicely. Could you also give us an update potentially on the number of patients you have on an integrated care platform today? And really how you see that shaping up in the next few years?","Kent J. Thiry","Yes. We don't break that out, and it's not to be difficult. But it really gets difficult to categorize, because you can have a pretty tiny pay-for-performance bonus and then define that as sort of a value-added managed care-type contract all the way to being globally capitated. And so I think from a strategic point of view, the number continues to grow and the sort of weighted average depth and robustness continues to grow. But not in a way that would affect your modeling one way or another, which is why we don't think there'll be any particular utility in us sort of arbitrarily defining what counts and what doesn't. So it's very nice progress. It helps with relationships. It's consistent with our mission. Someday, we hope that we can monetize our capability in a way that makes it worth talking about with you. But right now it's just not.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. An update to that. Could you give us an update on anything that is potentially going on with the ESCO program? Or is that just completely on ice right now?","Kent J. Thiry","I think -- I'm going to say words that one should never say. I think it's going to go into effect soon and that's just because I was in D.C. recently. And so I think it's going to go in soon. We are participating out of a sense of citizenship. It's not at scalable program as currently defined. However, we totally applaud CMS for doing all the work to get it where it is, and in particular Dr. Conway and others. And hopefully, we can use this as a platform to take that next step to a scalable program, which will really transform kidney care in America, dramatically improve quality, save a bunch of money, be good for shareholders, be great for families, keep people at work. So we're getting -- we're inching towards the promised land.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. That sounds very intriguing. Just one follow-up question. It's looked like from the initial proposals that an entity of your size can maybe end up something in the ballpark of 6,000, 7,000 patients. Is that the right way of thinking about it?","Kent J. Thiry","It's been so long since we submitted the details, to be honest, I don't remember. Those numbers could be about right. Remember, CMS gets to pick which proposals for which markets, and it's sometimes difficult to forecast then even within one of those selections exactly what the enrollment's going to be. But that maybe -- it's certainly not that we're going to have 20,000 patients and it's not that we're going to have 1,000. I mean we could have 0 if they don't award anything to us. So we'd be surprised and disappointed at that. So it's not 25 and it's not 1,000, but beyond that, I don't really remember. I think where CMS was is that, in total, they wanted to have about 15,000 patients in the pilot. Now they may have gotten more aggressive on that, but that used to be the number. And if you assume that if we're 35% of the patients in America, we'd be 35% of the ESCO patients, that would put us right about exactly where you were estimating.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schaper with William Blair.","Margaret Kaczor - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","It's actually Margaret Kaczor in for Scott. Kent, you had mentioned at the beginning of the call that you guys were really going to invest into 4 main areas for HCP: the ICPs, the JVs, et cetera. Which of those to date and going forward do you think will have the best ROI? Which one will have kind of fastest growth in MA patients? And if you were a betting man, which you're probably not, which of the 4 horses would you want to really grow the most on a 5- or 10-year basis?","Kent J. Thiry","Okay. Well, I'll first give a qualitative answer. They will all develop slower than you would like. But then separate from that, if we compare the medical group segment to the health system segment to the payer segment to the IPA segment, the one that we're, by virtue of our DNA, most compatible with and attracted to is the medical group segment. I mean we're a physician caregiver organization and so medical groups are like finding cousins or long-lost brothers or sisters for us as opposed to the other categories. And so I think that's the one that we're sort of philosophically drawn to. But as to which one will end up being the best vehicle for good risk-adjusted return on equity, it's just too soon to tell. If you forced me to bet right now, even though I'm not a betting man, I would go medical groups.","Margaret Kaczor - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just one more for me. Anything that you guys are seeing due to some of the weather the East Coast is getting? Are you seeing people maybe miss some of the dialysis appointments, anything on HCP?","Kent J. Thiry","On the weather, in general, our teammates do amazing things to help their patients get dialyzed. And I mean amazing in terms of picking them up, in terms of clearing out parking lots when there's no public services to do it, working early, working late, helping babysit for each other's kids so somebody can stay late. I mean it is inspiring to see what our people do. As a result, almost always, almost everyone gets their treatments. Does anybody around the table know anything different this time?","Jim Gustafson","I think no. And we do all always see a few -- a higher number of mistreatments every winter. And it just depends on where the storms are and stuff, but there is a little seasonal impact every winter.","Kent J. Thiry","We just had -- there were floods in Malaysia. And so we had people that were sleeping and sitting on their roofs because the water filled their houses, and our teammates continued to travel by boat to a stranded dialysis center to dialyze, with at least one caregiver being apart from their family for 7 days straight to make sure that patients got to the center then back in a boat, back to their home. So it gives you some sense of what they do.","Operator","And at this time, I show no further questions.","Kent J. Thiry","Okay. Well, thank you, all, very much for your consideration. We will do the best we can and look forward to seeing many of you at Capital Markets.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

You may begin.","Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Daisy, and welcome, everyone, for our fourth quarter conference call. I appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Javier Rodriguez, the CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Vijay Kotte, Chief Financial Officer of DaVita Medical Group; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer and Interim CFO; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.","For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Jim, and thanks, everyone for joining our call. We will start as we always do with our clinical performance. We are first and foremost a clinical enterprise. Within the DaVita Medical Group, we had great news on our star ratings most of you are familiar with that. If you think about it, we have six main markets and there are nine key star measures, so a total of 54 cells in that grid, and 31 of those 54 cells, we have a five-star rating, that's 57%, and 47 of the 54 categories are either a four or a five, 87%. Those are our best results ever and we doubt that any other multimarket set of medical groups can match them. So, very proud of that.","Within Kidney Care, CMS recently released the results of the ESRD quality incentive program, which is called QIP, we significantly outperform the industry for the fourth year in a row. Our penalty percentage was about 50% less than the rest of the industry, so a very large difference. And we, as always, remain big supporters of the transparency in both the quality incentive program and the five-star programs in both DaVita Kidney Care and DaVita Medical Group.","Now, I will turn it over to Javier Rodriguez to discuss Kidney Care.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon. I'm going to jump right in, because I have a lot to cover. Our adjusted operating income was $423 million for the quarter on relatively flat U.S. dialysis revenue and patient care costs per treatment, resulting in an adjusted operating income of $1.715 billion for 2016, which is near the midpoint of the adjusted guidance we provided last quarter of $1.695 billion to $1.725 billion.","Now, I'm going to shift to provide some details on our 2017 Kidney Care adjusted operating income guidance of $1.525 billion to $1.625 billion, which we first provided in January. I'm going to cover four headwinds and two tailwinds in depth.","Let's start with the headwinds. First, the early results from open enrollment indicate that the number of dialysis patients covered in ACA plans for 2017 will be down significantly year-over-year, consistent with what we have previously disclosed. This decline appears to be driven by changes in plan design, loss of plan choices in certain markets and disruption generally in the market, including the impact of the interim final rule.","As you know, the federal court issued an injunction, which prevented the rule from being enacted, concluding that the rule was arbitrary and capricious. In fact, the judge found material fault with both the process and content with the IFR, indicating that significant harm would be done to thousands of patients if the rule had been implemented. While this was a big victory for dialysis patients, in general, we still estimate that the earning impact from the overall loss of enrollment will be consistent with what we had previously disclosed at approximately $230 million.","On to the second headwind, like other healthcare providers, we've been experiencing wage inflation and turnover that is higher than our historical rates. Clinical teammates costs represent our largest expense. So even a small change in these costs are impactful.","Third as Kent mentioned earlier this year, our guidance range incorporates known and forecasted rate decreases. To try and be helpful. I'll ask and answer questions that I would have if I was in your roles.","First, has something structurally changed in our core business? The answer is, no. Are there more contracts than usual up for renewal this year? The answer is, no. Has leverage with payers changed? The answer is, no. They have always been formidable negotiators.","Well, then if all this is true, why are you experiencing rate reductions? The answer is that the political dynamics and the intensity of the conversation surrounding charitable premium assistance increased the scrutiny on ESRD rates. And in a subset of our situations, we felt that it was appropriate to respond when the rates were unusually high in exchange for long-term sustainable agreements.","The last question I'll ask myself on this topic is, how should we think about the future? Unfortunately, I can't provide much help here. It's hard to speculate in timeframes beyond 2017, and, as has been the case for the past decade, we remain focused on negotiating agreements at long-term sustainable rates and attractive terms.","The last headwind I will discuss is that we expect significant decreases in operational income in our pharmacy business in 2017, as a result of several factors impacting rates, volume and cost.","Now, let's shift on to the tailwinds. The first, as we disclosed in January, we signed a new supply agreement with Amgen. We entered into a six-year deal that provides for substantial savings starting in 2017, however, the specific terms including pricing are confidential.","Secondly, historically, we have had a profit share program in lieu of a traditional 401(k) match, and we're now switching to a 401(k) match effective in 2018. The net effect of this change is a one-time expense pick-up in 2017 of approximately $100 million just due to the timing of the accruals.","Please keep in mind that this will create an additional expense when comparing 2018 to 2017, because we will begin to accrue for a 401(k) match in 2018. The aggregation of this is unfortunately \u2013 the net results of all these factors is that year-over-year we will have a decline of adjusted operating income of approximately $140 million at the midpoint of our guidance. This guidance includes the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but there are scenarios where we could be higher and lower.","Please note that we do not expect the operational income to be distributed evenly throughout the year due to several reasons, two of which are normal season factors, so for example, there are two fear treatment days in the first quarter compared to Q4, and one fear treatment day compared to Q1 of 2016. And secondly, there are seasonally higher payroll taxes in Q1. As for the outlook, Kent will discuss this in his closing comments.","So, now, I'll hand it over to Vijay Kotte to discuss DMG.","Vijay Kotte - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Javier. DaVita Medical Group had solid operating performance in Q4 2016 with operating income of $22 million. This includes approximately $7 million of non-cash accelerated amortization expense for our transition to the DMG brand as noted on our previous earnings call.","As a reminder, this accelerated amortization began in September 2016 and will run for 30 months at a rate of approximately $2.2 million per month. In terms of the full-year, we ended 2016 with an adjusted operating income of $135 million, which places us slightly above the midpoint of our most recent guidance range. This includes approximately $9 million of incremental amortization expense related to rebranding for the year.","Turning next to our expectations for 2017. We mentioned on our prior earnings call that we were anticipating 2017 to be roughly flat year-over-year. Based on the completion of our annual budget process and our review of open enrollment results, thus far, we believe this continues to be the case and are giving 2017 guidance of $110 million to $115 million.","A natural question might be why we are only expecting relatively flat year-over-year performance. To answer that, I'd say that we expect continued operating improvement, but anticipate operating income to be relatively flat due to a few formidable headwinds.","First, $40 million in rate cuts, $30 million of which are related to Medicare Advantage and $10 million in Medicaid.","Second, $26 million of brand amortization expense, which is $17 million more than what we had in 2016.","And third, incremental investments in the business that we expect will improve our performance downstream focused in three main areas:","Number one, core infrastructure such as a new enterprise data warehouse.","Number two, innovative new capabilities as we continue to build a differentiated medical group, including the development of telemedicine capabilities, which will allow us to engage patients face-to-face outside the walls of our clinics or check-in between office visits as well as mobile shot technology that will provide our clinicians safe, remote, critical patient data regardless of where they are.","And then number three, expansion of existing population health capabilities into new markets, as we shift from fee-for-service to value.","As you can see, staying flat in operating income masked some pretty strong operating performance improvement as we overcome these headwinds. Finally, as we look towards our long-term operating income, our 2019 target remained $215 million.","Now, to Jim Hilger for some financial details on the quarter.","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Vijay. I'll first address our international operations. Adjusted international operating income was $2 million in the quarter, and adjusted international operating losses were $27 million for the full-year. Q4 international equity earnings from our APAC JV benefited from a $7 million currency gain within the JV. However, this gain was largely offset by a $6 million currency loss reported in other income, which is reported below operating income. These results are better than our guidance of approximately $40 million in adjusted international losses in 2016. We expect international operating losses to be approximately $20 million in 2017.","Now, on to cash flow. In 2016, we generated strong operating cash flow of $1.96 billion, positively impacted by the timing of certain working capital items that will likely reverse in 2017. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2017 is $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. 2017 cash flow should be unusually high relative to adjusted operating income, primarily due to the net cash proceeds from the government payer settlement that we expect to receive in the first quarter.","Next, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of our stock for $416 million. And for all of 2016, we deployed $1.1 billion to repurchase more than 16.6 million shares of our stock, which represents approximately 8% of our outstanding share count over the past year.","Now, a few tax items of note. The lower effective tax rate in the quarter was due to lower realized day tax rates and related true-ups. Our expected full-year tax rate attributable to DaVita in 2017 will be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%, excluding any non-GAAP items. And please note that DaVita like many other U.S.-centric healthcare service providers pays among the highest tax rates in corporate America.","Now, over to Kent for a few closing comments.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","I'd like to finish with just a few words on each of our businesses. In Kidney Care, we are in a period of greater policy uncertainties, and is the norm, if you look back over the last 10 years or so, not unique, but more than the norm. And so, while we expect a continuation of the positive operating performances we have had for several years, given the policy uncertainty, we could in fact do better or worse than the outlook that we've discussed today and earlier this year.","The big and obvious reasons are all the uncertainties surrounding what the new administration and the new Congress will do with respect to the Affordable Care Act. In addition, we do know that despite the immensely favorable Federal Court ruling on the IFR, nonetheless the debate over what will happen with charitable premium assistance, not just in Kidney Care, but in all spheres of American healthcare.","In addition to the debates about benefit, design, and benefit implementation, we'll continue to play out over the next couple of years as much as all of us would love clarity to emerge sooner. And it is worthwhile to note that there are also upsides embedded in this uncertainty with respect to issues like MSP, Medicare secondary provision, accelerating our patients' right to choose MA plans, the patient act enabling us to do global capitation in centers throughout the country et cetera. And as we often point to the Kidney Care platform in the United States remains very strong.","The international business segment, we continue to grow at a good clip and progress towards reasonable scale and we continue to expect that we will breakeven in 2018 in international dialysis for our current footprint of countries, hopefully a platform emerging with a lot of downstream growth potential.","And then lastly, the DaVita Medical Group, DMG, which has proven to be a remarkably resilient platform with capabilities improving each and every quarter at this point. You probably noted that without the non-cash amortization there would have been a nice uptick in our thoughts around the operating income trajectory. And in addition, there is growing MA support, Medicare Advantage support, in the administration and in Congress and we hope that translates into a better rate environment in the next few years than the very, very, very difficult one we've had the last few years.","And lastly, at the enterprise level, we'll make the typical obvious, but nonetheless worth noting point that our cash flows are strong, steady and hopefully we've demonstrated reasonable thoughtfulness in how we've deployed that wonderful shareholder asset and we'll continue to do so.","Operator, could we please open the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. One moment for our incoming questions. Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck [Bank of America Merrill Lynch]. Your line is open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks. Just wanted to go back to the pricing headwind that you guys talked about. Is this an issue of out of network being pushed in network?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Short answer is, no.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then we think about then re-pricing some of your contracts that maybe were above average, is that something that you feel is now completely done or is the way that contract timing works, we might see additional pressure like this heading into 2018?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, Kevin, what I would say is that we can't predict 2018. What we do know is that the climate and the landscape has changed, that with the new administration, with so many patients leaving the exchange, and therefore, having less dialysis patients than the benchmark, when the injunction relief, that right now, the landscape is materially different for 2018, and so while that does not mean we will win, we're back to a very balanced situation. Is that helpful?","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. No, I think that makes some sense. And then, I guess if you could just \u2013 really wasn't clear to me exactly what's going on in the pharmacy business, what the headwinds are there? And when we think about the headwinds into 2017, is that something that is now in the numbers, or is that something that we should be expecting to pressure the business additionally in the future?","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","I'll grab that one, Kevin. I'll probably be pretty redundant to what JR said, that there's a whole bunch of stuff going on there, unfortunately, largely negative. And so, without parsing it all out, it's a bunch of stuff that at the same time has hit rate, volume and cost, leading to the substantial decline that JR talked about. And it's conceivable that through the course of the year, we might actually even move into a loss situation for the first time in a long time, and we'll of course keep you posted on that. So, it was important enough for us to point to, and we'll keep you posted as we move through the year.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is that a business that you feel you need to be in strategically, or is that something that if it heads this direction, it becomes a loss that you could potentially get out of?","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","From a strategic, and from a clinical, and from a mission perspective, we love the business. It does remarkable things for our patients' clinical outcomes, and the access and convenience, and support that they and their families so intensely need. Having said that, if you said that the premise was ever we're going to lose money forever, then we'd have to take a good hard look, but that's not our expectation and that's not our intention.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess, there's a lot of things going on there, so it might be hard to explain in a short period of time. But I guess, just any color that you can provide around that, just so that we now have a sense of whether we think this will get better or worse going forward, I guess, it's kind of vague, and I'm not sure how to think about it.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Maybe we'll go a little bit more in Capital Markets, because we never had to talk about it much and we had a couple very nice years there. And so, part of this is a drop from some really good things that happened that we didn't talk about because of the timing of the bad period we felt it important to cover that on this side.","So, why don't we share more at Capital Markets? And in general, a material movement in profits for Rx, that starts to look pretty immaterial when you think of it just as a part of our Kidney Care offering overall. And so, we don't want to place an emphasis on it that's out of proportion to the actual absolute numbers.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That will be helpful. All right. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tejus Ujjani. Your line is open.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. This is Tejus Ujjani. Thanks for taking the question. How should we think about U.S. center growth going into 2017? And then also, can you remind us of your JV strategy? And also kind of a modeling question, I noticed the NCI stepped down a bit sequentially, any color there would be helpful? Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Let me take the first part. The first part on our non-acquired growth in Kidney Care, we're going to be consistent to the range that we've highlighted on the 3.5% to 4.5%. And if you could repeat the second part of your question?","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sure. So, on your JV, you have joint ventures as well, so just curious kind of in 2017, will there be any change in kind of going after those opportunities as well? And then, kind of more remodeling question, I noticed that the non-controlling interest expense amount stepped down sequentially and year-over-year in this fourth quarter, I'm just curious kind of what drove that?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Got it. As it relates to going after JVs, we remained consistent in our philosophy there, which is, we really like the clinical value that a joint venture partner offers. So, that has not changed and we don't expect that to change. As it relates to the number, Jim's got an answer.","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, Tejus, the reason NCI dropped in the quarter was related to the goodwill impairment at one of our SIs, we took a $28 million impairment, there was $8 million related to that was impacted NCI. If you look in our non-GAAP reconciliation in the back of our earnings release, you can see the numbers.","Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake [Wolfe Research]. Your line is open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. [Technical Difficulty] (24:37-24:46)?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Hey Justin. Justin you were all garbled there the first 10 words or so. We couldn't hear them could you start over.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Sorry about that, I just said, I'm in airport. So, current pricing (24:59) pressure, can you tell us how much more patients you have at these higher rates that could be subject to pressure going forward, I know you can't predict it. But you did a similar amount that you still have these rates that you've already seen get re-priced or is it more or less?","Vijay Kotte - DaVita, Inc.","Well, it's less than before, given what happened. And I think it's \u2013 I don't think it's a good idea to sort of discuss the distribution curve. I mean there is always going to be one, of course, but it can have a different shape and ours has been very steadily becoming a tighter distribution curve over the last eight years, consistent with the strategy that we've expressed to you. So, unfortunately, we can't sit here and say that there is no downside going forward. Having said that, we just incurred a big chunk of it.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","And now last on Medicare Advantage, you noted the final (26:04) and your stars are improving, can you tell us what you think your rates could be for 2018? And how that might affect your DaVita Medical Group business? Thanks.","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Justin, it's a little early for us at this point. As you know, there's a lot of variability between the advanced and the final notice. We've got some very high-level assumptions that have been put out, but the accounting level specifics are very important for us. So, it's way too early to tell and when we get more information, we'll let you all know.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Justin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman [Wells Fargo Securities]. Your line is open.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one housekeeping item. Jim, what was the share count at the end of the year?","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","It's in our earnings release. Hang on.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Sorry.","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","Fully diluted, at the end of the quarter, that will average for the quarter was 196,743,187.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And what was at the absolute end of the year?","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","We'll get back to you, though. We're...","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Yeah, that was the number I was looking for. Javier, you mentioned that the landscape you think was more balanced going in to 2018, given some of the recent events. Is there any chance that, that helps you at all in 2017 or is everything kind of locked and loaded for 2017 already?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Well, it's not locked and loaded. The probabilistic gives and takes embedded in the number that we gave you.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So, maybe it's not unreasonable, I think it might be a little bit better than initially thought?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","It could be a little better, it could be a little worse. In the name of the game, we try to be as constructive and productive as we can and give you as much as we can and that's what's embedded in our guidance.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. And then if we think about the total, the $230 million hit, the two buckets you broke it out into, was the Medicaid and the non-Medicaid. So, in future years given the court decision, is it possible that the non-Medicaid comes back? How should we think about the opportunity there?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. On the non-Medicaid, I doubt that it would come back. I would just \u2013 I would say no to that, although you never say no to anything nowadays, because everything is being questioned. And so, is that the bulk part of your question or is there something else in that?","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, I think that's sort of the bulk of the question. And then maybe just to wrap up Kent, I think this is a question for you. You guys bought back a record amount of stock last year. I mean going into this year with EBIT expectations to be down for the first time in a while, there is a little bit of a dichotomy there, obviously, it sounds like you guys are pretty bullish on the business with the stock repurchase. So, can you maybe help reconcile that for us and what makes you so optimistic about the business going forward?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Okay. Gary, if you could clarify for me, where do you see the apparent contradiction?","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, just that you guys are obviously bullish about the business with the large stock repurchase, and the EBIT guidance for next year is down, which is not typically the case, so that sort of what I'm pointing out as maybe a little bit of a dichotomy?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I don't know if I quite think about it the same way, so that makes me stumble around here for a second, and see if it can be useful. As we accumulate cash, if we're not thinking that we've got the right business opportunities to invest in, there's a point at which we get someone uncomfortable, and usually a bunch of you do also with the amount.","And then we do stare at the price of the stock, and we are not in the camp that some people are in, where they just say buybacks are \u2013 buyback decisions should be made totally independent of what the stock price is. We're not in that camp, nor do we think that we're excellent prognosticators of which way the stock moves as you can tell from a lot of the decisions we've made over time, whether it's stock buybacks, or option exercises, or whatever.","So, we're appropriately humble in thinking about that, and there's always upside and downside. So, clearly, putting all that stuff together, and the fact that it didn't feel at all appropriate to use your money to pay down debt, we thought it was right to put the cash to work by buying back stock, put it to work for you rather than having it sit for a longer and longer period of time on our balance sheet. And of course, we didn't want to reduce our standards for making additional business investments.","It is also the case that we think that while 2017 is going to be a very tough year compared to perhaps any year in memory that things are going to be better as we move forward out of 2017, it's not to say there isn't risk, but that's where we lean. So, is any of that helpful to you in trying to resolve what you feel is sort of a contradiction?","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, I think that is helpful, I mean maybe could you be more specific on some of the things that you think get better post-2017.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Well, it doesn't take much to get better. Taking a couple of hundred million dollars in hits between government actions and big payer hits. We've never had that happen in, I think, 17 years and so, just by not being another 2017, it already is a very nice step-up. In addition, the fact is when we do eliminate some higher than usual rates that is another element of downside that's gone. In addition, we do have some policy upsides. In addition, we're hoping that DMG and international start to be incremental contributors.","So, I think those are some of the reasons beyond just the continued positive operating performance of our core U.S. Kidney Care platform, leads us to think we've got a very good chance of doing better.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. That's perfect. Thank you very much.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Hey Gary, while I've got you on the phone, both Jim and I have answers. This is Javier. I don't think I was clear in my answer. I might have even misspoken. The Medicaid is likely not to come back and the non-Medicaid is too early to tell. I think I might have confused my labels there.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","And Gary on the share count question, it's 194,554,000, and that's also disclosed on the face of the balance sheet.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Gary.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Taylor [JPMorgan Securities]. Your line is open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good evening. Couple of questions, one, since you mentioned it, is there a date for the Capital Markets Day yet for 2017?","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","We're targeting a time in late May, Gary, and we're just finishing up that.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. Another question around the Amgen contract, is the contract structured in such a way that the CMS ASP calculations are going to reflect your substantial savings? And if so, what's the risk that they look at rebasing the bundle again?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - DaVita, Inc.","Gary, the way our contract's structured has little to do with how CMS sees the data and the spend. And so you remember that CMS has to look at all of the inputs of cost to the facility and should do a rebasing, what you're referring to on a holistic basis. So, they'll be looking at lots of things, including how much we're spending on Epogen and how much the industry is spending on total cost of care. Then number two, I'm sorry, can you remind me the second part of the question?","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I think you kind of handled both, it was just, are they going to be able to see the savings? And if so, risk of potentially rebasing. So I think you hit both.","My last question would be, with the $100 million of headwind for 2018, which is about a 6% OI headwind, I know you're not giving 2018 guidance yet, but the Street's got 6% OI growth in 2018, which means, net of that headwind about 12% OI growth. Are there some obvious tailwinds at this point comparable to that $100 million headwind to identify?","James K. Hilger - DaVita, Inc.","I don't think we want to go any further in talking about time beyond 2017, right now. Capital Markets, hopefully, will give you some more insight and analysis to help you think about it, but I don't think we want to go any further now. We have a shot at 2018 being a good year when you think about it in the context of the $100 million headwind created by the accounting change, but nothing that can be put in the bank yet.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Whit Mayo [Robert W. Baird]. Your line is open.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. I'm just curious of the conversation around premium support on exchange lives is having any impact on the non-exchange business or maybe said in another way, do we believe that there is any spillover effect in your commercial book from the focus of premium support on the exchanges?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","There hasn't been any that I know of. The other parts of the business are very different from a regulatory and decision-making point of view. So, that's the current status.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And maybe can you elaborate a little bit more on what some of the benefit design changes you're seeing health plans implement that's impeding the ability of the ESRD patients to enroll at this point?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","The real answer is that with open enrollment done, the substantial part of the equation played out. And so, it's not right now about the design issues, but rather that we missed the open window.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. And maybe one last one here just looking in my notes, and I can't remember if Renal Ventures is closed or not, I know you re-priced the deal, just any color on the timing and any other relevant developments would be helpful.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. Unfortunately, there are no major developments to report on this. It's been a long transaction and we are anticipating in Q2 close, and that's all unfortunately we have to say.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And the original plan was first quarter?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","To be honest with you, the date has been a moving target, I can't remember the last one we gave you, because the buyer and the FTC and the process has been one that's kept going. And so, we've probably given you more dates, and the last one was, I believe, Q1, but I can't recall.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. I'm going to sneak one more, and just you flagged higher labor cost trends and I presume a lot of this is field level, but any other color you can share around what headwinds you're seeing and maybe comment on merit pay increases? Thanks.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah. I don't have anything insightful. The labor markets are getting tight, it's a competitive landscape, and just workers are demanding higher wages, of course, it's our job to create a special place to work where people are more fulfilled. And so, therefore, on average, wages becomes, while of course, they are beginning to make a competitive wage, but people are less willing to consider moving to another place just for the wages. And so, that's what we're dealing with. I don't have anything else to add to that.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","No. That's helpful. Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor [William Blair]. Your line is open.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. First question is a broader one for me. Is there any legislation that you guys have seen that's percolating that might benefit you with the new administration and Congress, and if there was some kind of a tax reform I guess, what could you do with the additional earnings in cash flow?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Well, if they achieved corporate tax reform, the kind of tax reform that they are talking about, we'll have a really nice party with you guys, because we're one of the highest taxpayers in America, and always have been.","And the good news is that the new Congress is really serious about doing that. We're in D.C. now and that subject has probably come up in four of the meetings that I've been in, in the last 24 hours. Having said that, that's a tall mountain to climb and so you've got tremendous resolve with Paul Ryan and others. And at the same time, you've got formidable challenges in pulling it off.","So, we just love the fact that it's a real possibility. And then, what will we do with it? Well, I think we'll wait until we're about to get it before we spend too much time on that. But I think we'll put it through the same decision-making filters that we put our current cash flow through.","And then I think your broader question about, is there any other legislation? The other piece of legislation which has a good shot is our patient demonstration legislation, wherein we would pick up the right to put thousands and thousands and thousands of our patients into a globally capitated environment, where we can provide integrated care, which would significantly improve clinical outcomes and over time save taxpayers money. So that's a very, very big deal with a number of the bill sponsors here in the last 24 hours who remain very enthused and so that's percolating and has very attractive potential.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just given the changes in profitability. As we look out for you guys, this year what should we expect in terms of the number of centers that you're developing or acquiring in the Kidney Care business. And more broadly, I guess, again, is just smaller competitors that you have, the mom-and-pop shops to smaller regionals. How do they handle the difficult profitability environment and could that impact your business in some way?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, Margaret on the de novo certification, we see somewhere in the range of 90 to 110 for 2017. So pretty consistent to the range we had for, did I say 2016. So for 2017, we have that range. It's consistent to the range we had for 2016.","As it relates to the small players, we have seen a slight pickup in the marketplace, but the reality is that there is just not a lot out there and so it's on a very low base. And so, you shouldn't see a big spike or meaningful movement in the acquisition number.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","So, you're not saying then necessarily shutting their doors or anything and the like yet at least?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","We haven't heard any, that doesn't mean that conversations aren't happening. But we have not heard of any.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just one more from me, in terms of Renal Ventures, is that included in guidance and roughly what's the impact? Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","It is included in the guidance, and the number, I'll check in a sec here.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","It's not material, is what I'm being told, but I'll get the number in a sec.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Kent J.

Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jim. Solid results in Q4 for both Kidney Care and HCP. We'll start by discussing our clinical outcomes first, as we always do. 176,000 dialysis patients in America, about 35% of the patients in America; 98% with a Kt\/V of 1.2 or greater; 73% of patients with fistulas placed for access. And we'd like to talk a little bit about our VillageHealth metrics, where we're at the cutting-edge of integrated care for these kidney care patients, with numbers like the hospitalization rate 26% better than the U.S. ESRD average; our readmission rate 31% better than the U.S. ESRD average; and as low as 5% catheter rates; and our special needs plans, less than half are already industry-leading companywide rate and 70% better than the U.S. ESRD average.","These are wonderfully exciting numbers of incredible clinical and economic benefits for society, cannot be scaled until we have a new government program, and we are hopeful in that regard, and then continue to work collaboratively with the government to try to move us there.","On the clinical side with respect to healthcare patients and our 830,000 patients there for whom we provide true population health management care individual-by-individual, but also across the entire population, if you look at 2014 HEDIS clinical metrics, California, our largest legacy market, we once again exceeded the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics, and we were four or five star across all MA patients on eight of the nine HEDIS metrics that are directly applicable to providers.","So the clinical outcomes for both Kidney Care and HealthCare Partners compared very favorably to national averages, which means healthier patients, higher patient satisfaction, and savings to taxpayers.","But now back to those solid results. In Kidney Care, that translated into $409 million NOI, and HealthCare Partners $72 million. Jim Hilger will elaborate on the Kidney Care numbers, but I'll just provide a couple of highlights. The biggest good news is that our commercial mix and our rates, both went up a bit. The biggest bad news is that our NAG, our non-acquired growth, went down.","The commercial mix number is particularly significant in that it shows that up to this point at least, exchanges are not hurting us as we continue to hold our commercial prices constant for this commercial segment in our mind. And one reason we're able to do that is because more and more payers are paying more and more attention to the total value proposition, which is to say our ability to reduce hospital rates, to reduce cost of care in other areas continues to grow as a factor in determining the prices for the core treatment itself.","Now on to HealthCare Partners, solid performance. But there were some one-time favorable and unfavorable items, so you shouldn't actually take the $72 million as the normalized number. Better to think of it as normalized at about $65 million, which is in line with our annual guidance after some of those one-time puts and takes.","On the business development front in HealthCare Partners, we are getting better. We have actually added full-time folks in the last few months, the first time since we did the deal. We are not satisfied yet, but we're getting to be pretty darn competitive. We're in some high potential conversations, and our status as the leading independent medical group in America is one that puts us in incredibly good position for some of the high-quality conversations we're having. Separate from thinking about potential transactions, we are sitting at an MA lives numbers that is 8.3% higher than the same time last year. So very nice growth stream underneath those numbers.","Moving on to guidance for the balance of 2015 or for the total of 2015 depending on how you want to look at it, our enterprise guidance is now $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion. What this means is we raised the bottom end of Kidney Care guidance by $25 million. It's consisting of Kidney Care being $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion and HCP being $225 million to $275 million.","If I were to step back for a moment and just comment on our outlook, we have two strong business positions, both enjoying some steady unit growth, each with reasonably stable economics, although there is always some to-ing and fro-ing, and we are investing significantly for our future in improving our value proposition in ways that others will matter. And then specifically with request to HealthCare Partners, we're continuing to make very good progress in creating a highly differentiated physician experience, a highly differentiated patient experience, and more of a growth capability outside of the historical markets.","I'll now turn it over to Jim Hilger.","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","Thanks, Kent. Starting with Kidney Care, our Kidney Care operating profits increased $38 million sequentially, driven primarily by three main positive factors: number one, higher number of treatment days in the quarter; number two, improved revenue per treatment due to improved commercial mix and commercial rates; and three, lower payroll taxes. These positive factors were partially offset by higher dialysis pharmaceutical expenses, driven by higher average unit costs in the quarter and increased losses in our strategic initiatives in the international business.","Our non-acquired dialysis treatment growth was 3.7% normalized in the quarter. This was the lowest in quite some time. While there was no single cause for this decline in our NAG, some of the reasons include higher mistreatments during the flu season earlier in the year and efforts to improve the profitability of our acute business. This has put \u2013 we have been putting a tighter screen on our new and existing relationships, and in some cases, exiting some hospital relationships where rates were too low to be sustainable. As an example, we recently lost a hospital chain acute service contract to a competitor, because we were not willing to accept the low rates the hospitals offered. These efforts have improved acute revenue per treatment and OI, but have had an adverse impact on our growth.","Now moving to G&A, G&A in our dialysis business was down from Q1 by about $2 per treatment, driven by seasonal declines in payroll taxes and the more treatment days in the quarter, and also higher-levels of legal and consulting spend that occurred in the first quarter. Please note that due to this higher legal spend in the first half of the year, we anticipate dialysis G&A per treatment to be slightly above last year's levels. International losses were $15 million in the quarter, which includes an asset impairment of $4 million. Including this non-cash charge, we now expect international losses in 2015 to be close to $50 million.","Moving now to the overall enterprise, our debt expense was $104 million in the second quarter, which is a good run rate for debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to non-controlling interests was $37 million.","Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the second quarter was 39.2%, after excluding the $8 million tax adjustment related to the finalization of the Vainer settlement. We expect the full-year tax rate for 2015 to be in the range of 39% to 40%, again excluding the impact of the Vainer settlement. And during the quarter, we repurchased $14 million in stock, but none subsequent to our last earnings announcement.","Turning to cash flow, we continue to generate strong cash flows. Our operating cash flow was $335 million in the second quarter, excluding the after-tax impact of payments made in connection with the Vainer settlement. And we now expect our 2015 operating cash flow to be between $1.6 billion and $1.75 billion, again excluding the Vainer settlement. As always, this guidance range captures the majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below the range.","And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck. Your line is now open.","Steve C. Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, yes, this is Steve Baxter filling in for Kevin. I wanted to ask about the proposed managed care consolidation. I wanted to \u2013 the plans have largely talked about this enabling them to drive a shift towards value-based payment models. Do you think this could help move markets that are traditionally more fee-for-service kind of down the value chain? And I guess, how do you think about this as impacting HCP down the line?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we hope what they're saying is true. But directionally, we think this kind of additional consolidation of market share is an unambiguous negative. Hopefully for us, because of where we sit with respect to our value proposition on both sides of the house, we can make some lemons out of \u2013 make some lemonade out of the lemon. But we worry a lot about what that combination or those combinations can mean for network adequacy and access for consumers as well as rates for consumers. So we have a lot of concern and we'll do the best we can. And hopefully there will be some opportunities created, particularly for us.","Steve C. Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That makes sense. I definitely see how you could perceive it as a negative on the dialysis side, but do you see it that way for HCP as well?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely. In general, that kind of increased consolidation just leads to more market pricing power and leveraging rate power, which often then if successful doesn't flow through to the consumer, because of the market pricing power. So we hope that it will create market-specific opportunities for us, because we think some of those folks do want to move to a more value-based world. But the dominant, the dominant directional effect is one that is scary both from the rate to consumer side and the leverage over provider side.","Steve C. Baxter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Lieberman. Your line is open.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. You'd mentioned that I guess the pharmaceutical costs being up in the quarter were one reason that impacted profitability. I guess going back to the Investor Day, you had made some fairly vocal comments in terms of I guess what your thoughts were in terms of pricing for Epogen as new competition came to the market. Fresenius discussed moving a number of patients to Mircera. And so I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on where you thought the pricing was headed and if you had any conversations that maybe you could share with us?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There haven't been any significant developments since the last call, Gary. We still have our hopes for how competitive market forces will unfold in that sphere. But there's been nothing noteworthy that's actually happened yet nor did we expect anything noteworthy to happen within this timeframe. But I don't know if Jim or LeAnne would want to add anything.","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","No, I think that's pretty much it, Gary.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So I guess the assumption that we should be working under would be that you would need to sort of see perhaps Hospira's drug come to market before there is enough of a dynamic in the market to bring down pricing?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well certainly, I think my response would just be pretty generic. The more people that come to market, the better, and we'll do everything we can to encourage it as will other people. And at the same time, of course, we have a lot of respect for the clinical efficacy of what we use right now. But certainly the more the merrier, the sooner the better.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then to follow up on the comments about the lost hospital business and I guess some competition on price, can you give us any more color on that? Was that a large national player that competed on price or a local provider?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","On the spectrum, it was a lot closer to the large size than the small size. And it was a significant account and it went for a price that we would not agree to, and it wasn't that difficult a decision. So it's just important that shareholders know that there is some of those pressures out there, and so you can worry about them at the same time that we are.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Should we be more worried about them? I mean do you see that increasing or do you sort of see this as an aberration?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Don't know.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, all right. Thanks very much.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks, Garry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor, your line is open.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Couple of questions from me. First, as we think about the non-acquired dialysis patient growth as we go over the next several quarters, is that 3.7% treatment growth similar to the patient growth? And then in terms of the lower growth, how can we attribute it between two buckets you had mentioned, the higher mistreatments versus the lower increase in the acute business?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me handle the second one first. We're not breaking it out, because it's just a single quarter and there is a fair amount of noise in the data, and so both factors are material. And there's some other stuff that play as well, only we didn't want to break it into four pieces, five pieces, six pieces. And so I think for the quarter, at least we'll just keep it at letting you know what a couple of the bigger drivers were, and that's as much as we can say now, and in each case, that effect may continue. As to the outlook going forward, we hope we can do better than how we did this quarter, but right now we can't guarantee that.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, you guys had mentioned that the commercial mix had increased. As we look at your guidance, what do you include in terms of the commercial mix? Are you expecting that to continue to increase as we go on throughout the year or stay pretty stable with where you are today?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Unfortunately on that one, it's another answer, we don't know. Certainly there has been a nice trend now for a number of months, that's comforting. But we watch each and every month, their earliest minute we can to see what happened to that number. And at this point, we're not willing to predict that it's going to keep going up, but we sure hope so.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. But you're not assuming that it continues to go up in the guidance that you've got it out right now, your operating income?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think in this case, our operating income guidance, we had never specified exactly what we were presuming on commercial mix. And we're not changing whatever we had in there. So there is no change to our guidance driven by what's happened with mix. And then probably the right way to think about it is the movements we've had on mix to be either consistent with whatever forecast we had or move this up within the range of guidance that we have.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And I hate to sneak one more in, but if I could, Kent now that you've got HCP, and then you guys have kind of gotten your hands wet in different models. You're increasing the biz dev group, expanding the business. What have you guys learned in terms of what deals are more or less accretive versus kind of the initial expectations when you had acquired HCP? And is there a model in which you've narrowed in on that's maybe more beneficial for you guys to pursue more aggressively? Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","A very fair question. I think what we like most is investing in growth, in our legacy markets. And that's consistent with what we said we would like a couple of years ago and we continue to like that, that's through organic growth and tuck-in acquisitions and things like that.","Second, we really like buying quality medical groups. We're partnering in some serious capacity with major medical groups, like we did in Colorado Springs, and as we are in a few conversations as we speak. So that's probably our second favorite option for growth.","And then, third and finally, we still have a lot of excitement around our payer joint venture in Philadelphia with IBC. And for those in general, and for our health system partnerships as we have with Centura in Colorado, but we continue to emphasize that, that is R&D, these are new types of arrangements and will take some time to emerge. So we're positive on them. But at this point, if we had to rank the kind of risk-adjusted, timing-adjusted attractiveness of different segments of growth, we'd put good old legacy markets and partnering with major medical groups at the top.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich. Your line is open.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey, Kent, thanks for taking the question. I jumped on late, so I apologize if I missed some of this. I just wanted to talk ESCOs, If you've covered it already, I can go back and check the transcript. But what's your thought \u2013 we've heard ESCOs being delayed. Is that something that you guys have considered? And I guess, what's your thoughts going forward with that program?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","On ESCOs, a couple of things. Number one, they haven't started yet. Number two, we don't know when they will start. Number three, we're working very collaboratively with CMS to get the design buttoned up. And the good news is, we and a lot of other people in the community and a growing number of people in CMS are quite positive. But to go any further than that would just be speculating and not a good use of your time.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we don't have any further questions on queue.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I will go ahead and add one other comment, operator. I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name at the top of the call. But I may have been a little bit off in one of my comments a moment ago. We're not quite expansive enough that we had provided guidance previously at our total treatment growth would be in the 4.5% to 6% range, and we're still comfortable with that expectation. Operator, are there other questions?","Operator","Yes sir. We have another question from Mr. Gary Lieberman. Your line is open.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the follow-up. Didn't want you guys to get off that easy. Just wanted to maybe go back to some of your comments on HCP and the growth and kind of what you're seeing and what your expectations are for additional deals you might do this year?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I'm sorry, I may have been talking over you at the beginning telling you that we're going to get revenge for your provoking the question period, but prolonging it.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I look forward to that.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But on HCP, we were in some high-potential promising conversations. Having said that, none of them are going to close quickly. If we succeed, it will be a very exciting beginning of our next chapter. But it's not going to happen in the next couple of months. And so I think there's nothing dramatic we can say about what will close or not close this year. All I can say is we are very substantively engaged with some groups that we really like.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Clive. Your line is open.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Hi. Just a question on your VillageHealth program. You started your prepared remarks with some interesting statistics on that. Could you remind us how many patients you have within VillageHealth? And I'm assuming the vast majority or almost all of them are Medicare Advantage. Could you give us some idea of what proportion of your total Medicare Advantage patient population are currently going through VillageHealth?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The definition of VillageHealth that we're using now is a broad one, which is to say the number of patients where there's some form of value-based payment. And so using that broad definition, which in its most extreme form is global capitation, and we have a nice chunk of that both in the Kidney Care side and on the HealthCare Partners side. And then down to having some kind of performance bonuses, shared savings arrangements with individual payers or health systems. And so that total number of patients where we're in some form of value-based payment is about 20,000. So it's significantly higher than what it was a few years ago.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","And is that \u2013 yeah, because I remember, I mean the last time I looked at the numbers, I thought it was more like 9,000. Is that largely because you've included those categories where it's not a sort of full capitation model and so could we assume that half of that 20,000, they're sort of less than full capitation?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, more than half. The, I don't know if we've disclosed the amount of globally capitated ESRD patients we have, but it's probably in the neighborhood of 1,800 or so, which is probably significantly more than anyone else, but that gives you a sense of the mix.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Lisa.","Operator","At this time we don't have any questions on the queue.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry operator, what did you say?","Operator","At this time, we don't have any further questions on queue, sir.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We'll hold for about 10 seconds or so just to give folks a chance. This is perhaps the most uneventful quarterly call we've had in 16 years. And so we will work hard to hopefully make the next one just as uneventful and hopefully positive for everyone involved. Thank you very much for your interest in DaVita. Operator, are there any other ones?","Operator","No questions on queue, sir.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you all very much.","Operator","Thank you.

I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Jim Hilger, our Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer; Vijay Kotte, our CFO for HealthCare Partners; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","I'd like to start by noting that during this call we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in these statements. Further details concerning the risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings included in our most recent annual report and subsequent quarterly reports. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us, and we do not intend and disclaim any duty to update these statements for any reason.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you, Jim, and welcome to all. This will be a pretty high density call, and I'll be covering more topics than normal because of some of the nuances contained therein. As usual, I will first talk about our clinical outcomes because that is what comes first. Second, for each major business unit I'll talk about the operating performance for the quarter, year, and provide some thoughts on 2016. Third, we'll then step back on each business briefly and on the enterprise overall to try to set the table for our Capital Markets Day coming up on May 18 in New York City. And then lastly, I'll talk about enterprise capital allocation. So let's launch right in since there's quite a bit to cover.","On the clinical outcome front, excellent news once again. Kidney Care, 97% of our patients with a Kt\/V of 1.2 or greater, 73% of patients with fistulas placed for access. At our recently final results announced for the CMS QIP program for another year period, once again we outperformed the rest of the community with only 1.4% of our facilities facing a penalty compared to 7.1% for the rest of the industry. Of course, no quality rating system is perfect, but in rating test after rating test, we come out as clinically differentiated.","On the HCP front, equally promising results. With respect to HEDIS clinical metrics, we'll just pick Nevada this time. We try to move it around for you geographically. And in terms of subject matter, we once again exceeded the Medicare fee-for-service benchmark on all metrics, and had four-star or five-star across all MA patients on all nine HEDIS metrics. So in both cases, both main sides of the house, our outcomes compare very favorably to national averages. This is good for patients. This is good for the taxpayer.","Now, let's move on to the quarter and the year. We'll hit HCP first, international second, Kidney Care third. HCP operating performance for the quarter, $25 million, that excluded the estimated write-down. This was within our guidance range. On a normalized basis, this was actually about $37 million if you normalize for prior-period adjustments, et cetera, which actually is about exactly the same amount of profit in Q4 of 2014 normalized.","For the full year OI improved, as you know, from $215 million to $240 million, which is also within our guidance, although at the low end. In order to achieve that, the legacy markets were up a bit, the new markets were up a bit, and the combination of those bits was more than enough to make up for the medical cost inflation and some very substantial investments in capability building\/G&A. And Vijay Kotte, our new HCP CFO will discuss those investments and capabilities in G&A in more detail in just a few minutes.","But I will say (04:48) move right on to 2016 guidance for HCP. It is $175 million to $225 million. There are three primary drivers of that range. Driver number one, $58 million in reimbursement cuts. This is primarily the result of the new acuity coding RAF model being implemented, the final chunk of the way, a 100% implemented as of that time. As previously discussed, the HCP was more comprehensive in its coding capture. Complete diagnosis of patient conditions is a good thing, but it also left the entity far more vulnerable to any coding reimbursement compression. So $58 million from that source, most of it the model and the model is now 100% in.","Second big driver of that range is our investment in additional capabilities. There's two components to this $60 million year-over-year increase. Component A is really remedial. Their prior business leadership essentially stopped investing in the company, it was working to maximize profitability for the sale either knowingly or unknowingly. And as a side note, just want to remind you that we knew that. That is why we only paid a six times multiple in a world where other allegedly comparable assets were then going for nine times to 10 times and now much greater than 10 times in the market. And the second component of that big G&A capability investment is offensive, meaning investments that we think are going to create significant competitive advantage for us over time.","The third primary driver is the positive one, which offsets a big chunk of those two negative ones. Solid operating performance, good old solid operating performance. So if you look at the math, you have a $58 million hit from essentially the completion of the RAF model. You have a $60 million hit from the increased investment in G&A, half remedial, half offensive. That would equal a $118 million hit. You then have a $78 million operating performance improvement which offsets all but $40 million of the two negative trends, and that yields the change from the $240 million in 2015 OI to the midpoint of the guidance $200 million for 2016.","We can of course take questions on all of that but those are the three primary drivers. 2017 does look better than 2016, the model will be behind us. We continue to make steady progress on our capabilities and our contracting. If we put the P&L aside for a moment and look at cash flow and take as a scenario the midpoint of our guidance, in other words the $200 million for HCP, and simultaneously take the midpoint of our guidance for the total enterprise, that $200 million would equal 11% of total enterprise operating income.","However, HCP operating cash flow is projected to be over $400 million, about 25% of total enterprise operating cash flow. This happens because of what we've talked about in the past, low working capital intensity, low CapEx requirements, and a $100 million per year hard dollar cash tax benefit. If we step back for a moment and look back at three difficult years, the total reimbursement cut from the implementation of the new RAF model for us, $165 million. What we had anticipated was a much smaller number than that, in fact less than half, so about $100 million of incremental P&L harm that we had not expected is due to that single variable, $100 million. Now, the fact that it came from that does not make it any less painful than if it came from anything else, but the important message is it did not come from operating problems or operating issues.","Looking forward instead of backward, we have six primary markets; California, Nevada, Florida, New Mexico, Colorado and Washington, or more particular the Seattle area. In those primary markets we have six leading independent medical groups. It is in those places plus our joint venture, Tandigm in Philadelphia, of course, but that is a horse of a different color, that is where we'll be placing most of our emphasis in the near and perhaps intermediate term. Prices are very high right now for valuable properties. Our bandwidth is pretty stretched given how much we've grown and given how much opportunity we have in those six markets plus with Tandigm.","And then third, we need to prove to you that we can get the right returns and margins in a number of those places before we do too many other significant things. Because of all that, it is unlikely we will do any other big Everett like deals, unless it is through a capital like transaction or is for a very attractive multiple. Other good news to take into account and looking forward instead of backward, I'll list a few of them each of a different type. First, our legacy markets in 2015 once again outgrew their markets in terms of MA growth. The markets grew 6%, we grew 9%. Number two, we've dramatically improved patient service metrics since the time of the transaction.","Number three, we've had a number of significant IT advances that have improved our support for our front line physicians. We have a long journey there and Vijay will talk about that a little more but we've got some nice early momentum and victories in better supporting our front line physicians. Number four, we've had a number of forecasting and fire period adjustment issues. You know that painful truth as we do. Our finance leadership team is literally 90% new. And fifth, and finally in this case, if you look at our top 22 executives, we have five great veterans with immense amounts of valuable HCP experience, and 17 new executives that we think are the right people to help take us into that next chapter going forward. So that's it on HCP for now, although Vijay will come back and talk about some of those capability and G&A investments a little bit later.","So to move on to international, we underperformed in 2015, $55 million in losses compared to original $40 million of guidance. But why? Well, we had a $5 million AR reserve, which almost entirely came from one country where there were two fiscal intermediaries that became insolvent. We actually hope to get a bunch of that money back. We also are $10 million behind plan or were $10 million behind plan in two countries where we built new centers and patient growth was behind plan. In 2016 for international, our guidance is losses of approximately $40 million. This assumes no unusual AR reserves. We are experiencing payment delays with the Saudi government. So that's a washout, but we have done nothing on that front now, we still expect to receive all of the funds. And the good news is, the Ministry of Health in Saudi is explicitly very happy with our service, and very impressed by the patient feedback they have received. Their words, not ours.","In 2017, we anticipate improvement over 2016 on an OI basis, and in 2018 in international dialysis in our current country portfolio we expect to achieve breakeven. We are, in fact, already in 2015 or we did already in 2015 generate positive aggregate EBITDA at the clinic level in eight out of our 10 countries as we continue to grow and cover our G&A. And another reference point that gives you a sense of the per country scale, in 2014 we had an average of $10 million revenue per country. 2015, an increase of 50%, up to $15 million per country. 2016, if we hit our plan will be $27 million in revenue per country. So you can see that at reasonable margins we are making strong progress in covering the fixed nut of global G&A.","Finally, most of our growth internationally has been through acquisition. Virtually every one of those acquisitions has been competed for with others. And so these are market valuable assets that real competition wanted to have, and our competitors continue to invest in growing internationally as well because of the returns they see. Now, stepping back for a moment with respect to international, we are still very bullish on the long-term opportunity both in Kidney Care and other HealthCare services.","Now, on to the Kidney Care operating performance. Once again, strong quarter, strong year. Operating income, $449 million, and then for the year $1.658 billion. First number was for the quarter, of course, once again excluding some non-recurring stuff. Jim Hilger will provide more detail on the numbers. I'll go right into guidance. We anticipate in 2016 another solid year, $1.625 billion to $1.725 billion. Of course, there's always risk, we'll fall short and there's always hope that we will exceed. This guidance, per our normal customs, does include the international economics, and it also includes the unfortunate fact of flat Medicare reimbursement for the third straight year.","The uncertainty in our 2016 performance, as in many recent years, centers on revenue and revenue per treatment. We anticipate our performance in the first half of the year with respect to RPT to be positive, but we have a lot less visibility into the second half of the year, hence the broadness of the range. And regarding the strategic initiatives, there could be some earnings volatility there. One reason is ESCOs, as you know, we have launched, and so we incur those costs, particularly those extra start-up costs now, and we get the shared savings payment later if we perform and the data is correct. And the second variable are some Rx, DaVita Rx renewals. All of this of course is incorporated into our guidance.","Stepping back now with respect to Kidney Care and looking out three years, four years, five years, there's one big downside and three attractive upsides. The big downside is what will happen to private pay. It is unfortunate that we have a large cost shift in our dialysis industry in America with private patients paying a lot more to subsidize the 80% to 90% of our patients that are Medicare and Medicaid. And when you put that on top of payor consolidation, distributed risk pools, exchanges and other things going on, it would not be prudent to not be nervous about what will happen with private pay.","On the other hand we do have three upsides; one is in the ESA market. For the long term, as many of you know, we spend about $800 million per year on ESAs. We are intensely looking for the right long-term partner or partners and hope to consummate some type of long-term partnership well before the expiration of our current contract at the end of 2018. Second, integrated Kidney Care. We are very competent at this. Regardless of who has the risk, we think we will be one of the sub-contractors of choice. And third, finally, the flat Medicare reimbursement is scheduled to go away at the end of 2018. In 2019 we hope to be back to our normal market basket. All-in-all, our strategic position in U.S. Kidney Care is strong.","Now, let's step back to the enterprise overall. The guidance; OI of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion; OCF, $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion. But on an equally important topic, how are we thinking about capital allocation at the enterprise level? Well, first with Kidney Care, we stay the course, and since there aren't a lot of large properties available out there, that means they will not use all the cash they generate. HCP, they will focus on existing markets unless something that is capital-light or at a very attractive multiple comes along. International, we will continue to invest to grow.","Putting all three of those together, what does our capital allocation look like if you pick something arbitrary like the next three-year period? We will generate in a reasonable scenario \u2013 with of course downside risk and upside hope, but in a reasonable scenario, we will generate operating cash flow of approximately $5.5 billion in the next three years. If you count normal use, meaning our current operating plans, business plans, et cetera, which of course could change, we will use about $3.5 billion for those purposes. This leaves about $2 billion on the side for us to contemplate what to do with, with of course your counsel as well, as we compare other growth opportunities to debt repayment opportunities to share repurchase opportunities.","Now, Vijay Kotte, our new CFO of HealthCare Partners will walk through a few more details.","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","Thanks, Kent. I'll take a few minutes to provide more detail into the investments we're making into the future. As Kent stated before, we are continuing to make both remedial and offensive investments into the business. The best way to look at these items is to put 2015 and 2016 together. When you do that, we have a total of approximately $80 million in incremental investments over 2014. To provide more context into these investments, I'll put them into three primary buckets. First, we have information technology; second, legal and compliance; and, third, next generation capability and change match.","In the bucket of IT, we plan to spend $40 million more in 2016 than we did in 2014. This includes the following areas. First, security; second, applications to support population health; third, a community portal to enhance communication between patients and providers; an enterprise data warehouse; our accounting system conversion; and a national IT infrastructure to enable our creation of one company.","Next, in the legal and compliance bucket, we will invest an additional $10 million to $15 million over 2014. In our final bucket, we're investing approximately $18 million into research and development related to next generation care management capability, a team we call Catalyst, with applications to our current markets as well as others.","Now, Jim Hilger, our CFO, will walk you through a few more details on the numbers in the quarter.","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","Thanks, Vijay. First, I'd like to point out a couple of non-GAAP items in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we recorded an estimated accrual of $23 million for potential damages and liabilities in our DaVita Rx pharmacy business. We have excluded these numbers from our reported non-GAAP income from continuing operations.","A few words about this estimated accrual. The reserves relate to the period from 2010 through 2015. As a part of our normal process, last spring, we initiated an internal compliance review of DaVita Rx, during which we identified potential billing and operational issues. We notified the government in September of 2015 that we were conducting this review of DaVita Rx and began providing regular updates of our review.","Upon completion of our review, we filed a self-disclosure with the OIG on February 5, 2016, and we have been working to address and update the practices we identified in the self-disclosure. In addition, as disclosed earlier today, on February 5, 2016, DaVita Rx received a Civil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Attorney's Office. The information requested has some overlap with the items we self-disclosed, and we do not know if the U.S. Attorney knew we are already in a process of developing a self-disclosure with the OIG.","At HCP, we took an estimated $206 million impairment charge of non-cash goodwill in an intangible asset of certain HealthCare Partners' operating units. These impairments were driven primarily by underperformance of the business reporting units in recent quarters as well as changes in other market conditions, including government reimbursement cuts and our expected ability to mitigate those cuts. The final amount of these impairment charges will depend upon the final outcome of this valuation work, which we expect to be completed in the first quarter of 2016. This non-cash charge will not impact go-forward performance or our cash taxes.","On to the overall enterprise, our debt expense was $103 million in the fourth quarter, which is a good run rate for debt expense in future quarters. Our income attributable to non-controlling interest was $40 million. Next, our effective tax rate for income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners in the fourth quarter was 36% and for the year was 38.2%. And we expect the full year tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 40% to 41%.","We have also repurchased $151 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter, and we also repurchased an additional $249 million in the month of January. As a result of these transactions, we now have approximately $259 million remaining under our current board authorization.","As you think about modeling the first quarter, here are a few things that you should keep in mind. In our Dialysis business, Q1 2016 contains one fewer day than this past quarter. So you should expect lower revenues and higher fixed costs for treatment. Second, our payroll tax caps reset at the beginning of the year, which leads to higher costs of a $1 to $1.50 per treatment. At HCP, OI fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter due to the seasonal needs of patients, and Q1 tends to be a bit lighter than the full-year average.","Now, turning to cash flow. We continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was $437 million in the fourth quarter and $1.861 billion for all of 2015 excluding the Vainer settlement. The strong cash flows in 2015 are borrowing a bit from 2016 operating cash flow mostly due to the timing of cash tax payments and other working capital items. But despite that, we still expect 2016 operating cash flows to be $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion, showing that we continue to generate strong cash flows. As always, this guidance range captures a majority of probabilistic outcomes, but we could be above or below this range.","And with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Mr. Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, hi. Thank you. Could you maybe just address the areas of operating performance improvement that you're expecting in the HCP business? Maybe just \u2013 I don't know if there's any kind of granularity that you're prepared to give at this point, whether it's by geography or function. I'm just curious the types of things that you think are going to be going better this year versus last?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Matthew, this is Kent. Thanks for getting on the call. It's pretty broad-based. So there's nothing really that jumps out. There's no dramatic disparity in unit growth or margin enhancement, either through MLR improvement or G&A savings or revenue enhancement. So it's pretty mixed across the portfolio.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And let me ask on a different front still related to HCP. As you look at things that are potentially for sale and you mentioned prices are high, is that still principally because of the major hospital systems that are bidding up? Is it, I mean, more of the same hospitals? How much is hospitals? How much is managed care versus other?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's certainly health systems bid sometimes breathtaking amounts for these medical groups, but we have been surprised by some of the other players, including some of the health insurance entities and the offers that they have put on the table as well.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Kent, I guess just kind of big picture, thinking about the guidance, which historically you've had a track record of being conservative. But if you look over the last few years, we haven't seen much growth in operating income. I guess, clearly, there has been some issues with HealthCare Partners. But I guess, broadly speaking, what will it take to get growth reaccelerating?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","A very fair question, Kevin, and one that we are pretty intense about on the inside. On the Kidney Care front, with that flat Medicare reimbursement that's just a real problem that we've got to get addressed. And then, hopefully, through a new partner or the same partner in a new partnership with ESAs, or getting some integrated care runway, we can start to break out of the current trend.","On the HCP side, of course, some of the declines have taken away the Kidney Care gains. And so if we just stop that and get back to a reasonable steady growth on HCP, that together with the normal growth in Kidney Care could start to generate some much more interesting numbers. And then, lastly, international is unfortunately just a couple of years away from being able to really help, although, once it starts helping it could be a long-term big deal.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. Okay. And then, going back to your comments on Kidney Care and the potential downside and three factors for potential upside. In the ESA component, you said that contract expires in 2018. Should we expect to see something happen in the next year or two years?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We would like to develop the right kind of long term win-win partnership sooner rather than later. We have the contract we have with Amgen and so if they don't want to do anything new with us, we certainly can't force them to. Having said that, there are other people that we can create agreements with that just wouldn't kick in until the day after the Amgen agreement expired.","So our point is pretty simple that we think we can be a great partner for someone for the next five years to 10 years in that area and we're eager to find that party and start working towards that long-term future. Necessarily, even if we got very serious with someone tomorrow, these deals are pretty complicated and nothing would be signed for some time. But that's one of the reasons why we want to start working on them now because it takes a while to put them together. Is that responsive?","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","It is. And can you remind us, I think in the contract you had the ability for 10% of your ESA supply to come from someone else. Are you guys testing other options out right now? And if so, how's that going?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","LeAnne, you want to talk about that?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs","Certainly. We do plan to do some pilots over the next year.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Will you go with one source or will you try different options, LeAnne?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs","Certainly we'll try multiple options.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay, great. And then, I guess going to hammer, going to the share repurchase, you guys were very active in January. I think you said you have $259 million remaining. Should we expect to see continued share repurchase activity maybe get \u2013 are you guys going to go back to the board to get \u2013 to re-up the authorization? And even though you don't provide EPS guidance, is that part of your outlook for 2016?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll go ahead and take that one. We're going to apply the same sort of measured calculus we've always applied looking at the alternative deployments, looking at the different scenarios going forward, looking at interest rates, looking at the stock price. As the CEO, I'm feeling a little sheepish about the fact that we bought back quite a bit when the stock was a fair amount higher than it is today and we would have done more value for \u2013 created more value for our long-term shareholders by waiting a little bit as opposed to buying when we were at above historical average EBITDA multiples.","So we bring our normal sort of intellectual calculus to it, but certainly we've demonstrated over the last year and certainly many of you were actively engaging and encouraging us too. Certainly, we've demonstrated, as we have at different times in our history, the willingness to going to the market and take some shares out of play.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today. Thanks for taking question. So on HCP guidance and the breakdown on different elements that are impacting the operating income. Specifically, I recall the company mentioned on the last call, Medicaid headwinds of $20 million. So should we assume that you no longer include that headwind or it's just small that you didn't disclose that?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What happened is we thought it would be Medicaid of $20 million, it turns out the Medicaid is $8 million. And so when we talked about $58 million, $50 million was that RAF model...","Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, got it.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","...in Medicare, $8 million was Medicaid.","Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That makes sense. So then I know you mentioned that those headwinds, you expect to be offset by a broad, I guess, based operating improvement. But are you willing to talk about the legacy market's performance in 2015? I don't know whether specific numbers are up or down, or the magnitude of the improvement. And then, what do you think this would be 2016 versus 2015?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. In 2015, our legacy markets contributed to the profit growth, the OI growth as did our new markets. So both were contributors to our ability to offset the bad stuff that happened in normal medical cost inflation and our big investments. In 2016, we anticipate the same that independent of the rate cuts, that both legacy markets and new markets will do better than they did in 2015.","Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then just a follow up on your comment around the dialysis business, and the pricing, that you expect the pricing to be positive in first half, but there's less visibility for the second half of the year. So can you shed a little more light why you think that?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's not because of any particular normal negotiation between us and the payor. It's just because of all the noise in the air with everything going on with exchanges, regulatory ambiguity in those areas, what some of the new payors are going to do in terms of getting in and out of exchanges. So there's just so much going on that we're uneasy, increasingly uneasy, and we thought we should share that.","Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So there's nothing specific to cause because I want to say you mentioned something around some specific contracts, or I guess maybe that was on the HCP side, so maybe that's irrelevant. And I guess that's all for me now. Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you. I think you might be referring to the DaVita RX renewals I referred to.","Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But that isn't independent point separate from what's going on in mainstream Kidney Care.","Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ms. Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys. First of all, thanks for all the details in terms of where you guys are investing in HCP. So maybe a question on that. What impact should we expect these investments to have? I might assume it's better outcomes that are going to lead to these higher patient adds. But even more specifically, over what timeframe should we see the fruits of these investments, is it as early as 2017, or is it more 2018, 2019, 2020?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Margaret, we knew this question was going to come and dreaded it because it's going to be the answer you hate. It's not going to happen right away. For example, in technology space it'll take a year, one to two years to get a lot of that stuff done. And then the benefit it has does not immediately leap off the P&L. In terms of our next-gen care management and changed management group, that's got some near term upside. When you're managing $4 billion of medical cost, the spending that extra whatever it is, $20 million with some new talents, with some new analytics, and with some new approaches, you can get a pretty good payback on that pretty quickly. But the whole team is so new and the processes we're putting in place are so new that we would just hate to create expectations and then fail. We're very bullish on the impact they're going to have, but it just is not going to be overnight.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. So maybe to take that even further, and I'm sure you'll appreciate this question as well. You talked about profitability in HCP, maybe improving in 2017, and part of that is that the reimbursement cuts from the RAF model go away. And so that should be, if I'm thinking of it right, about a $60 million tailwind. But then are you going to increase investments further in 2017 to offset that? And then also the final bucket in terms of OI performance, should that improve in 2017 as Centura and Everett start to have a larger impact?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, you do know us well. The elimination of the RAF model that's been hanging over our heads, that's certainly the elimination of a headwind. It doesn't lead to a tailwind. It just leads to the absence of wind, which for us right now would feel pretty good assuming that benchmark rate increases would be, roughly speaking, equivalent to what goes on with medical cost inflation. And so we do want 2017 OI to be nicely higher than 2016 OI because of the elimination of those headwinds and a lot of the other stuff hopefully kicking in. But did I miss a part of your question?","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. So the operating performance of Centura and Everett, what kind of impact will they have in 2017 and 2018.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. On Everett, we would also expect 2017 to be better than 2016. 2016 has some integration expenses. 2016 has some adding talent to take on risk pools. So we have that expense. We have some additional amortization from the deal. We have some special additional expenses that exist for the first year or two years of the deal and then go away. And so we are counting on \u2013 we are expecting a nice operating income trajectory at Everett clinic in 2017 versus 2016, and 2018 versus 2017, and 2019 versus 2018. We have high hopes for the significant growth of the business there. And then on Centura, that is a tougher one. We certainly expect it to do better in 2017 than 2016. It really depends on if we get a quality of risk (41:07) contract, what the effective date is, and then how quickly we can make a difference. So that one could stretch out a little bit based on the timing of all that. We're making nice progress, but right now there's nothing locked and loaded.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then just one more from me. You guys were nice enough to provide kind of the DeNovo clinics that were waiting for regulatory approval last quarter. How are those looking this quarter, and should we expect they're still could be a bolus of clinics that we'll see open in the first half of the year? Thank you.","Patrick McKinnon - Vice President","Yeah. The DeNovo backlog is still about the same as what it was last quarter, but what we're seeing is a much better improvement in opening new clinics. So that's where we'll see improvement in the first half of the year.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And that person speaking is Patrick McKinnon, Chief Financial Officer of Kidney Care.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Margaret.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Sticking with HCP for a second, is it possible to get some color on Albuquerque, maybe just how the recovery has gone on, and where it is today versus where it was, say, a year or two years ago?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Boy (42:28) Gary, this is Kent Thiry. I'll handle that. The difference between a year or two years ago is night and day. This is just huge orders of magnitude, better. So that's the high level answer. The operations have been stabilized. We're in very constructive risk pool conversations with one of the major payors. We're in healthy collaboration discussions with two other significant health systems. The leadership has been stabilized. The management team has been improved. So there hasn't been any \u2013 I mean, the numbers are certainly way better than two years, but I'm not wanting to represent this as we're on some stunningly steep trajectory of profit improvement, but all the fundamentals are better, and now we'll see what we can get done in the next couple of years.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then how much of your time are you spending on HCP versus on the Kidney Care business?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I spend significantly more time on HCP than on domestic Kidney Care.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe just talking about the self-disclosure and the CID both happening on the same day. Is that just coincidence, or is there something else that we could read into from that?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's just totally coincidence.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then is there any additional color you could give us around it?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think so, Gary. We just don't know much yet. The good news is that through our own internal normal compliance processes we uncovered some issues, and we did the right thing in investigating them. We did the right thing in reporting to the government. We did the right thing in doing some refunds. All of these were small dollar issues, and transactions that were a tiny, tiny percentage of overall transactions. And we kept the OIG up-to-date along the way as to the work we were doing but not completed, and then we send off our formal self-disclosure document. And then it just so happened that very same day that we got the CID from the Department of Justice, and we have no idea if the Department of Justice had any idea that we were already nine months down the track with the OIG.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then I think you said your analysis went back to 2010, and it looks like their inquiry goes back to 2006. Is there anything to read into that?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I guess, it would suggest, again, that the two things aren't at all linked because clearly they were coming up with their own set of issues and their own set of dates, but beyond that we don't know. As you know, in many instances once they decide to take a look, they often that first document is very, very broad because, why not?","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then on your comments regarding negotiating an ESA contract. It sounds like \u2013 you're talking about it more than I think you had in the past on new contract. Is there anything tangible you can share with us or any hope that it could get done in the near term?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No idea. This is \u2013 we are eager. I'll be redundant, but we are eager to have a long-term partner and a long-term plan, and we just think there's a lot of opportunity. But getting there we'll take either our current partner deciding they want to create the next generation together, or doing it with someone else, in which case the implementation of course would have to wait. But the reason we're talking about it more is people are getting more serious because it's just not that far away anymore, and $800 million a year and growing is a lot to play with.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then, I guess, maybe just last point on that. Is there anything that you can share with us or that you're aware of, of the one short term biosimilar that has been expected to come to market but has not yet?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I personally don't think it makes much sense for us to start talking about individual biosimilars and what exactly is going on. And so LeAnne, I don't know if there's anything you'd like to get out on the table. Anything I do would just be repeating publicly known information.","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs","No Kent, I think you answered that correctly.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks very much.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks Gary.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. We're going to get the advanced notice for 2017 MA rates next week, and obviously I don't want to \u2013 it's hard for you guys to predict what's going to be in there. But one thing that's been kicked around is potentially adjusting the risk models to better code for duals. Do you have any thoughts on that, particularly if it was budget neutral, and if not, can you at least give us a sense for within the HCP pool of enrollment how many are duals? Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Like you observed, we don't have any idea what they're going to do, and we do believe that currently in Medicare Advantage the sickest people we get under reimbursed for, and the healthiest people they over reimburse for. And for people like us, who are not insurance companies, and we want to keep the patients we have, we do keep them, we can't really determine which new ones come to us, the current reality works to our disadvantage. And then with respect to duals in particular, while we have a bunch, it's impossible to say whether we would benefit materially or not until you know whatever the heck they would do.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. And then changing gears here, just with regard to the seamless payor organization rollout or pilot\/fall, can you give us a sense for some initial feedback from patients, or just anything with regards to that would be helpful. Thanks a lot.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Is this regarding ESCOs?","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's just too soon. But we can tell you that we've been in a globally capitated pilot with CMS for seven years, eight years now, and it's pretty significant. There's 800 patients there or so. And then we have another 800, 900 globally capitated patients within our HealthCare Partners universe. And in general, and in particular on the Kidney Care side where the C-SNP plan, special needs plan, is focused just on these Kidney Care patients, it's spectacular. The patients get extra services. The doctors have extra support. The referring doctors get better information. The nurses get to provide coordinated care. The patient and family gets support at home. So I can tell you in our mature other where we're globally capitated, it's a spectacular, beautiful, transparent victory.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. Kent, you've discussed in the past your desire to reengage in productive conversations with your Health Plan partners to ensure that your incentives are aligned with their incentives, and they treat you as a good partner with the MA rate cuts. And are there just any developments along the re-contracting front that would be of any interest to us?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, is the short answer. I'm not going to get the mix right, but if you ask on Capital Markets Day we'll have it. And Jim Rechtin is not here right now, but I'd say a healthy percentage of our renewals end up with a new agreement where our interests are much more aligned. And that's been true every year. It's a big shift from what existed before. And the same statement is true with respect to health systems in hospitals where a very solid percentage of our new contracts there create a lot more alignment than the old ones which were so zero-sum. So I would say, it's steady progress, nothing dramatic. But it's really healthy in reducing downside risk, and over the long-term will create some shared upside.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. And just on Renal Ventures, I don't think I've heard an update. Just maybe I should know this, but just divestitures, FTC, and any sense for the contribution this year.","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care, DaVita HealthCare Partners, Inc.","Hi. This is Javier Rodriguez, CEO of Kidney Care. There is no update. We're still anticipating a Q2 close.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And maybe one last one. It's just, any way to get a sense of the size of DaVita Rx now, either by patients or revenue?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Boy, I don't remember what our historical policy has been. It has certainly grown. It is making some money, it's not losing money anymore. And I'm going to have to turn to Jim Gustafson so I don't violate any policy. Go ahead, Jim.","Jim Gustafson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah. We disclosed we're serving in various capacities 165,000 patients, and that includes both internal and external.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Ryan Newman with Promus Capital. Your line is open.","Ryan Newman - Promus Capital","Hey guys, thanks for taking my call. You spoke a little bit about the softness in some international markets, and how other players were attracted to those assets as well. As well, I know you've expanded a little bit in Colombia, in Portugal, China, Germany. Can you just talk a little bit about where the most softness occurred?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Where the most what has occurred?","Ryan Newman - Promus Capital","Where the softness conditions existed internationally?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Softest conditions?","Ryan Newman - Promus Capital","Yeah.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So soft as in...","Ryan Newman - Promus Capital","The worst performance.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Poor performance? Okay. Thank you. Sorry for my...","Ryan Newman - Promus Capital","No. I misworded the question. I apologize.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say the softest performance from a profit point of view, I mean, my mind is racing as to how much I should disclose.","Ryan Newman - Promus Capital","Sure.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We've had some profit problems in Colombia. That probably sticks out as one of the softest. In Saudi, we've been growing a little bit behind plan, but the microeconomics appear to be solid. And I think beyond that, I'd have to get into so many nuances. In China, we still put in the R&D category where we're very steadily consistently investing to look for the winning formula. And we don't have it yet, but we're not discouraged. We've got some stuff that's working there, and we have some stuff that's not working, and that's kind of the hit rate we expected. India, we know, is a long haul kind of thing, an immense market. But we're not ever going to start doing anything big there quickly because the microeconomics are just too tiny. So there's a little bit of flavor across three or four, and I'm probably giving Jim Gustafson a heart attack by providing all this.","Ryan Newman - Promus Capital","Yeah. That's great. Thanks, guys, for the detail and I appreciate your time.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we no longer have further questions on queue.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the Capital Markets are May 18. Correct, Jim?","Jim Gustafson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yes.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In New York, we're going to nail down the location. There's a lot to talk about. We look forward to going into more detail. We're going to have a longer general session that we normally do so that we hopefully give you a very comprehensive and analytically thoughtful not only reiteration of our strategy but our progress and the right kind of leading indicators to stare at. So we're looking forward to a real high intensity extended exchange, and we'll do our best in between now and then to get through 2016, and start growing again in 2017.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to DaVita's second quarter 2018 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","Thank you. Mr. Gustafson, you may begin your conference.","Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Christine, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter conference call. We appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today are: Kent Thiry, our CEO; Joel Ackerman, our CFO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita Kidney Care; Jim Hilger, our Chief Accounting Officer; and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","Please note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainty that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainty, please refer to our first quarter earnings release of earlier today and our SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements.","Additionally, we'd like to remind you that during this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our earnings press release submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all out there on the phone for your interest in DaVita.","I'll make three quick points up front. As Javier will review, we had a strong quarters for Kidney Care operations. The second point is the DMG sale process continues to progress and is on track to close this year. And number three is we've deployed significant cash towards share repurchases during the quarter.","However, as we are first and foremost a caregiving company, I will start our call, as always, with clinical results. Infection is one of the leading causes of hospitalizations in our population. In the second quarter, we delivered the lowest infection rate since we started tracking these rates. For our in-center patients, the bloodstream infection rate actually decreased by 9% year over year, outpatients even better as the peritonitis improved \u2013 decreased by 19% year over year. This is not only an unambiguous example of quality improvement on the clinical side, it also leads to a dramatic improvement in quality of life and lower costs for the system.","And on that happy note, I will turn things over to Javier.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you, Kent, and good afternoon.","The second quarter was strong, with solid fundamentals and solid earnings growth in our dialysis business. I'll give you three high-level points on the financials, and then Joe will go into more detail.","First, normalized non-acquired growth was flat for the first quarter. Second, revenue per treatment was up slightly after adjusting for Medicare bad debt recoveries in the first and second quarter. Third, we continued to contain our costs despite wage pressure.","On today's call, I will focus on five topics. First, as you probably know, the preliminary 2019 Medicare rate was released a few weeks ago. After five years of practically no increase, we are encouraged to be back in an environment where Medicare fee-for-service rates will be growing again and help offset inflationary reality.","Second, calcimimetics, the transition from Part D to Part B reimbursement continues to go well. In the second quarter, utilization and economics look similar to the first quarter. Across our Kidney Care business, we expect the net impact of calcimimetics to be a mid-single-digit margin before our indirect costs to administer the drugs.","For the third topic, let me provide an update on the human activities and some bad public policies they're seeking to pass. There are three different issues the industry faces and that it opposes: number one, a bill in California that seeks to restrict dialysis patients' access to charitable premium assistance by creating hurdles to patients and charities and limiting the providers' reimbursement for commercial patients to Medicare rates; number two, a ballot measure in California to capture reimbursement from private payers and interferes with our contract to the benefit of private insurance; number three, we will likely face the similar ballot measure in Ohio. In the next two weeks, we will know if the Ohio measures has qualified.","The dialysis community is committed to advocating against the measures on behalf of our patients, our teammates, and our shareholders. We are working with a broad coalition of over 100 healthcare providers and patient groups to oppose these measures and intend to do whatever is necessary to educate voters on why these measures are flawed. Unfortunately, educating voters on regulations around a complex and lifesaving therapy such as dialysis will be expensive.","On to the fourth topic, GranuFlo, a jury recently handed down a negative verdict involving DaVita's use of GranuFlo, one of the components used to produce dialysis. Before I comment on the case, I want to be clear. DaVita's first priority always has been and will continue to be the care and safety of our patients. DaVita has a clear record of improving patient quality of life and reducing patient mortality over the last two decades.","Now on to the case, we do not believe the verdict is supported by the facts or the law. We will be pursuing all avenues to overturn this verdict and do not believe that the verdict will stand in its current form.","My fifth and final topic is DaVita Rx. As we talked about in the past, changes in the oral pharmacy space, including reimbursement reductions, have hurt the economics of DaVita Rx. As a result, we are looking for a new way to deliver high-quality pharmacy services to our patients in a more cost-effective manner while maintaining our medication management capabilities.","As such, we will be outsourcing the customer service and fulfillment functions of DaVita Rx. We will maintain our renal-related medication management capabilities in-house, which will help us provide differentiated integrated care to dialysis patients. And in 2019 and beyond, what remains of DaVita Rx will be accounted for as part of our U.S. dialysis and lab segment, similarly to how we handle our labs.","Let me finish by emphasizing that the underlying dialysis operations and clinical results remain strong. These results allowed us to maintain our adjusted operating income guidance range while absorbing the significant anticipated advocacy costs.","Now on to Joel for some financial details and our results.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Thanks, Javier.","Adjusted operating income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $419 million. This includes $12 million in non-recurring Medicare bad debt recoveries from prior periods relating to the change in revenue recognition standards we implemented at the beginning of 2018. This is slightly above the $6 million to $8 million we expected.","As you will recall, in Q1 we recognized $24 million from this change. We do not expect any significant prior-period revenue from this going forward. Excluding this impact, net dialysis revenue per treatment was up approximately $1 from the previous quarter. This was driven by an increase in commercial and government rates, partially offset by a seasonal decline in acute treatment mix.","Our continued strategic review of our business portfolio resulted in three changes this quarter, creating some noise in the quarter's financials. First, following up on Javier's comments on DaVita Rx, in the first half of 2018, the Rx business was approximately breakeven before intercompany management fees and excluding an $11 million charge related to write-off of assets in Q2. We expect to incur some additional charges in the remainder of the year related to this plan. These charges are excluded from adjusted operating income and guidance.","For the second half of the year, we expect to incur an adjusted loss on DaVita Rx operations of $20 million to $35 million due to duplicative costs during the transition. This loss has been reflected in our adjusted operating income guidance for continuing operations. In 2019 and beyond, we expect no significant net financial impact from DaVita Rx.","Second, we sold our remaining stake in Tandigm to Independence Blue Cross. As a result of this sale, we have recognized an after-tax gain of $19 million, which is included in our discontinued operations.","Third, we sold Paladina Health in June and recognized a one-time operating income gain of $35 million, which is excluded from our adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income guidance.","Regarding the sale of DMG, we continue to be on track to close the transaction in 2018.","For international, our adjusted operating income in the quarter was $3 million, which included a $5 million foreign exchange gain from the cash balance in our Asia-Pacific joint venture. We continue to expect to achieve breakeven adjusted operating income in late 2018 excluding any foreign exchange gains or losses. This is incorporated in our enterprise adjusted operating income guidance for 2018.","Now cash flow, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $606 million for the quarter. We continue to expect OCF from continuing operations for the year to be $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. We also expect CapEx for continuing operations for the year to be consistent with the approximately $925 million we mentioned previously.","Finally on share repurchases, through July 31, 2018, year to date we purchased approximately 15.9 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion, representing nearly 9% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. This includes approximately $500 million of stock repurchased since our last earnings call. As we said last quarter, we view this as an early deployment of the enhanced liquidity we expect later this year. On July 11, our Board of Directors approved an additional share repurchase authorization. The total amount of our repurchase authorization remaining as of July 31 was approximately $1.4 billion.","For our annual adjusted operating income guidance, we are maintaining the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, but we have now included in this guidance our expected costs associated with countering the union policy efforts.","This guidance does imply lower expected operating income in the second half of the year than in the first half. This is the result of two positive items in the first half of the year and two negative items expected in the second half. The positive items are $36 million in Medicare bad debt revenue recognized in the first half due to the implementation of the new revenue accounting standards and $17 million in DaVita Health Solutions revenue recognized in the first quarter that we do not expect to recur. The negative items are the $20 million to $35 million anticipated second half adjusted loss at DaVita Rx, and the increased advocacy costs expected in countering the union policy efforts.","We incurred some costs in the first half of the year, but we expect costs in the second half to be significantly higher and heavily weighted in the third quarter. Therefore, the fact that we are maintaining our adjusted operating income guidance range while incorporating this additional cost shows our increasing confidence in the underlying financial performance for 2018.","This change to include anticipated advocacy costs in our updated guidance also impacts our expected tax rate because these costs are not tax deductible. For the second quarter, our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita Rx from continuing operations was 29.5% in the quarter. For the full year, we now expect our effective tax rate on income attributable to DaVita from continuing operations to be 28.5% to 29.5%.","Now I will turn it over to Kent for some closing remarks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","A quick restatement of a few of the key takeaways; number one, we are experiencing a material amount of non-business external friction, particularly on the union side. Importantly, however, number two, we continue to be strategically well positioned both in the context of the current business model and for the longer term providing integrated care to kidney care patients across the country. And lastly, number three, we continue to generate strong cash flows.","And with that, operator, can we go on to Q&A please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll begin the Q&A session. And our first question in queue is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. I wanted to see about the guidance. Is it fair to say that now that your guidance includes \u2013 you actually didn't say how much the advocacy costs are going to be, but let's say $50 million of additional costs, that you're more comfortable at the low end of the guidance, or are you saying that the core business has improved through the year and you're comfortable at least at the midpoint of that guidance range?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","I guess I would say we are comfortable adding the advocacy costs and obviously bringing in a new cost and maintaining the guidance is the positive side. I would not interpret anything about where we expect to be in this guidance range relative to where we had expected to be beforehand based on the fact that the advocacy costs are coming in. Is that responsive?","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess. It's basically saying you're not going to comment. So that's fine though. I guess you mentioned the two California bills and the Ohio ballot. When we think about those things, how do you quantify the potential impact if these things were to be going through?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Kevin, we figured you'd ask the question. Unfortunately, the answer is not very satisfying because there are so many variables in play and literally every day there's a new dynamic. As you can imagine, they're all very different. But if the ballot initiative passes in California, you'll instantly have approximately 66,000 patients that are being treated in centers that mostly will be unsustainable. And so to assume that there's going to be some kind of a plan, a backup for that is just unrealistic. So then you've got to go into how would it play out and then you go into, well, okay is there going to be some intervention by policy makers to avoid a crisis and if there are some regulatory things or some legal challenges we could do, and so on and so forth. But the answer to your question is we're not going to give a number. It's too hard to do so.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, maybe you can help clarify a couple things. I've gotten questions from people about what the California ballot initiative is actually trying to do because the language says the rebates go back to the commercial payers, which some people have interpreted to mean that this 15% margin is actually tied to only commercial payers rather than the 15% margin to the site across all payers on average. Can you just clarify your interpretation of how that margin is applied?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","First of all, we've got to be careful with the phrase 15% margin because the ballot defines 115% of allowable cost, and allowable cost is poorly defined. So there's going to be a lot of debate as to what it's in it and what's not. So to assume that there's 15% margin is probably not realistic there.","As it relates to the second part of it, I think it is a rebate to the commercial patient, and that is the commercial plan. Is that the second question you were asking?","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","It's a rebate to the commercial plan, but that 15% of allowable cost, is that done at the site level across all payers that includes Medicare and Medicaid, or is it only applied to your commercial customers, which would obviously be a different thing? If you had allowable costs on Medicare, that would help. Obviously, you're not making your 15% on Medicare. And therefore, it would increase the overall profits of the facility rather than if you were only to apply that to the commercial side of things.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Right, so it's on all costs to all payers the de facto because Medicare is in essence the low cost in many instances. You really are thinking about the commercial payers.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, okay, that's how we're thinking about it. And then I guess the last question then, on the bill that's being debated in California, how do you think about \u2013 you guys have quantified some impacts before about \u2013 if CP-8 were to go away. How do you think about that I guess, in rough terms? Would that be similar to the gross impact exposure weighted by the California exposure of that, or do you think that it would be the net number you say that there would be offsets and the number is closer to $100 million? The $250 million is more the way to think about California being 20% of that is just order of magnitude on that.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","Unfortunately, the math is not straightforward on the numbers that we gave you in the past and this one because if you look at the bill, it could effectively eliminate charitable assistance for dialysis patients because it's got inconsistencies between the bill and the OIG guidance relating to the dialysis charity assistance. So it could literally result in disproportionately hurting low income population. And so then you have to go into how would that population behave, what plan would they pick, what's happening with our competitors, are they having less capacity in their centers? So are patients having to in essence go deeper into their pocketbook because they don't want to be displaced, et cetera? So again, SB 1156 is quite dynamic and keeps changing. And every time it changes it introduces a new twist, but the math is not intuitive at that level that you have.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Actually I lied, one more question. Given these three things, I'm a big fan of you guys buying back stock in advance of DMG closing if you've got good visibility on that closing. But I guess how did you think about buying back stock in front of these three things? I guess any one of these things could be meaningful to the company. So how do you think about valuing the company given those potential risks? And that's it, thanks.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","It's a tough question to answer, Kevin, given the uncertainty that these three things create looking forward, but we stuck to our principles, which were looking at the long-term intrinsic value of the company and using that as well as a number of items to decide the pace at which we want to buy, which is obviously influenced by the DMG closing and our not wanting to have to accumulate rapidly during some artificially high stock price. So you put that all in the mix, and that's where we came out in terms of our buyback for the quarter.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just as we were looking at the RPTs less patient care cost per treatment, I guess a measure of gross profit per treatment, it looks like the margin was down about 300 bps year on year just on that measure. And I'm just curious to understand if there's anything to spike out there and whether there has been any change on the calcimimetics side, either from a reimbursement or margin standpoint versus Q1?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, so a few things. Obviously, you've going to back out all the noise. Two things to point out, one is the 401(k), which was an artificial improvement to 2017. So that would probably be the single biggest thing to call out looking at how to adjust year-over-year margins.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it, okay. So I was actually going to ask you about that too. And is that still consistent with the $100 million for the year, and is that ratable exactly?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","I'm sorry, I didn't hear the second part of the question. Is that?","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","The guidance for the 401(k) headwind was $100 million for the year, if I recall. I'm just trying to check the cadence of that and if it's still similar to where you expected it'd be?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yes, it is, and it's relatively flat across the year. So there's not a lot of quarterly variation in that.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And then just secondly, just on the G&A line, it looked well controlled, at least relative to how we modeled it. Is there anything unusual to break out there, or is that a good run rate to use going forward?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","The best thing to do is to look at it as an annual number, and there's not much to report on that.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it, okay. And just lastly for me, I just wanted to clarify the comments on Ohio. It sounded like you said the ballot measure has qualified. Is that the case? It seems like there's news reports out that suggest maybe it is not.","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","No, I apologize if that's what you heard. We will find out on August 13, I believe, if it qualifies, so in the next couple weeks.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it, okay, so still uncertain. Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon, good evening. I just want to go back to Kevin's question on the OI guide, obviously very good that you can absorb all these incremental costs. You gave us the DaVita Rx number. Can you give us a ballpark ballot cost estimate, or is that just too competitive and you want to keep that out of the call?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","You're correct, we'd like to keep it out.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you for asking and answering. I like that.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Well, you guys are teaching me, I am trainable. So the second thing \u2013 so it's August 1 and you've still got $100 million wide guidance range. I would think there's more visibility in the business there, so I don't think it's unreasonable to ask. Where do you think within that range, the higher? I know you have a history of doing the higher end. Where within that guidance range do you think you're more likely to fall, probabilistically, of course?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, so I think the reason the range remains so wide is advocacy that is contributing to an uncertainty that remains at this stage in the year. In terms of where in the range, I think we're just comfortable with the range, and we'll let it play out.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Maybe for this quarter, can you tell us where you were? It certainly looked like it was ahead of my estimates and I think consensus in terms of OI. Can you tell us how it looked relative to your internal expectation?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","We don't guide quarterly, and I don't think we're going to comment quarterly on where we came out relative to internal expectations. We're going to stick with guiding for the year. We think that gives you the visibility that we can offer.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, I'll ask one more. Can you tell us why the tax rate is up 200 basis points?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yes, it's the expected non-deductibility of our advocacy costs that we expect to pay in the balance of the year \u2013 or to spend in the balance of the year.","Justin, I misspoke in the script. I think I said I was \u2013 I referenced the tax associated with DaVita Rx. That was just a foot fault. I just meant DaVita, in case that wasn't clear. But yes, the 200 basis points is from the advocacy, which is not deductible.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, so the tax rate for next year, as long as there's no advocacy cost, would revert back to your original guidance. So this is a one-time charge?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Depending on how you view advocacy going forward, yes, it not a fundamental change to the tax rate.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Frank Morgan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, I guess I'll follow up on Kevin's question earlier about buybacks. Clearly, $1.4 billion left under your existing program, if I heard you correctly, in light of what's ahead of you with both the ballot initiative and this SB 1156, what is your appetite now for further purchases ahead of the outcome of those two events?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Frank, we have been comfortable communicating our strategy about buybacks, but we're very reluctant to comment about what we're going to do in any given period. It's not something we want to signal. We don't want to drive the stock up artificially and then feel compelled to buy into that. So we will continue with our buyback strategy, but I don't have any particular color for you in the next quarter or so leading up to be the ballot initiative.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","No change in cash flow from ops guidance absorbing those advocacy costs, any changes in your outlook for CapEx in terms of just looking at free cash flow?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","No, still the $925 million number we've given in the past is still a good number.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then final question, just any updates, any thoughts around the patient, any timing there or updated thoughts from a regulatory or a legislative perspective? Thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","This is KT. The short answer is it's still the case that we have a real shot. We need the CBO score. And if that comes out at a reasonable level, we have a real shot. We didn't bring it up proactively because we figure many of you are sick of hearing that paragraph. But it's still for us very, very alive, and every week we cross our fingers and hope for the CBO score.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from John Ransom of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. I'm next to a very chatty and loud Southwest gate agent, so sorry for the background noise if there is any, two quick questions for me. As you think about CapEx after this year, have you done any more analysis of the relationship of CapEx and growth? Is there a way you could bracket expectations for next year, or is it too early to do that?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","So for next year, we are comfortable saying that we will head back down to a number that's more closely aligned with our 2017 number, and that our view is that 2018 had a couple of things worth roughly $100 million that were unusual, and those will go away, so, something in the low $800 million.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, so that's roughly \u2013 that's almost 2x your depreciation. Is that just the permanent plateau, no matter what?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Hold on one second.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Why don't you give us a few minutes to reflect on the question and see we can come back in a satisfactory way?","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","It just seems like a big number, but...","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Let me take it.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Sure.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","The $800 million \u2013 I'm sorry, John. The $800 million is \u2013 I wouldn't call it a new plateau. It's definitely tied to our growth. Remember, most of that is not maintenance CapEx, it's development CapEx. We are thinking about ways to get the number down both through small initiatives around lower cost to build de novos, in lowering our IT spend and stuff like that, as well as some larger ideas that I mentioned briefly on the call last quarter. That said, I don't think we're prepared to guide to any trend on the number ahead of what we've said about 2019.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, fair enough. And secondly, the pharmacy initiative, I know you've called out some losses for the back half of the year. When do you think that transition will be done, and what would be good expectations for the ongoing contribution of the business?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","The transition will be in Q3, maybe it slips a little into Q4, and the economics post that in 2019 will be irrelevant.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So it would go from losing what you're saying to basically breakeven or off the P&L. Is that a way to think about it?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","That's a good way to think about it.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So it's a good guess. So I asked about the pharmacy I think last call or two calls ago, and you guys were pretty adamant that it was a strategic asset that you wanted to keep. So what changed in the last two quarters that made you change your mind?","Javier J. Rodriguez - DaVita, Inc.","It's mainly a revenue change, John. So we've had a couple of contractual changes in a drug that has the potential of being generic for quite some time. It went generic, and it went generic, and the pricing was quite rapid, the decrease in pricing. So the combination of several revenue hits made the decision, while painful, the right one.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, fair enough. Thank you, that's all I have.","Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Good morning, really, good afternoon. Just a question, I know you had said on calcimimetics, it was essentially similar contribution as the first quarter. In the first quarter, you said it was $19 revenue per treatment. Would you be more precise? Is it right on $19, is it different...","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, it's about $19, no material change.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And it looks like there was almost $10 million of equity investment income, a line item that usually is not material, contributing to the operating income. What was driving that figure?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","We are taking a look, Gary.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, I think it was $9.795 million.","Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.","And, Gary, could you even talk a tad louder?","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Oh, yes, I'm sorry.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, Gary, I'll remind you that the APAC joint venture we have is an equity investment, and the foreign exchange swings related to that come through that equity line.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","You had called \u2013 I think you said that FX was $5 million, so about half of it. So is it fair to think that line is probably a few million dollars a quarter, but not necessarily $10 million or...?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","I think you should expect that to swing around and not contribute in either direction over any sustained period of time.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, just two more quick ones. It looks like ancillary $7 million loss in the 1Q added \u2013 it was a positive $3 million in the 2Q, I don't think that was DaVita Rx yet. So was there something driving that?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","I'm sorry, you're asking about the ancillary line?","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, where you give operating income, I think it was negative $7 million negative in the 1Q and it was plus $3 million this quarter, so about a $10 million sequential good guy?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, there's some noise in that line. I think in Q1 it had the DHS number, which was a $17 million good guy. In Q2, it had the Paladina write up, which was a $35 million good guy.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, might have to follow on that one.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Oh yeah, and Q2 also had the Rx minus $11 million running through that line.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, I might have to follow up because it's better, so I'm not sure I understand all that, but I won't tie up folks. Just last question is, so I follow your math on if you take the first quarter revenue per treatment less the $24 million Medicare bad debt recovery in the 2Q, $352 per treatment less the $12 million Medicare recoveries puts your normalized revenue per treatment up about $1 sequentially from 1Q to 2Q. But you said that increase was related to commercial and government rates, so I just wanted to make sure I understand that. I don't think there would be a lot changing on the government rate side intra-year. It may be some intra-year commercial. I guess generally I'd consider maybe there's just some fluctuation of mix, but I wanted to make sure I was understanding that properly.","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yeah, there is some \u2013 within the government line, remember, Medicare fee-for-service is not our only government payer. There's Medicare Advantage. There's Medicaid fee-for-service and managed Medicaid. So as mix shifts between those buckets, you can see some shifts in the RPT.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, that's all I had.","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next one is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks, a few more questions. You said the DMG sale process is on track. Is there anything further you can share with us? For instance, what might be left to do here when you met the second request, so we can understand the clock a little bit, anything?","Kent J. Thiry - DaVita, Inc.","Really not much to add, both parties are working to get it closed in 2018.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, anything on commercial mix in the quarter in terms of up, down, or it continues to be pretty steady?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Nothing to call out, Justin.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then on share repo, I just ran some back of the envelope numbers, and you bought back 16 million shares. I think we're pulling up about a little over 200 million shares have traded year to date. So you guys have been responsible for about 7.5% of the volume. I'm just curious if that's \u2013 is that the gating factor to the percentage of volume you can be out there? Is that the gating factor to what you've bought, or is that 7.5% number \u2013 I'm just trying to think about looking ahead and the timing of share purchases going forward, or is that just there's no really rhyme or reason to it and don't use that 7.5% as a proxy?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","I would not use that as a proxy for what we can buy. What percentage of the volume we are does affect our thinking at times. But I wouldn't say over the course of the quarter or the year to date, that's been a driving factor in how we think about buybacks.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then lastly, I just want to confirm. When I asked about the tax rate going up 200 basis points, you had indicated that most if not all of that is coming from the lack of deductibility of advocacy costs. Is that correct?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yes.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","So that didn't have to do with DaVita Rx or anything else, right?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","No, there are other small things related to the change in the tax law that will flow through that, but it's largely related to advocacy.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Because I think what's going to \u2013 what people are going to do is put two and two together here and basically you can math into how much advocacy costs have to be then to drive a 200 basis point change in your tax rate?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","Yes, the old rate was a range and the new rate is a range, but I get the math you want to do.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","I'm picking up $75 million, and I only say that because I'm sure everybody is going to do it. Is that a number that you'd want to walk us up or down on?","Joel Ackerman - DaVita, Inc.","We don't want to comment on what we are going to spend.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, that's it for me. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And that's the last question in queue at this time.","Jim Gustafson - DaVita, Inc.","All right, thanks, everyone, for your interest.

Sir, you may begin.","Jim Gustafson - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, JR, and welcome everyone to the DaVita HealthCare Partners' First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I appreciate your continued interest in our company. I'm Jim Gustafson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Kent Thiry, our CEO; Javier Rodriguez, CEO of DaVita of Kidney Care; Vijay Kotte, Chief Financial Officer of HealthCare Partners; Jim Hilger, our Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer and LeAnne Zumwalt, Group Vice President.","I'd like to start with our forward-looking disclosure statements. During this call we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason.","Additionally, I would like to remind you that during this call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our Form 8-K submitted to the SEC and available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kent Thiry, our Chief Executive Officer.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Jim, and welcome to all. In the quarter, we delivered solid operating income and strong cash flow. The total adjusted operating income, as you've seen in the release, $458 million, and the operating cash flows of $429 million.","In the course of this call, before Q&A, we'll cover clinical outcomes; we'll talk about U.S. Kidney Care; we'll provide an international update, including talking a little about the deal announced today; we'll cover HealthCare Partners results, HealthCare Partners we now refer to as the DaVita Medical Group; and then we'll provide a few additional financial details.","As to clinical outcomes, we'll discuss them first, as we always do, because that is what comes first. We are, first and foremost, a care-giving company. And the Kidney Care side is where we'll focus our clinical comments on this call. We'll probably rotate back and forth between the various parts of the enterprise each quarter.","We have about 178,000 dialysis patients now in the U.S. That's about 35% of all the patients in the U.S. And from a vaccination point of view, our outcomes relative to the community are very strong; pneumonia vaccinations at 92% for patients, influenza vaccinations 92% for patients and teammate influenza vaccinations at 84%.","And as many of you know, improving performance in vaccinations also leads to fewer hospitalizations and, as always, in our areas around the enterprise, our improved clinical outcomes are also very good for the taxpayer.","For more color on U.S. Kidney Care financial results, let's hear from Javier Rodriguez.","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","Thank you, Kent. I'll divide my comments into two sections. First, I'll cover the quarter, and then secondly I will cover full year guidance. For the quarter, we had a strong operating income of $422 million, and let me cover some of the highlights.","Number one, normalized NAG was 4.1%, which represented continued improvement over the prior quarters, and it is consistent with our guidance that we gave last year for three years of 3.5% to 4.5%. Our rate per treatment increased by $2.34 per treatment and it was mainly driven through higher acute mix and improved commercial mix.","These improvements were partially offset by fewer treatment days which is normal in Q1, and as a reminder, the quarter benefited from an extra day due a leap year, and seasonally higher cost in treatment number one, primarily due to higher personnel costs from payroll taxes and higher pharma costs from seasonally higher Epo utilization due to the delay of the flu. Happy with the quarter.","Our guidance for Kidney Care remains unchanged at $1.625 billion to $1.75 billion. And as always, our range in total captures the majority of the probabilistic outcomes and based on where we are today, we are more likely to be on the top half of the guidance range.","The primary reason for leaving our guidance unchanged is driven by some economic uncertainties surrounding the exchange plans of the ACA. Let me summarize with four points on our experience on the ACA.","Number one, it is working for patients. Americans who otherwise would not have insurance are now insured. Number two, many people are far better insured and have better coverage than they had before including many of our patients that are benefiting from the insurance coverage.","Number three, the regulatory environment around exchanges is still being built. While many payers are living up to the spirit of the ACA, others are changing their fine print in their plan designs to avoid paying for expensive chronic diseases either by cost shifting to the patient or by making the plans unattractive for the expense of chronically ill in other ways. It might be helpful to give an example. We had in one state a plan that tried to limit dialysis benefits and shifted significant economic responsibility to the patient, which as many of you know, these patients can clearly not afford. Once we alerted the regulatory agencies, the plans were instructed to remedy their behavior.","That being said, we're seeing more effort by some of the payers to improve their economics in the exchange plan by making it more difficult for dialysis patients to enroll. This is a complicated issue which will require regulatory environment. As you know, it happens to be a tough year because of the election and many are distracted. Therefore, the dynamics around enforcement are hard for us to predict.","I'll state the obvious. Patients and providers will continue to work with regulators as this unfolds. Lastly, as you know, not unique to us, there are larger macroeconomics and political risks that are clouding the future of the exchanges. Therefore, it's hard to handicap with certainty how this will play out for us. We will talk about some of these issues in our longer term outlook in two weeks as we see you in Capital Markets.","So I'll pass it back to you, Kent.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks, JR. I'm going to cover international now. The losses, as you've seen, were $10 million in the quarter and this is in line with our guidance of approximately $40 million on the year. The most noteworthy new news on the international front is our definitive agreement to form a joint venture to grow our Kidney Care business in Asia with two partners, Khazanah and Mitsui. Khazanah is a highly respected sovereign wealth fund of the Government of Malaysia with an investment portfolio greater than $30 billion. And Mitsui, as many of you know, one of the largest and oldest business groups in Japan, with about $45 billion in annual revenue, and they recently designated healthcare as a key strategic domain for themselves corporately going forward.","They're both experienced in healthcare already and are value-added partners for us, not just investors. One of their noteworthy successes in the Asian healthcare scene is they have a majority stake \u2013 approximately, a 60% stake in IHH Healthcare, which many don't realize is the second largest hospital company in the world by market cap. Their market cap is about $13 billion at this point, and we're very excited to have them as our partners.","The financial terms, just at a summary level, each of Khazanah and Mitsui will invest $150 million over the next few years, and each will receive in return a 20% ownership stake. We will, of course, still be the majority owner, therefore, and we will be running the enterprise with them as our very active partners.","Just to give you a sense of the current scope of the business, we have 64 clinics that serve about 3,300 patients across five countries in that part of the world. The definitive agreement is subject to a few closing conditions. So it could take some time to complete, but all three parties are working to make that happen as soon as is possible.","And now let's turn to what has historically been called HealthCare Partners but is now, at least internally, referred to as the DaVita Medical Group, Vijay Kotte, the Chief Financial Officer.","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","Thanks, Kent. We'll first start with a review of the HCP Q1 performance. Operating income for the quarter adjusted for the $77 million goodwill impairment and the $16 million Nevada hospice reserve gets us to $36 million on a non-GAAP basis. Included in the $36 million are approximately $9 million of one-time costs. When adjusted for these one-time costs, we get a normalized operating income of $45 million for the quarter.","One question you will likely ask is to reconcile this with the first quarter of last year. To do this, we start with 2015 Q1 OI of $60 million, subtract one-quarter of the $58 million in MA and Medicaid rate cuts we had previously disclosed or $15 million, and that gets you to $45 million, demonstrating a relatively flat underlying performance year-over-year.","Now let's break down some of the drivers of performance for the quarter. There're some good things and some bad things. We'll start with the bad things. In addition to the rate cuts, Medicare Advantage enrollment in our legacy geographies grew less than in prior years and we grew in line with our geographies. Additionally, our commercial membership continues to decline with the market.","Now let's turn to some good stuff. We continue to close transactions. Earlier in the quarter we closed on the Everett Clinic, a nationally recognized physician group that has over 500 clinicians across 20 plus clinics, serving over 300,000 patients with an expected annual revenue of over $400 million.","In addition, within our existing geographies, we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities including a number of small tuck-ins as well as a few larger acquisitions in process. One example is our prior announcement of our intent to combine with Mountain View Medical Group, which has 50 clinicians across 14 clinics serving over 80,000 patients which, if closed, will strengthen our already healthy capabilities in Colorado Springs. As we have said before, we continue building capabilities. Here are a couple of examples, one clinical and one operational.","On the clinical side, we're expanding our very successful home care program from other geographies to Nevada, focusing on the needs of our high risk patients in order to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations and re-admissions.","On the operational front, we're centralizing national operations and expect to realize savings from scale and vendor consolidation.","To remind you, there has been a significant transformation of the leadership team and that group is picking up new momentum every month. The progress on all these activities, we have a good shot at adding approximately $30 million to OI in the remaining three quarters of 2016, above the Q1 normalized rate of $170 million, bringing us to approximately $200 million for the year, the midpoint of our guidance range. So we are maintaining our guidance range of $175 million to $225 million, although we acknowledge that achieving the high end may be less likely. We'll provide more details on our ongoing investments and operational capabilities and our longer term outlook at Capital Markets Day in two weeks.","Now I'll turn it over to Jim Hilger.","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","Thanks, Vijay. In regards to the overall enterprise, our debt expense was $103 million in the first quarter, consistent with recent quarters. Next, the effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners was 40% in the quarter, when you adjust for the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and the HCP Nevada hospice accrual. For the full year, we now expect the 2016 effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners to be in the range of 39.5% to 40.5%.","Now turning to cash flow. We continued to generate strong cash flows. Operating cash flow was $429 million in the first quarter and on an adjusted basis $1.88 billion for the 12 months. As we've discussed before, over time, Kidney Care contributes about 75% of our operating cash flows. HCP contributes about 25%, notably higher than its contribution percentage to our enterprise operating income.","Regarding capital deployment, during the first quarter we purchased 3.7 million shares for $249 million at an average price of $67.61, but we have not made any additional repurchases since our last earnings call. Please note that we continuously weigh capital deployment opportunities across growth investment, share repurchases, debt repayment and holding cash.","And now, finally, on to outlook, I'd just like to restate our outlook. We are still expecting our consolidated operating income for 2016 to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion. We expect our operating income for Kidney Care to be in the range of $1.625 billion to $1.725 billion, and we expect income for HCP to be in the range of $175 million to $225 million. And our operating cash flow expectation is in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion. As always, these guidance ranges capture a majority of the probabilistic outcomes that we can foresee.","And, with that, operator, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from the line of Mr. Kevin Fischbeck. Sir, your line is open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks. Can you talk a little about the $9 million of one-time costs in HCP, what that was related to?","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","Sure. The one time costs, Kevin, were related to three primary things. One was the move of our California headquarters. Two is some compensation related accruals and the third is just some expense true-ups for prior periods.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then you guys earlier kind of quantified the 2017 MA rate headwind of $25 million. I guess how do you think about offsetting that and any kind of tailwinds you think about into next year versus this year?","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","We're not going to give full 2017 guidance or that information, but related to the rate headwinds themselves there are some things related to the health insurer tax that will give some tailwinds but not enough to overcome those headwinds. And beyond that, we'll give more detail of our operational expectations and similar other things at Capital Markets in a couple of weeks.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Actually I was the health insurance fee, is that explicitly built into your contracts as a flow-through or is that something that you have to go back and kind of renegotiate as an offset?","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","It varies by contract and so we've already addressed it with most of our payers.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then I guess maybe last question, I guess as far as Epo costs for the year, I guess Amgen was pushing through a rate increase on Epo and then encouraging people to move over to Aranesp. Any thoughts there about how you guys are dealing with that? Is that the move that you've done or do you expect Epo pressure through the year?","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","LeAnne, would you like to go ahead and take that one please.","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs","Yes and you may need to clarify if I don't answer your question correctly. As it relates to Epogen pricing, we did not experience a price increase this year. So I don't know if that answers your question or you referred to Aranesp?","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess my understanding was that Amgen was trying to move people to the longer-lasting Epo product, generally speaking maybe your contract might be different than others, but I wasn't sure if that was something that you guys were looking to do and whether that was going to be a cost advantage to you under your contract this year.","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs","We certainly use some Aranesp now in the population and we use both products. They are both very clinically appropriate for patients. And so we just use whichever the physician is ordering at this point in time and there's not a contractual difference.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs. Sir, you line is open.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Just first question I was curious, your perspective on the slowdown. I realize it's a much broader dynamic than just DaVita Medical Group, but the slowdown in Medicare Advantage enrollment, and if there is anything that the DaVita Medical Group physicians are seeing on the frontlines that might help inform what's going on?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","At this point, we don't have a good sense of what 2017, 2018, 2019 are going to look like. We still think Medicare Advantage is going to be growing in our markets as in the country overall. We and a lot of other people continue to add more services and capabilities that will fuel that fire.","At the same time, if the payers decide in any given period to leave benefits stagnant or in fact even pull back a little bit, that has a big impact. And so we remain very bullish on fundamental growth. But at this point, the notion of sort of guesstimating what's going to happen in 2017 and 2018, we're not feeling certain enough to add any value there.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. That makes sense. And I'm just curious, when the Medical Group sees MA patients, is there any distinction in terms of the financials, if that's an employer group MA member or a regular, I guess, you'd say, retail MA member?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Can you restate the question, Matthew? I'm not understanding it.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, I guess, you think about the major Medicare Advantage plans, they typically have \u2013 for every 800 individual MA members, they maybe have another 200 that come from employer groups that are doing retiree coverage. It's all Medicare Advantage. I'm just wondering if there is any distinction that the Medical Group sees in terms of the financial arrangements, risk-taking arrangements between group and individual.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, we have not seen anything significant in that vein.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And you don't really know how many is one or the other, is that correct?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I don't think we have anything useful to say about this, Matthew, but by Capital Markets, if there is anything useful to say, we'll be prepared to say it.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That sounds great. Just one last question. On the ACA Exchange plan dynamic, can you give us some sense of how to think about what the numbers are? In other words, I wouldn't think the numbers would be very big in terms of your overall patient base, but is there a higher concentration relative to, say, how the ACA Exchange enrollment compares to the overall insured population?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me take a stab at that, Matthew, and then you tell me if I'm hitting the right thing. Exchanges are a tiny percentage of what we're about. At the same time, when we have exchange business that's private insurance, that is additive in the same way that our private insurance patients are in general, since as you know, the 10% or so of patients we have are private subsidize the 90% that are government on which we lose money on the margin. And so exchanges are a tiny percentage but just like with the rest of private pay, little movements add up.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And have you ever contemplated starting your own exchange plans to get around the problems that you have had with the payers?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Up to this point, we have not.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you, Matthew.","Operator","Thank you. At this point, I would like to open the line for Mr. Gary Lieberman.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I was going to make a joke, but I decided not to. Host is going to say, oh, well.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Matt?","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hello, I thought someone is going to make a joke there for a second.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Matt, we want to hear the joke.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Sorry, I don't have any jokes for anybody. Maybe talk about the joint venture and kind of the expectations for growth and maybe some of the startup losses that we should expect.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry, Gary, there is still some noise on this end. Could you go you ahead and repeat the question. My bad.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Maybe talk about the joint venture a little bit and the expectation for growth and what if any startup losses we would expect to see from it.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we are still losing money in the Asia market and that's not going to change in the near term because if anything, the addition of these two partners is going to accelerate some of our growth, which in the short term could actually increase our losses, kind of depends which countries we're growing the most in. So I don't know how much useful I can say beyond that but go ahead and fire off another question if you'd like.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess in terms of \u2013 a little different topic. Just foreign exchange rates, any thoughts there? They've been somewhat volatile. Any plans to hedge them or is it too small to really worry about it?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Up to this point we've done little or no hedging. We're paying a lot of attention but the numbers are so small and in particular, given we're spread across 10 different countries, 11 different countries and you kind of do the math, it just isn't that helpful at this point. But we're making sure we're talking to people who are more thoughtful and sophisticated than we are and trying to figure out exactly when we should start doing more of that.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. On to the ESAs, is it possible for you to tell us what percentage of patients are currently using Aranesp?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs","I can answer that. We're predominantly an Epo shop, though it's quite small.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is it the 10% that you're allowed to use other ESAs or does that not count, I guess, if it's Aranesp?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs","Yeah, Aranesp does not count against us.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then the pricing \u2013 the lack of pricing increase on Epo, does that have something to do with you moving some number of patients on to Aranesp?","LeAnne M. Zumwalt - Group Vice President-Purchasing and Public Affairs","No. No, that's not the case. And since I have the floor here, I'm being corrected that we did take a 1% price increase in January. So I apologize for that mistake.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Okay, that's all I have for right now. Thanks a lot.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ms. Margaret Kaczor of William Blair. Ma'am, the line is open.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. First question from me...","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi Margaret.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","There is a lot of moving pieces in HCP, and I'm sure you'll address a lot of them at your Capital Markets Day in a few weeks. But, that said, as you look at HCP and its trajectory really over the next couple of weeks, how important is that patient and revenue growth compared to that profitability improvement and where do you see that going? Can the newer market revenues exceed the legacy markets, since those appear to be slowing, and can those legacy markets even reaccelerate from here?","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","Yeah. A very fair question and certainly we're going to hit that hard in the Capital Markets, or at least to the best of our ability. We do think in a couple of our new markets the growth prospects over the next two years, three years on revenue, EBITDA and OI basis is material.","But at the same time we actually have a lot of growth opportunities in the three inherited markets. And so which has more potential, I think we'd probably say they're pretty equivalent and if anything, the legacy markets have more. But it'd be nice to see them in a bit of a race.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And just to maybe pick a little bit more at that. We saw the senior revenues in the mid single-digit range in 2015. But as we look out again over that two-year to three-year time horizon, what would you be with happy with seeing in terms of that kind of new patient growth as well as the revenue growth?","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","Okay. What would we be happy to see? I would you say if you give us the gift of reflecting on that, we're going to talk about the range that we expect to see at Capital Markets, and then maybe address the happiness thing. But we'll definitely give you our sense of the range of likely outcomes here in a couple of weeks.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Fair enough. And then, on the Kidney Care side, the number of clinics that you guys are opening are growing a little bit faster than they have been the last few quarters and rightfully so. But should we expect a similar pace of net new centers opening throughout 2016 as you guys catch up with those longer approval time frames from last year? So are you going to reach 120 new clinics for the year? And how quickly can these new clinics help get your NAG back up to that 4.5% or maybe even higher over the near term?","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","I'll turn that one over to Javier.","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","Thank you. We had 30 centers open in the first quarter; our range for the year is 90 centers to 110 centers. The last part of your question on NAG, we're still comfortable with the multiyear range that we addressed earlier, so 3.5% to 4.5%.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then last one from me. How is the acquisition of Renal Ventures coming along? When should we see kind of the initial impact on results and how long is it going to take for that chain to more closely resemble maybe the financial structure of the DaVita owned clinics? Thanks.","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","JR, can you take that one please?","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","Yes, it's still going through the FTC, so the short answer is we don't know.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","Okay. Thank you, Margaret.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Gary Taylor of JPMC. Sir, your line is now open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good evening. Couple of questions. I wanted to go back to the international JV for a second and just make sure I understand what you said. Each of these investing $150 million over several years for 20%, so that was for each of those, right, so $300 million investment combined on 40% of the venture.","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","Correct.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So that implies something with an equity value of $750 million. Does DaVita make commensurate capital contribution, or is this capital light to you because you're contributing your market operational intelligence knowhow, et cetera, or what's your contribution?","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","Right. This investment will be the growth capital for the entity and what we're submitting into the partnership is the entity itself, which is the kind of things that you mentioned.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And are you contributing your existing centers in those five countries into the JV?","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","Correct. So our entire business in Kidney Care in that geographic area, that's the asset which we're contributing into the partnership. What they're contributing is the $150 million each of growth capital.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And it implies a pretty sizable capital deployment to that part of the world, I guess, compared to what you've invested thus far. So are there existing centers to acquire? Is this primarily development or will it be both?","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","It will be both, but we're expecting that more of it will be acquisition than de novo. But it almost gets difficult to use some of the labels because in some of these countries, for example, China, you could end up with deal arrangements that are kind of a hybrid.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then my other question \u2013 I just want to go back to commercial mix. I was taking notes, but I don't know if I missed those comments. Did you make a comment about commercial mix of patients, which I think was \u2013 actually grew year-over-year in 2015 for, I think, the first time in some time, so 1Q of 2016, did that change?","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","It did grow in 2015 for the first time in a long time, and so we're pretty pleased with where we are at. I think we disclosed in the 10-K a 12% mix. We're rounding up to 12%. No, we were...","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is that....","James K. Hilger - Interim CFO and Chief Accounting Officer","11% \u2013 sorry. We were 11%, rounded to 11% in 2015.","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","11% of our total patients.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","You only give us that annually, I believe; is that right?","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","That is correct. We disclose it annually.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So the commercial mix continued to improve year-over-year in 1Q of 2016 or has that leveled out?","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","We continued to improve in the quarter.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And is most of that \u2013 is that improvement being driven by exchanges or...?","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","That is a portion of the improvement. The improvement we've seen over a multiple-quarter period is in part due to exchanges and in part due to improving economy and in some cases it's difficult to discern which is where. We know where the exchanges are but there also is some cannibalization.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Obviously a powerful trend, though. My last question. What \u2013 and I have a feeling maybe I'll get kicked down the curb a couple weeks here to Capital Markets, but what is your average commercial rate increase you're expecting for 2016 that's baked into guidance?","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","Yeah. We will go over our expectations on the RPT side at Capital Markets. And we may or may not get quite to that level of granularity. But, as always, we'll give you a three-year outlook on what we think about RPT or revenue per treatment.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this point I would like to open the line for Ms. Lisa Clive of Bernstein. Ma'am, you may begin with your question.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three for you. First of all, sorry if you I missed the details on this, but could you give us some color on the accrual for HCP, the hospice business in Nevada and am I right, this is about $16 million?","Second, on dialysis, could you comment on the ESCO program and your experience with it so far? I believe you have something like 3,000 patients or 4,000 patients and according to your competitor, Medicare has just recently suggested the program could be expanded. Would you want to participate on a larger scale, or if not, why not?","And then lastly, looking further in integrated care, FMC has actually just started a Medicare Advantage Dialysis SNP. Could you comment on what your integrated care platform looks like beyond ESCO and if you have any initiatives ongoing to grow this?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Let's go ahead and start with the first one. Go ahead, Vijay.","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","Yes. So on the hospice, it's related to the Nevada hospice business. The reserve is for damages and liabilities associated with our potential eligibility determinations that majority of which predates our acquisition of that business in 2013.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And let's go ahead and we can always come back to that, Lisa, but let's go ahead and hit the second question on ESCOs and, Javier, you want to hit that, please.","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","Sure. We have about 4,000 patients in our ESCOs right now. It covers four states, three markets and it's too early to tell how these are going to turn out in our excitement on expansion or not. We've only been at it for a couple months so it's too early to go through that. As it relates to the C-SNPs, we now have five C-SNPs and we continue to find it a good growth vehicle that is really great for integration of transitions of care for the patient. So we'll continue to grow on that side.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Sorry. Are those C-SNPs, are you partnered with insurers on that or is that something you're doing unilaterally?","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","We do have partnerships.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And maybe, Lisa, I'll add a couple of comments on some of these items. Kent Thiry here. First, regarding integrated care beyond ESCOs, we remain as intensely positive about that as we have been for years and think that more and more payers as well as more people in Congress are starting to understand the clinical and economic upside. And so we will continue to push integrated care outside of ESCOs, both for private pay and for Medicaid and for Medicare.","It's impossible to predict when there might be an inflection point, but certainly we're in a lot higher quality conversations and doing a lot more deals of different sorts with payers now than any time before. And then going back to the hospice, we necessarily have to be pretty circumspect there because there's some active litigation, which is why our commentary is quite sketchy.","Lisa Bedell Clive - Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd.","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from the line of Mr. Whit Mayo of Robert Baird. Sir, your line is open.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","For treatment and dialysis, it's trended a lot better than I would have thought for a much longer period of time. Can you remind me just what's driving that improvement and how long we can expect to see those declines?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Whit, the first part of your question for some reason, the phone cut off. And so we only heard the last half. Could you redo it please?","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. The question was just the G&A trends in dialysis, it's just trended much more favorably than we thought. I just wanted to know what's driving that and how long we can continue to see improvement?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I can tell you it's driven by excellent work by Javier and his team, but I'll let him complete the answer. JR?","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","Yes. And unfortunately less powerful, but due to some seasonality we expect G&A to be flat year-over-year.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","On a dollar basis or per treatment?","Javier J. Rodriguez - Chief Executive Officer, Kidney Care","Per treatment basis.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And on HCP, I think you referenced in the last quarter that we should anticipate about $10 million of incremental investments this year. Is there any update around that number and does that include any of the corporate changes, relocating the corporate headquarter that you referenced in your prepared remarks?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry, could you do that one again?","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I'm sorry. Last quarter you communicated that we should expect about $10 million of incremental investments into HCP, I wanted to know if that was still the right number for 2016 and does it include the corporate headquarter change that you referenced?","Vijay Kotte - Chief Financial Officer - HealthCare Partners","So, one, it did not include the corporate headquarters and what we had planned to invest are still in our plans. There's no significant changes to that. They were intended to be in the later part of the year and as we continue to assess the year we'll see if that changes. But right now we have no plans to change.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And the $10 million are all investments that would be of a recurring nature.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. One last one. Just looking beyond ESAs, are there any other interesting therapies potentially coming to market, whether if there's an iron drug, vitamin D, just wondering if there are any other drugs that we haven't been paying attention to that you find to be interesting?","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think there's any right now that would affect your three-year forecast. The big variable in the near and intermediate term is what kind of partnership we establish on the ESA front, which everybody is, of course, already aware of, and we're looking forward to wrapping up a good partnership with someone. But outside of that, there's really nothing to handicap right now.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, speakers there are no additional questions in queue.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Operator, unless you've already gotten somebody else. Have you?","Operator","Right now we do not have any additional questions in queue.","Kent J. Thiry - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, we will look forward to seeing a bunch of you and talking to the rest of you at our Annual Capital Markets session where we can obviously go into all this stuff with much more intensity and analysis. So we look forward to that. Take care.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."]}}
