Horton America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States, First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Donald Tomnitz, President and CEO for D.R. Horton. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you, and good morning. Joining me this morning are Bill Wheat, Executive Vice President and CFO; Stacey Dwyer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer; and Mike Murray, Senior Vice President. As usual, before we get started, Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Some comments made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there's no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the day of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","D.R. Horton is off to a great start in fiscal 2013. This quarter, we saw a broad improvement in demand in most of our markets, which has given us the ability to raise prices in more of our communities. Both the entry-level and move-up segments of our business are strong. We're anticipating a good spring selling season and have added homes and communities to capture this increasing demand. We continue to find opportunities to expand our business in our existing markets, as well as new submarkets. We put a significant amount of capital work this quarter by increasing our investments in homes under construction, finished lots, land and land development. D.R. Horton is in the best position it has ever been in its 35-year history. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","In the first quarter, our consolidated pretax income increased 270% to $107.9 million from $29.2 million in the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of consolidated revenue, our pretax income margin was 8.5%, an increase of 530 basis points from 3.2% in the prior year quarter, reflecting significant improvement in both our homebuilding and financial services operations. Compared to the year-ago quarter, homebuilding pretax income increased to $90.2 million from $25 million and financial services pretax income increased to $17.7 million from $4.2 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.5%, which resulted in income tax expense of $41.6 million in the current quarter, compared to $1.5 million in the prior year quarter. Net income for the first quarter increased to $66.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to $27.7 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Our diluted share count this quarter included 38.6 million shares related to our convertible senior notes. We expect these shares to be included in our diluted share count in most future quarters. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Our first quarter home sales revenue increased 38% to $1.2 billion on 5,182 homes closed, up from $884.3 million on 4,118 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Home sales revenues increased by double-digit percentages in all of our operating region. Our average closing price for the quarter was $236,100, up 10% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by pricing power and a larger average home size. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","The value of our net sales orders increased 60% from last year to the increased volume in home prices. Our net sales orders increased 39% to 5,259 homes on a 9% increase in active selling communities. Our average sales price on the net sales orders of $249,900 increased 15% compared to the year-ago quarter. The average sales price on our net sales orders for the quarter increased by double-digit percentages in all of our operating regions. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 22% compared to 26% in the year-ago quarter. The value of our backlog increased 80% from a year ago to $1.8 billion with an average sales price per home of $240,400. Homes and backlog increased 62% from the prior year to 7,317 homes. Our increased backlog is providing greater visibility to our future revenues. We expect that our backlog conversion rate will continue to revert closer to historical seasonal norms. For the second quarter, we expect our conversion rate to be around 70%. We've continued to see strong sales through January. Mike?","Mike Murray","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 18.8%, up 200 basis points from the year-ago period. 170 basis points of the margin increase was due to improving market conditions resulting in reduced incentives and higher average selling prices in excess of cost increases. 40 basis points of the margin increase was due to lower amortized interest and property taxes. These increases were partially offset by a 10 basis point decrease from higher estimated costs for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenue. Our expectation for our second quarter home sales gross margin is in the high-18% range, consistent with the first quarter. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Homebuilding SG&A expense for the quarter was $140.8 million compared to $119 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A improved 200 basis points to 11.4% from 13.4%. We are leveraging our fixed cost structure, while at the same time, building our sales and production capabilities where necessary to meet increasing demands. In the second quarter of 2013, we expect our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues to continue to improve on a year-over-year basis. However, sequentially, the absolute dollars and percentage will likely be higher in the second quarter than the first quarter due to seasonal cost increases. We expect our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues to be lower throughout fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. The improvements in our gross profit and SG&A percentages, and a decrease in our direct interest expense, expanded our homebuilding pretax margins to 7.3% in the current quarter, an increase of 450 basis points from 2.8% in the year-ago quarter. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Financial services pretax income for the quarter was $17.7 million compared to $4.2 million in the year-ago quarter. 83% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. Our mortgage company handled the financing for 59% of our homebuyers this quarter with virtually all loans meeting eligibility requirements for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. FHA and VA loans accounted for 49% of our mortgage company's volume this quarter, down from 57% in the year-ago quarter. Our mortgage company's new borrowers during the quarter had an average FICO score of 717 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 90%. First-time homebuyers represented 47% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter, compared to 50% in the year-ago quarter. Mike?","Mike Murray","In September, our construction in progress and finished homes inventory increased by approximately $227 million. Our homes in inventory at the end of December totaled 14,200 homes, up 1,200 homes from last quarter and up 4,000 homes from a year ago. As of December 31, 1,200 of our homes were models, 7,400 were speculative homes and 2,400 of the specs were completed. We have positioned ourselves to capture demand during the spring selling season with robust housing inventory and increased community count. We expect our average community count for the fiscal year to increase at least 10% year-over-year. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","In our first fiscal quarter, we increased our investments in land, lots and development inventory by $613 million, as we continue to find new communities and build our lot supply to meet increasing demand. Our gross investments on land, lots and development costs during the quarter totaled $912 million, of which $340 million was to purchase finished lots, $445 million was to purchase land and $127 million was for land development costs. The majority of the land and lots we purchased were in our South Central and Southeast regions. We saw an increased number of land and lot investment opportunities this quarter from landowners who are willing to sell at attractive prices, if we're able to close the transactions by December 31, 2012. However, we expect our pace of land and lot purchases will moderate, while development spending will increase over the next few quarters. At December 31, 2012, we control approximately 177,000 lots, of which 118,000 are owned and 59,000 are options. 30,000 of our owned lots and 30,000 of our option lots are finished. The 60,000 total finished lots we control at quarter end are up 32% from a year ago. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Our total available liquidity at December 31 was $1.1 billion which included homebuilding, unrestricted cash and marketable securities of $643 million, and available capacity on our revolving credit facility of $495 million. The balance of our public notes outstanding at December 31 was $2.3 billion, and we had $100 million outstanding on our revolver at quarter end. At December 31, our homebuilding leverage ratio, net of cash and marketable securities was 33% and our gross homebuilding leverage was 40.2%. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","In closing, this first quarter which is D.R. Horton's most profitable first quarter since 2007, with $107.9 million of pretax income. All of our operating metrics improved on a year-over-year basis this quarter. The value of our sales, closings and backlog increased by 60%, 38% and 80%, respectively. Our pretax income increased 270%. Our pretax income margin increased 530 basis points to 8.5%. Our gross margin on home sales revenue increased 200 basis points. Our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues improved 200 basis points. Our land and lot position is the strongest in our 35-year history. And most importantly, we're experiencing pricing power in many of our markets for the first time in 6 years.","Finally, D.R. and I would like to personally thank all of our D.R. Horton teammates for their hard work and accomplishments. We're excited by the certainty of the start of this new upcycle and by the opportunities we see in fiscal 2013 and most importantly, beyond. Keep up the good work. Always remember, nothing happens until we make a sale, so let's go kick some tail to spring. This concludes our prepared remarks and I will host any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You've talked a lot in terms of positive commentary in terms of just the activity as of late. In recent times, your land activity has been somewhat cautious in terms of looking for land that you'd work through in, say, 12 to 18 months. How much more are you shifting the land strategy now so that you're buying land that will last for longer and will involve a lot more development activity here?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Dan, we're continuing, as I said, to add both finished lots, as well as raw land. Our underwriting criteria is still the same. We're requiring our return of cash on our land deals to be 24 months, the way that we're adding our number of lots is we're just doing more deals. But we're focused on trying to get our cash back on our land purchases within 24 months of initial purchase.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then in terms of the margins there's a comment about how margins are likely to be flat, sequentially. You also talked about how demand remained so strong. Can you provide any color in terms of just the pricing strategy or the impact of cost increases in terms of materials and such, and so what's -- how you're looking at that?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We're clearly raising prices on each and every one of our communities on a house by house, on a subdivision by subdivision basis. I think we have a good focus right now because existing homes are in low supply, and I think the quality of existing homes in the marketplace are not as good as what they once where, as well as the fact that our new home inventory is one of the lowest it's been in 5 or 6 years. So I think that's a confluence of events which is adding to our pricing power. We do have costs which are going up in some of our markets and with some of our subcontractors but clearly, our pricing power is exceeding the cost increases that we have today.","Bill W. Wheat","And just to add a couple of specifics to that, Dan. In terms of our sales price per square foot on a year-over-year basis, that's up a little over 6%. In terms of our total cost per home per square foot, that's up a little over 3%. So that differential there is what's driving our margin improvement. Clearly, our goal is to continue to drive improved margins to the extent we continue to see positive pricing dynamics, there certainly is potential our margins will continue to move upward. We took a very big step-up this quarter, sequentially, certainly, and we expect we certainly had the ability to maintain that level. And our goal is to improve it, but in terms of guidance and what we can actually see in the next quarter or so, we're comfortable saying we can maintain where we are at the high-18%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Given your -- kind of extension of the land question right before, but as I look at your regional land positions, both in terms of your options and owned land position, as well as what are talking about in terms of your finished, it seems like you're not as well represented on the coastal areas. How do you think your thought process might work in terms of shifting a conservative capital allocation to the high-cost markets, which I think are historically cyclical and can drive so much gross profit dollars? I mean, do you think you might be underrepresented in the west, let's say, as opposed to where you were in the last cycle because of your conservative land approach?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, clearly, in California we are proceeding more cautiously in that market than we have in others. And primarily, the thing that concerns us most about California is just the state of the California economy. And so as a result, we are looking -- continuing to look in California, but I would say to you that we're approaching on a cautious basis. We want to make sure the demand is there. I know that there are a number of immigrants who are still moving into California, and that's a good thing. And so as a result, I think there's good demand in most of our markets there, but it's not as widespread in California as it is in many of our other coastal markets. If you look at the Carolinas, as well as Florida, we have widespread representation in terms of all of the markets in those markets, continuing to improve. Whereas in California, it's on a more selective basis.","Bill W. Wheat","Our largest operations are in our Southeast and South Central regions and a lot of those markets are coastal markets from the coast of Texas, all the way around the Gulf Coast and including Florida.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Good. I appreciate that. And I guess, Stacey, if you could expand on your SG&A comments, it seems to me, given your backlog conversion, I mean, it seems like it's mostly flat sequential quarter. What costs are there? If you're growing your 10% -- community count about 10%, are there incremental G&A costs related to those new communities or and is it hard to find labor? What are some of the challenges you're seeing as you guys are ramping up the business?","Stacey H. Dwyer","There are minimal incremental costs associated with opening a new community. Generally, we're not doing the very, very large master plan communities which we have a lot more upfront cost and infrastructure. But as we open for sales, we're going to need to hire a sales person as we begin construction. We may be able to leverage a nearby superintendent, but quite likely be hiring another superintendent. So there's some level of overhead associated with that, but it is truly variable with the community count, which we always viewed as a positive. Just as a point of reference, from this time last year, we've increased our employee count by 700 employees, which is about a 22% increase. And that's in direct response to the increased demand we've seen for housing and the increasing communities that we've opened. So there will be an increase in SG&A expenses going forward, but we expect the revenue to fully and more than offset those expenses.","Bill W. Wheat","In terms of the comment, seasonally, second quarter versus first quarter, there are some seasonal costs that are incurred ahead of the revenue. In the second quarter, we typically will advertise a bit more in the spring season that we may turn into closings in the third quarter. So we will see more advertising expense in the second quarter, as well as payroll taxes and a few things like that, that increase when the calendar turns. We typically will see a higher level of expense in the second quarter versus the first quarter, seasonally.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Roxland with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you just go into a little more detail on what you're seeing with respect to labor costs. I know that you've mentioned in the past you have a strong labor pool to work with, but what we've been hearing is increasingly about a lot of labor shortage in various markets across the U.S. If you could go into a little bit of more color there?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, we're not actually experiencing a labor shortage that you're talking about. One of the facts are clearly, we're the largest builder and we have a major position in most every one of our markets and we have basically been the lifeline to most of our subs over the last 4 or 5 years as we've gone through the downturn, and kept many of those subcontractors in business during the lean times. So as a result, we have a very loyal subcontractor base. They're expanding their businesses as we expand. As we expand into new submarkets, we're taking most of our existing subs and they're supporting us in those new submarkets, even submarkets that are several hundred miles away from our main market. So we're very, very fortunate with our subcontractor base and it's a very loyal base and we're not experiencing shortage.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. And then just quickly, as you continue to focus on the move-up market, how should we be thinking about your land base and your approach to land acquisitions? Should we expect that you'll be putting a richer mix on a similar land base because obviously, that would benefit margins or will you be sizing the homes to larger lots?","Stacey H. Dwyer","It will be a combination. In many of our markets, with really the exclusion of California, we are zoned for a variety of floor plans. And as we see demand swing to more of a move-up buyer, we simply build more of the larger floor plans and put a higher level of amenities in those floor plans. At the same time, we are also identifying through our land acquisition processes, communities that will specifically be designed for move-up buyers, whether it's the location or the price point that we'll be targeting across the board. So it'll be a mix of increasing the home sizes in our existing communities, as well as looking at different larger sizes of lots in new communities.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And actually, we have a focus on a higher-end business line within D.R. Horton, and we're focusing on that business and growing that under a different name within D.R. Horton. And we're beginning to roll that out in major markets across the U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question I had was on the 4Q orders themselves. I think ahead of what we were looking for, and I think what most we're looking for, when you look at the acceleration from 4Q, which was around 24%, can you give us an idea if that was driven or just the year-over-year trends in general, however you want to characterize it, driven by community counts starting to turn positive year-over-year or was it all an acceleration in absorption pace? Because I believe, over the past few quarters, community count has been, and correct me if I'm wrong here, maybe at best, up just a little bit or I think going past earlier into the past year, it was even down a little bit year-over-year?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think, clearly, a lot of it had to do with the community count, but almost also, and most importantly, Mike, the fact that we were opening those communities that we had contracted for in the previous quarter or quarters. Our people have done a great job, region-by-region, of acquiring new land positions and lot positions. And a lot of those lot positions, as we told you, were finished lots. We invested $345 million last quarter in finished lots. So as a result, just the fact that we've got more flags flying and they're finished lots, and so they're coming to market a lot more quickly.","Bill W. Wheat","Just a couple of specifics. Year-over-year, our community count, average community count, was up 9% and our total sales units were up 39%. So it certainly is -- a piece of it is new communities but clearly, our absorptions are increasing as well. On a sequential basis from Q4 to Q1, our average community count is up 2%. So a slight improvement there. So clearly, any acceleration is largely being driven by improved absorptions across our communities.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Without a doubt, but thanks for the detail. The second question, on pricing trends. Don, you mentioned in your opening remarks that you're raising prices in most communities, and I was just trying to get a sense of people kind of ventured over the last quarter or 2 saying, we're raising prices in half our communities, 3\/4 [ph]. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of the broadness of that trend? And also, the degree of magnitude on average, what would you say your nominal price is going up and also how much your incentives are coming down?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, first of all, I wouldn't characterize it as we're raising our prices in most of our communities out there and -- that's a function, as I said earlier, of the low new home inventory, 4.5 months of new homes available and also, the low inventory of existing homes out there. And like I said before, and we've talked around here, the quality of those existing homes in the marketplace are low compared to what they were in the past. So as a result, I think most people or a lot of people are being driven to new home purchases.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Any granularity on the degree of magnitude?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I did -- let's say, most is more than many.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The amount of the increase?","Bill W. Wheat","Well, our overall ASP was up 10% on our closings, 15% on our sales. So clearly, it's in the double-digit range right now, in terms of the overall increase. If we're increasing in the majority of our communities and most of our communities, then clearly, that's a fairly substantial increase in our sales prices.","Mike Murray","Stacey mentioned before, that we had an increase on our revenue per square foot of about 6% for the quarter. And part of that is product mix shifting and geographic mix shifting, but part of that is our price increases as well.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think the key is we have pricing power out there today. And the pricing power, I will go back to, was being driven by the existing and new home inventories being at 5 or 6 year lows.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just sticking with that pricing power commentary and maybe thinking a little bit longer term, and there are some out there that believe the lack of available land, the finished lots could be a bottleneck and could drive margins higher through the cycle than maybe you've seen previously. So I was wondering what your thoughts on what maybe industry margins will look like as we march back to the magical 1.5 million starts number.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, first of all, we do not have an issue with finding land and lot deals. We are a major player in most every one of our markets, and we're an early player in most every one of our markets and began buying lots before the other competitors did. So as a result, people keep talking about the difficulty associated with doing new land deals and new lot deals. We are simply not finding that. We have a lot of deals coming through here in each and every division, in each and every market.","Bill W. Wheat","And clearly, we see some very good opportunities here in the near term over the next few quarters to able to drive margins, to be able to drive pricing. Where that goes longer term, we don't really have a view on that because I think there's a lot of question marks around where it could go.","Stacey H. Dwyer","And there's a lot of differences by geographies as well. So you could see some strong margin appreciation in certain markets that may be more a lot constrained, whereas other markets wouldn't see that same level of margin appreciation.","Donald J. Tomnitz","We're going to walk before we run. We're focusing on, obviously, our gross margins. We're 18.8% this past quarter, up 200 basis points and we're working toward our goal, company goal, of trying to achieve 20% gross margins across the board.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So what would be your -- philosophically, what would be your approach, let's say, if you had the 20% or even a little higher gross margin in the markets you wanted and you had the cost structure you wanted? So you were getting the margins you wanted, yet it appears that maybe were a little more land constrained, were trying to take pricing. Do you think you would focus on stealing some share from them if you had those margins you liked or would you follow the price increases and slowdown pace maybe?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We're, obviously, have been and continue to be a market aggregator. And we'll continue to be in the future, but focusing on profitable market aggregations. So it's going to be a balance. And we're looking at it on a subdivision-by-subdivision and our division presidents are looking at it on a house-by-house basis. There are some homes, the larger homes we can raise prices on today easier than we can than the smaller homes. There's a better demand right now for the larger homes simply because people have low interest rates and they have attractive housing prices, and most of the people in the marketplace today are trying to buy as much home as they possibly can. So as a result, I believe we're at much more -- we have better pricing power on our larger units than we do on our smaller units. But it's a balance on a subdivision-by-subdivision basis. Some of our subdivisions were eliminating plans because they're too small a plans, they're not an attractive gross margin on the house. And one of the things that we have always focused on in this company, is not having a price leader in any one subdivision when we go out and build, sell and close homes and make money on a house, we're trying to make the same gross margin on each and every house. It may not be the same dollars, obviously, but we're trying to make the same gross margins. So we eliminate the lower gross margin houses as we proceed through a subdivision, where we can. Some states like California, we have to build 4 plans and -- plan 1, 2, 3 and 4, and get to build the number that you plotted. But in most of our communities and most of our divisions, we have the flexibility to change our plans and eliminate them and add them.","Bill W. Wheat","We like our competitive position today with our ability to find new communities with our adequate land position, our strong land position and pricing power in the market that gives a lot of flexibilities in terms of being competitive in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Locker with FBN Securities.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to talk to you about -- on material costs. When they'll hit, I mean with lumber, bit of a lag if you're going to see more of a ramp on the material costs that hit your COGS, let's say, in your third quarter versus your second quarter.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Well, typically, what you would expect to see, especially on lumber, is that lumber prices will rise throughout the spring selling season and into early summer as the demand increases, and then you would see prices moderate. So it's entirely possible that you could see slightly higher costs flowing through in the Q3 and Q4 closings than in current closings. However, one of the things we try to do is lock in our prices for a longer period of time and use the volume that we have to negotiate favorable pricing with our supplier, so we try to mitigate that cost at the same time. And then in a rising price environment, we're optimistic that we can continue to raise prices to cover the cost increases. There are other categories, there's talk of price increases. Our goal is still to offset any price increases that we have to take with price decreases and other categories -- getting tougher to do that. And then some of the headliners in terms of price increases, we actually have price protection on the back-end. So there may be a market price increase, but we've locked our pricing through some of our national agreements.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And again, because of our volume nationwide, with our national contracts that we have, we have some preferential pricing in that and that also helps us pushback because of our volume with our different vendors and our suppliers, to push back on price increases. We can't always do that, but we're effective at it more times than you would think.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","I was just thinking, with lumber just jumping up in the November, December versus the spring period, it just kind of made an early move, so I was wondering if that might hit your second quarter or your June quarter versus your March quarter but...","Donald J. Tomnitz","We're very in touch with our lumber prices. And as I get e-mails from our national purchasing managers, we have, as Stacey said, been advising our division presidents on a timely basis about locking their prices on their -- or the costs on their lumber and extending those price locks for a longer period of time. I'm not sure that we've mitigated every one of the price increases, but I think we're doing a good job.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","And last question on financial service revenue, it was around 3.4% of your home closing revenue versus a year ago, it was 2.4%. Where do you think that will be -- what's a good run rate if you look at it as a percentage of home sale revenue? I know you sold a few mortgages that you have left over from the fourth quarter, but just going forward because it's up significantly year-over-year?","Bill W. Wheat","Clearly, it's a very favorable market right now in terms of the gain on sale that's available in the market, a lot of capital looking for mortgages. So that's driving higher margins, higher revenues per loan, and you're seeing that across the whole of the marketplace. One of the other drivers right now is our increase in our average selling price, it goes up, the average dollar per loan is going up as well. So that's helping drive that. But clearly, the margins today are higher than historical averages. Historically, you would probably see closer to the 2% range or the low 2% would be the long-term average, and today it's much higher than that.","Mike Murray","We've got a good window right now just based upon the FICO scores, the quality of the loans and the fact that the interest rates are low and the prepayment possibilities are low on these loans. So as a result, the purchases of those -- and investors in those mortgages, really, are buying mortgages at opportune time. Even though they're paying a higher yield, they're going to have a good yield on these mortgages going forward.","Stacey H. Dwyer","And Joel, you make a good point. I mean, Q1 is typically one of our lower homebuilding revenue quarters, but it's typically one of our stronger financial services quarters because we're selling a lot of the loans that we originated in the September quarter. So as we move into next quarter and homebuilding revenues pick up and we're selling loans than we originated this quarter, you may see that moderate a little bit.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Goldberg with UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question, I want to talk a little bit about growth, and I know you guys have touched on and Stacey mentioned some of the hiring you've done to support the growth as the markets rebounded. But I wanted to take a little bit -- a bigger picture of you on it, and what I want to talk about is controls as the market starts to get going again and things get better and better. And really, the question has to do with how difficult it has been to find people to add on? Presumably, people who got laid off over the 5-year downturn, have gone and found new jobs. Are you finding it difficult to find good quality people to bring on board as the business grows? And what kind of training timeline do you need, if you kind of think about the various jobs, job functions that there are?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, actually, we're not having a difficult time finding good people. One of the things that we have done a good job of over the last 3 or 4 years, even in the downturn is -- as an example, our Division President and City Manager training program, where we're bringing people up through the ranks and having them mirror the Division President or the City Manager that they're working for and D.R. and I specifically sit down and the talk with those people a couple of times a year, to make sure of their progress and how they're tracking. But the other issue is, is that because of who we are and the size of our company and the financial stability and the strong balance sheet that we have, there are a lot of people who, even outside the industry, look at that type of -- those type of metrics and they want to join the company like D.R. Horton, simply because it's a good place to work and it's a good solid company. So as a result, we really don't have difficulty attracting people and most of our people we're bringing up, we're bringing up through the ranks. We just expanded into several new markets and we've taken players from existing markets that have been proven, land acquisition people, sales manager and people of that sort, and put them in City Manager and Division President position. So we've eyed this for a number of years. We knew -- we kept our footprint, we knew we're going to begin expanding at some point in time when the economy was cooperating with us. And so as a result, we're well positioned internally to continue to grow largely, internally.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's a very helpful color. My follow-up question was, DT, about your comments on the entry-level segment showing strength, it feels like maybe that's a little bit different than what we've heard, even as we've gone through the upturn and it feels that we've gotten some momentum here. Can you talk about what do you think is driving the entry level outside of -- maybe it's just there's just no existing home inventory so if they want to buy, it's got to be on the new home market. But then also, as you look forward, how does that change your land buying behavior in terms of where you're looking for lots? And as you move forward, is the geographic footprint of your land purchasing going to change?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I think that you're right in terms of where we are. The -- excuse me, I had a good answer for it and I lost it.","Stacey H. Dwyer","David, the entry-level has always been a key part of our business. Traditionally, we ran 35% to 40%. Through the downturn, we moved up to 60%. That's down through our mortgage company, this quarter we ran about 47% first-time homebuyers. It really doesn't change our approach to land. It's just a continued extension. Our approach recently has changed more to where we're buying for the move-up buyer because we've seen that segment come back. The biggest thing that we're hearing from people who are buying today is they're looking at the rent versus own equation. And in so many of our markets, you can get into a home, no tax effect whatsoever, and have your payment for your house be less than your current apartment rent is. And so that's a significant dynamic, and we always come back to jobs too. And while the job market is still not as dynamic as it was in the heyday, it's shown improvement on a year-over-year basis and that's showing up in our results as well.","Donald J. Tomnitz","That was the point I was trying to make, was on the apartment issue out there, the reason that the new homebuyers are so attracted to buy a new homes is, the apartment owners are raising rents dramatically. And so as a result, the cost benefit to own versus rent is very attractive to own today. So as a result, you're finding a lot of those people. If they can get the down payment, as I say beg, borrow or -- beg it, I guess. I don't want use the third adjective, that can be inappropriate. But bottom line is, those people are trying to get into a home. And the other side of the issue is, if they're trying to get that money from parents, I have a number people who are helping their children get into homes because of the fact helping them with the down payment, just simply because it's an attractive time to purchase.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath with MKM Partners.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just as a quick follow-up on David's question. Given your increase in spec in anticipation of the spring selling season, are you expecting that your mix to the first-time buyer could increase as we move to the spring selling season or are these different types of specs that you're targeting towards the move-up buyer?","Donald J. Tomnitz","It's spread across the spectrum. It depends upon the subdivision. It depends upon the city. And we're building specs at the entry-level all the way up to the higher end. But again, it's just subdivision by subdivision based upon what the market is in that particular part of that division.","Bill W. Wheat","But we do believe with our specs in inventory at the beginning of the selling season, we are in a very strong position to be able to sell and capture the demand versus the competition in the existing market or other homebuilders who may not have as many homes in inventory.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just a follow-up on your land acquisitions, I just wanted to specifically ask about Texas. You talked a lot about your land acquisitions being in the South and Southeast, I think you said. We had heard through the grapevine that land prices in Houston and Dallas were reaching levels that they had seen at the peak. I'm not sure if you're seeing that and just wanted to hear some color specifically on what you're seeing in that market since you're so big there?","Donald J. Tomnitz","And we are the largest builder in Texas. And clearly, if you look at our various markets here, we're not seeing those kind of land prices. The underwriting that we're doing, still, is generating us in excess of 20% gross margins and we're achieving our return of capital on those land deals within 24 months. And currently, we find that land market in Texas is still attractive and we find the demand in Texas very strong. So as well, we continue to expand our existing number one position in Texas and we'll continue to do that.","Mike Murray","Peak is a strong term to use for pricing of land in Texas. We're much more topographically flat. We just didn't see the run up here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Don, I wanted to go back to something really interesting you said earlier. There's a widespread perception that there's a huge massive lot shortage out there and you said you're not seeing that. I think that a lot of that perception that there's a lot shortage came from during the downturn, whatever few buyers there were, basically, only wanted the most A-grade locations. And obviously, by definition there's going to be lot shortage in the most -- best locations. So my question is, are we seeing now with the housing recovery getting going here, an expansion of demand kind of going out again beyond just the A-grade locations. And obviously, you guys being the biggest builder and having the broadest array of communities, are we seeing that spreading of demand to those outlying areas again?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I would say very marginally. We're focused on -- are still doing A deals, and most of the deals we're doing are in A locations. So as a result, we're just not seeing a lack of good deals in any of our markets, and it's not on the periphery [ph]. Where -- It's the first area to slow. And there are attractive price out there on the periphery [ph], but most of our markets were still on A and B locations, clearly.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. So then, clearly -- actually, let me ask something different. During the downturn, you guys had constrained pretty significantly the sort of deals you would pursue to limit risk, right? Like you would pursue a smaller deal, as small a deal as possible. I think you had gotten under [ph] deals where your 15, 20 lots, let's say, and then finished only. Now, clearly, the deal sizes are getting larger and perhaps some more development work. I was just trying to get a sense of -- I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of that transition, how far it's gone and what your current kind of typical deal looks like?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I would say our typical deal today is still probably somewhere around 100 lots and they're in A and B locations, and we are able to continue to find those. The larger deals, even though we're doing larger deals, we still are underwriting those to a 20% plus gross margin and a recapture of our initial land investment within 2 years. And so as a result, we believe that is a very, very conservative land policy. And on a go-forward basis, we think we have very little risk in our land strategy, in our land portfolio by continuing to abide by those 2 key metrics. 20% plus gross margin and a return of our capital in 2 years. That's the characteristic of 99% of the deals coming to through company right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen East with ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","DT,  you've given a ton of great information on this call. And really outlining where you're going. I just want to clarify, if I heard a few things here. One, you're saying that price was much more of a driver than mix on your ASP and your move up is seeing better gross margins than your entry-level, so you're moving further that way. Is that correct?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Let me clearly correct it if I said this, but I know what I said, we build an entry-level house or we build a move-up home. We are shooting for essentially the same margin, 20% as a percentage. Now clearly, the dollars are different based upon the sales price but when we go out to build a home we're looking for that 20% gross margin. So we're still looking at the percentage of our move up, of our homes that we've sold and closed, in this quarter have moved up the scale. And so I think 47% of our closings this past quarter were first time and the rest of them were move-up buyers, and that's increased from -- the move-up buyers have increased by about 3 or 4 percentage points. I think that goes back to what I said and that is our buyers are out there in the marketplace trying to buy as much home as they possibly can in a combination of size and dollars to take advantage of the low interest rates that's available in the marketplace today.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. And then if you're targeting 20% gross and given the pricing power that you've got, I assume that you all are bringing in more mothballed communities into the mix. And if you are, what type of margins are they generating relative to your new land deals?","Donald J. Tomnitz","And yes, we are selectively bringing in mothballed properties. Obviously, as the market begins to recover, we still probably have several years, 3 or 4 years, to work through our mothballed assets. But as the market improves, we're comfortable that we'll work through the vast majority of those. And to answer your questions directly on the mothballed communities, our underwriting guidelines on those are somewhere around 16% gross margins. We'll bring those back in and that's an acceptable margin to get the asset off of our -- land asset off of our books and blend that in with our other margins. So it's somewhere around -- my metric is 15%, 16%.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And one last question. You all talked a little bit about materials, the inflation. Where are you seeing, what categories are you seeing the biggest inflation, other than lumber?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Yes. We talked about lumber. I think, another of the headliners over the last year has been drywall. And there's talk of another price increase, but it would be smaller than the one that was in place last year. And beyond that, there's just different categories and it's going to be different in the different geographies.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Now back to your point earlier, just -- when we bring something back, from mothball back into production, the key metric for us is not the 15% or 16%, but we want to absolutely be comfortable that we're not going to be looking at a future impairment when we bring that back into production. So we're looking at the marketplace and seeing what the opportunity is to work our way through that on a timely basis.","Bill W. Wheat","How much cash will it take to develop it? Naturally, that's a big part of it.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Stephen, one other thing on the cost side. We are using our volume and making some bigger commitments to individual vendors to help control those pricing increases and mitigate them for us as much as we can.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Are you seeing, along those lines too, on the labor side, I know you said you're not seeing it. Are you seeing subs willing to hire effectively, just more generally, across the industry?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Absolutely. And that's what I was describing earlier. Our subs that we're going out into new submarkets with are hiring new people and creating new teams in order to satisfy our business. So a beautiful thing about where we have been in our business, and we've maintained our footprint and even our markets -- position in most of our markets, almost all of our markets, and that is, is that our subs have been with us and they're willing to grow and expand because they're comfortable that they can grow and expand with us profitably.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess the first question, most of my questions have been answered, but over the last several years I know that, DT, you and D.R. have essentially split the country up in, roughly, half and have really had a very hands-on approach to managing your business. And that's, I think, been very much to the company's benefit over the last several years, at least. As we look forward to a hopefully expanding market for quite a number of years, and you increasing your volume at least at the industry rate, if not more, can you give us a sense for how you envision over the medium to longer term handling the management on an operational basis? Do you still envision it to be basically as you have it today or do you anticipate bringing in another layer of management?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I'd answer that question, and first of all say, our Regional Presidents have been the main factor behind our success and our growth, notwithstanding the fact that D.R. and I are out there and we really didn't split up the country, but we go to different parts of the country, obviously, at different times. But our role has largely been to review and approve what they have been doing, i.e., the Regional Presidents have been doing with their Division Presidents. So to the extent that we need to bring in another layer, at one point in time we had another layer, and when we're going to 100,000 units and then we had a little hiccup and we didn't need that layer of management. So as we move forward, if we feel necessary to add another layer of management, certainly, we're openminded to that. But right now, I want to make sure that everyone understands our Regional Presidents have really led us to where we are today with a little guidance and a little help from D.R. and me.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So you haven't articulated either internally or externally what level of volume you think you can handle without adding back that layer of management. And then I guess, if that's true, is there -- can you give us some general understanding, has the -- let's say, the systems in place at the company enabled you to operate at a higher volume with a smaller corporate footprint?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Look, Bill Wheat answered that question from a corporate perspective because he's very much closer to that than I am. But as an example, on a division basis, at the peak in our Southwest Florida division, I think we closed 800 homes and we have like 120 or 130 employees down there, and we are currently come close --  somewhere close to that in the next fiscal year and we have substantially fewer employees, and that's probably about half. So I think what's happened is we've become a lot more efficient in the field, but also at the corporate office we've become a lot more efficient.","Bill W. Wheat","Really, across-the-board, we do feel like we have gotten a lot more efficient. We learned a lot of things through the downturn in terms of how we operate at our division level, our regional level and our corporate level, such that as we grow again, we probably will not have to have the same level of overhead or infrastructure. Systems are part of that. We are on one operating system from a computer standpoint today. We've deployed more technology into the field as well, which allows people to do more with less. So there are a lot of things that contribute to that, that we do believe that down the line will pay very good dividends for us.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And a lot of our operating systems that we're using today we're developing in-house, and we're not relying on someone else outside of the company to be able to do that for us. So again, we're in touch with our business from a corporate perspective better than we ever have been and developing things that actually fit our business and our company, as opposed to trying to find someone outside of our industry to supply us with those programs. And the bottom line is, our industry is not big enough to attract a lot of software writers and so forth to develop programs that we need.","Mike Murray","And to circle back to your comment on senior management at the region level and then at the corporate level, the visibility of information on individual land deals, on performance of projects, to D.R. and DT, to corporate management, to region management is far better, that visibility is far better today than it was 6, 7 years ago. So the ability of our key managers to make decisions and view how our performance is, is far better than it was in the last cycle.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Best information in the history of the company.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. I think that's a very important point. And I think it also suggests that your ability to manage your SG&A control, which is something that you guys have always been leaders on the industry on, will certainly be better this cycle than it was in the past cycle. If I could dovetail on that, the second question that I had for you related to the potential to manage your hard costs and labor costs, also, better through the evolution of technology. It seems pretty clear that you can be able to manage maybe with less corporate staff for a given amount of volume. But one of the things that we've begun to hear from some of your peers has been that the improvements in systems has allowed, during the downturn, has allowed these companies to approach the way that they bid out projects and get quotes for labor and materials, such that the overall costs for development is less than it might have otherwise been prior to the cycle -- prior to this cycle. And I was curious if you could talk about that, whether you think there's any opportunity to use systems and changes in the way you do business to drive hard costs and labor costs down? You kind of touched on it earlier, but it almost sounded like you were saying your subs are going to be reacting on gratitude to you in keeping prices down.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Don't get confused, it has to be a win-win for both of us. And I'm sure they're very grateful for our relationship, as we are for our relationship with them. But as an example, we used to have the subcontractors come in to our offices and sit down with our purchasing managers. We'd have 50 sets of plans and they'd all pick up the plans and they'd go out and they would bid off the plans, on paper plans, or bring the bids back in 2 or 3 weeks later, and maybe they got that the maybe they didn't. Almost all of our plans today are available through our subcontractors online. We disseminate the information to them online. There are specific bid sheets that they can fill the data in, as opposed to pencil and paper process. So we've increased our efficiency, their efficiency, and it's a lot more accurate system. We know for sure, all the items that are in the house, whereas before when we're doing takeoffs, it was more of rounding error. Today, we know every nail, and every 2 by 4 that goes into each and every plan, and it's a lot easier to bid it and control your costs that way.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask on the land you're acquiring, if you could provide a sense for the average size of the deal or the typical deal, for example, the number of lots per community and whether that continues to increase? I think, last quarter, you suggested you're starting to see larger lot sales from banks and developers?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes. And as I've mentioned before, the average size of our deal is somewhere around 100 lots, as opposed to before it was probably 40, 50 lots during the peak of the downturn, if there is such a thing. And also in '08 and '09, we hardly buying anything. We started buying things in '09 and '10. And when we started buying they were small deals, just a handful of lots here and there. But as we have bigger demands in most of our markets, it's easier for us to get A subdivision with 100 plus lots in it, we put a model in it and we have a flag and that flag is good for 2 years. So that's what we are focusing on.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","As a follow-up, do you have a sense for what percentage of your current land position was acquired post-2009?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Jade, if you look at our balance sheet, if you look at the land that's held for development, that's going to be the biggest portion of anything that we have owned through the downturn. And there's probably some small portion that we're currently working through in the other 2 categories that most of what we are building today are 2009 purchases or later.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Buck Horne with Raymond James.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to get into some of the regional categories of the sales strength. And I was just wondering if there's any noticeable differentiation between market to where D.R. Horton doesn't face quite as much public builder competition? I'm just, I guess, focusing on the Southeast region in particular, where you had some really strong gains. So I'm wondering like your places like Alabama and northern Florida, were places where you got a lot of strength versus some of the other areas and maybe like Atlanta or Orlando or south Florida, just understanding if there is more significant capital barriers between the publics and privates that are playing out here?","Donald J. Tomnitz","The way I'd like to answer that question is that the State of Florida is a good market for us right now and that's clearly in the Southeast, and also in Carolinas. Those are good markets for us, as opposed to markets where we don't have very much competition or very much public competition. Virtually, every one of our markets, we get up every day and we have a ton of competition from the publics and the privates. So I wouldn't say that we're capitalizing on any one market by the lack of competition.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one more for you. The thing about the mortgage industry here and the new rules and regulations that came out from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau there. Have you guys been able to absorb and process what the new rules will have on your mortgage operation, I guess, particularly thinking about the 3% cap on points and fees. Is that going to have any impact on the operation and will there come a point where you may consider actually selling your mortgage business? What's the net effect of all these new rules on the industry and your customers?","Bill W. Wheat","Well, the most important thing is that the standard for our qualifying mortgage turned out to not be much different than what the prevailing practices are in the market today, so that's good news. That provides some stability and some certainty around the mortgages for lenders out there. And hopefully, that will encourage some additional market participation and bring some more capital into the mortgage market. In terms of some of the other provisions of the law, specifically the 3% cap on fees, there's a -- we're still absorbing that, we're still analyzing that. There's a year that we have in front of us before we would have to implement any of those, before they take effect, so we'll be analyzing that over time. And at this point, we don't really have any comment or estimates as far as potential impact. Right now, it's business as usual and we will work through those things over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Barron with the Housing Research Center.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","I wanted to just ask a real quick question on the land. You guys have answered most of my questions, but most of the stuff you bought this quarter, is that stuff that will be put into use this year or is that more like 2014 and beyond?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Primarily 2014. The raw land is, obviously, the finished lots that we bought will be put into play right away.","Mike Murray","The raw land is entitled though, and so we will begin working through the process of preparing for the land development part. But as far as delivering homes on land purchases today, that would be 2014.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","So it was obviously a pretty significant purchase, although it sounded like you guys said, to expect some moderation in the future quarters?","Mike Murray","Don't forget now, Alex, $345 million of that was finished lots that we purchased of the money that we spent. And the other side of the coin is, is that we are seeing good demand in most of our markets, so it's time to step up and take advantage of the many opportunities that we see in the marketplace today.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","Now the fact that you, I guess, bought a lot of stuff versus your option position didn't increase that much, does that mean that you're not finding a lot of people willing to option on the same terms as before or was it more attractive about actually buying the lots?","Bill W. Wheat","Well, Alex, a lot of what we bought this quarter was in the option number last quarter. Typically, the process is we'll contract it, and as soon as we've got something contracted, it goes into our option number. And subsequent to that, 60, 90 days later, it gets purchased. So what you saw there is that we did purchase a lot out of our options, but then we replenished option supply with new contracts.  So no, we haven't really seen a slowdown in terms of the number of new contracts we're seeing or option deals.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","Okay. And then in regards to -- you guys mentioned that you're seeing more demand coming from apartment renters because of the buy versus rent equation. I guess my question is, are you also seeing an increase in demand from these boomerang buyers, the people that have been renting the foreclosed houses, basically, the people that got foreclosed?","Mike Murray","We've heard anecdotally of some of that activity, but I wouldn't say that it's any large percentage of our business right now.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And back on your question on the land side of it, the deals that rolled [ph] in, that we are buying, as I said before, those are 20% plus gross margin deals. And the deals that we primarily have bought in the last quarter were A-plus locations positioning us for 2014 and 2015.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","And last one for Bill, if I could. Any guidance on the remaining DTA reversal, Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","As of right now, we still have $41.9 million of evaluation allowance on our DTA. That solely relates to our state deferred tax assets driven by our NOL carryforwards. And there are a number of the states we operate in that have very short carryforward periods, and so we've estimated that we will not be able to earn enough income in those states to fully capture the full NOL. And so that was an estimate that we made in fiscal 2012. We will continue to monitor that estimate based on the income levels that we generate here in fiscal 2013. If there's a point where we continue to perform strongly or performance improves versus where we are today, then there's a chance that we could bring some portion of that back. We will not bring all of that back though. There is some portion that we will not receive because of the short carryforward periods in some states.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I was curious to -- with the outsized land investment in the quarter if you sort of thought of a percentage of that spend that was really tax-driven, given the pending tax law changes?","Bill W. Wheat","I couldn't give you a percentage. There were a number of deals that we closed in the last 2 or 3 days based upon the seller -- of the calendar year, based upon the seller's desire to miss the tax increase. I wouldn't call it a significant amount. What really took place was during the quarter, we found a number of good deals and larger deals than what we had done in the past in order to capitalize on those to support the growth in our existing markets.","Mike Murray","And there were a number of deals that we were working that perhaps under normal circumstances, might have closed later in 2013 that due to the tax changes that the seller preferred or offered us the opportunity to close before 12\/31 with a better price. And so there's probably some acceleration of deals we were working on as well.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just another question. Long shot, would you be willing to give us finished lots by region?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I don't have that in front of us here.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I'll assure that each one of our regions based upon the demand we're seeing and the profitability we're seeing on each region are adequately supplied, to this point, with the finished lots.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then on the Southwest, I'm guessing that's a store count [ph], community count [ph] issue, it looked like the growth was flatter there. And we've heard, obviously, a strong commentary out of the Arizona market, any comment there?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, we're trying to replenish our lot supply. To be quite frank with you, Phoenix turned around faster than we thought it was going to turn around and we probably are scrambling a little bit more than we normally would in the Phoenix market to replenish our lot supply, and the same thing in the Albuquerque market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall with RBC.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping you could provide a little commentary on the conversion rate going forward?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Backlog conversion rate?","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You got it.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I believe we're pretty clear when we said that we anticipate it to be somewhere around 70%, and that's back to a more normalized seasonal percentage.","Stacey H. Dwyer","If you look out over the last few quarters, Bob, it's consistently been slowing down. And so our traditional pattern is that we would convert somewhere in the mid-50% range in Q1 and Q2. So our actual reserve this [ph] quarter and our guidance for next quarter still have that elevated. In the back half of the year, we would traditionally trend down to the mid-60% range in Q3, and then be somewhere around 70% in Q4. We will try to give you more visibility as we get closer, but right now we're kind of watching how things settle out as well. We don't have as many completed specs as percentage of our inventories, so we're not experiencing the same number of homes that can -- under contract and then close in a really, really short timeframe. We're seeing an increase in our build-to-order jobs, which are great from a margin perspective, but they do stay in backlog longer. We just don't know exactly what the timing is going off when all those convert.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. That makes sense. You guys had a big move in your ASP for new orders into kind of like a $250,000 range. Is that a good full year number to use for modeling? Is that kind of big uptick sustainable?","Bill W. Wheat","Well, I can tell you what we're seeing, as I've said before on the call, we are seeing buyers coming in trying to buy as large a house and the most house that they can qualify for, given where the interest rates are and where the supply is going forward. So I don't know if it's sustainable. I actually think we might be able to increase it.","Donald J. Tomnitz","On the sale side.","Stacey H. Dwyer","On the sales side, exactly. If you look at what we just closed, it was $236,000 and in our backlog, it's right at $240,000. So in terms of using that for a revenue average price, that would probably be too aggressive.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","No, I was just talking on the new orders, but that's good color, that's what I was looking for. And a final question, as you guys ramp for the spring selling season, obviously, there is some variable cost into the mix. Do you think you can get full year SG&A inside of $650 million?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, first of all, we are ramped up right now for the spring selling season.","Bill W. Wheat","It all depends on volume levels. We don't have an estimate or guidance on the dollar amount that we're going to spend because some of that is variable, it depends on where our sales go and where our volumes go. Clearly, our long-term goal on SG&A is to drive it to 10% of homebuilding revenues. That would be a big jump this year. We're probably not going to get there, but we do expect to still see substantial improvement in our SG&A percentage this year as we did in the first quarter.","Operator","Mr. Tomnitz, we have no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you. And D.R. and I want to make sure that all of our DHI teammates out there are aware of just how proud we are of what you did this last quarter. But most importantly, we want you to be aware that we're very, very proud of the accomplishments that we've made over the last 4 years. This company went from '07 through '10 and '11, and those were tough years. And for us to produce and for you to produce the kind of performance that you did in this first quarter is a magnificent accomplishment, and we thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Donald Tomnitz, President and CEO for D.R. Horton. Thank you, Mr. Tomnitz, you may begin.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you, and good morning. Joining me this morning are Bill Wheat, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Stacey Dwyer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer; and Mike Murray, Senior Vice President. Before we get started, as usual, Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Some comments made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there's no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R.

Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","D.R. Horton is off to a strong start in fiscal 2014. Our first quarter results were highlighted by $189.7 million of pretax income, on $1.7 billion of revenues and a pretax operating margin of 11.4%. Our home sales gross margin improved 350 basis points year-over-year to our highest level since 2006, setting a firm foundation for a strong profitability as volume grows. Housing market conditions continue to improve across most of our operating markets and we are optimistic about the upcoming spring selling season. We are prepared for spring with attractive communities in great locations and a strong supply of finished lots and homes in inventory to capture the expected increase in demand.","Our weekly sales pace accelerated in January as compared to the first quarter, which could be an early sign of strong demand to come in the spring. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","In the first quarter, our consolidated pretax income increased 76% to $189.7 million from $107.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Our pretax income as a percentage of consolidated revenue was 11.4%, an increase of 290 basis points from 8.5% in the year-ago quarter. Homebuilding pretax income more than doubled to $181.9 million from $90.2 million, and financial services pretax income was $7.8 million compared to $17.7 million. Net income for the first quarter increased 86% to $123.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $66.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Mike?","Mike Murray","Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 33% to $1.6 billion on 6,188 homes closed, up from $1.2 billion on 5,182 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $263,500, up 12% compared to the prior year driven by pricing power and an increased mix of larger move-up homes. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","The value of our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 14% to $1.5 billion. Homes sold increased 4% to 5,454 homes, and our average selling price increased 10% to $275,600. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 23% compared to 22% in the year-ago quarter. The value of our backlog increased 20% from a year ago to $2.1 billion with an average sales price per home of $275,100, and homes in backlog increased 5% to 7,684 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the quarter was 75%. We are ready for the spring selling season with a strong supply of homes available to close by March, so we expect our second quarter backlog conversion rate to be around 75%, which is higher than our second quarter historical conversion rate. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 22.3%, up 350 basis points from the year-ago period. 200 basis points of the margin increase was due to improved market conditions resulting in reduced incentives and higher selling prices in excess of cost increases. 110 basis points was due to lower relative costs for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenue, and the remaining 40 basis points of the margin increase was due to lower amortized interest in property taxes. We have invested in attractively priced land and lots over the last 2 years and we continue to see solid demand and improved pricing in many of our markets. Based on current market conditions, we expect our gross margins to continue at a strong level. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Homebuilding SG&A expense for the quarter was $183.4 million compared to $140.8 million in the prior-year quarter. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A improved 20 basis points to 11.2% from 11.4%. We continue to leverage our fixed cost structure, while at the same time building our sales and production capabilities where necessary. We expect our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues to increase seasonally in the second quarter before trending lower in the third and fourth quarters with higher expected revenues. The improvements in our gross profit percentage and SG&A expense ratio expanded our homebuilding pretax margin to 11.1% in the current quarter, an increase of 380 basis points from 7.3% in the year-ago quarter. Mike?","Mike Murray","Financial services pretax income for the quarter was $7.8 million, down from $17.7 million in the year-ago quarter. This quarter reflected a more competitive pricing environment, whereas the year-ago quarter benefited from unusually favorable market conditions, which produced higher than normal gains on sale of mortgages. 88% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. FHA and VA loans accounted for 45% of our mortgage company's volume this quarter, down from 49% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company during the quarter had an average FICO score of 719 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. First-time homebuyers represented 41% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter compared to 50% in the year-ago quarter. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Since September, our construction in progress and finished homes inventory increased by approximately $224 million. We had 16,800 homes in inventory at the end of December, of which 1,400 were models, 9,300 were speculative homes and 3,400 of the specs were completed. Our average community count for the quarter increased 13% from a year ago.","In our first fiscal quarter, our investments in lots, land and development totaled $467 million, of which $254 million was for land development, and $213 million was to purchase finished lots and land. At December 31, 2013, we owned 126,000 lots and controlled 49,000 lots through option contracts. 61,000 of our lots are finished, of which 33,500 are owned and 27,500 are optioned. We are well positioned to meet demand with our 175,000 total lots owned and controlled. Mike?","Mike Murray","In October, we acquired the homebuilding operations of Regent Homes for $34.5 million in cash. Regent operates in Charlotte, Greensboro and Winston Salem, North Carolina. At the date of acquisition, we acquired approximately 240 homes in inventory, 300 lots and control of an additional 600 lots through option contracts. We also acquired a sales order backlog of 213 homes valued at $31.1 million. Our first quarter results include 76 net sales and 136 closings in Regent's operations. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Our unrestricted homebuilding cash totaled $801 million at quarter end. At December 31, we had available capacity on our revolving credit facility of $656 million and no cash borrowings outstanding. Our homebuilding leverage ratio, net of cash, was 37.1% and our gross homebuilding leverage was 43.8%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at December 31 was $3.3 billion. Subsequent to quarter end, we repaid the remaining $145.9 million principal amount of our 6 1\/8% senior notes at maturity. Our $500 million principal amount of convertible notes mature in May. These notes are eligible for conversion into equity if our stock price is at or above $12.96. If the notes convert, we intend to settle them with common stock. In January, our Board of Directors approved a payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 per share payable on February 18 to shareholders of record on February 7. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","In closing, this quarter was D.R. Horton's most profitable first quarter since 2006 with $189.7 million of pretax income. The majority of our operating metrics continued to improve on a year-over-year basis this quarter. The value of our sales, closings and backlog increased by 14%, 33% and 20%, respectively. Our pretax income increased 76%. Our pretax income margin increased 290 basis points to 11.4%. Our gross margin on home sales revenues increased 350 basis points. Our SG&A, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, improved 20 basis points. Our average sales price increased 10%, as we experienced pricing power in many of our markets. We are better prepared this year than we have been for any recent spring selling season. We have a strong finished lot position and an attractive cost basis. And we continue to bring new communities to market, which reflect extraordinarily competitive finished lot costs due to our excellent low-cost land purchases over the last several years. January sales are accelerating into the spring and we have a supply of spec homes available to meet that demand. We look forward to a very strong spring selling season. We'd like to personally thank all the D.R. Horton team, let's keep the momentum from January going. This concludes our prepared remarks and now, we'll host any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from David Goldberg from UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So my first question was actually on absorptions. And if I got the numbers right, it seems like absorptions were down kind of high-single digits, community counts up, and obviously, pricing is very, very strong in the backlog and in terms of order growth. Should we see that as kind of a little bit of a change strategically, that you're going to let absorptions be a little bit lighter year-over-year maybe, if that's the way it falls out but you're going to hold pricing? Or is the commitment still very much --, \"Let's make sure we drive absorptions through the system and through the communities?\" Maybe you can just kind of talk about the balance at this point?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think where we are clearly -- and it's the same place where we were at the end of the fourth quarter -- and that is, we're holding our pricing strong and firm going into the strong selling season. And we feel like there's a limited supply of new homes on the market. And I think as we move into the strong selling season, that we'll be able to continue to maintain our pricing, if not slightly increase it. So we don't see any real reason, as we said at the end of the fourth quarter, David, to begin discounting early. There's no use to get -- to overreact. We think we're in an extraordinarily strong position. And based upon our sales in January and especially this last week, we feel very good about the strong spring selling season and our ability to continue to maintain our pricing stability and raise prices.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then, maybe you guys can comment on the Regent Homes deal. If I got the numbers correctly in the dialogue, in the prepared remarks, they just overbooked, it sounded like, maybe slight premiums were up booked. What's the deal flow look like, especially kind of after the second half last year, a little bit of uncertainty heading into this year? Are you finding the deal flow will pick up in terms of M&A? And the willingness of, maybe, private builders to be flexible on pricing? Is that changing out there now?","Bill W. Wheat","We are seeing a lot of opportunities as we have been and we're evaluating them. There was a bit of a pause in the sales environment late last summer into the early fall. And that perhaps did bring a few more people to coming out and trying to look at their alternatives and options. So we continue to look at opportunities, and hopefully, we'll continue to be successful finding the right acquisitions. We're not stressed to have to do any one given deal. We're looking for the right thing that fits strategically with what we see as a company and improving our footprint and our capabilities.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It was interesting to note in your prepared remarks -- in your press release, you specifically called out the move-up buyer as an area of strength. I was just wondering if you could elaborate that a little bit more, and also address what you're seeing in the first-time buyer?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, clearly, we opened Emerald Homes probably about 6 months -- or actually longer than that, 9 months ago -- and we're bringing that into fruition in a number of our divisions and that's focusing on the higher end. And that product line has met with a lot of strong demand in the marketplace and we're expanding that into more and more divisions. And we expect to continue to grow that to the point where it will become a significant portion of the corporation on a go-forward basis.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so but...","Stacey H. Dwyer","And in terms of the first-time buyer, though, I mean, I don't ever want people to think that, that's not a core part of our business as well. The first-time buyer and the first-time move-up buyer have been our bread-and-butter for many, many years and we're going to continue to focus on those segments as well. But we have seen an opportunity to expand our product offerings so we're offering more things to more people in many of our markets.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess from a demand perspective, can you discern any different trends between the segments?","Stacey H. Dwyer","I think we're seeing some improvement in the move-up simply because we've added that product line. And so it's really hard for us to gauge what the incremental demand in that is. Overall, for our business, it's been an increasing portion of demand.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, when you -- Don, it sounded to me like when you're -- your tone, when you're talking about acceleration into January that, that was a little bit more than you might see normally. Is that correct?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I would relate it to, specifically, my expectations. And as you know, I'm a more conservative person. So I would tell you that in January and especially this last week, that our sales have been better than I had expected. And I'm excited about where we are and I feel like that we're right on the cusp of a strong selling, spring selling season. And from my own personal perspective, I think the spring selling season has started a little early for our company and that's a very positive thing that I'm seeing.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Mike Roxland from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you just talk about specific trends during the quarter? Was any 1 month particularly better? And if so, what do you think drove that? Was there -- it sounded like you didn't increase your incentives at all. So what did you see as the quarter played out?","Bill W. Wheat","Really, our sales pace through the quarter was fairly consistent. Each month of the quarter was up on a year-over-year basis. So we saw just very consistent sales trends and then we've seen that accelerate in the month of January.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I also think that the buyer is becoming more accustomed to the current mortgage rates. If you recall back a couple of quarters ago, there was a pretty adverse reaction to the increase in mortgage rates even though they were slight and they're still historically low by anybody's standards. But frankly, over the last 4 to 6 months, the buyers have become accustomed to the mortgage rates and I think that, that will be less and less a factor as we move into the spring selling season and fiscal year '14.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And you see that in terms of your traffic as well? The traffic has accelerated?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. Then the last question is -- quickly. Can you help us frame how we should be thinking about rising rates and really the impact on your business? Obviously, we don't expect another spike in rates but we should have higher this year alongside, obviously, the Fed tapering. At what point should we expect to see a more notable impact on your business? And should we expect you to increase your focus on move-up luxury buyers in anticipation of rates going up?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I personally believe that rates are going up, as I've said for a number of quarters, although they haven't gone up significantly. I don't believe rates are going to go up significantly. And the way I look at it today, the affordability index is still at one of the highest it's been in many, many years. I look at current opportunity for the buyers to buy a home at still reasonable prices relative to where they've been on a historical basis. And where the mortgage rates are, that it's certainly a great time to buy a home. And I think that a lot of buyers are continuing to accept that and believe that.","Stacey H. Dwyer","And we've looked at numerous charts over the past few years and the tightest correlation in terms of new home sales isn't with interest rates, it's with jobs. And so if interest rates are rising because the economy is improving, because more people are employed, we view that as a strong positive boost[ph] for our business.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Dan Oppenheim from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It sounds that you're in great shape in terms of being prepared for the demand in the spring season. I was wondering, Stacey, you'd talked about the higher backlog conversion based on the specs there for the March quarter. I was wondering, how much of that in terms of what you're doing in specs is really for the first-time buyers in terms of. Let's call it, the 2\/5 of the business there versus higher price points? And with the first-time buyers, what are you typically seeing in terms of timing from contracts on into closing?","Stacey H. Dwyer","More of our specs are probably going to be targeted toward the first-time buyer and the first time move-up buyer. In terms of time to contract, I don't think we're seeing anything that's significantly different. We had expected, as the economy recoveries and the demand recovers, that we'd see more build-to-order, and we actually did see our backlog conversion rates slowing down some. We're still running above historical trends and we're still seeing more compacted contract to close than we've seen historically.","Bill W. Wheat","And still, with the number of changes in the mortgage underwriting guidelines, it's taking longer to qualify a buyer than what it has in the past. And we're processing those as quickly and as efficiently as we possibly can, but that is a slowing process to our business.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then, in terms of the comments in terms of the better trends in January, especially this past week. Any regional color you can offer in terms of just where you saw pockets of strength?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Dan, I've passed that stage in my life. I'm going to pass on that question. This we -- we just look at the business overall and I'll leave it other people to make the commentaries on the various markets and grade the markets.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, just wanted to dig in a little bit more, Don, on your comments regarding sales trends in January and how you're thinking about the spring. Given that sales pace is still down year-over-year, obviously, with some of the shorter-term comps and recent gyrations earlier this year with the mortgage environment, in terms of your expectations, you're obviously, looking forward, as you said, to a strong spring selling season. But as that comps against last year, where it was also a very strong selling season, are you thinking more that you'd be happy matching on a sales per community basis, the results of the year-ago and that would certainly qualify as a strong season? Or are you actually looking for year-over-year improvement on a sales pace basis?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, we're constantly looking for year-over-year improvements on the sales basis, but to your specific question, we're always trying to increase our absorptions on a per community basis. That's our best leverage of our SG&A and that's a focus in each one of our communities. So we are focusing on how we penetrate each market deeper, but also how we increase our absorptions on a community-by-community basis.","Stacey H. Dwyer","I would add one thing on that. If you look at our West region, we actually have been raising our sales prices and really improving our operating margin, that we're not focused on absorptions in that region just because of the lot supply dynamics there. So there's always the nuance of we're going to approach our business differently based on the different market conditions everywhere. So again, it may not be a one-size-fits-all answer.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and I appreciate that. And then, just some clarification, if possible. Don, you mentioned about SG&A, you expect it to increase seasonally in the second quarter. Just wanted to clarify if that was in dollars or on a percent of sales basis relative to 1Q? And also, if you could give what the community count was in the first quarter sequentially in year-over-year in terms of the growth as you have in the past?","Donald J. Tomnitz","On the SG&A certainly as a percentage, but certainly not in terms of dollars. And if you'll notice that our Q1 SG&A dollars were down. So as a result, we expect the same thing to happen to us in the second quarter. Community count...","Bill W. Wheat","Community count, on a sequential basis, our average community count was up 2%, and year-over-year was up 13%.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. But the SG&A as a percentage of sales versus 1Q, is that -- I mean, on a year-over-year, I'd assume you'll have leverage but sequentially, would that be up as well? Or...","Donald J. Tomnitz","We think on a percentage basis, we'll be up because typically, our second quarter, we -- is our slowest quarter for closings. And if you take a look at our expectation on our backlog conversion, 75% would produce slightly fewer units in Q2 closed than what we did in Q1. So our SG&A, as a percentage of revenues will be slightly up.","Bill W. Wheat","And that's our normal seasonality in terms of SG&A.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Stephen East from ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Don, you've talked a little bit about SG&A. If I step back and just look at all the costs that are rolling through. Your gross margin, when I backed out last quarter's warranty benefit, was up pretty significantly sequentially. One, did that surprise you? Two, what are the expectations moving forward relative to this past quarter in that? And then on your SG&A, what's driving that? We expect that it would drop a little bit more than what it's been dropping. Is it just your infrastructure build or are you using more dollars on brokers, et cetera, than expected? And sort of tied into that, what you all think about cost expectations as we go through to '14?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, on our gross margin basis, obviously, what we've been doing is we've been holding our prices steady even though the demand, if you look at our fourth quarter sales and our first quarter sales, we've been able to hold it, even in a slow part of the time period. And as Stacey had said earlier, clearly in the West region, as well as other regions, we are not discounting homes and we're maximizing our prices. So in terms of gross margins, our gross margins are basically close to their historical peak, but we don't think they're -- we're at peak pricing in most of our markets. We strongly believe one of the factors that will continue to improve our gross margins -- actually, 2 factors. One is our very competitive land positions that we're bringing to market in the form of finished lots. And secondly, if you take a look at what we think is a constrained or reduced demand or -- of inventory of homes out there for the expected demand, I think that we're going to have pricing power because of those 2 factors. But especially the limited amount of inventory that's prevalent in most of the markets today. I'll let you guys handle the SG&A.","Bill W. Wheat","And in terms of SG&A, clearly, we are prepared for stronger volumes in 2014. So we have been building infrastructure on our sales teams and our production capabilities. And so from that standpoint, we definitely are prepared for some stronger volumes. And on a year-over-year basis, we did leverage it 20 basis points. So we are ahead of the pace that we set last year. In Q1, we finished the year at 10.7% last year so we're on pace to do better than that. Clearly, we're always looking to leverage SG&A as much as we possibly can. And our expectation is with higher volumes later in the year, that we will leverage it further.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And to digress just for a moment, obviously we're expecting to close more units in fiscal year '14 than we did in fiscal year '13. So we've added -- we've had to add the additional SG&A particularly on the construction side to get our homes built and to have them available for the spring selling season. And as the market continues to improve, as we think it will, throughout the third and fourth quarters, we've got to have superintendents to deliver those homes.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That is a very thorough answer for all of that. That helps me a lot. I appreciate it. And then just the other thing that I had, in your fiscal first quarter, if you look at it sequentially, your orders usually drop about 15%, 20% versus the fourth quarter. This time, they were up about 6%. Blending that with what you've said about the January commentary, is the result in the fourth quarter more a function of the fourth quarter improving -- or the first quarter improving, or the fourth quarter just being much weaker than normal?","Donald J. Tomnitz","No. I think it's a function of the first quarter improving. Like I said, that improvement has continued over into the second quarter. And we're very happy, even though we're focusing on double-digit increases in all the important metrics, except for SG&A. The fact that we are up 4% in units and 14% in terms of dollars in our sales, we're very pleased with that. So we continue to feel like there's momentum building and we're pleased with those numbers.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from James McCanless with Sterne Agee.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask first on the community count growth numbers you gave. Should we expect that plus 13 or somewhere in that range to be the growth rate for the rest of the year?","Bill W. Wheat","James, we would expect it to moderate a bit. We do expect our community count to continue to be up on a year-over-year basis, but it may not continue to be double-digit based on what we can see right now. But really, what will ultimately happen will depend on what we see in terms of the strength of the market as we get into the spring and later in the year, if they have -- if the strength exceeds our current expectations, we could end up adding some additional communities. But right now, we'd expect it to stay positive but perhaps not at the double-digit level.","Donald J. Tomnitz","One of the factors in the marketplace today is that the number of markets have land prices reflecting continued increase in median house prices, and we're very, very pleased with our current land position because we bought before the prices ran up as dramatically as they have. And clearly, that's what we're expecting in terms of complement to our gross margins. Because we do have less expensive land than what the market is reflecting in terms of land prices today.","Mike Murray","In each of the last 2 years, we've built our community count by double-digit percentages each of the last 2 years, so we've built up to a very good footprint to be prepared for this year. So we're in a very good position and really don't feel the urgency to have to continue to increase our community count at the same pace.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And that's reflected in our first quarter land spend because basically we had -- what $45 million worth of land spend in the first quarter. So that's less than what we've had for quite some time.","Mike Murray","And the total land and finished lots are $213 million. That is moderating from where we've been.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A few questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the spec situation. I guess, first, you talked about the fact that you've got, I think you said 9,300 specs, and that positions you well. A lot of times, when you have a lot of specs, people sometimes, in previous times, say that \"Oh, it's a bad thing.\" Because that means you're going to have to discount. But in periods where the demand is very strong, you really don't have to discount that much. So, I guess, if you could help us understand, if sales progress through the first quarter are, let's say, a little lighter than you anticipate, would there be a point where you might feel you have to sort of accelerate the discounting on those units? And what sort of scenarios embedded in your expectation since you're going to be having more specs as a percentage of deliveries, I would think, than you did for some time?","Donald J. Tomnitz","First of all, we're in a very strong position given our specs. Although our specs as a percentage of our total inventory are nowhere near what our peak specs were at one point in time as a percentage of our inventory, our specs as a percentage of inventory increased from 53% to 56% sequentially, which is normal process, so that we get ready for the spring selling season. But we don't share your concern about a weak selling season. I think there's going to be a strong selling season. But, Kim, to your specific point, if there were such, currently, our spec gross margins are continuing to exceed our build job gross margins. So we feel like that we're in an extraordinarily strong position, given one, our spec count; and two, the margins built into our specs, so that even if we have to discount -- and we don't think that we're going to be eroding our overall gross margins significantly. Ordinary course of business.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's really helpful.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes, when we're managing specs as ordinary course of business, the ones that really will receive more discounts are those that are aged. And that's what we really monitor very closely, to manage our specs. And our aged completed specs continue to stay at a very low level.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. That's very interesting. And then secondly, regarding your land spend, you pointed out just now that it is really low. It's actually really the lowest we've seen for a while from you guys. Some people would take that as a sign of confidence that when you start feeling really good about the business, again, that you might actually start coming back into the market and spending more land -- more on land. But from your commentary, it sounds like you're pretty much planning on standing pat for at least the next few quarters -- or next couple of quarters in terms of land spend at this kind of level. Is that a fair characterization? Or are you guys thinking that the land market is starting to look more interesting here?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, it's always interesting. Has been for 30-some odd years, but I'd say that we're -- the key in the land side is to be proactive earlier in the market, just like we do on the acquisition side. So I would say to you, the wonderful thing about where we are today is we were proactive. We have some great subdivisions and masterplan communities that we're bringing in at lower than current prices, which gives us that pricing power. We're proactive in the market. We're always taking a look at opportunities. And I wouldn't describe our land acquisition policy as on the back burner. We're always out there aggressively looking for quality deals that we can make our return on.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. And then lastly, the FHA changes, the loan lumps [ph] coming down and whatnot. And I was just in Florida last week. It was definitely a topic of conversation, but people haven't really been seeing the effect yet. With your commentary about the last week of January -- or the most recent week of January, it would sound like it's not really having much of a bite on your ability to transact. Can you just sort of comment on what you think the loan limit impact is going to be on your business?","Stacey H. Dwyer","It's probably a smaller impact for us now than it would've been a few years ago, because we've already seen the mix of the mortgages that we're writing through our mortgage company come down significantly in the FHA category. I think part of that has been intentional, as they've raised the down payment for the last 3 years and then increased the insurance cost, both on the upfront and the monthly premium. So the cost of an FHA loan compared to an initial loan is getting to be in the same ballpark. So if people had the 5%, they're probably going to choose to put the 5% down. So I'm sure that there will be some places that are impacted, some buyers that are impacted, but there are good alternatives for them with the conventional financing that's available as well.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Rob Hansen on for Nishu. Just kind of noticing over the past few quarters, your total land supply on an absolute basis and on a year supply basis has come down pretty significantly. So I just wanted to see if you could comment on what you think your kind of optimal land supply is here going forward?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, currently, we're sitting on approximately a 2.5-year supply of finished lots, both owned and option. And our total lot supply, both developed -- and our finished and unfinished is right at 5 years. So my definition of a conservative but more than adequate land supply is a 5-year supply. And we're right on that number right now. And 2.5-year supply of finished lots, that gives us more than enough lots to meet the demand and meet the construction cycles and so forth on the land development side. So we think we're well positioned. Those are good numbers, 2.5 and 5.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then kind of given the comments you've made on land prices and a little bit of a slowdown in land spend, I guess you're kind of right around where you need to be in terms of total land. But does this mean that acquisitions may be a better way to pick up land in the future, given your other comments?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, not to create a higher hurdle for Mike sitting over here to my left. But I guess it all depends upon the premium that he has to pay for lot positions.","Mike Murray","Absolutely. It's one strategy to acquire a greater land position, but it's also -- acquisitions give you sometimes a functional capability you didn't have before, or gets you quicker to achieving efficiency in a given functional capability beyond just acquiring land or lots. Always looking at land and lot option positions. And while the spend did come down in the first quarter, as looking at a discrete 3-month window, those -- that's kind of a short window to look at. And it was very -- it was much higher in the prior quarter, a little bit lower in the quarter before that. So it is going to fall up and down as we see the opportunities and when various land transactions close. It's hard to look at any one 3-month period and extrapolate to that. Plus, our development spending has increased as we're bringing more of those land purchases from last fiscal year into production this year.","Donald J. Tomnitz","The key in the land acquisition business is to be able to be opportunistic based upon your inventory of land and loss supply for your expected housing production. And we are right in the right place, right now in terms of where we bought and when we bought. And we're not -- we don't have to be desperate to go out and replace lots. We see land transactions taking place in several of the markets that I've been in recently, where it doesn't make any sense to us -- the prices that some of our competitors are paying for land prices. So again, we feel like that, that 2.5 and 5-year supply at the prices we have, and we can replace those as we see fit and as demand dictates, but we don't have to overreact on the land purchase side.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess, Don, the question of seasonality, as we kind of look at the homebuilders right now, usually, since 1Q decelerates from 4Q it's not abnormal for 2Q to go up from 1Q. Our estimate is you guys usually go up around 50% sequentially. Is that somewhat accurate? Is that a reasonable benchmark for our and perhaps your expectations, if the season is doing well or not? Per absorptions, per community?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I would answer that question, yes, really.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Now as we're seeing differences by region, so the southeast in terms of backlog, it had come down versus other places like -- southwest, excuse me, have come down versus the east. Could you just perhaps comment if these absorptions are different by the regions? Or why we're seeing such swings in those particular markets?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think in particular if you look at the southwest, basically, our ASPs out there are flat. And, essentially, the southwest for us is Phoenix and New Mexico -- or Arizona and New Mexico. So as a result, I just came out of Phoenix and Tucson. And if you look at Phoenix, specifically, this -- at this point in the year, they have about 25,000 or 26,000 existing homes on the market compared to 16,000 last year, so that's a lot of competition for all sellers. Secondly, that the ASPs in calendar year '13 in Phoenix increased 25%, and that's not expected to happen in fiscal year or calendar year '14. But as a result, I think that pricing ran up dramatically and quickly in Phoenix and has plateaued. And I think that it will stay flat to slightly decreased in Phoenix, and maybe to a certain extent in Tucson. But that's the wonderful thing about where DR Horton is and in our footprint, because we're well diversified. And we want to be a bigger builder in Phoenix, but right now is not the right time, given where the demand and the pricing point is. It's a good market for us, but it's not a great market. And it's going to be weaker, I think, in '14 than what it is -- was in '13.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So you're asserting rising existing inventory is hurting the new supply demand?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think if you're a seller in the marketplace, and you have 26,000 homes on the market versus 16,000 homes, I think that notwithstanding the fact there's a percentage of the buyer out there who is a new homebuyer and not an existing homebuyer, that nevertheless that additional inventory in the marketplace creates a more competitive environment.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And do you see pressure from what had been investor-related properties coming back to the market? Or are they in just different locales?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think it's difficult to ascertain what the level of investor ownership is in each one of these markets. And I do believe that the investors are still holding. But as the ASPs flatten year-over-year, I think that'll create more opportunities for those -- or create more reason for those owners to bring those units to market. So you could face more increased competition especially in some of the Sunbelt cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas and so forth, where there has been a huge investor participation. I think there's a possibility those units will start coming back to market and compete with all sellers.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Joel Locker from FBN Securities.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","I just was curious on your tax rate. It was around 35%. What do you expect going forward in the rest of '14 and '15?","Bill W. Wheat","For the remainder of '14, we would expect to be between 35% and 36% this year. The primary difference this year is that we're going to able -- we expect to be able to fully utilize the domestic production activities deduction, which has been limited for the last few years as we've been utilizing our NOL carryforward. We've now fully utilized our federal NOL carryforward, so now we'll get that deduction, which helps to offset our overall tax rate. So our expectation's between 35% and 36%.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","And what about 2015, is that going to be any different?","Bill W. Wheat","Based on what we can see right now, I wouldn't guide to anything really different than that. There could be changes between now and then. But as of right now, I wouldn't see any significant difference from '14.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Your average order price was up 10% year-over-year which is fantastic, but it was sequentially flat. And I wanted to get a view, with the opening ASP for orders of 275,000, what should we expect for modeling purposes? And how should we think about it moving forward through the rest of the year?","Bill W. Wheat","In terms of -- we've seen very good average selling price increases throughout '13. We have stated previously that we -- while we do expect to see some further pricing power into '14 depending on the strength of the market, we don't expect the prices to continue to increase at the same rate. So as we sit here today seeing early results that points towards a strong spring, we would expect to continue to see some further pricing increases over our current levels, but perhaps not the same pace we saw last year.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Would mid-single digit for the full year be a good starting point for thinking about it?","Bill W. Wheat","If you look at the course of history, if you have sales price increases in the mid-single digits, that's a very solid year, so we would certainly take that. We'd expect more, but accept that.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And great job on gross margin, huge move. It also sounds like it's sustainable, which is a great set up for 2014. Can you just give us a framework for thinking about operating margin on a net basis, how you see that moving through the year? Obviously, you have a tailwind with the gross margins, but what's the leverage look like on SG&A? And how much more upside should we be thinking this year in a good setup to the spring selling season, volumes good, pricing is strong so far? Should we be expecting big things out of operating margin performance?","Bill W. Wheat","Well, certainly. As you well know, the whole year will be -- will really be determined by how strong the spring selling season is. So there certainly is some uncertainty about where it can go. But where we stand today with where our backlog margins are, with what we see in our communities across our operation, we feel good about our current margin levels. We feel like we should able to sustain them in the current range. And we certainly expect to continue to be able to leverage SG&A. We've got 20 basis points in the first quarter. We would expect to continue to get further leverage through the year and improve on our previous years' operating margin. Past that, it's really going to depend on the strength that we see in the marketplace as we get into the spring.","Donald J. Tomnitz","A lot of that is a function of the fact that we've been steadfast and holding on to our margins though through the fourth quarter of fiscal year '13 and, clearly, the first quarter. And I will say, with the demand that we're experiencing in the first several weeks of January, I feel like with the limited inventory that's prevalent in the marketplace today, that we should be in a pricing power position -- strong pricing power position in most of our markets on a go-forward basis for fiscal year '14.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You guys have commented traditionally gross margin's been between 20% and 22%. You obviously beat that this quarter. Is there any chance we're seeing a shift towards a higher gross margin range above that 20% to 22%, maybe like 21% to 23%?","Donald J. Tomnitz","It depends upon a couple of factors. If we continue to do a good job of controlling our cost -- our stick-and-brick cost, as we have been doing relative to our sales prices, as well as, as I continue to say, everything that I read, everything that I see in the marketplaces. There's a limited supply of new homes on the marketplace. If the demand is as good as we think it's going to be in fiscal year '14 spring selling season, we will have an opportunity to expand those margins.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Will Randow from Citi.","William Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In regards to your financing business, with the implementation of the Ability to Pay rule, just about 20 days ago, can you talk about any added cost that we should expect, and how that may impact margins? And how have you seen that impact closings of those mortgages as well?","Stacey H. Dwyer","So far, we've not seen any impact on the closing of the mortgages. We have added some level of overhead for additional staffing, because we have implemented additional review processes at different points during the originating process to make sure that we are complying with the new regulation. So the customer's ending up with essentially the same mortgage product, and we've added a few more costs to deliver that product.","William Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Thanks for that, Stacy. And then just a follow-up to an earlier question. Can you talk about the top 5 categories, where you're seeing incremental pressure on input costs? Sounds like land might be one of them but might be stabilizing.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, first of all, it's not impacting our input cost simply because we are not having to buy land at those higher prices today. Clearly, we see a little bit of increase -- potential increase on the drywall side. And I don't know how much that's going to be. But we think it's going to be a low total dollar amount per home. Lumber prices right now have been working in our favor, clearly. The one thing that is pretty constant in our business is that the lumber companies know that we have a strong spring selling season; and typically, lumber prices will increase in the spring selling season as the demand increases. So I would anticipate lumber will do the same thing that it has historically done for some-30 on years I've been in the business. They'll continue to raise prices in the spring. Other than that, those are my reflections. I don't know if you guys have any additional thoughts.","Stacey H. Dwyer","I'd just add labor to the bucket in selected markets just based on the construction level that we're seeing there and the availability of labor amongst the various trades, but that's not a consistent across the nation increase.","Donald J. Tomnitz","But just as a point of order, if you take a look at our year-over-year stick-and-brick cost per square foot, they were up less than what our year-over-year increase in our revenue per square foot is. So we're continuing to be able to raise prices at a faster pace than what we are experiencing cost increases.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Alex Barron from Housing Research Center.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","Strong results. Don, I wanted to just get a little bit better understanding of your enthusiasm for the spring selling season, because last year, spring selling season was pretty darn strong, mortgages were 3.5% or lower, prices were much lower than they are today. So, I guess, I'm just trying to understand, do you think we're going to be able to see higher sales than we did a year ago? Or can you help me out with that?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We, personally, are counting on higher sales this year than a year ago. A couple of factors that I think are impacting that. One is that even though not overly excited about the growth in the economy, the one -- national economy, the one thing that is accurate is that there seems to be a slowing improvement in the overall economy, and that's good for our business. I think that translates into increased jobs, especially permanent jobs or full-time jobs, that will be additive to our business. Also, as I've mentioned earlier, there's been an adaptation to the current mortgage rates by the buyer over the last 4 or 5 years. And I think that's going to be -- or 4 or 5 months, I should say. And I think that's a positive to our business. And I also believe that when buyers are going into communities and looking for new homes, and there's not an excess inventory of new homes, I think that's a positive factor. One of the most negative things about a selling environment is if there's excess inventory in the subdivision, or in the market in particular, because then there's very little urgency on the part of the buyer. So I think the supply side is definitely helping the demand side, if no other reason from a psychological point of view is that there's not a lot of excess inventory out there.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","Okay, that's helpful. The other thing that I was trying to, I guess, understand better was it seems like, obviously, your margins were better, and I think you guys noted that it was because incentives were lower than a year ago. But I would have thought it's the other way around, because it seems like the markets slowed down at the end of 2013 and many builders were increasing incentives, it seems, versus the previous years. So I thought margins would have been under a little bit of pressure. But it seemed like in your case, that wasn't the case. So how is it that you think incentives were lower this year than last year?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think, largely, as we said, Alex, from our fiscal year end '13 conference call is that we were not going to overreact. We looked at the inventory levels across the country and our markets, and we didn't see any excess inventory out there. And as a result, we -- and then especially places like the west, in particular, all the way from Seattle to Portland and northern California to Southern California, there's just not a lot of inventory out there, both in terms of finished lots nor finished homes. And we decided that we would not overreact, and that we would maximize our margins in that area. And if you take a look at the west in particular, our average sales price in the west was up 21%, and our operating margins increased from 9% to 15%. So I feel like that we called it perfectly out there, and we are in a strong position, like I said, in almost all of our markets, and we're going to let the market come to us.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","Okay, that's great. And if I could ask one for Bill. Bill, can you help me on the interest amortized of cost of goods sold versus interest incurred? Are those going to reverse towards each other at some point later this year or not until next year, you think?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, I would expect that gap to narrow over the next year as we began capitalizing all of our interest costs, beginning in Q3 of last year once our active inventory exceeded our debt. The amount of inventory and interest in inventory has started to rise a bit, so I would expect that gap between interest incurred and amortized cost of sales to narrow a bit over time.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jim Krapfel from MorningStar.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","What were the selling prices and cost per square foot in your closings and new orders?","Bill W. Wheat","For closings, our revenue per square foot was $115 for the first quarter.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","How much is that up on a year-over-year basis?","Bill W. Wheat","On a year-over-year basis, that was up...","Donald J. Tomnitz","8.4%.","Bill W. Wheat","8.4%.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","8.4%. And then the cost per square foot?","Stacey H. Dwyer","It was up about 8.2%.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And that's just stick and brick. That's variable construction cost, yes.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Yes, that's stick and brick, sorry. Right, yes. And we do that on homes closed because on homes sold, it's not final, final. Closings, we can actually measure that and know that's a final number.","Donald J. Tomnitz","So as we said earlier, we're continuing to raise our prices faster than our costs are increasing.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","When do the higher underwritten land deals really starts to flow through the P&L?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We anticipate third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year and then throughout fiscal year '15.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And final question, how much would you estimate you're getting in margin benefit just from previously impaired land?","Donald J. Tomnitz","That's very little. That's been declining every quarter for the last 3 years, so it's pretty minimal now.","Stacey H. Dwyer","The majority of our closings are on more recent land.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Right, yes.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. One last question to throw in there. What's the latest activity with small private builders? Are you seeing them become a greater participant in the land market?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I think the land market for most of the small builders is still a difficult proposition, simply because of the fact that banks are not lending, and a lot of those smaller builders are still reliant upon forming LLCs and finding private investors to finance it for them. And obviously, those are at higher interest rates than what you could get from a commercial bank, except that the commercial banks are not lending. So as a result, we still believe the public builder has a very advantageous opportunity, both on the land side, as well as the cost side and the houses. The smaller builders are not that significant a competitive environment for us, simply because of the fact -- the lack of financing.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And you expect that to improve for them going forward in the next year or two?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Oh, at some point in time, I presume the banks will begin lending, but I don't see that imminent on the marketplace. And one of the things that Mike is seeing on the acquisition side are smaller and medium-sized builders who are having difficulty acquiring financing and as a result are soliciting or interested in, I guess, liquidating their companies -- selling their companies. It's very competitive on the financing side out there for small people.","Operator","Our final question today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to go back to the spec inventory that you guys have. And just -- could you help me characterize what kind of specs you're building at this point, whether your mix of specs is more entry-level focused or more of the move-up product that's going out the door? And to what extent your view of mortgage availability this year is influencing the product mix of specs that you're building right now?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Our specs are across all subdivision, all product lines and all price lines. Clearly, from a volume perspective, we're going to have more of them on the entry-level and lesser in the move-up buyer, and even lesser into the second and third time buyer on our annual[ph] side. But clearly, we're, as Stacy said earlier, the heart and the core of D.R. Horton is still that first-time, and to the lesser extent, second-time homebuyer, but that's the vast majority of our focus. And that's where our specs are.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And separate topic. Just going to the idea of investors in the markets. Have you been approached by any single-family rental operators that are out there, some of the larger guys or even smaller guys, that may want to buy new homes and build them for rent purposes? Is that something you guys would consider doing?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We have not been approached to that on a large-scale. That happens from time to time. We're in the business of building, selling and closing single-family homes to individual homebuyers. We have avoided selling blocks of homes to investors. That's not our business, and that's not a business that we want to be in.","Operator","That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Tomnitz for any closing or further comments.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes. Thank you very much. D.R. and I would like to thank all of our D.R. Horton employees. We've done a phenomenal job over the last 3 or 4 years. I can't say enough kudos to you. We continue to outperform our competitors. I've been here for 30 years. We've never been better positioned than we are today for the spring selling season in terms of opportunistic land purchases that we made, finished lot costs that we have in our land development deals as well as our inventory that's in the field. All of our salespeople are totally in a position of power, because you're well inventoried with specs in your communities. And we ask you to do the same thing that we've always asked you to do and that you've done: sell our specs and close them. And let's move onto a fantastic year. We're very optimistic about fiscal year '14. It's the culmination of a lot of hard work over the last 4 or 5 years. And it's time to slam dunk it. Thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude today's teleconference. D.R. Horton would like to thank you for participating today. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."],"6291":["D. R. Horton Inc.

Horton team is off to a strong start in 2018, in the first quarter our consolidated pre-tax income increased 23% to $391.2 million, on a 15% increase in revenue to $3.8 million. Our pre-tax profit margin improves 70 basis points to 11.7% and [technical difficulty] of our homes sold increased 17%. These results reflect the strength of our operational teams and the diverse product offerings across our broad national footprint. Our strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual [technical difficulty] in both revenue and pre-tax profits, while generating positive operating cash flows and increasing our returns.","For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory was 17% an improvement of 110 basis points from 15.9% a year ago, with 27,800 homes in inventory at the end of December and 259,000 lots owned and controlled we are well-positioned for spring selling season and further growth in 2018. Mike?","Mike Murray","Our consolidated pre-tax income for the quarter increased 23% to $391.2 million, compared to $318.1 million a year ago and homebuilding pre-tax income increased 27% to $373.8 million compared to [technical difficulty]. Net income for the first quarter was $189.3 million or $0.49 per diluted share compared to $206.9 million or $0.55 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.","Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted into law in December impacted our current quarter results with a one-time non-cash charge to income tax expense of $108.7 million to reduce our reduce our deferred tax asset, which was partially offset by $41.1 million redemption in current tax expense due to a lower [technical difficulty] rate, lower federal tax rate apply to this quarter's income.","The net impact of the tax legislation was the $67.6 million redemption of net income for the quarter or $0.18 per diluted share. Our backlog conversion rate for the first quarter was 88%. As a result, our first quarter home sales revenues increased 14% to $3.2 billion on 10,788 homes closed, up from $2.8 billion on 9,404 homes closed in the prior year quarter.","Our average closing price for the quarter was $295,200, down 1% from the prior year quarter. This quarter actual homes marketed under our Express Homes brand accounted for 36% of homes closed and 29% of home sales revenue. Our home [technical difficulty] higher end moved and luxury buyers price greater than $500,000, or 6% of homes closed and 15% of home sales revenue.","Our active adult Freedom Homes brand is now being offered in 22 markets across 12 states and customer response to these affordable homes and communities offering a low maintenance lifestyle continue to be positive. Freedom Homes accounted for 2% of homes closed and 1% of home sales revenue in the first quarter.","The value of our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 17% from the prior year quarter to $3.2 billion and home sales increased 16% to 10,753 homes. Our average number of active selling communities increased 1% from the prior year quarter.

Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 20.8%, an improvement of 100 basis points from the prior year quarter and 50 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter. Gross margin increase compared to both periods, primarily due to lower litigation of warranty and interest costs.","And I apologize that we're been told that the call is not coming through clearly and it's breaking up. So we're going to very quickly get off the line and redial back in to see if that makes it better. Our apologies for the inconvenience.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Now rejoining our speakers.","Jessica Hansen","Thank you, Kevin. I'm going to continue with home sales gross margin. Our home sales gross margin will be impacted by the strength of the spring selling season. Based on our first quarter results and current market conditions, we expect our gross margin will be in the range of 20% to 21% for the full fiscal year, with quarterly fluctuations that maybe outside of the range due to product and geographic mix as well as the relative impact of warranties, litigation and interest costs. Bill?","Bill Wheat","In the first quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 9.5%, unchanged from the prior year quarter. This quarter's SG&A includes $5.3 million of transaction cost related to the Forestar acquisition. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our growth. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Financial services pre-tax income in the first quarter was $22.2 million, compared to $26.5 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in profit was primarily from lower pricing on loan origination sales due to competitive pressures in the mortgage market. 96% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. And our mortgage company handled the financing for 56% of upward [ph] in home buyers. SHA and VA loans accounted for 44% of the mortgage company's volume.","Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 719 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 43% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, consistent with the prior year quarter. Mike?","Mike Murray","We ended the first quarter with 27,800 homes in inventory; 15,500 of our total homes were unsold, with 11,200 in various stages of construction and 4,300 completed. Compared to a year ago, we have 13% more homes in inventory, putting us in a strong position for the spring selling season and the rest of fiscal 2018. David?","David Auld","Our homebuilding investment in lots, land and development during the first quarter totaled $954 million, of which $573 million was for finished lots and land acquisitions and $381 million was for land development. Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for new communities remain consistent at a minimum 20% annual pre-tax return on inventory and a return of our initial cash investment within 24 months. We expect our homebuilding operations to invest approximately $4 billion in lots, land and development in 2018. Bill?","Bill Wheat","At December 31st, our homebuilding, land and lot portfolio consisted of 259,000 lots, of which 126,000 or 49% were owned and 133,000 or 51% were controlled through option contracts. 98,000 of our total homebuilding lots were finished, of which 36,000 were owned and 62,000 were optioned. 3,100 of our optioned lots at December 31st were owned by Forestar. We have increased our option lot position 42% from a year ago and we believe we can increase the option portion of our total land and lot pipeline to 60% over the next few years, while maintaining our number of owned lots relatively flat with the current level.","We plan to continue expanding our relationships with land developers across the country, as well as growing our majority owned Forestar land development operations. Our 259,000 homebuilding lot portfolio is a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market and sufficient to support our growth. Mike?","Mike Murray","On October 5th, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar Group, a publicly traded residential land development company for $558 million in cash. D.R. Horton's alignment with Forestar advances our strategy of expanding relationships with land developers across the country to increase our access to optioned land and lot positions and enhance operational efficiency and returns.","The interactions between D.R. Horton and Forestar have been very predictive and we continue to be excited about the value this relationship will create over the long-term for both D.R. Horton and Forestar shareholders. Forestar's operating results for the period subsequent to the acquisition date and as of December 31, 2017 are fully consolidated in our financial segments with the 25% interest D.R. Horton does now reported as non-controlling interest. Forestar's assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date, including $402 million of cash, $345 million of land and low inventories and $20 million of goodwill.","The segment information tables provided in our press release present Forestar's operating results as of December 31, 2017 on its historical cost basis. And the impact of purchase accounting and other adjustments are presented separately. Forestar currently has operations in 16 markets across 11 states. Both D.R. Horton and Forestar are identifying land development opportunities to expand Forestar's platform.","Since the acquisition in October, Forestar has been evaluating approximately 22 opportunities, primarily sourced by D.R. Horton and Forestar closed on six of those opportunities as of December 31st. All of the projects are located in high demand markets that D.R. Horton currently serves. These 22 communities are expected to yield approximately 11,000 finished lots majority of which may be sold to D.R. Horton in accords with the master supply agreement between the two companies. We are also continuing to work with Forestar on plans for its existing projects to improve returns and accelerate cash flows on its legacy portfolio, which will provide capitals to support Forestar's future growth. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Looking forward, during fiscal 2018 we expect Forestar to invest approximately $400 million in land acquisition and development, funded from both existing cash and the cash flow generated from this legacy portfolio.","Also in 2018, we expect Forestar to obtain a bank credit facility to help fund its working capital need. In fiscal 2019, we expect Forestar to access the public market for additional growth capital and over the next three years we expect Forestar's annual deliveries to grow to approximately 10,000 lots by fiscal 2020.","We do not expect Forestar to have a material impact on D.R. Horton's fiscal 2018 earnings, primarily due to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments and intersegment profit deferrals. We will reference Forestar on a future D.R. Horton earnings calls and we expect to update our 2018 guidance for Forestar on our second quarter call in April.","As a public company, Forestar will continue to file quarterly and annual reports and other required public information, but will not host quarterly conference call. D.R. Horton will continue to handle Forestar's Investor Relations to allow the Forestar team to focus solely on operations.","Forestar has historically operated on the calendar year-end and will file its 2017 annual report by mid-March. Forestar has announced that it is changing its fiscal year-end from December 31st to September 30th in 2018, which will align with D.R. Horton's fiscal year. Bill?","Bill Wheat","At December 31st, our homebuilding liquidity included $558 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $877 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage ratio improved 270 basis points from a year ago to 25.9%.","During the quarter, we used $400 million and we issued $400 million of 2.55% senior notes due in 2020 and repaid $400 million of 3.625% senior notes at par. The balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion and we have no senior note maturities in the next 12 months.","During the first quarter, our consolidated cash used in operating activities was $75 million. Excluding Forestar, we used $30.7 million of cash and operations, as we increased our homes under construction in preparation for the spring selling season.","During the quarter we paid cash dividends of $47 million to our shareholders and we repurchase 500,000 shares of our common stock for $25.4 million. Our remaining stock repurchase authorization at December 31, 2017 was $174.6 million.","At December 31st, our stockholders equity was $7.9 billion and book value per share was $20.98, up 12% from a year ago. We are also pleased that S&P recently upgraded D.R. Horton's investment grade corporate credit rating to BBB flat from BBB minus. David?","David Auld","Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet strength, liquidity, consistent earnings growth and cash flow generation are increasing our flexibility, and we plan to utilize our strong position to improve the long-term value of the company.","Our top cash flow priorities are to consolidate market share by investing in our homebuilding business and strategic acquisitions, reduce or maintain debt levels, and return capital to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. After considering the impact of recent tax legislation we now expect to generate at least $700 million of cash from operations in 2018, growing to over $1.25 billion annually in 2020 excluding Forestar. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Looking forward, we are updating our expectations for 2018 based on current market conditions. We now expect to generate a consolidated pre-tax margin of 11.8% to 12%. We still expect consolidated revenues of between $15.5 billion and $16.3 billion and to close between 50,500 and 52,500 homes.","We anticipate our home sales gross margins for fiscal 2018 will be in the range of 20% to 21%, with the potential quarterly fluctuations outside of this range. We estimate our annual homebuilding SG&A expense will be around 8.7%. We expect our financial services operating margin for the year to be around 30%.","We are forecasting a fiscal 2018 income tax rate of approximately 26% excluding the one-time deferred tax asset charge we took this quarter and we expect our outstanding share account to increase by less than 1% this year.","And as David mentioned, we now expect to generate at least $700 million of positive cash flow from operations excluding Forestar in fiscal 2018. Our results this year will be significantly impacted by the strength of the spring selling season and we will update our expectation as necessary each quarter, as visibility to the spring and the full year becomes clear.","For the second quarter of 2018, we expect our number of homes closed will approximate the beginning backlog conversion rate in the range of 97% to 100%. We anticipate our second quarter home sales gross margin will be in the range of 20% to 21% and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the second quarter to be in the range of 9% to 9.2% of homebuilding revenues.","Over the longer term and as we generate increased cash flows, we expect to pay down debt and decrease our leverage, increase our dividend and repurchase shares to offset dilution with the target to keep our outstanding share count flat by 2020. David?","David Auld","In closing, our first quarter's growth in sales, closings and profits is a result of the strength of our people and operating platform. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to continue to expand our industry leading market share. We remained focused on growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while continuing to generate annual positive operating cash flows and improve returns.","We are well positioned to do so, with our solid balance sheet, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offering across our D.R. Horton, Emerald Express and Freedom brands, attractive finished lot and land position and most importantly, our outstanding team across the country.","We thank the entire D.R. Horton team for their continued focus and hard work, and we look forward to growing and improving our operations together in 2018, as we celebrate our 40th anniversary year.","This concludes the prepared remarks. We will now host any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Please proceed with your question.","Carl Reichardt","Good morning everybody. I see Don's still controlling SG&A relative to the phone system. But I wanted to ask a little bit about gross margin, which was better than what we expected and I know we will see the numbers come out a little bit later. But did you have any issues - obviously you have got spec up, but did you have any issues getting homes out of backlog this quarter? And was there any significant mix impact from the higher margin markets that helped you?","Mike Murray","No Carl, it was just a solid quarter, backlog conversion was solid, our core margins throughout the business have been very stable. And really our outlook going forward is continuing very stable on a core margin basis. We did see lower impact from litigation and warranty this quarter.","I would say back to a more normal level there we've had an elevated level the last several quarters as well as we continue to see a steady decline in the interest component, the interest costs and our margin which was a contribution this quarter as well. But primarily lower litigation warranty and interest and just solid stable margins on a core basis and as we look forward same outlook there.","Carl Reichardt","Okay, thanks Bill. And then David, I'm interested in your perspective on some of the markets where you don't have as much penetration. I know we expect you to continue to try to invest to consolidate share in the markets where you've already have presence. But markets like the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic the Midwest can you comment at all about your thought process there, in terms of potential growth in those markets? Thanks.","David Auld","Carl we've spend a lot of time last two or three years looking at those markets kind of repositioning within those markets. And my personal belief is that those are going to be a big part of our company kind of going forward.","Carl Reichardt","Thanks, David.","David Auld","In the markets there are a lot of people there and there is no reason for us not to be number one in those markets, just like we are number one in Texas market.","Carl Reichardt","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now live.","John Lovallo","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. The first one is on the comments around the intention for Forestar to access the capital markets in fiscal year 2019. I guess the question would be, any thoughts on whether this is going to be equity or debt? And then is the goal overtime to still kind of dilute that stake down to closer to 25% in accordance with the master supply agreement?","Mike Murray","John, this is Mike. We have not yet decided what makes the most sense between debt or equity right now. Possibly a bit of a blend in any as we do intended to drift down our ownership percentage overtime. But today, we're focused first and foremost on building and growing the platform.","John Lovallo","Okay, that's helpful. And then, if I heard this correctly, did you guys comment on community count in the quarter being up about 1%. And if that is the case, how comfortable are you with being able to continue to push absorption?","Jessica Hansen","Very comfortable with continuing to push absorption that was the story. Obviously once again this quarter we were up 1% year-over-year, sequentially we tick down slightly, I believe about 2%. The details will be at in our supplementary data after the call, but we'd continue to expect our community count to be relatively flat to slightly up or down as we move throughout the year.","Mike Murray","And John, our product diversity is really helping drive that absorption as we're introducing Freedom into some of our communities where we have other brands there as well, that's helping us increase our absorption. We really see the potential for that for the remainder of this year.","John Lovallo","Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.","Stephen East","Thank you. Good morning guys. Just a follow on, on Forestar and surprisingly here, you've identified about 22 deals you brought on about 6. Could you talk about where they're located first of all? And then I have a couple of other questions on Forestar.","Mike Murray","Our 22 deals portfolio right now it's the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, Texas and Washington.","Stephen East","All right, got you. And then Mike, what's the limiting factor as you move through the year and into fiscal 2019 as far as converting those 22 and whatever else you're seeing converting those to going on to the balance sheet of Forestar? And then could you repeat for me, how many lots you expect to use from Forestar in 2020, I missed that.","Mike Murray","In 2020, we expect to have around 10,000 lot deliveries coming out of Forestar. So there is really, the limiting factor is people growing the team and the processes. We feel like we've got adequate capital for the foreseeable future into 2019 before we think about a capital raise, and feeling very good about our growth path and trajectory. The additions to the teams we've made so far have been strong. And we think that's going to lead to more growth in the platform.","Stephen East","Okay. And the limiting factor I guess on that growth. And I guess if you're already looking at 11,000 lots to have only 10,000 in 2020, I guess surprises me a little bit.","Mike Murray","The 11,000 would be the total inventory in the lots. The 10,000 would be the annual deliveries. So they'll be holding on inventory of several years supply and then - but we expect them to be delivering 10,000 a year out of those deals by 2020 development.","Stephen East","Got you, okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is now live.","Alan Ratner","Hey, guys. Good morning, nice quarter. So first question on the gross margin, really strong results this quarter and you're bumping the low end of the range that you've talked about. It seems like forever, it's at 19 to 21 up 100 basis points. Then the items you mentioned in the release that really drove the upside this quarter, the litigation, the warranty. They're certainly lumpy, but they seem a little bit more one-time in nature, and they can move around a lot.","So I was hoping you could just expand a little bit upon like what you're seeing in the market that gives you the confidence to raise that low end? And maybe just expand a little bit on pricing power that you're seeing especially in the face of rising rates that we've seen over the last month or two?","Bill Wheat","Yes, Alan we're just seeing really stable strong market out there. Limited inventory, certainly the ability to raise prices obviously in our more affordable product where we're very careful about the pace at which we raise price. Because we want to make sure we can keep an affordable product out there, but the markets very solid, very strong. Certainly we expect to continue to see some cost increases, but our ability to either offset that through other categories or to offset that with some modest price increases we believe is still there. So just overall market tone just feels very stable, very steady, and our outlook for margin is solid for the year.","Jessica Hansen","We continue to see our purchasing teams across the country do a fantastic job on controlling costs. We believe our business model plays very nicely into that particularly with Express. But our revenues per square foot did outpace our stick-and-brick increase per square foot on a year-over-year basis again this quarter. So more of the same we're still seeing labor cost pressures and material costs relatively net neutral.","Alan Ratner","Great, thanks for that detail. Good to hear. And then the second quarter I know it's really early, but I'm hoping if you could just give some rough parameters here. When you look at the 22 opportunities you're looking at the Forestar and even if you want to drilling more on the 6 that you've closed, can you give us a little bit of a sense of what type of margin underwriting we should think about for Horton as you actually deliver homes on those lots as well as what Forestar will actually report on a development margin when they sell the land to Horton?","Just trying to figure out how much different from the 20% to 21% you're talking about. Should we expect on those Forestar deals and what type of margin are you embedding for the developer? Thank you.","Mike Murray","We continue to focus on the returns of those projects as we look at it from both the Forestar side and the Horton side. And we're looking at high teens, are very incrementally positive returns to the Forestar portfolio and continuing to underwrite to a 20% or plus return on inventory metric on the home builder side.","Those are the primary underwriting metrics that we're looking at. And so that's where we're focusing and the margins will vary.","Alan Ratner","Okay, got it. Thanks guys, good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Zener","Good morning everybody.","David Auld","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zener","So your guidance is up, and the gross margin is good, your orders hit seasonality, my question is relative to your total units in inventory your 27,300 versus 24.5 last year. That low teens growth is good, but I wonder why the spec component - the growth rate in the spec component has declined. Is there something about your orders being stronger in terms of backlog or why did that component of units in inventory declined year-over-year when that's obviously a component that enables you to gain share by building spec ahead of other builders?","Jessica Hansen","Our spec count is actually up 16% year-over-year Ken, I don't know if that's part of what was cutting out on our call, we do apologize for the in and out earlier.","Ken Zener","Okay. So what is your total units in inventory 27.3 and what's your spec count?","Jessica Hansen","Our total units in inventory is 27,800 and our spec count is about 15,500.","Ken Zener","Okay. And is that the gross margin guidance there, I know you're obviously working on a lot of different things, but you were the first company really to cut gross margins in order to get the pace up. Is there something that you're doing to get this slight upward revision in gross margins, I mean, is it if labor is there, material is there why are you getting this upward tick? Could you readdress that? Thank you.","David Auld","We've been working very, very hard to improve efficiency deliveries in the delivery of the product, take labor out of it. If you look at our ASP on closed houses we actually saw a slight dip this last quarter, while we improved margins. And that's just the combination of a lot of really hard work in getting product positioned to be more competitive and drive a better return and - which is now translating into - it has been stable margins, but we saw a little uptick this last quarter.","Ken Zener","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Rehaut","Thanks, good morning everyone. First question, I just wanted to make sure I got the best feel for it and I apologize if you answered this earlier might have been when you were little more statically. But the drivers of the gross margin increase for fiscal 2018 you highlighted that the kind of the upside or the higher end of the range in the first quarter was due to the litigation warranty also a little bit of less interest cost and that that has become more stable than previous years.","So am I to infer then that the raise for the full year is also driven by these two factors primarily and obviously continue that good end markets and being able to roughly offset costs inflation, which are all very good positives. But that the lower litigation warranty and perhaps the less interest as a percent of revenue, those are that the main drivers of the increase for the full year?","Mike Murray","Yes, Mike that is the primary driver, I would say it's the reason why we haven't been able to raise our margin guidance prior to this. We were seeing a trend that was affecting our margin, that trend has moderated. We believe it's at a more stable level today and we continue to see a very stable outlook in the core of our business.","Mike Rehaut","Right, okay great. No, that's helpful. And also then on Forestar, with the 10,000 deliveries that you expect the company to achieve in 2020, I guess, that's a year ahead of the original slideshow presentation and expectations, also you have now you talked about 22 deals of that are being evaluated, six have already closed. And I believe in the original guidance, you were looking for eight deals to be close in the first year.","So, is this - are we to kind of conclude that maybe would Forestar would be doing perhaps in the 10,000 to 15,000 range in the first year and that kind of as you look at further years out, if it's 10,000 in 2020, the 15,000 goal that you had I believe in 2022 could be something on the order of a 20 to 25 type number?","Bill Wheat","I think we indicated last quarter we thought that we would be able to exceed those June projections, that were out there and we try to update that a bit right now with the 2020 goal of 10,000 deliveries. And very pleased with the flow of projects and opportunities that Forestar has been able to evaluate. But we will be updating our guidance for the balance of 2018, with some more details in April. We'll be a little more comfortable I think to share a little more granularity in what we see in interim periods.","Mike Rehaut","Okay. And just one last quick one if I could, the operating margin guidance being raised by 30 bps versus the gross margin guidance raised by 50 bps. What's the reconciliation there?","Jessica Hansen","We reduced our financial services operating margin, we have set 30% to 32%, now we're saying around 30%. The operating margin was only about 27.5% in the first quarter and we are seeing competitive pressures in the mortgage market, it's really reverting to what we would consider to be a normalized operating margin, whereas the last of couple of years they have seen outsized margins in their business.","Mike Rehaut","Okay, perfect. Yes, I was thinking operating homebuilding margin. So thanks for that clarification.","Jessica Hansen","Yes, [indiscernible] consolidated pre-tax margin of 11.8% to 12%.","Mike Rehaut","Got it, thanks a lot.","Jessica Hansen","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.","Stephen Kim","Thanks a lot guys, really impressive results. My first question relates to the comment you made David, about the importance of discipline and I think that's something that really has been a focus I know of yours in the company and in the management team over the last few years. With respect to discipline, we were looking at your ROA across your regions recently and I was kind of surprised to see just how wide the spread of returns on assets were across your different reporting regions, it was actually among the widest we have seen - we see in the group.","And I was curious, if you just sort of comment on the degree - why we are not seeing the discipline and the controls and the overall strength of Horton not also manifest itself in perhaps somewhat more similar returns across the regions, if that's even a meaningful metric or goal or aspiration at all and if not, why not?","David Auld","Every one of these markets are different and we do operate with a very decentralized approach to what we're doing we think that gives us that ability to scale up and operate in markets profitably other people have a difficult time entering. When I look at these operations and like the Northeast or Arizona a couple of years ago, actually opportunities get better and that's what we're striving to do is overtime get better. If you look at the longevity of our people you see that we've - I think in a way lead the industry and been able to keep people in markets for the longest period of time that's very important to me.","So we don't have a top down approach to it, we don't have a quick trigger on changing people out. We work with people striving to get better and build on their relationships within those markets to create long-term value for the shareholders. And that's been the philosophy of Don Horton, Donald and something I shared.","Stephen Kim","Great. I appreciate that, thanks. If I could extend the question again a little bit in a slightly different way talking about discipline. We've also been very intrigued to note that this cycle is the first housing up cycle where we've seen eight consecutive years of housing start increases. That's never happened in the history of the country. So while housing may still be as cyclical as it ever was, it has been noticeably less volatile than in prior cycles.","And I was curious if you could talk about if you think housing demand is more likely it's likely become more volatile in the next couple of years in a potentially rising rate environment. And how you think D.R. Horton's discipline in the market particularly maybe with respect to your spec strategy and incentives? How that might be more visible or visible in a more volatile market if we were to have one?","Bill Wheat","Steve, we've been expecting to see higher interest rates for a quite few years. We feel that's very important to maintain an affordable product out there in any environment. And that's really still the most underserved segment of the market today is at the affordable end of the price range. So as we go into a period where we're now interest rates are rising, we believe we're in a very good position to compete in that scenario. Our decentralized operations also allow us to respond to individual market trends when changes in local economies affect the housing market. But overall, we're very pleased with the position that we're in.","Mike Murray","And also look at the recovery. It has been eight years of increasing housing starts, but they're increasing from a very low level at a very slow trajectory relative to continued population growth household formations. So the under building so to speak, that was occurring. We're still working out against that. And there has been discipline in the industry with amongst the players and not being overbuilt.","David Auld","I think, the other contributing factor to what has extended this housing cycle has been the lack of financing for small builders and independent developers. That typically that's how the market gets oversupplied. Lawyers become developers and doctors become lawyers and it's a - they put product out there that there is no demand for. And what's you're not seeing and it's not just the D.R. Horton it's all the builders. Much more disciplined, we all went through that downturn. And we didn't enjoy. So we've got a great market working for us today. And it's just a matter of positioning and execution. And we did pretty well in that environment.","Stephen Kim","Great, thanks a lot guys and best of luck.","Mike Murray","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jack Micenko from Susquehanna. Your line is now live.","Soham Bhonsle","Hey, good morning guys. This is Soham on for Jack today. My first question was on capital allocation. And just coming back to what you guys said in your opening comments on priorities going forward in the other of paying down debt, raising dividend and purchasing shares to offset dilution. Just curious you mentioned raising dividends. So just wondering, what's driving the decision to favoring a dividend increase over share repurchase at this time?","Bill Wheat","We've always been a steady dividend payer. That has typically been our preferred method of distribution to shareholders through the years and it continues to be. We have more recently begun to pull then some level of repurchases of shares and we expect that to now become part of our consistent distributions as well. But that's really been the - our historical pattern on distributions to shareholders through dividends.","Mike Murray","We went from no share repurchases in the year ago quarter to up to 0.5 million shares repurchased in the most recent quarter. So seeing an increase in return there and our focus would also be looking for opportunities to invest in the business and continue to take advantage of market opportunities that we see, as a high priority for our capital.","Soham Bhonsle","Okay. And then I guess one Forestar, as we think about gross margins and SG&A for that business. Is 40% on the gross margin the right level to think about? And then what is the SG&A percentage look like on the 10,000 lot basis that you guys just referred too? Just trying to think through the longer-term pre-tax profile for the business?","Bill Wheat","Right, we're focused like we are at the homebuilder, we're focused on the returns and the Forestar team is focused on the returns as the primary metrics that are guiding their decisions. And we'll get back with some more updated guidance information after Forestar reports their full annual results in mid-March when we come back with our April call.","Soham Bhonsle","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Nishu Sood","Thank you. First, thinking about the 60% optioned lot target which you folks have mentioned again here and I think you have been talking about that pretty consistently. How do we think about the increment from here at 50% to 60% relative to Forestar? The 10,000 lot deliveries by 2020 would seem to make up - would seem to help make up most of that progress from 50% to 60%. Is that roughly where that difference is going to come from? Or am I not thinking about that credit because of the consolidation of Forestar?","Mike Murray","I think you are going see it coming from both sources the third-party land developers as well as Forestar. The exact mix between those two still kind of working that out, but I do feel really good that both - we'll have both the expanded relationships with developers as well as certainly an increased supply from Forestar for our lot position.","Nishu Sood","Got it, thanks. And in terms of mortgage rates obviously some concern about those having picked up. Now you folks have been pretty consistent in describing that if rates are rising relative to a better growth pattern that's fine. But if there is a sharp move, continued sharp move in rates during the spring selling season, what level on the third year would worry you, is it the 4.5%, 5% how are you thinking about that heading into the spring selling season?","Jessica Hansen","There is no certain rate really an issue as you said it really is based on how sharp they rise. So if they do rise very sharply in a short period of time, we would expect some period of impact, while buyers' mindset resets and adjust to that higher rate. But as long as we're offering affordable homes that people can afford, which we think we are doing today even with a decent rising rates. We feel good about the overall spring selling season in really sales as we move throughout 2018.","David Auld","With the increase in rents that we've seen in the market, the payment at 4% or 4.5% is even close to 5%, still going to be less than rent amounts. So it's - these are great rates. And what we have seen is that the uncertainty in rates is pushing people off the accounts [ph], and is actually increasing demand right now. So, we're looking at each market individually and positioning within that market to meet our targets, feel pretty good about it.","Nishu Sood","Got it, thanks for the color.","Mike Murray","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Dahl from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Dahl","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First question, just another high level question around how to think about the impact of Forestar and I guess if we're thinking about these 10,000 lots or as you go up further clearly more. But these are deals that buy and large would have otherwise been either been either sourced to other third party partners or brought on your own books if I'm - or A, would be am I thinking about that correctly; and then B, if so is it then more of an issue from an accounting standpoint of you'll capture the additional margin on having developed those lots through Forestar versus outsourcing them to total third party? Or is it truly a - so is it a margin gain or is it a -line gain in your view as far as the contributions from Forestar?","Mike Murray","Well the goal of Forestar is for them to be a large well capitalized national land developer that ultimately will not be on our balance sheet. And so while we're in the process of doing right now is putting deals in place to build a pipeline just help them build that foundation and build that platform across the country. Ultimately what that will provide when they are capitalized, when the foundation is built, when they're across the country and they're off our balance sheet the returns on D.R. Horton side will grow because we will have a more efficient balance sheet.","There are profits to be made in the land development business and Forestar will make a solid profit, a solid return on the investments that they are making. And we will earn our portion of the profits on the Forestar business. But in the short run here for the next year or two we are in the process of building out that platform and putting them in position to deliver a more substantial portion of our lots down the line and to build a profitable strong returning business on a standalone basis.","Michael Dahl","Got it. Okay, thanks. And the second question, I guess, if you could just I know it's still a small piece of the business, but in the midst of a meaningful ramp over the course of this year and next before looking at Freedom homes. Could you give us an update on how we should be thinking about that ramp over the course of 2018 and any details you can give us on what type of sales pace you're observing in those communities relative to your other brands?","David Auld","We've pushed this into 22 markets we're actively working on every market we've got introducing the Freedom, it's a little bit different in that set up on the community HOA documents are a little more restricted than what typically be a Horton community. So it has been a situation where we are having to put lots on the ground to support that brand. It's a huge buyer segment, buyer demographic and they are much less interest rate sensitive. So we think it's going to be a significant impact to growth if not this year next year then certainly three to five year period.","Mike Murray","Steady growth is the expectation within a few quarters it's at now 2% of our overall mix, we would expect to see steady growth going forward throughout 2018 and 2019.","Michael Dahl","Okay, thank you.","David Auld","Where we can put those projects on the ground and execute it well. They have outperformed and very excited about it.","Michael Dahl","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Oppenheim from UBS. Your line is now live.","Dan Oppenheim","Thanks very much. I was wondering about the issues the specs and the rate environment here. Wondering what you're seeing in terms of the consumer respond are you seeing that this period of where mortgage rates is actually increasing the attractiveness of specs with the sorter closing time? And also wondering as others talked about spec in terms of just the potential for lower margins are you seeing that or are you seeing that the specs are coming through essentially the same margins as to be built on?","Mike Murray","Specs have consistently been a significant part of our business operations and those margins that we see now reflects 70% to 80% spec home deliveries every quarter and have for a long-long time. So we're not seeing anything, but solid margin performance across our communities and that's reflective of a lot of spec deliveries, which is very helpful as we compete with not just other new home sales, but with existing home sales as well.","David Auld","Our operators are very disciplined. We're not just throwing inventory out there we plan our spec starts based upon demand within that community and position it to create a most efficiency we can building these houses through the - on a month-to-month week-to-week basis, which is part of our overall program. And I believe, we believe that it is the reason we've been able to maintain such stable margins for the past three, four years.","Jessica Hansen","And Dan, in terms of the rate environment we haven't seen any impact to our traffic or sales in January as a result of mortgage rates, actually very pleased with our sales pace and in line with our business plan as we're finishing out the month here today.","Dan Oppenheim","Jessica I specially meant more in terms of just does the - do the specs actually service incentive and help the conversion rate of traffic people can then close in?","David Auld","Absolutely.","Dan Oppenheim","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Jade Rahmani","Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could give your updated thoughts around integrated off-site solutions in terms of preconstruction of various aspects of the home. How much potential do you see in this trend over several years?","Mike Murray","We continue to look at different ways to be more efficient in the building process and we in various markets and we do penalization, in other markets it's more restrictable process and in a lot of places it's a combination of both on-site always looking for the most efficient way to deliver affordable home. But we continue to watch that and at this time, we don't really have any kind of a codified view on what impact that will have on the awarding, but with something rest assure that we're watching continually.","Jade Rahmani","And can you also comment on labor availability and cost pressures, related to labor constraints. How are you managing that and where would you say the problems are most acute?","Mike Murray","The problem really hasn't manifested itself for us, broadly across the board we - our spec strategy, our disciplined starting program of working to give an absorption in the community has allowed us to get the labor we need. From a high-level monitor overall build to see if we are having issues delivering homes and we've not seen any kind of elongation in our build cycle by our field production teams. They have done a great job staying on top of the labor. And then with the cost we have seen some increases in stick-and-brick cost that it varies from quarter-to-quarter is to how it's manifesting itself. But for the most part we have been able to get the pricing power to cover any of the cost increases that have come through.","Jade Rahmani","Thanks very much.","Mike Murray","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now live.","Buck Horne","Thanks, good morning. I had a question on labor, but that get answered as well. So I'll ask a question that I get a lot from my clients. Just about the tax law changes and how you guys might internally be thinking about, if these changes the standard deductions, state and local taxes and mortgage interest deductibility. Do you think that has any meaningful effect on buyer behavior, maybe between certain states this year or even next?","Mike Murray","Buck with the homes we're looking to deliver primarily affordable homes that whatever customer segment we're serving. We are not expecting a significant negative impacted at all from the tax rate changes. In fact we're hopeful it put more money in people's pockets that they are more emboldened to be confident to make the decision to go and buy that new home and to buy an affordable home from D.R. Horton.","David Auld","Buck the alternative is rents and if you want to lock in your housing costs, you pretty much got home and build equity [ph] all the time. So it's a strong economy, more money in their pockets those are both ramps for D.R. Horton.","Buck Horne","Okay, thank you. And just a quick follow-up, have you guys given any thought to partnering or working with other single family rental operators for product that may be built for rent if that type of opportunity presented itself?","David Auld","We get pitched a lot of things from a lot of different people. Right now we are very happy with the absorptions we're driving selling to single family homeowners. And to me you put too many renters in a community owned by one company you can end up creating problems for the homeowners. So, if that was a way to drive absorption and we were looking to drive absorption then we probably we think more about it. But right now today we like the model we work under and feel like we are offering long-term value to our homeowners and that's a winning combination for us.","Buck Horne","Thanks, that's very helpful, I appreciate it. Great quarter guys, thank you.","David Auld","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","David Auld","Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking to you again in April, to share our second quarter results. And to the D.R. Horton team, thank you for a strong first quarter and an outstanding start to 2018. We are proud to represent you up here. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."],"6524":["DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) Q4 2013 Earnings Call November 12, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Donald J.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Donald Tomnitz, President and CEO for D.R. Horton. Thank you, Mr. Tomnitz, you may begin.","Donald J.

As always, before we get started, Stacey?","Stacey H.

Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you. In fiscal year 2013, we experienced significant improvement on our homebuilding operating results. Our investments in home in inventory -- homes in inventory, land, lots, and development positioned us to take advantage of a sharp increase in demand for new homes in the first half of the fiscal year. And we also benefited from rising sales prices as housing supplies struggled to catch up with demand. Our results from homebuilding and financial services were highlighted by $657.8 million of pretax income and a 10.5% pretax operating margin. Our strong pretax operating margin was driven by 310-basis point year-over-year improvement in our home sales gross margin to 20.8% and 100-basis point improvement in our SG&A expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues to 10.7%. The value of our net sales orders in fiscal 2013 increased 37% due to a 19% increase in homes sold and a 15% increase on our average selling price to $261,400. We experienced strong pricing throughout fiscal 2013 with very solid demand during the first half of the year. In the September quarter, our gross sales were up year-over-year by 19% in dollars and 3% on homes sold. Our cancellation rate increased to 31% during the quarter, resulting in a net sales increase of 14% in dollar value and a 2% decrease in net homes sold.","Our fourth quarter sales reflect a moderation in demand that started in mid-May and lasted through September, as economic conditions remained sluggish and potential homebuyers adjusted to both higher mortgage rates and increasing home prices. However, we saw improved sales trends in October as our net sales orders and dollar value increased year-over-year and were higher than any month in the September quarter. We are now in the slowest seasonal sales period of the year, so our next good read on sales demand will be after the traditional spring selling season begins in February. We believe the housing market remains in a period of recovery. And our expectation continues to be that the pace of the recovery will vary across our local operating markets and will be closely tied to improvements in each market's economy, as measured by growth in jobs, household incomes, household formations and increases in consumer confidence. We have seen a significant increase in housing demand during the past 2 years, but demand still remains below normal historical levels across most of our markets, which leaves opportunity for further improvement. Pricing has recovered sharply in certain markets, but still has room to increase in many other markets. We have also continued to proactively control our rate of sales while raising prices in some of our strongest performing communities, to ensure that our sales pace and backlog align with our construction cycles, which have lengthened slightly. This ensures that our construction costs are certain before we establish the sales price of the home, which enhances our gross margins and profitability. Mike?","Mike Murray","Our net sales orders in the fourth quarter reflected our pricing power across many of our markets and our increased mix of move-up buyers, as the value of net sales orders increased 14% and our average sales price increased to $276,800. The value of our backlog increased 33% from a year ago to $2.2 billion with an average sales price per home of $269,400, and homes in backlog increased 13% to 8,205 homes. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","In the fourth quarter, our consolidated pretax income increased 104% to $202.8 million from $99.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Our pretax income as a percentage of consolidated revenue was 10.9%, an increase of 350 basis points from 7.4% in the year-ago quarter. Homebuilding pretax income more than doubled to $189.4 million from $85.7 million, and financial services pretax income decreased slightly to $13.4 million from $13.5 million. Net income for the fourth quarter was $139.5 million or $0.40 per diluted share compared to $100.1 million or $0.30 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Mike?","Mike Murray","Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 40% to $1.8 billion on 6,866 homes closed, up from $1.3 billion on 5,575 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $262,500, up 14% compared to the prior year, driven by pricing power and an increased mix of larger move-up homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the quarter was 69% compared to 76% in the prior-year quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we expect our conversion rate to be around 65%, trending back down to a more normal historical rate. This also reflects our continuing mix shift to larger homes with longer construction cycles and delivering more built-to-order homes than in recent years. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter were 21.9%, up 380 basis points from the year-ago period. 250 basis points of the margin increase was due to improving market conditions resulting in reduced incentives and higher average selling prices in excess of cost increases. 80 basis points was due to lower relative costs for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenue, and the remaining 50 basis points of the margin increase was due to lower amortized interest and property taxes.","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue for the fiscal year was 20.8%, up 310 basis points from the prior year. 210 basis points of the increase was due to improving market conditions, 60 basis points was due to lower relative warranty and construction defect costs and 40 basis points was due to lower amortized interest and property taxes.","During the fourth quarter, we recorded $5.9 million in land option charges for write-offs of earnest money deposits, and due diligence costs for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded $21.2 million of impairment charges related primarily to longer-term projects that we held through the downturn and recently decided to sell as is to redeploy the capital into more productive assets. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Homebuilding SG&A expense for the quarter was $186.6 million compared to $145.9 million in the prior-year quarter. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A improved 90 basis points to 10.3% from 11.2%. We continue to leverage our fixed costs structure while at the same time building our sales and production capabilities where necessary.","For fiscal 2013, homebuilding SG&A expense was $649.9 million compared to $528.7 million in fiscal 2012. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A improved 180 basis points to 10.7% from 12.5% a year ago as we made significant progress toward returning to our annual SG&A goal of 10%. In the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2014, we expect our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues to increase seasonally from our most recent quarter as we typically deliver fewer homes in the first half of the fiscal year than in the second half. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Since our active inventory exceeded our debt level, we recorded no direct interest expense this quarter compared to $4.9 million of homebuilding interest expense in the year-ago quarter. For the year, we expensed $5.1 million of homebuilding interest compared to $23.6 million in the prior year. We expect that our active inventory will continue to exceed our debt in fiscal 2014. The improvements in our home -- in our gross profit percentage, SG&A expense ratio and interest expense expanded our homebuilding pretax margin to 10.4% in the current quarter, an increase of 380 basis points from 6.6% in the year-ago quarter. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Financial services pretax income for the quarter was $13.4 million, down slightly from $13.5 million in the year-ago quarter. This quarter reflected a more competitive pricing environment, whereas the first part of this year and the prior fiscal year benefited from unusually favorable market conditions, which produced higher-than-normal gain on sales of mortgages. 88% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. Our mortgage company handled the financing for 53% of our homebuyers this quarter, with virtually all loans meeting eligibility requirements for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. FHA and VA loans accounted for 45% of our mortgage company's volume this quarter, down from 51% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company during the quarter had an average FICO score of 723 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. First-time homebuyers represented 43% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter compared to 53% in the year-ago quarter. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Since June, our construction in progress and finished homes inventory increased by approximately $312 million, excluding noncash items. We had 17,000 homes in inventory at the end of September, of which 1,300 of our homes were models, 9,000 were speculative homes and 3,000 of the specs were completed. Our average community count for the quarter increased 17% from a year ago.","In our fourth fiscal quarter, our investments in lots, land and development totaled $552 million, of which $215 million was for land development, $183 million was to purchase finished lots and $154 million was to purchase land. During the fiscal year, we invested $2.6 billion in land, lots and development. At September 30, 2013, we owned 127,000 lots and controlled 54,000 lots through option contracts. 33,000 of our owned lots and 29,000 of our option lots are finished. We are very well positioned to meet demand in fiscal 2014 and 2015 with our 181,000 total lots owned and controlled. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Our unrestricted homebuilding cash totaled $913 million at fiscal year end. During the quarter, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility from $600 million to $725 million and extended its maturity date to September 2018. At September 30, we had available capacity on our revolving credit facility of $663 million and no cash borrowings outstanding. The balance of our public notes outstanding at September 30 was $3.3 billion. At September 30, our homebuilding leverage ratio net of cash was 36.7%, and our gross homebuilding leverage was 44.6%.

Regent operates in Charlotte, Greensboro and Winston Salem, North Carolina. We acquired approximately 240 homes in inventory, 300 lots and control of an additional 600 lots through option contracts. We also acquired a sales backlog of 213 homes valued at $31.1 million. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","In closing, this quarter was D.R. Horton's most profitable fourth quarter since 2006, with $202.8 million of pretax income. The majority of our operating metrics improved on a year-over-year basis this quarter. The value of our sales, closings and backlog increased by 14%, 40% and 33%, respectively. Our pretax income increased 104%. Our pretax income margin increased 350 basis points to 10.9%. Our gross margin on home sales revenues increased 380 basis points. Our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues improved 90 basis points. Our average sales price increased 16% as we experienced pricing power in many of our markets and as our expanded move-up and luxury product offerings have received a very positive reception from our customers.","Finally, we would like to welcome David Auld to his new position as Chief Operating Officer for D.R. Horton. David will oversee all homebuilding regions and will play a solid role in guiding our operations. David has been with a company for 25 years, and we welcome his extensive operating experience to our executive team. Congratulations, Brother Auld. We would like to personally thank all of our D.R. Horton team. You are executing our business plan superbly, which is why our company continues to perform so well with improving margins, profitability and returns, continue taking good care of our customers and outperforming in fiscal 2014.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now host any questions you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from David Goldberg with UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to first talk a little about mortgage underwriting in the market today. We've heard from a number of banks that we've seen -- that there are overlays that they are putting on FHA mortgages are loosening. And I want an idea if you guys are seeing any of that in your business. Obviously not necessarily in the FICO scores coming down at all, but do you see loosening with your clients, and do you think that's going to help us to kind of get into the selling season next year?","Stacey H. Dwyer","David, we've not seen any significant changes in the underwriting standards that are available to our customers. We have seen certain banks, which have had more restrictive overlays, now begin to make those overlays less restrictive so they match what's currently in the market. But in terms of an overall loosening, we're not seeing anything significant.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then my follow-up question, it seems like we've kind of hit this slow patch in the market and everyone -- it feels like most of the builders are general playing well in the sandbox and nobody's starting to discount really heavily. Do you think that if the slowdown were to continue, and just based on your historical experience, do you think if it were to continue into the selling season, do you think you would see more of your competitors start to discount, start to get more aggressive to drive sales volumes? Or you think everyone kind of realizes that might be kind of a zero-sum game at this point?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I don't think there's any question that will start with incentives if -- the pace continues into the strong selling season around Super Bowl Sunday. Currently, even though we were down slightly in terms of units in the quarter, we were still up 14% in terms of sales dollars. We think that's a great relationship. And currently, we're not overreacting because this is normally a slow part of the season. But we have plans in place coming January to make sure that we drive the right amount of the absorptions relative to our margins, because it's a balancing act. And we've got plans on a community-by-community basis, and I'm sure other builders probably will follow suit.","Bill W. Wheat","And in general, I think we'll see different activity from market to market, and that will depend largely on what the inventory levels are. In general, most of our markets' inventory levels are either low or imbalanced and to the extent that inventory levels are not out of line or higher than where demand is I think you'll see builders adjust their production schedules, to match demand, which then would not require as much incentives. But right now, we think we're on great position. We're up 14% in terms of sales dollars in the fourth quarter, and we're going to see what happens and we're going to adjust accordingly.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask first about the soft patch that we've seen in demand since the summer. When it first unfolded, I think a lot of folks in the market were imagining since it was rate driven, at least partially if not significantly, that the historic pattern of the first-time buyer being harder hit would generally play out. And that was the perception. But as the soft patch has dragged down a little bit, it's become clear that it's a little bit broader based than that. I wanted to ask for your folks' thoughts on that with your special insights into the first-time buyer market. Is it just the first-time buyers that are principally what's driving this weakness, or what do you folks see?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think it's applying across all product and price lines, to be frank with you. And I don't mean to date myself, but as I sat around and look at the people here, no one around this table can remember mortgage rates being higher than 6% or 7%. And I think one of the factors that we are dealing with, quite frankly, is most analysts and most young buyers, especially first-time homebuyers in the market today, are -- have been accustomed to low rates for all their lives. So I do know one thing: Rates are going to go up and we're going to have to deal with those on a go-forward basis. But I think rates going up will indicate that the economy is doing better. We're creating jobs, and I think that will be good for the economy and that will be good for us.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And I also wanted to ask about -- in your product mix, you folks mentioned having had some success in some of your move-up in your luxury product. I also noticed that you mentioned the decline in your mortgage subsidiary in terms of the first-time buyer going from 53% to 43%. So I wanted to ask about your product mix strategy going forward here. I mean, obviously, you have shifted more towards the move-up buyer. Is that something you would expect to continue? And is that stat out of the mortgage subsidiary is that just an anomaly this quarter? Is that reflective of the products mix shift?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, clearly, we have expanded our Emerald and our upper price point, and we're getting very good reception in the marketplace from that. But be clear, we're expanding our business in all price points and all product lines, whether it be the low end, the mid-priced or the high end. And Stacey can speak more specifically to that.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Yes, and I think you are seeing that flow through in our mortgage company because they are primarily focused on our business. So the mix of their results is probably a decent indication of what we're seeing in the home buyer -- excuse me, in the homebuilder. Just as a point of reference, in Q4, the number of homes that we closed over $500,000 was just under 5% compared to 3% last year. But the dollars have grown a little more significantly, they are now 12.6% compared to 8.3%. But as Don mentioned, we do plan to stay very focused on the first-time buyer and the first-time move-up. So in terms of trying to get where that number's going, we don't have complete clarity.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And I would say also something driving that 53%, 44% relationship in terms of first-time buyers being down is that, as we expand that higher price point, you're dealing with a more second- or third-time buyer, and they're a little bit more familiar with the financial system, and a lot of those people drive their home mortgages, and they have other mortgage companies as opposed to just DHI Mortgage company that they've done business with in the past. So a lot of that has to do with their relationships in the marketplace as opposed to a first-time buyer who, in many times, has never dealt with a mortgage company.","Bill W. Wheat","From a longer-term historical perspective, historically, our normal percentage of our business that was first-time buyers was around 40%, 35% to 40% range. So we continue to move closer to that longer-term historical range, and our mix is really getting back to normal levels.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I think a quarter or so ago, you guys were really the first to indicate that you saw -- you were witnessing some effect from interest rates on the business. And also, you were one of the first to talk about a bit of a shift in your land-buying strategy to really focusing on lots where you felt like you could recoup your investment relatively quickly. And particularly on that second point, I observed that your land spend this quarter, if you look at your land spend as a percentage of revs, it's kind of in the low side relative to your peer group, indicating that you've been a little bit more cautious in buying land than your peers. I was curious if you could comment on whether you expect land values to get incrementally more attractive over the course of the next several months. Or what in general your land-buying policy is today with respect to an eye for recouping your investment quickly?","Donald J. Tomnitz","As you know, Steve, land prices continue to go down very slowly and go up very rapidly. And as we have adjusted our land purchases, I believe the same is happening in the rest of the industry. And we're beginning to see somewhat more cooperation from our land seller today than what we were getting 6, 9, 12 months ago just simply because there's less demand in the marketplace today. And I think that will be reflective come the spring, depending upon how well sales go in the spring. But land sellers could -- will adjust accordingly. But generally speaking, land prices haven't come down, but they're a lot more flexible on terms, it seems like, than what they were 6 and 9 months ago.","Bill W. Wheat","And Steve, I think a little bit of the slower activity you saw this quarter certainly is reflective. When we see a little bit softer sales environment, then we certainly do adjust our spending. But it also is reflective of the fact that we built up our lot supply very nicely in fiscal '12 and the first half of fiscal '13. So we're in a very good position from a lot supply and really don't need to add too much here in the short term. So we have some flexibility in when we pick and choose to go make our investments.","Donald J. Tomnitz","As D.R. would say, we made some good purchases over the last 12 months. We are bringing those raw land purchases into development, have them bringing them under development. And so our feeling is, is that we're in a great position with lower-priced land hopefully than our competitors since we bought a little bit earlier, and we ought to be able to help supplement and protect our gross margins on a go-forward basis with the new good projects that we're bringing on at Horton.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, great, that's very helpful. If we could -- I wanted to ask you a follow-up question with respect to land. This quarter, you took some charges for walking away from options and also impairing some older lots you were pointing out. I guess first of all, can you give us a sense for the options that you decided to walk away from, roughly what vintage are we talking about? Not an exact year, but I mean, are we talking like this was stuff that was recently purchased or older stuff? And then with respect to the impairments, if you can give us a sense for whether or not there are additional lots that are out there that you own that are sort of -- you're sort of mulling it over. They're kind of close of the threshold where you'd say, \"Well, this is something that we might want to sort of walk away from.\" Or if you feel like what we saw this quarter was pretty much it?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I'll let Bill handle the second part of the question. The first part, I'd like to speak to specifically and that is we did walk away from earnest money deposits and due diligence expenses on land deals that we were working, but as the market slowed, we didn't want to acquire those lots because we didn't need those lots. So I learned and we have learned years ago, your cheapest walkaway is your earnest money as opposed to buying some piece of land or buying some lots that you really don't need in your inventory. That's what we chose to do. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","So an option to walk away is clearly -- those are land deals we've been currently working over the last months, several quarters, perhaps over the last year. In terms of the projects that we took the charges on, those were projects that we have owned for a number of years that we bought pre-downturn. And as we evaluated our best return opportunities, we had, had plans to build through those projects but our returns were going to be very low. And so as we evaluated those, we determined our best option was to sell them in the short term and reinvest our cash into better opportunities. On a regular basis, we disclose our overall evaluation for potential charges and the number of projects that we continue to evaluate, but that list has continued to get smaller over time. And I believe it will continue to as long as we continue to see market recovery. There certainly could be additional projects in the future. But as of right now, we believe that everything that we're going to move that requires a charge at its current time has been taken.","Donald J. Tomnitz","In a couple of instances, we basically, what drove it was we had offers from buyers to purchase it, and we were forced to make a decision as to whether we want to keep it or take the cash in today. And we chose to take the bird in the hand.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Mike Roxland from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just first question, your pricing was better than we were modeling and yet volumes were a little bit lighter and overall gross margins were better than we were expecting. Was there anything from a cost vantage point in the quarter that benefited you? Was it lumber? Was it OSB? Or maybe was it just lower basis land that's beginning -- that still continuing to flow through the P&L?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We're still dealing with increased costs right for this quarter. And for the fiscal year, we've been able to increase our sales prices faster than what we have experienced our cost increases. But we still have good, strong cost increases from our subs and our manufacturers, and that we think that will continue into calendar year 2014. Our goal from our national purchasing, as well as from a local purchasing perspective, is to continue to hold those costs down. And we believe that we're in a preeminent position to do that just simply because in most of our markets, we are the largest builder. We're starting more homes than most people, and we're the largest builder nationally, which certainly helps us with our national contracts. So we're proactive in terms of those respects, but so far, we have been able to increase our prices faster than our costs have increased.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, very helpful. Just last question, I wanted to get a sense from you as how you see margins progressing next year or two. You achieved a 29% gross margin this quarter. The last time you achieved this type of margin was back in 2006. So how much further do you think margins can go especially as the higher cost land you're purchasing either today or like a month ago starts to flow through your P&L?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, first of all, we're not purchasing as much land today or in the past 6 months at a higher cost. We feel like that we're in a preeminent position based upon our purchases 12 and 18 months ago that we're developing and bringing the market here for fiscal year '14. But as Stacey likes to say, we've increased our margins and we're hanging on to every bit as strongly as we can. And that's going to be really impacted, I think, clearly when it comes to the Spring selling season, and we have specific absorptions for community by community. And I don't want anybody to think that we're sitting here asleep at the wheel because we have a plan for each one of our communities, to hit a specific absorption level and a gross margin level, and we're going to fine-tune that with the ROI. So we're going to drive our absorptions and keep in mind our gross margins and our ROI.","Stacey H. Dwyer","We've seen a significant improvement on our gross margins primarily as we saw sharp jumps in prices in certain markets because demand was outpacing the housing supply. And so we've now recovered into a normal operating range. As we move forward, and as the supply is catching up to demand, we will still do everything we can to improve our gross margins. But our expectation is that the increases in sales price will moderate as we have caught up on the demand side, and until we see more substantial improvement in the overall economy and in the economy of our individual markets.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And as we said in our conference call script, we have had price increases on a number of our markets significant last year, but there are other markets where we haven't experienced that kind of increase. So we're hoping that those markets that have had a lesser increase in 2013 will have a stronger increase in '14 and help us maintain our gross margins or even hopefully improve them. But right now, I would agree with Stacy. We -- it's going to be a lot more difficult to improve our margins on the scale we did in '13 and '14.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Eli Hackel from Goldman Sachs.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just want to go back to your October comment, better than any of the month in the quarter. Was that driven by anything related to incentives? Was traffic constant from the third quarter -- from the fourth quarter into October, and maybe they just ended up closing in October? Just curious about the comments that you made there.","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, it's difficult know exactly what's caused it. But just anecdotally, we do hear that there could be a little bit of pickup in demand. And certainly buyers have had an opportunity to adjust now to higher rates, prices out in the marketplace are probably increasing quite at the paces they were in as many communities, so I think certainly buyers could be coming back. There could be some level of incentives that are a little bit more than you may be seeing in some of our communities or with some other builders. It could be there. But we're just pleased to see certainly some pickup in demand in October.","Donald J. Tomnitz","That's a good point, Bill, because as D.R. remembers when he sat in a model home himself self-selling homes, when the interest rates go up, you have a dearth of traffic there for 1 week or 2 as people are adjusting to the higher rates. And I think Bill makes a great point, and that is sales prices have increased dramatically in a lot of markets over the course of fiscal year '12. They are much more muted today. And I think the buyers are clearly getting more comfortable with where pricing is today. And they're beginning to become more comfortable with where rates are today. And as homebuilder, I would say based upon all my years of experience, as I told Stacey a few moments ago, if you're waiting for a better rate and a better house price, you're going to wait and you're going to find higher rates and higher house prices. So I think they're coming to -- a number of buyers are coming to the conclusion that rates are not that high, home prices are not that high and today is a great time to buy.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just one more question on the land. It sounds like you're saying you're spending a little bit less now than you were. I mean, I don't need your specific 2014 guidance, but do you think you'll end up spending less in '14 than you did in '13?","Bill W. Wheat","In terms of a land acquisition today, it will really be determined based on where we see the sales environment in the Spring. But today, our expectations is we will purchase less land in '14 than '13. However, our land development spending is increasing quite a bit as we develop the land that we bought in fiscal '12 and '13 and bring new communities in line. So our overall investments may not go down, but I think the mix will shift definitely more towards more development.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk about your orders geographically, and not at the metro level but just maybe in your reporting regions, there's a bit of a variance in terms of the different year-over-year changes. And so could you just talk about that in light of also comment on how much community count may have impacted some of those different regions?","Bill W. Wheat","Sure. As we look across our regions on a year-over-year basis for the quarter on sales, clearly, our largest 2 regions in the Southeast and the South Central had very solid results up in both units and then also seeing very good double-digit improvements in average selling prices. That's the core of our operation, and we certainly saw good results there. As we see good demand, there's a lot more job growth and more dynamic economies in many of those markets. On the flip side, you can see our next largest region in the West, units were down or number of homes were down 15%, but our total value was up by 12%. So there, that's reflective of significant pricing increases in the West. And I would say in general, we probably have more of our communities where we are pacing our rate of sales to our construction pace in our West region than in other places.","Donald J. Tomnitz","If you look at that West, that is totally reflective of what Horton did in the quarter, but most importantly in the fiscal year. I'm not going to apologize for being down 2% on units. But if you look at our total dollars of sales being up 14%, that's a great metric. And we could have driven the volume more, but we chose to collect the profits and focus on the dollars and increase our average sales prices market to market.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the second question is, can you offer -- can you provide any preliminary outlook on expected community count growth in 2014?","Bill W. Wheat","We would expect it to continue to be up. I think the rate of increase, we're at 17% this quarter. I don't know that the rate of increase will continue that high on a year-over-year basis, but we do expect it to continue to be up on a year-over-year basis, at least for the next couple of quarters.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Dan Oppenheim from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk a little bit in terms of the spec homes that you have in terms of the 3,000 completed and the 9,000 under construction right now. Just wondering if this is where you want them to be? So what percentage of sales during the quarter were specs in October that you bring this down at all in terms of the better sales activity there?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We're sitting at about a 53% spec ratio today. And I would say to you that we have adequate inventory in each one of our markets to meet our current demand. And certainly in this time of the year, we expect our specs to work their way downward simply as we sell our existing specs, so that we can put new and fresh inventory out there come February and March when the selling season begins. And our percentage of specs that we sold -- stays pretty much somewhere in the 60% range each quarter.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And so no effort to bring that down and to bring the spec sales up in October and bring the level down?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We would like to increase sales and we'd like to increase specs, of course, Dan. And we're working on trying to bring the specs down slightly so that we can refresh some of our inventory out there.","Bill W. Wheat","We're in that normal range, so no major adjustments at all.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Yes. And, Dan, one of the things we've seen, too, is the spec percentage tends to follow our first-time home buyer percentage. So we've seen our first-time home buyer percentage trending down. It's entirely possible that specs may move down a little bit, too, because more of the higher-priced homes stay in backlog longer and people choose to do more customization to build jobs.","Donald J. Tomnitz","But we kept our spec percentage pretty much the same year after year after year after year. And Horton has always had slightly higher specs than other builders largely because we focus on doing a lot of business with realtors as opposed to spending advertising dollars. And as I've said many times before, realtors have one thing in common. They like to collect their commission as quickly as they possibly can. And that runs in conjunction with our homebuyers who, especially in this type of rate environment, are trying to take advantage of the interest rates before change. So we have a buyer who, when get qualified, they want to close as quickly as they can before rates move up and they can't qualify any longer. And the realtors who represent a huge percentage of our sales on a month-to-month basis, they want to be able to collect their commission in a 30-day period as opposed to a 4- or 5-month period on a build job.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Joel Locker from FBN Securities.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just on amortized interest, that's about 160 basis points in gross margins. What do you expect that for 2014?","Bill W. Wheat","Joel, it's been declining as our overall leverage has remained lower. It's probably at pretty close to its low point as we're now capitalizing all of our interest. We're not directly expensing any now. I think our capitalized interest in inventory will rise a bit, a little bit closer to our historic levels and then the level of amortized through cost of sales could increase slightly as well. I don't expect any dramatic shifts though from here.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Right. And on community count, what did you end the quarter with? I mean, how much was it up sequentially from, say, June 30 to September 30?","Bill W. Wheat","1% sequentially.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Stephen East from ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Bill, you mentioned in community growth not as high in '14 as in '13. Is that purely internal issues? Are you seeing stuff -- getting things approved, getting through the pipeline, all of that. We hear it in some markets, didn't know if that was an issue. And also, when you look at the pricing that you think you'll be bringing your communities out this year, how does that compare to what type of gross margins you're getting today versus underwriting? Are we higher, lower, about what you expected as you went through the underwriting process?","Bill W. Wheat","In recent quarters, our community count has been up 15% to 20% in that range, which is pretty significant. By and large, I would expect over the next couple of quarters for the communities to come online reflective of our land spend in fiscal '12 and '13. Our land spend in more recent quarters has moderated a bit from those levels. I would expect community count to continue to increase of the same pace, although we expect it to continue to increase certainly. In terms of our margin expectations on our new communities, that's one of the areas that we have very, very strong expectations. We feel very good about the investments that we've made in fiscal '12 and early '13. We certainly set strong margin hurdles for those projects, and we've seen market improvement on -- in general since we made those purchases. So our expectations is the margins should come in very good there, which hopefully can provide some lift to our margins. Or if we see some softening in the market and perhaps incentives rise or anything like that, that provides us some cushion and some flexibility to hopefully allow us to keep or maintain our margins up in the level where we are today.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great answer. And then if we look -- your SG&A surprised me a little bit. It ran about 70% of sales growth. Your SG&A growth was about 70% of your sales growth. Anything unusual going on there? Is that stepping up the Emerald division? Is there something else moving there, because always are typically outstanding on this line?","Bill W. Wheat","First thing to point out, Steven, is that if you're looking at sequential growth from Q3 to Q4, as we talked about last quarter, in Q3, our SG&A benefited by 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue due simply to changes in our compensation accruals due to our stock price decrease last quarter. So the sequential change is affected by that 40-basis point benefit last quarter. And when we look at it exclusive of that, the change in the quarter is more closely in our historical trends.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And I would also say to you as our business has grown, we've added more employees throughout the year. And we've been slow to hire. And as a result, a lot of that what you see working its way through the SG&A has just been the realization that we needed to hire more people to be able to grow our business.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. And then just the last thing I had. One housekeeping item is, what were the land sales and the revenues? And then Stacey, your Emerald division, could you just talk a little bit about that, about where you all are, where would you ultimately like to have that as a percentage of your business, that type of thing?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I'd say is we're at the very formative stages with our Emerald division. And we haven't rolled out in the number of communities, some of which we are developing lots. So we don't have the products online yet. But the product offerings have essentially been from about $500,000 up to typically $1.2 million, $1.5 million, except for Palo Alto in California where we basically had a higher-priced homes, and that's just based upon the lot price. But we are receiving the amenity level in these homes, to finish out using different subs to build that product line is extraordinary. And if you ever have a chance to get into one of our Emerald communities, you'd be astounded of the high level of finish out and the quality of the floor plans and the quality of the exteriors. And so as a result, we don't know where we can take that business. But certainly, we look at other builders who are focused on that segment of the business, and we feel like that we can continue to make strong inroads into their business and grow our segment of the business of Emerald.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the land sales and revs?","Bill W. Wheat","Land sale revs were $15.8 million for the quarter, $61.1 million for the year. And margin in the quarter was 23.4% on those land sales and 16.7% for the year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Could you repeat the operating details on Regent especially the units that are going into backlog?","Bill W. Wheat","Regent backlog units were 231 units in backlog -- 213 units in backlog and a $31.1 million sales value. We acquired 240 homes in inventory and 300 lots. We also assumed control of another 600 lots in the process.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right. As with the markets slowing down a little bit, has the opportunities for similar deals increased? Are you seeing more deal flow coming across?","Bill W. Wheat","We're always looking at all transactions that we see coming across. And I would say that we had seen a bit of an uptick lately with the folks exploring their alternatives, people that have been through a few cycles. And maybe they're trying to time the top of the market and maybe they're looking at the market cycle. Whatever's driving it, we are seeing more deal flow.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. And if I can sneak one more in. What should we expect for the tax rate for next year?","Bill W. Wheat","Around 37%, could fluctuate a little bit either side of that, but around 37% is our current expectation.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a question just on pricing trends throughout the fourth quarter. DT, you mentioned that you're trying to hold the line in incentives -- on incentives, and maybe your actions might be different seeing how things might come together in January. But I believe if I'm not mistaken in the past, you may be referred to, to a degree -- or maybe other builders have, I apologize if it hasn't been yourselves, but kind of percent of communities where you've been able to raise price and maybe by what degree of magnitude? Certainly things have slowed in the fourth quarter, but it does appear that you're still largely at minimum holding the line on price, if not raising in some areas. So I was just trying to get a sense, if you could give us an idea what percent of communities you have been able to raise price either through higher base price or lower incentives and on the flip side, what percent -- what percent you might have had to raise incentives here or there and how that contrasts to the previous quarter?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I can answer that question very briefly. Thank goodness we've never told you that information. You must have had us confused with someone else. Generally speaking, clearly, the demand has been more muted in this past quarter. And this, as I said earlier, is our normal seasonally slow period. And again, given the fact that we are up 14% in terms of total dollar sales in the quarter, we're not going to overreact. I don't want to overreact, and it's not the time to overreact. We had a wonderful September. And that was probably driven some by increased demand just off the top from people getting more familiar with the mortgage rates, more familiar with the housing prices. But we are also in certain areas, certain communities also having sales programs, sales contests and that sort of thing, division by division, community by community selective basis. So in those areas, we are offering some incentives to drive that increase. But we're not going to overreact. We're going to wait see what happens in January and February. But as I want to reiterate, we are totally prepared on a community-by-community basis, the sales programs for each one of those communities in place ready to implement based upon us wanting to meet a certain absorption level in each one of those communities.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And, Don, when you said happy with September, were you referring to October actually, the bounce back there?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I was, thank you.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just on October itself, is October typically a stronger month than September? Maybe there was some type of bounce back? Again, people getting more used to the new environment and -- or would you expect as November and December typically would be more of a slower -- as you get into the quarter, would you expect that to be continuing more of a normal seasonality?","Stacey H. Dwyer","The normal seasonality would be you'd see your strongest sales in March and April. And then you'd begin to see just a slow decline throughout the rest of the calendar year, with acceleration into January and February. So October is a seasonally slower time of the year. It's typically lower than September. We've also seen this pattern before that we actually saw it last year. So our October comp was a very tough comp because last year, we saw the same thing with October being higher than September.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one last one, if I could. The SG&A you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you expect to be seasonally higher in the first half of the year. Assuming that you'll have -- it appears given the backlog and the backlog ASP, still a decent, I'd expect at least low double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Can we still expect year-over-year leverage?","Bill W. Wheat","That would be our expectation, yes.","Operator","Our next question is coming from David Williams from Williams Financial Group.","David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to see if you might be able to shed a little color on what you're seeing in maybe some of the A- and maybe B community? You guys seem to have a little better position maybe outside the city centers. And just kind of looking for a little commentary on what you're seeing as far as traffic in those areas?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We do count our traffic, and I don't focus so much on the traffic as I do the hit ratio that our sales people hit because can have -- you can be in a great community with a lot of traffic and if you don't have a salesperson who has what we call, high kill ratio, then you're not going to have nearly as many sales. So what we're focusing on is just how many traffic units do they convert to contracts. And generally speaking, our traffic was up in October as our sales, and we'll continue to monitor that as we go forward. Although in November and December, those are typically our slowest months of the fiscal year just simply because of the holiday season. And so we don't have any great expectations about November and December. But clearly, we do have great expectations about January, February and March.","David Neil Williams - Williams Financial Group, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then secondly, just on your cycle times, you'd mentioned that those that become a little more elongated. Can you frame that maybe with a little -- with days of change there?","Bill W. Wheat","It's not significant. We're talking in terms of no more than a 2- or 3-week difference really over the last 12 to 18 months. Still, the vast majority of our homes are constructed in the same range they always have, but within the ranges they have shifted no more than 2 or 3 weeks. But that's enough to move the needle a little bit for us.","Donald J. Tomnitz","It's also being lengthened by our Emerald product line taking longer to construct. And quite frankly, subs have been somewhat slow to grow their businesses simply because of the fact that they don't want to go back to 2005 and 2006. They want to keep their businesses slightly smaller. So there are times when we take the next subdivision to a framer or an electrician or a plumber and they say, \"well, take it to somebody else.\" And so we've had to in certain instances look for other subs to backfill existing sub base simply because they've been through the merry-go-round once before and they don't want to go down the hill again.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to find out on the options walkaway cost, that was a pickup sequentially. And wanted to ask if of you expect that to trend higher driven by any change in your view on some of the deals that you currently have under contract.","Donald J. Tomnitz","We evaluate each one of those deals on a weekly and even a daily basis because all of those land contracts, whether they be option or all-cash purchases come up here. And we are evaluating where our performance has been in the subdivision, what are -- in terms of gross margins and what are our absorptions have been, and relative to our next take -- takedown requirement and if we believe that we have adequate lots. We don't want to do the next takedown, we try to extend the contract. But we're not going to bank lots in a deal where we're making marginal gross margins. The cheaper route is to close it down and go someplace else, redeploy our capital where we can achieve a higher ROI.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Just directionally, Jade, that was our highest number for a while. So directionally on average, we would expect that to probably come down going forward, but it will be lumpy. I mean, those decisions don't happen on a normal basis. They happen basically at a decision point where we have to make a go-forward or not go-forward decision.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And frankly, it's really -- it factors on a division by division, city by city, market by market basis all relative to what we're doing in that market in terms of returns and how much capital we want to commit to that market and where we can redeploy that capital if we can get a higher return.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And in addition to the takedown time line, is pricing also up for negotiation or renegotiation?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Absolutely. I sent an email up to all of our regional presidents and division presidents about 4 or 5 months ago and said, \"Hey, the land market is slowing down. Now is a good time to go back and see if we can get some of the lot price back, the negotiation downward into the sales price of a lot.\" And sometimes, we're successful, sometimes we're not. But it's -- I love D.R.'s comment, \"You'll never know till you ask.\"","Bill W. Wheat","Right. These runoffs reflect after we've gone through every other possibility, whether it's delaying the takes, reducing the takes, suggesting the price, all of those things. We explore all of those things before we determine that we're not going to move forward.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Great. And just on the cancellation rate, do you have a sense for how much of that was normal seasonality? I think historically in the fourth quarter, the cancellation rate does tend to pick up.","Bill W. Wheat","We've seen a little bit of that in the past. But I believe it was more driven by just the general adjustment that potential homebuyers were going through. We saw a little bit of that towards the end of Q3 and then that continued on into Q4. We didn't necessarily comment on it because one month is a little difficult to measure in terms of can rates. But we did see our can rate come back down a bit in the month of October when we saw a little bit better sales.","Donald J. Tomnitz","But an important point, just because we can someone because all of a sudden, they couldn't qualify under the existing mortgage, we have what we call the Home Buyers Club, and those people will go into that club or we'll keep them on the list. And 1 of 2 ways, we're going to still try to figure out how to put them in a home, house price or a rate that they can afford. And just because they can't qualify at a specific rate at our current sales price, they might elect them, they might be able to get them in a slightly smaller home. Bottom line is get them in a home today, let them experience that appreciation so they have something, some basis on their money to get the appreciation and be able to be a future buyer of another home, perhaps the one that they couldn't afford today, 3 or 4 years out.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Alex Barr\u00f3n from Housing Research Center.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","I wanted to ask about that acquisition that you did. How -- what was the timing, like was it at the beginning of this quarter or just very recently? Like how many homes did those guys deliver last year?","Bill W. Wheat","That acquisition occurred, in the first week of October, it closed. And they closed probably about 400 homes in the 12 months leading up to that.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","Okay, got it. And with regards to your tax rate this quarter, obviously, I think throughout this year, you guys have been reversing part of the remaining DTA. Was there some of that this quarter, and what is your remaining DTA valuation allowance?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, we have been seeing some of that activity in the valuation allowance and other -- there's other tax adjustments that occur in the fourth quarter. We'll have full disclosure around all of our tax balances, DTA valuation allowances and everything in our 10-K. I don't have all those details here in front of me today, but we'll have all those in our 10-K that we'll file here in a week or so.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","Got it. And Don, I guess in your comments about you're not -- you're saying you're not becoming -- what was the word you used? Well, you said that you would evaluate what goes on in the next few months. Are you seeing anybody that is kind of acting irrational in your view?","Donald J. Tomnitz","No, not really. Clearly, as builders approach their fiscal year end, certain builders, they begin to offer incentives to hit their expected or desired closings or sales for the year. And so you always have that, Alex, and it all depends upon what month their fiscal year ends. So yes, we experienced some of that in a couple of months ago. But generally speaking, I think people are acting rational. And frankly over the course of the past 18 months or so, most of us have been, I wouldn't call struggling, but we've been striving to meet the demand in the marketplace and been experiencing good pricing. I think everybody in the industry should be glad to be back to decent demand and decent margin and decent pretax income possibilities on a go-forward basis. So right now, everybody's playing in the sandbox pretty well.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","In regards to the Home Buyers Club that you talked about a few questions ago, one thing we've seen is the private mortgage insurers have begun to fall out a little bit and move a little bit further down FICO. And at least one is now running MI down to the 620 level. And I'm curious if you begun to see any of that out of the mortgage company and sort of expanding the buyer pace on the entry-level side. And if that's something -- I think you said 720-ish was the average FICO for the quarter. Where was that number back in sort of more normalized time, sort of '03, '04, '02 kind of time frame, trying to get a sense of how much sort of buyer pool opening up that could possibly be?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Okay. In reverse order, the FICO score was about 723 this quarter. Historically, we would have expected something closer to 710, so not a huge difference from where we are today. In terms of the MI product and the expanded pool of buyers, we're not hearing anything significant about that. I can ask our mortgage company, if you'd like me to, and we can follow back up with you.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then have you -- recent reports talking about some of the builders selling some sort of closeout homes to some of the REITs. Are you active in any of that on the closeout side or some of the specs that maybe hung around in the past? Or is that something you've looked at in the past?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Absolutely not. No interest whatsoever.","Operator","Next question is coming from Jim Krapfel for Morningstar.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You mentioned walking away from optioned land just to increase flexibility? And does general experience during the downturn caused you to rethink your land spend next going forward towards more options?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, we would like to do 100% options if we could, but there are markets where we cannot. And simply because the developers aren't large enough or there aren't enough people well capitalized enough to provide us our lots on a timely basis in a cost-effective basis. So frankly, right now, if you take a look at our finished lots, we have about half of them that we own and about half of them that were optioned and that's probably a pretty normal percentage for us. Like I said, it would be nice to have 100% options with $100 earnest money up on each contract, but that's not feasible.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Do you see the supply of optioned land coming back any time next couple of years?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Actually, I don't. I think what we focused on over the course of the past 18 months is the reason we stepped up our land spend over the last 18 months there for a while was because there weren't option lots available. And so therefore we needed to get back in the business of being a land developer to provide us the necessary lots to meet the demand. And it just varies by market by market. I do know one thing. Right now, the banks are reluctant to lend on a very favorable basis to private developers to the extent that many of them are requiring 50% equity in the deal to develop the lots. So for a large builder like ourselves, well capitalized, we're in a preeminent position to be able to be a developer and provide ourselves lots at a cost-effective and timely basis.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then second question, what were your selling prices per square foot in closings and new orders?","Stacey H. Dwyer","We -- I think we have that information available on the closings. We probably don't have it on the sale. Bill is looking right now.","Donald J. Tomnitz","We don't have that readily available. Why don't we just -- again with permission to get back to him later?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Yes, we'll follow back up with you, Jim.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Robert Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is actually Desi filling in for Bob. In the financial services business, you highlighted that the competitive environment has become less favorable. Did you start to see this shift in prior quarters or was it the first quarter that's really impacted you?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Can you restate -- to restate your question, please?","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sure. So in the financial services business, you highlighted that the competitive environment had become less favorable during the quarter. Do you see that in prior quarters, or was this really the first time that it impacted you?","Stacey H. Dwyer","This was the first quarter that it really showed up in our operating margin. So you saw us running from around 40% operating margin to a lower level this quarter. Basically, there's a lot of capacity in the market origination business right now. Refis have dwindled as rates moved up. And so there's more competition for the business that's still available.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Would you say that current environment is normal or do you still see it as stable relative to historical trends?","Stacey H. Dwyer","This quarter probably falls right in the middle of what we would consider normalized historical trend.","Operator","Our final question today is coming from Susan Berliner from JPMorgan.","Susan Berliner - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just want to get a little more detail, if you can, with regards to the markets. I know you talked about the regions, the West being really strong. But I was wondering if you could talk about any specific markets that are showing any slowdown, and highlight those markets that are doing really well?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I have been reluctant to do that for a long time, and I apologize. I know that we have one of our competitors who seems to walk through and rate each market, and I always wait for their rating of the markets. I hate to give any specific color to you on that because we're very -- I guess we like to focus on our own markets and we don't like to give our competitors any indication of where we've got stronger or weaker markets. So I would apologize, but I prefer not to answer that question.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to the floor back over to Mr. Tomnitz for any further or closing comments.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Kevin, thank you very much for being a great moderator. We always appreciate you having us on our -- you on our call. To all of our D.R. Horton employees, we've come a long way, as the Virginia Slims commercial says. Since the '07, '08 and '09 period, we -- you've turned in a stellar year for us in fiscal year '13. We are looking forward to the same and better, obviously, in fiscal year '14. And we're optimistic with our existing land position that we bought over the last 2 to 3 years and with us bringing those projects under development. And we believe we're looking forward to being able to maintain and increase our gross margins in the year ahead and we're looking forward to increase demand in fiscal year '14 over '13.

Tomnitz","Thank you. The spring selling season did arrive this year and it is still in full swing. Our net sales orders were up 55% sequentially from the December quarter and up 19% from our second quarter last year. Our average sales price increased to $222,700 during the quarter and the value of our net sales orders increased 28% compared to the year-ago quarter.","We've also seen continued sales strength into April. Our sales this quarter resulted in a 17% year-over-year increase in our backlog units, which puts us in a strong position for increased revenue and profitability in the second half of fiscal 2012.","In response to our improving sales, we have increased our homes under construction while reducing our spec percentage to 50%, which is the lowest level in recent history. We are also evaluating and selectively investing in land acquisition and development.","We're using our strong operating position and our solid balance sheet to profitably grow our business in the current housing environment. We are demonstrating our ability to leverage our fixed costs while increasing production in response to stronger demand in our communities, even though macroeconomic and housing conditions remain soft.","We see uneven improvement across our operating markets with some markets experience in increases in demand and others remaining weak. However, we are finding opportunities to take market share and existing markets while evaluating the attractive new sub-markets. We continue to dominate the entry-level market while expanding our product offerings for move-up buyers. We are optimistic for the remainder of fiscal year 2012, after recording net income of $68.3 million for the first 6 months. Mike?","Mike Murray","In the second quarter, our Homebuilding operations generated pretax income of $34.6 million and our Financial Services operations generated pretax income of $7.7 million. Our net income for the quarter increased 46% to $40.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted share from $27.8 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter.","Bill W. Wheat","Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 27% to $931 million on 4,240 homes closed, up from $733 million on 3,516 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 5% compared to the prior year and up 2% sequentially to $219,500. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Net sales orders for the second quarter were up 19% from last year to 5,899 homes on a 6% decrease in our active-selling communities. In the March quarter, our average sales price on net sales orders of $222,700 was up 7% compared to the prior quarter and up 3% sequentially. Our cancellation rate for the second quarter was 22%, which is very close to our historical pre-downturn cancellation rate range of 17% to 21%. Our sales backlog at March 31, 2012, increased 17% from the prior year to 6,189 homes. The value of the backlog increased 25% to $1.4 billion from $1.1 billion a year ago. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the second quarter was 17.6%, up 140 basis points from the year-ago period. 80 basis points of the increase was due to cost improvements and decreased incentives and discounts. 50 basis points of the decrease was due to reduction in amortized interest and property taxes. Also contributing 10 basis points was a decrease in the estimated cost for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenues. Sequentially, incentives and discounts were flat. However, our gross margin improved 80 basis points from the first quarter due to the decrease in the estimated costs for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenues. This largely reflects a higher level of insurance recoveries received than in the first quarter, including a $2.4 million reimbursement of costs related to Chinese drywall. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Homebuilding SG&A expense for the quarter, which includes corporate overhead, was $128 million, up only 3% from the year-ago quarter on a 21% increase in homes closed. As a percentage of Homebuilding revenues, SG&A was 13.6%, down 320 basis points from 16.8% a year ago, reflecting both the improvement in volume and our continued efforts to control costs.","We also continue to see the benefits of our aggressive debt reduction over the past several years, as Homebuilding interest expense was down 63% from the year-ago quarter to $5.5 million. And our second quarter Homebuilding interest incurred decreased 17% to $28.1 million. Our capitalized interest balance at March 31 totaled $81.1 million, which is only 3.2% of inventory. Mike?","Mike Murray","Financial Services pretax income for the quarter was $7.7 million, which included $1.1 million of recourse expense. 82% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our Homebuilding operations. Our mortgage company handled the financing for 60% of our homebuyers this quarter, with virtually all loans meeting eligibility requirements for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae.","FHA and VA loans accounted for 57% of our mortgage company's volume this quarter, down from 61% in the year-ago quarter. Our mortgage company's new borrowers during the quarter had an average FICO score of 706 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 91%. First-time homebuyers represented 49% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Since December, our total inventory increased by approximately $155 million, excluding noncash items. We increased our homes and inventory by $82 million and our investment in residential land and lots by $73 million. Our homes and inventory at the end of March totaled 11,100 homes, up 900 homes from December. As of March 31, 1,100 of our homes remodels, 5,500 were speculative homes and 2,200 of the specs were completed. Our spec percentage improved to 50% from 56% at December 31. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","In our second fiscal quarter, our investments in land, lots and development costs totaled $319 million, which reflects our ability to find good opportunities to open new communities and replenish our finished lot supply. We continue to purchase our option finished lots in many markets and are also selectively investing in land acquisition and development opportunities to ensure we have adequate lots applies in desirable markets.","In March 31, 2012, we control approximately 121,000 lots, of which 86,000 are owned and 35,000 are option. Our owned lots include 23,000 finished lots and 20,000 lots to be developed within the next 12 to 18 months. Our option lots consist of 24,000 finished lots and 11,000 lots that we generally expect to purchase and develop within 12 to 18 months, bringing our minimum pipeline of finished lots over the next 2 years to 78,000. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","We used $79 million of cash in operations in the March quarter, primarily due to increases in homes and inventory, residential land and lots and mortgage loans held for sale, offset by net income and an increase in accounts payable.","We ended the quarter with $961 million of Homebuilding unrestricted cash and marketable securities. The balance of our public notes outstanding at March 31 was just under $1.6 billion, with no maturities until May of 2013. Mike?","Mike Murray","At March 31, our Homebuilding leverage ratio, net of cash and marketable securities, was 18.9% compared to 18.7% a year ago. Gross Homebuilding leverage at March 31 improved 580 basis points to 37.1% due to debt reductions and increased equity. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Before we move to Q&A, we wanted to share our expectations for some of our operating metrics. With 6,189 homes in backlog at March 31 and solid sales through the first part of April, we expect stronger closings and profits in the third and fourth quarters. Our sales during the March quarter combined with spec inventory of 56% at the beginning of the quarter, enabled us to convert 94% of our beginning backlog into closings.","With specs now at 50% of total inventory, we expect that our future backlog conversion rate will be below 90%. Our current expectation is for home sales gross margin to remain in the mid-16% to mid-17% range. Our absolute SG&A expense in the third and fourth quarters will increase due to variable components. However, our SG&A percentage should improve as we close more homes and leverage our fixed cost structure.","We continue to analyze the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax asset. If our current business trends continue, we expect to be out of our 3-year cumulative loss position before the end of the fiscal year. If our business, the Homebuilding industry and the economic conditions remain stable, we may be able to significantly reduce the valuation allowance at some point in the next few quarters. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I don't have a formal closing this quarter as our strong numbers speak for themselves. However, I would like to thank all of our DHI teammates for producing an outstanding quarter.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We'll host any questions you have now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Don, I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit on your comments about the improvement being uneven. I was wondering if you could -- are there any themes between the markets that were improving and weren't. And I wonder if you could explain what those were? And also in that, if you could comment on what you're seeing in the existing inventory market and how that's been affecting those trends?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I'll take the second part of your question first. I noticed a lot of media coverage around foreclosures. And frankly, one of the things that we think is that the foreclosures that are available to our buyers today are in typically poor condition requiring quite a bit of cash out of pocket to make them livable. And I think that's one of the reasons why you're consistently seeing over 1\/3 or equivalent to 1\/3 of existing home sales go to all-cash buyers, which means that the investors who have the money to take out of their pocket to put -- to improve those homes. But our buyers are typically looking for a new home, obviously, with a good warranty to behind it and frankly, something that they don't have to take cash out of their pocket. So I think we're in a very, very strong position notwithstanding the fact that banks are supposedly going to increase the number of foreclosures they're putting on the market. But again, I think these are tertiary buys compared to what the new home buy is for our customers. Now generally speaking, as I go across the country and I don't like to identify markets anymore as which ones are strong and which ones are weak, there are just several markets and primarily in the Sun Belt, in the coastal regions, that continue to be better markets for us. And typically, those are where some job creation is taking place and if you certainly look at the state of Texas, state of Texas is generating jobs and the state of Texas continues to be a very good market for us.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then my second question is, if I just look at the prices you reported both in closing price and order price, it's generally, with the exception of maybe 1 or 2 regions, they were all up. I was wondering if you could comment on just how much of that is mix related versus your building to raise prices now.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, Bill, I think, will put some more color on this. But frankly, as you recall, probably 12 months or so ago, 18 months or so ago, we began talking about focusing more on the move-up buyer. And we have been focusing on the move-up buyer and I certainly think that's one of the factors contributing to our increase in our ASPs.","Bill W. Wheat","And generally, we believe that the change in mix towards move-up buyers is the top primary driver behind our increase in our average selling prices right now. We do in a very limited basis see the opportunity to raise prices or reduce incentives somewhat incrementally in some areas right now. But I think by far, the largest factors are changing product mix towards move-up.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And frankly, from a perspective of offering that move-up product with our cost structure both from the land side, as well as from the hard cost side, the direct sell side, we can develop and build a better if not equally as good a product as a custom home builders who are having difficulty getting financing and offer better product to the buyer.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Goldberg of UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to follow-up on Adam's question about foreclosures. And do \u2013 he totally understood that concept that you're not really competing against the foreclosure home given that it's in poor condition and there's lot of out-of-pocket. But are you worried that the foreclosures that come on the market limit the ability to raise prices simply because if an investor comes in, buys the house, prices are going up, they're more likely to flip the house than they are to rent it?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think certainly, they're going to flip the house at some point in time. I think that clearly, they're going to take some time to fix these up, but at the same time, I think they're going to hold them for a period when the pricing improves. So I don't see any immediate competition from the investor, who basically probably has a 2- to 3-year horizon before they flip the housing -- flip the house. Also, our pricing power is not as strong as it has been in the past in many years, so I think we're still out there facing pretty much flat pricing. Most of where we're coming from is by being able to delete our incentives and our sales, so to speak. We don't have nearly as many event-driven sales this year as what we have in the past. We've had more of a level sales from the beginning of the year.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then just my follow-up question was on -- and I know you guys have talked about a strategy of looking at more of a move-up buyer and  shift a little bit away from the first time. And I just wondered if you -- is that really because that's where the buyer segment is now? Or is that a question more where land buying is now? Can you talk about maybe how that kind of goes moving forward? It doesn't seem like underwriting's changing it all for buyers especially the marginal buyer. So do think that ship kind of continues and the first time kind of continues to decline as a percentage of the overall volumes?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well I think that our move-up buyer segment will continue to increase as a percentage of our overall sales as we move forward. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we're very competitive with the custom builders out there who cannot get the financing. And the second part of it is that, that second time buyer and that third time buyer basically have a lot more to put down and they don't have the challenging FICO scores, a lot of our entry-level buyers have. So the down payment and the better credit scores help us meet that buyer demand a lot easier than the entry-level buyer.","Bill W. Wheat","And David, if you go back to prior to the downturn, our historic average mix had 35% to 40% of our buyers being first time home buyers and a fairly equivalent number of move-up buyers. I think what you're seeing in this shift is a shift back closer to a more normal mix for us. During the downturn, the first-time homebuyer was a much larger percentage. They got as high as 60% for us. And I think we're seeing a shift back towards a more normal mix now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question on the gross margins. I was hoping to get a little better sense for the guidance relative to what you put up this quarter, which was the best in quite some time, I guess, 2 years or so. I would think that with better volume to the extent that there's obviously a little bit of fixed cost even in the gross margin side, you could do a little better potentially than the $17.6 million. So I just wanted to get in terms of the thought process if there were some drivers that you think might push it back to the range that you put out there?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Mike, as we talked about on the conference call, most of our sequential improvement was not necessarily from underlying strength in being able to raise sales prices. It came from a change in our estimates related to warranty and construction defects. So when we're giving the guidance going forward, we're taking into account that sequentially, we've seen very good sales but we haven't necessarily seen a pickup in our underlying margins just yet. So we've got the range that encompasses about where we were this quarter but also allows for the core margin to remain about where it is. In terms of volume, none of our margin is contingent on volumes. Everything is house-specific and flows-through cost of sales. It's previously capitalized inventory until the home closes, it doesn't hit cost of sales.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, appreciate that. The second question, Don, you mentioned your prepared remarks that you're going to be evaluating selected land acquisition and development, maybe picking up that pace going forward. Also, evaluating new sub-markets. So I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit from an inventory kind of balance sheet perspective even. I guess, a couple of questions. Where do you see to the extent that the improvement in the market backdrop continues? Where do you see the debt to cap going? And also, the investment dollars going in terms of the inventory balance? And if you could kind of give us at least broadly a sense of which new type of submarkets you might be evaluating?","Donald J. Tomnitz","First of all, let me emphasize that notwithstanding the fact that we are looking at some land and lot development deals, our business model still is a land light business model and our focus is very strict underwriting guidelines on our development deals. 90-plus percent of all of our deals, development deals require that we get our capital back in 2 years or less. There are some outliers but not very many outliers. On a go-forward basis, we'll continue to -- where finished lots are not available at attractive prices. We'll continue to evaluate those land a lot development deals. We have in the past, as you know, been a large developer and we'll continue to develop where it's optimistic for us.","Bill W. Wheat","And then Mike, in terms of our balance sheet and how we're managing that, the pace of our investments in land, land development and finished lots has increased. Over the past couple of years, we had invested around $800 million in total. This quarter, we invested a little over $300 million. So that pace has increased, about 50% from where the pace had been. So we are seeing the opportunities to increase that pace in response with our -- to our improved sales. But all of those investments will be done within the constraints of where we want to keep our balance sheet targets and our liquidity targets. We still expect to maintain a strong balance sheet. Our target is to still keep our net debt to cap down below the 40% to 45% range. Clearly, we have a lot of room on that today. And this is really just reflective of how we prepared this company for the ultimate recovery in the housing market. We've been -- we generated a lot of cash during the downturn. We paid off a lot of debt. And we have a lot of cash on our balance sheet. So we're in a very strong position to be able to reinvest in our business now as we see the opportunities.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think especially relative to our peers, I think our debt to cap and our net debt to cap is extraordinary strong and permits us the opportunity to continue to aggregate market share from our competitors as well as the custom homebuilders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering, Stacey, you talked about the lower backlog conversion rate going forward given the more limited spec inventory. What about the other side of that in terms of margins? Do you think there's any positive impact on margins from having fewer spec sales coming through?","Stacey H. Dwyer","There certainly could be, going forward, which is why we give a rather wide range with the high end of the range above last quarter's margin. It essentially includes this quarter's margin.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And I would also say to you from our construction cycle perspective, we're starting and finishing homes at a much faster pace than what we have especially during the hot markets of the '04, '05, '06. And so as a result, notwithstanding the fact that we are down to 50% specs, we can build them quickly. And a number of our buyers are coming into our models today, which is a good deal for us, and that is requesting build jobs, so that they can get the house their way. And as you evaluate our gross margins, you'll clearly find that, that's an opportunistic position for us.","Bill W. Wheat","And that's a little bit reflective of the change of the product mix as our sales mix shifts more from first-time homebuyer to move-up buyer, you see -- you're seeing our spec mix shift with that as we see more build-to-order jobs.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And the second question then, I'm wondering about -- you touched about looking for land and expands different submarkets. As you think forward into '13 and '14, what do you think in terms of just what you want to be doing in terms of the aim for communicant growth through the next several years?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Our goal is to continue to grow our community count, and we are out there aggressively adding new subdivisions to each 1 of our 4 regions. I think relatively, relative to our peers, we've added more new deals and any other builder in the marketplace today. So our game plan is to continue to grow where growth make sense. But I don't want to get focused on so much the growth because the one thing we've done is we've gotten our debt down, and we also have got -- we still have work to do on our gross margins. And our goal is to try to get our gross margins up to the 20% levels. So we still, as you can tell from what we're -- the guidance we're giving you, which is a 16.5% to 17.5% for the second half of the year, we still have goals that exceed our current margins. So growth is important but profitability is more important.","Bill W. Wheat","And Dan, just one clarifying point in terms of our active-selling communities. Our selling communities were flat sequentially from December. They are down 6% year-over-year, which reflect some of the activity that we talked about in the second half of last year as far as cutting out underperforming communities. And so we've accomplished that but we are actively adding new communities today and would expect that to increase sequentially going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Zener of KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You talked about the sales trends in April being solid. Could clarify that relative to the 2Q rate we saw at 19%?","Bill W. Wheat","Very similar. That continues to be strong.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then the -- related to the community count, which is down 6%, I mean, do you -- please feel free to give us your community count, if you have it. However, it seems that the absorption pace would've increased on the order of 20% to 25%. Can you talk about why that's occurring, what the dynamics are, if it's better location, intentional strategy to drive volume through fewer communities and to quantify your community count increase. Is it going to be single-digit or is it a bigger round into the back half?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well clearly, one of our focuses has been to penetrate our existing subdivisions deeper. In other words, to increase our net sales per subdivision per community because that is an optimum position for us. The key is we called a number of subdivisions that weren't performing. But most importantly and for the majority of the instances, we've gone back and reworked our pricing and our take down schedules on our option deals to enhance the performance of those communities. So I think it's a wonderful thing that would have increased our absorptions per community because they were a little low in our estimation.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Now the other thing I think you're seeing and I've read in several analysts reports that we kind of referred to a couple of times here, the other opportunity is for home buyers are smaller than they were. There aren't as many other builders offering new homes, so you're seeing a disconnect in terms of the national new home data and what you're actually seeing terms of the large public builders as we're taking market share.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then your closings this quarter, obviously, there's a very different variety of ways to think about a forecast but you guys, were very specific. What's with -- in terms of its conversion rate, was weather the factor that led to the higher volume of closings?","Bill W. Wheat","Ken, I'd say the #1 reason was our reduction in our spec count. We reduced our spec from 56 to 50 and so there was a focus. I would say that in general, our closings exceeded our expectations for this quarter a bit. We didn't expect to convert quite as high but I think it was mainly driven by specs. Weather in a certain point in time always does have some effect, but largely, we do it as driven by specs.","Donald J. Tomnitz","We don't like to blame weather for our lack or performance nor do we like to give weather credit for our over performance. The real issue is strongly that our people are outperforming everyone in the industry and they executed the business plan that we put forth to them 6 months ago and they're exceeded their business plan. So no weather here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to follow-up on some of the earlier questions about future growth plans. I know you mentioned that you would like to increase your community count and that's what you're aiming. But if I look at the 6% year-over-year decrease, if I look at your balance sheet with the super strong 17%, I think, you said net debt to cap against kind of 40% to 45% longer-term target you have, I think you could argue that you're still taking it -- you're still taking a somewhat cautious approach. So at some stage in the future, the headroom you have in your balance sheet argues that you would put that to work and expand investment and community count growth into recovery. So just wanted to drill in with some specificity on what do you need to see to kind of really press down the accelerator a little bit harder? You mentioned gross margins. I mean is that what you're waiting to see? Are you waiting to see that you can consistently maintain your gross margin before you really begin to flex your balance sheet into the recovery?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Frankly, we're waiting for a lot of things. Let's not forget the -- I used to say that someone flip the switch February 1 on our buyers. I think frankly, they just increased the real steps slightly and we've had higher traffic in our communities and we've had higher sales. I don't think that you need to worry about our community count because one thing that we can do is we certainly can increase our community count rapidly. The thing that we are looking at in general, though, is that if you look at the macroeconomic situation in the U.S., I don't see very much of any job growth out there currently. And job growth is clearly what drives our business. So we have country that has a tremendous amount of debt and we still have a lot of unemployed people in this country and for -- and a lot of underemployed people. So what we're looking for is a general increase in the macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. before we start to become over-exuberant. We're 3 months into this and are we ecstatic? Yes, but we're not over-exuberant.","Bill W. Wheat","And specifically in our business, we're on a front-edge of seeing some early indications on a number of factors that could be improving. But again, this is only 2 months into a selling season and that doesn't necessarily make a trend. Improving absorptions, slightly improving kind of rates and some improvement in sales prices and margins, those are certainly good indications but we're on the early stages of that.","Stacey H. Dwyer","And with all that being said, if you look at our option lot positions since September, we've grown the number of lots we have under option by 8,000. We've increased our own lots by about 1,000, and we have spent more money this quarter than we have in the recent past on land and lots. So even with all the caveats we're feeling better about our business overall.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. And then second question, through all of the noise about the FHA last month, I think one of the interesting things that emerged was that a breakdown of that government loans figure. I think, you said it was 57% and the VA is probably running at, let's say, 15% or 20% of that. So probably higher than what most investors have thought that VA percentage might be. So I wanted to get your thoughts on that going forward. What does it tell us that the VA percentage is so high? Is that a sustainable percentage as well going forward as the housing recovery continues? In other words, is the VA going to be able to support growth if that continued 15% to 20% of volumes range?","Bill W. Wheat","That's been -- the VA percentage has been fairly consistent for us over times. Whether it's sustainable, I'm not sure I know the answer to that. But over time, that's been a fairly consistent percentage. As far as our overall business percentage in FHA and VA combined, that's actually down year-over-year. So a 57%, that's down a bit from where we've been in the past.","Stacey H. Dwyer","And the real number on that is 20% is VA and 37% is FHA.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen East of ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","If we just stayed on the FHA for a minute, we had some insurance that went into effect and then we also have sitting out there potentially, seller financing concessions. One, do you think there was any impact from the insurance going into effect? And 2, as you look at this potential seller financing concession change, do you see that impacting your business? And if so, how much?","Mike Murray","I think we didn't see a big impact, Steve, on the mortgage insurance change coming into play. And on the seller financing limits, as they come into play, I think it may elongate the time for some buyers to accumulate more of their cash required to close the transaction. But I think that's a 1x event that will shift some buyers to later periods. I can't tell you we'd quantify that real strongly right now.","Stacey H. Dwyer","The proposed change in state the capital and the seller contributions toward closing calls from 6% down to 3%. Our average right now is closer to the new proposed cap. So we don't ever start offering 6% closing costs. So it might impact some of our marginal buyers but overall, it's not going to be a significant impact.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And then if I look at 2 different issues: one, are you seeing any cost inflation out there? And if so, what type of impact is it going to have this year on your gross margin? And then 2, your Texas growth was modest relative to the overall growth. Could you just talk a little bit about what's going on there?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think Texas obviously, has been -- I don't think, I know it's been a strong market for us for even all through the downturn. And frankly, as we have some of our other markets kick in, it's less of a percentage in terms of our growth on a go-forward basis. But Texas, let me assure you, is strong and we're continuing to expand our footprint in all of our Texas markets. I would say to you on the cost side, clearly, we are receiving cost pressures. We're negotiating those as strongly as we can. One of the difficult things is, obviously as we began to begin to report a profit then all of a sudden, our suppliers and vendors began to realize that we are making money. But bottom line is we're still not as profitable as we'd like and we are also starting more homes than anybody else in the country so as a result, we are very, very competitively pricing and bidding everything that we've got going forward. And we want to work with our suppliers and our vendors. But we still have a lot more to accomplish in the quarter.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","All right. If I could ask one other, on the DTA that you talked about. You talked about moving into a profitability on 3 year. If I look at the trailing 12 quarters, you're already there. Is there something else you're looking at before you bring the DTA back onto the balance sheet?","Bill W. Wheat","On a simple pretax income basis, all in pretax, consolidated pretax income basis, we're not quite there yet. We're at about $200 million loss on a 3-year trailing basis right now. So -- but we do see that -- we do see as getting out of that position sometime before the end of the fiscal year. That is one of the major factors, clearly, that goes into the evaluation. But it's one factor. Obviously, we want to see ourselves deliver our backlog strongly the rest of this year. We want to see our sales continue to be strong and our pricing to remain stable, our margins remain strong profitability levels and remains as good as well. And then we also then look at the rest of the industry conditions, as well as general economic conditions and the mortgage markets. So all of those things will go into the mix and evaluating when we feel confident that, that asset can come back onto the box. Ultimately -- but it's just a matter of timing and ultimately, it's just a general entry. It's just the balance sheet entry. It's not -- it will not change our cash position one bit and so when that happens, it will happen. Whether that happens before the end of fiscal year or not, it changes a few metrics but ultimately, it doesn't change our business one bit.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joshua Pollard with Goldman Sachs.","Anto Savarirajan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Anto for Joshua. With higher share of your late 2009, early 2000 land being delivered and the early '10, early '11 share increasing, how different are the margins here versus what is rolling off?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, clearly, the margins on more recent land purchases will typically be a bit higher than land that we purchased earlier. In '09, the market was still struggling some, and so some purchases, we would've made in '09 may not have performed at the levels that we expected if conditions deteriorated, and the more recent purchases are more in line with where the market conditions are today. I don't have numbers in front of me to be able to quantify the difference. But clearly, more recent purchases that we've been able to evaluate with our current cost structures and with the current market conditions would have better margins.","Anto Savarirajan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. What is any changes in orders or cancellation did you see during the first week of April than that was neither on the FHA requirements? And could you also talk about how the mortgage company is planning for -- when the things are again re-implemented come July?","Bill W. Wheat","We haven't seen any real changes in our cancellation trends here in April. And I'm sorry, I didn't quite pick up the second half.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Yes, the second part how would we prepared to respond to the FHA changes. And it's going to be business as usual, and we'll just be working with each customer with the available loan guidelines that are out there. One benefit we have at D.R. Horton is we have what we our Home Buyers Club. And we work very specifically with people who have credit challenges and help them plan for homeownership, whether it is cleaning up collection items on their credit report, establish a payment plan for that, improving their credit score, just to establishing a savings plan for their down payment.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And frankly, over the last 4 or 5 years, we worked through a lot of changes in underwriting guidelines increases in FICO scores. So our job is to go build a product and adjust to the market whatever the financing is.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani of KBW.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a clarification on the gross margin. Was about 30 basis points and a sequential improvement related to the 2.4 million Chinese drywall and then the rest of the variance was on lower construction warranty estimates? And then regarding those lower estimates, was any of that a true-up that would impact future periods? Or is this just going to -- is this what explains the higher margin guidance you gave for coming quarters?","Bill W. Wheat","The $2.4 million reimbursement does equate to around 30 basis points. We did have some additional insurance recoveries during the quarter as well that contributed to that. So the remainder of the 80 bps is an entirely due to changes in estimates. I believe it's about 60 basis points were based on total insurance recoveries and 20 basis points were from a change in estimate. And the changes in estimate relative from quarter to quarter do fluctuate somewhat, but the largest contributor this quarter was our insurance recoveries.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And frankly, as reflective of our attitude in our process of the corporate office of pursuing insurance recoveries based upon our insurance policies and the drywall Chinese drywall, I know that we told you in previous conference calls over the years that we're going to aggressively pursue that, and we have. And we've had some nice the accomplishments.","Bill W. Wheat","And we do continue to pursue additional reimbursements.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just when we think about your incremental margins, if you look at the improvement in growth in operating margins that we saw this quarter versus the 5% sequential revenue change, is there a rule to think about or some way you could help us formulate what potential operating leverage is going forward on an incremental revenue growth?","Bill W. Wheat","Generally, when we look at our incremented revenue growth, at least in the short term, we look at SG&A as a variable component. And typically, our SG&A variable component will be somewhere in the 4% to 5% range of the increase in revenues. So in the short run, that's probably a rule of thumb to use. Over the longer term, there'll be some additional SG&A that would need to be built to support a much larger volume level. But that's the SG&A leverage is the biggest portion of any leverage that we get from our growth.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And frankly, we're controlling our SG&A very nicely and we're very judicious in our new hires. We want to make sure that the business, the earnings are growing before we add the overhead.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Locker, FBN Securities.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just first of all, I guess, in the Midwest orders up almost 50%. I know it's a kind of odd reason for you, but was that base mostly on absorptions or just maybe arising community count are counter trending the company?","Bill W. Wheat","That's primarily based on absorptions off of a fairly low base a year ago.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Right. And just on a percentage of buyers in the second quarter that were -- had experienced some king of short sale or foreclosure in the last 2 or 3 years, what percentage or do you have a rough number on that?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We don't have an exact number but I can tell you, as with visit with our salespeople across the country, there are more and more of those people who are becoming available. That's the -- I believe is a 3-year span. And those buyers are coming back into the market.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Right. Would you say that's significantly more than a year ago on a percentage basis?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes, I would.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath of MKM Partners.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Don, just to sort of try to summarize, listening to your opening comments and then your answers to the Q&A. Is it fair to say your view of the overall market is that the housing market in the U.S. is sort of flattish to stabilizing and most of your growth is coming from market share gains?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. And is there anything you're kind of looking for? You've had a great read on the market in the last couple of years. Are you still expecting overall U.S. housing to be flattish this year? Or do you think that we're a little bit better than that now?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think, we'll be a little bit better than that but not significantly. And again, you're right, basically, we continue to aggregate market share across the country, as well as to drive down our directs as well as our keep our SG&A low so that we can offer a quality, very competitively priced product in the market. And then also, I want to continue to emphasize is that, that move-up buyer is helping us grow our market share.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the DTA. It sounds like from your comments that, I don't know if this is what your account have told you that the DTA could come back on to the books in pieces gradually?","Bill W. Wheat","By and large, it will come on in one piece. When you get to the level of confidence that you believe the asset is recoverable, by and large, it should come on in one piece. The only exception to that will be to the extent that a portion of our NOLs that we're carrying forward relate to certain states in which the carryforward periods maybe rather short. There may be some portions of our state NOLs that we may not feel that we will fully recover. So there could be some portion that could be left in the balance sheet or the valuation allowance could be remaining for those portions.","Operator","Our next question comes from James McCanless with Guggenheim Partners.","James McCanless - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","First question I had, just going back to the FHA's seller concessions. Can you all discuss how easy or how difficult it would be to transition somebody who might qualify under the old concession rule over the, say, a conforming mortgage with mortgage insurance behind it?","Stacey H. Dwyer","The challenge there is and if you're looking at simply the seller concessions, if you're looking at contributing 6%, you're probably working with a buyer who doesn't have a significant amount of cash at closing and the FHA down payment is 3.5% whereas conventional mortgages is going to at least 5%. So I'm not sure that trying to transition that person to conventional mortgage fully addresses the cash situation of that buyer. And that's where we would work with the buyer then to help them understand exactly what's required in terms of cash at the point of closing.","James McCanless - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my second question, just was wondering with the decline on the cam rate year-to-year, is that a function of scrubbing potential buyers more closely now than you may have in the past? Or is that a function of the shift in the more move-up, housing and move-up buyers who are bringing more cash and more equity at the table? If you could discuss that, I would appreciate that?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think clearly, the shift into the move-up buyers we are experiencing more buyers who are bringing more down payment to the table, especially in markets like California where a number of our buyers have 20% down payments. I think generally, the answer to your question specifically on whether we're changing the way we're scrubbing our backlog, absolutely not. Standard procedure basically, no changes whatsoever.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Widner of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Michael R. Widner - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm not the smartest guy on the block, I was just hoping you could clarify once again for me on some of the 1x or kind of things that are included in the margins. And if I understood you correctly, it was about $2.4 million or 30 basis points in a drywall settlement. And then you mentioned 60 basis points insured in insurance recovery, so roughly, $5 million or so. So is it fair to say that between the 2 of them, you have 90 basis points, give or take, that was kind of 1x in nature? And then I would presume that the changes in estimates that you talked about would be sort of an ongoing thing?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, when we've been talking about the recoveries, we've been speaking about the sequential change. And so of our sequential change you have 80 basis points from Q1 to Q2, about 60 basis points of that is coming from the reimbursements, which it is around $5 million in total, of which $2.4 million related to Chinese drywall. The remaining 20 basis points, the remaining change is something that's just ongoing. There's always some fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter based on activity in terms of our costs, activity in terms of just the way some of our costs settle out and the way we have to adjust our estimates.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And frankly, that's one of the reasons why we're indicating to you that we don't see a lot of pricing power available in any of our markets out there today. There are few but not many. And secondly, why we led you to our 16.5% to 17.5% gross margin expectation for the second half of the year.","Bill W. Wheat","Clearly, our forward expectations are to continue to improve gross profit, but we don't want to mislead anybody as to what caused the sequential increase this quarter.","Michael R. Widner - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. So you guys have been through cycle or 2 here and you built a few houses over the past 4 decades or so. I just wondering if you could talk not about what's going on right now but sort of from your experience, both on a regional basis and now on a national basis you had this big pullback that just happened in the past again on sort of a regional basis. I was just wondering if you've experienced the phenomenon before where at the bottom, where a lot of private guys are still kind of reeling and they don't have access to the balance sheet capital that you guys do. Did you have that opportunity to kind of -- you've the land, you've got the capital, you've got the ability to store or steal share at the bottom. But as things progressed, as those guys watched you stealing their market share, I'm wondering how the challenge of them wanting to get back into the market and then watching what you're doing and figuring that hey, it's time to start up in communities ourselves. I mean, how does that play out with your simultaneous hope to increase margins? And it seems like it would be very difficult to both increase margins as you hope to do, as well as continue to increase market share as those guys are seeing that demand is coming back and trying harder to get back into the game themselves. Just wondering if you could talk about how that's played out in the pass on a local basis?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I think, frankly, this time around, the private builders have been devastated more than they've been devastated. Any previous downturn in this is for the nice fourth downturn in the industry. I don't see the banks stepping up to lend money to those people today. As a matter of fact, I see just the opposite. So I look at our markets and our submarkets across the country and the one thing that is consistent amongst almost all of those markets is that there are fewer and fewer public builders out builders who, one, are live and 2, if they are alive, they actually can get a loan from bank who doesn't want to loan them any money. So I think this is a unique downturn. It has been unique for D.R. Horton and myself. This has been the worst downturn in our almost 29 years together. I see an opportunity for us to continue to take market share not only away from those small and medium-sized undercapitalized private builders, but I also believe and know for the very first time in our company's history, that we have an excellent opportunity to continue market share away from our public competitors, who I perceive are way overleveraged to us and permits us an opportunity to continue to aggressively take market share away from them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Kim of Barclays.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's Steve Kim from Barclays. A question I had for you relates to your comment about not putting to price increases in most of your communities. And then also -- but then also, talking about positive mix shift. I was curious as to whether or not the land that you are building your move-up product on is substantially the same as the land that you may have been building more of the entry-level type product on, let's say, last year or the year before. Because it would seem to me that if you're able to put a richer mix on a similar land base, that would be almost as good as the price increase but if you could just answer that broadly, that will be great.","Donald J. Tomnitz","To answer your question directly, we are not putting a more expensive house on the same price as the -- our entry-level lot prices, so there's no real benefit there. As we continue to expand into that entry-level market, we're paying more for those lots than what we're paying for our entry-level products so there's really no enhancement there. And I would say the other thing about the pricing that we can't forget in terms of pricing power is that one of still our major issues facing our industry are appraisals. And notwithstanding the fact that we believe that we have a justification to raise prices in a number of our markets, those pricing increases are slow simply because of competitive appraisals throughout the U.S.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. The second question I have for you relates to your comments about margin. If you could share with us a little bit -- I'm sorry, not margin, but community count. If you could share with us a little bit your view of how the community count is going to likely trend as we head into next year? You were talking about down 6% today but your sales have also been better-than-expected and so I'm actually been closing out on more communities that you would've otherwise have expected, let's say, late last year. Today, given that you're looking at a better sales profile and you have the balance sheet with which to grow, would it be unrealistic of us to expect that if sales trends continue and you burn out of the same kind of rate that you're burning out today, that your sales count could be -- you're selling community count could be up double digits next year?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well I hate to put a number on that, Steve, because really, what we've done and what we\u2019re going to do, we have a division president's meeting here in Las Vegas next week and we've expressed to our divisions in our 4 regions, our growth expectations for them in '13, '14 and '15. So basically, what they're going to be doing is going out and finding lots and land positions in order to meet their respective growth expectations that we have here. So I don't see -- it could be a double-digit, it could to be a single digit. But let's remember one thing, the best thing that could happen to us is to continue to achieve higher sales and higher closings of our existing communities because certainly, we have enough lots in our communities. We have enough lots on our books. And to the extent that we can penetrate those existing communities deeper, and that's better for us on a SG&A component and the gross margin component.","Bill W. Wheat","And as we look to invest and as we look to grow, certainly, we want to grow incrementally but as long as we also stay disciplined as far as how we invest, stay disciplined on our land supply and on our return thresholds on a project-by-project basis, that's what will improve our company, not simply focusing on the top line growth.","Donald J. Tomnitz","As I said earlier, our focus is on growth but our bigger focus is on profitability. We need to continue to grow our gross margin and our pretax income percentages.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Barr\u00f3n of Housing Research Center.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","My question is we've seen, I guess, a strong improvement in the orders in the last 2, 3 months, as you mentioned, or 2.5 months. And so my view is that a lot of communities have started to perhaps sell-out earlier than expected, which I guess, is a good problem to have. But my question is, are you guys starting to also see some cost pressures and perhaps are you thinking you should accelerate your land purchases earlier? And are you starting to see cost pressures from materials and labor and land prices?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, we've consistently seen cost pressures from the land and lot side, as well as most importantly, our subcontractor and our vendor base. So it's a division-by-division, as we call it, release-by-release bidding process, an aggressive bidding process. As I said earlier, we are building more homes and starting more homes than anybody in the U.S. We bid every release. And we want to make certain that we have the most competitive pricing at that point in time. We're going to have commodities going up, and we're going to have labor going up but the bottom line goal has always been at this company is how we balance those with increases and decreases such that we end up with the most competitive direction in the market. Again, our size and our number of starts, I think, leads us to a very competitive position relative to our peers. As I travel the country, I just don't see a lot of our peers even today starting a lot of houses. So we're the preponderance of starts in most of our markets.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","Great, absolutely. My other question was if you start to see the number of buyers remain at a strong phase, is your view more towards just taking the volume on a per community basis? Or is it more to raise the price and kind of put an upside on the sales per community? And related to that, what are your views on selling homes investors?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, frankly, over the last 5 years, we'll sell homes to anyone. Frankly, what we're focusing on is selling homes to families who are not investors, basically people who are buying homes for a good place to raise their children and send their children to school.","Bill W. Wheat","And we're always looking to try to strike the best balance community by community between driving additional volume and improving our prices or reducing our incentives. Sometimes we're constrained by appraisals in the submarket but in general, we're trying to strike that best balance. Right now, we clearly would love to see more absorptions per community. But we want to see that with some improving dynamics in terms of our incentives and our pricing as well.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Clearly, we can grow the business from a number of different aspects, whether adding new communities, whether of rolling options, whether we're penetrating our existing communities deeper or whether we're developing land and lots. We've got the whole wide expanse out there of opportunities. We just hope that the sales and the closings continue to be what they have been since the 1st of February because that will provide this company really the preeminent opportunity in the industry to continue to grow profitably.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Unknown Analyst","This is Dezi [ph] filling in for Bob. You said your capture rate was 60% for the quarter. Can you talk about your experiences with home buyers who chose to go with a different mortgage lender? And how that impacted cancellation rate in the quarter? And whether you expect the capture rate to increase going forward?","Bill W. Wheat","Since we have very strong capture rate with our captive mortgage company, we really haven't noticed a substantial impact on our aggregated closings in any given quarter because of any follow-up from other mortgage companies. Typically, if we're not working with DHI Mortgage in a given market, that division will be working with other preferred lenders and have a tight working relationship to manage the backlog through. So we haven't really had that kind of a fall-off in our business.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And I think as Stacey mentioned earlier, as I asked the same question in our pre-conference call, our 60% capture rate has a lot to do with the fact that our mortgage company is also pursuing non-captive business. So sometimes those numbers are skewed slightly by the number of non-captive buyers they solicit and are able to garner in a specific quarter.","Stacey H. Dwyer","And since our cancellation rate actually improved in this quarter, down 22%, we're not running into any significant hurdles even with our outside lenders right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Timothy Jones of Moloney.","Timothy Jones","Okay, other than orders, D.R.'s favorite number is SG&A in sales, I believe. And you did keep your SG&A flat with $200 billion increase in sales and brought your margins down 4%. But there's still 13.7% [ph], which is even for this quarter probably 250 basis points of I think your norm. Is it that your -- is it still high because you're expecting a further improvement in upcoming months? Or are you getting hit with that normal amount of sales by realtors, which are where are -- where the margin would cost you about 3% versus 1.5% internally?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We haven't talked in a while and I guess, as just -- as Todd Horton [ph] says so eloquently, \"No good deed should go unpunished.\" We continue to have the lowest -- some of the lowest SG&A in the industry and we include our corporate overhead in our overall. But we still get questions about our SG&A. But to answer your question directly, yes, that is a focus of the D.R.'s. But I'll let Bill perhaps explain or answer your question since I really just didn't answer your question.","Bill W. Wheat","Year-to-date our SG&A expense is 13.5% of revenues. That is higher than our long-term target. Our long-term target is to have it as close to 10% as we can. There's a lot of targets that we're not quite at today. We're not at normal margin rate either. So we have certainly kept our some level of SG&A infrastructure that will support some higher volume as evidenced this quarter when our closings were up 21% and SG&A was only up 3%. We've also maintained our footprint across the United States. We haven't exited a lot of markets. And so we are in well-positioned to be able to grow and leverage that SG&A. We expect as we're able to reinvest in the business, use some of our cash to grow our business and we would leverage that SG&A and it will drop as we grow. And hopefully we can get it back closer to that long-term target of 10%.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And I think Bill makes an excellent point there. If you look at everyone else's footprint, most people have shrunk their footprint much more dramatically then we. And our goal all along was keep our footprint the same but then take down our multiple divisions in each one of our various markets to the lowest common denominator that we could get to. And they're ready to grow.","Stacey H. Dwyer","One clarification to you to, Tim. For D.R. Horton, the external sales commissions are actually in our cost of sales not in our SG&A. and I just want to know if D.R. put you up to that question.","Timothy Jones","No comment. But I am in contact with your company quite often. Secondly, where is your warrants? I mean, they're still outstanding, aren't they? Where are they on the balance sheet?","Bill W. Wheat","Convertible debt? Yes, it is in our debt and the current carrying value is around $432 million.","Timothy Jones","Still your debt?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, $432 million is in our debt. The face value of those notes is $500 million. So the remainder of $68 million is equity today, and that's the value of associated with the convert. And that is being accreted each quarter out of equity and into debt. So by the time that debt matures in 2014, we'll be at $500 million debt on the balance sheet.","Timothy Jones","You could turn it to cash tomorrow. It's in the money.","Bill W. Wheat","Well it's not callable in advance of the maturity date. So we can't make that decision or let transaction until 2014. But clearly, yes, the price is 1306 [ph] the strike price of 1306 [ph] so as long as we take care of business here then we should be in good shape.","Timothy Jones","What's the interest on it?","Bill W. Wheat","2%.","Timothy Jones","I'll take it.","Bill W. Wheat","I think you can buy it in the open new market.","Timothy Jones","I'll take it from your side not my side.","Bill W. Wheat","It is trading at a significant premium.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to the idea of expecting a little less in your backlog, I believe, than previously. Is that just purely driven by the shift a little bit more towards move-up? Because I would think all else equal, you wouldn't necessarily be moving away in any regard from your spec approach in the market?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Actually, it's interesting you ask that question because it's really due to our more conservative nature. We had -- we started the quarter with 56% specs. Our goal was to try to get that number reduced back down to closer to 50% and we did. So it's just a function, I believe, of largely not having started as many homes as we could've started simply because our spec ratio was a little high and we wanted to see those specs come down. And frankly what happened was the spring selling season materialized and that caused our primarily our reduction in our specs. But as I said before, construction cycles are currently some of the shortest in the history of the company since I've been here. And our ability to put a house on the ground and get it ready for a buyer is the best we've ever had.","Bill W. Wheat","We do typically see our spec percentage sequentially from December to March because we do have home started prior to the selling season but then we sell during the March quarter. But I think, we did a little bit better job of selling-through that this quarter than we have in the last 3 years.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And frankly, that has been a focus of both Bill Wheat and Mike Murray with our division presence and our regional presence clearly identifying who needed to move, what age inventory or what point in time. And they actually, over the last quarter, did an excellent job on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko of SIG.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I did want to get your thoughts on land pricing maybe quarter-to-quarter year-to-year in the markets that are working. And wondering how much moving on this option increasing the option mix over the last couple of quarters, moving to a higher trade up mix over the last couple of quarters? How much of that strategy is tied to land pricing that you're seeing in the better markets?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Basically, I think that all of the lots that we're buying are more competitively priced than what they have been in the past. In other words, I think that the land sellers are trying to get more for their lots than what they had 2 years ago and 3 years ago because there has been some months of improvement in the industry. So I think we're going to continue to fight that on a go-forward basis.","Stacey H. Dwyer","One of the things that helps keep the lid on that though is the land prices are constrained by what we can sell the home for. And so when we\u2019re targeting a specific gross margin and return on our investment and we know what our fixed cost are, they basically use a residual that we're not willing to pay about a certain dollar for the land.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And it's further constrained by the fact that we still have appraisal issues across the country. So again, I say, there's not a lot of pricing power in the industry today.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you very much. Again, I thank all the DHI employees who quarterly turned in an outstanding quarter.

Our backlog conversion rate for the third quarter was 89%, at the high end of our guidance range. As a result, our third quarter home sales revenue increased 16% to $4.3 billion on 14,114 homes closed, up from $3.7 billion on 12,497 homes closed in the prior year quarter.","Our average closing price for the quarter was $302,000, up 3% from the prior year quarter. The value of our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 13% from the prior year to $4.4 billion and homes sold increased 12% to 14,650 homes. Our third quarter sales growth was driven by a 15% increase in community sales pace offset by a 3% decrease in our average number of active selling communities.","Our average community count was flat sequentially from the second quarter. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $298,000 and the 21% cancellation rate during the quarter was consistent with the same quarter last year.

Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We are experiencing healthy market conditions across most of our markets with solid demand, especially at affordable price points. And the supply of new homes remains limited. In this environment, we are reducing sales incentives or raising prices in communities where we are achieving our targeted sales base while striving to ensure that our product offerings remain affordable. Land and construction costs are generally increasing and we are utilizing our scale and relationships to control cost increases.","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter improved 110 basis points sequentially from March and 210 basis points from the prior year quarter to 21.9%. 120 basis points of the improvement from last year was due to net sales price increases in excess of lot and construction cost increases. An additional 60 basis points of the increase was due to lower litigation and warranty costs, 20 basis points was from lower interest costs and the remaining 10 basis points of improvement was due to less impact from purchase accounting.","Based on current market conditions, we expect our fourth quarter home sales gross margin will be relatively consistent with the third quarter.

We will now host any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question today is coming from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you and good morning, everybody. First, I'll start with the land. The option jumped up to 56%. It's a big jump you all have been talking about getting to 60%. It seems like now maybe that 60% is readily achievable. So just would like to understand your thoughts there? And then, how did Forestar play a role in any of that jump, and what we should expect moving forward? I know they've acquired \u2013 as of last quarter, they had 21 deals. How many deals do they have in place now?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Well, Stephen, good morning. We are very excited about the progress we're making towards increasing our option percentage. We're at 56% this quarter, but we do expect fluctuations up and down in that number. It's a fairly dynamic measurement. And it can move a little bit day-to-day. In fact, it does move a bit day-to-day. We are making progress in the right direction, but we expect to see that continue to fluctuate. But we do believe we will be achieving the 60% target, probably not going to be by the end of this week, but we will be doing that over the next couple of years.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And the Forestar lot count in our option position is 11,100 of our 156,000 option lots. So it is playing a role in that percentage moving up. We're not planning to provide project counts anymore. We're providing their market counts, their owned and option lot position each quarter going forward. We would, of course, expect to update guidance as necessary for lot deliveries and revenues. But we really believe that their lot position is the best indicator of progress and their future growth.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough, fair enough. And then as you look at your order growth, lot of talking in the markets and we've seen some builders not deliver particularly good order paces. Could you talk about a little bit but what you saw in demand through the quarter? And then what you all were seeing out West and in particular California?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Stephen we saw a good demand throughout the quarter. I mean there was normal seasonality played itself out in the quarter as we expected it would. But we had very good demand across our footprint, specifically out West in California. At the the price points we're serving, we see a lot of buyers, a lot of demand, a lot of traffic. We don't have a lot of standing available inventory out in our West region at all, especially in California. Demand has been very strong. Our absorptions per community I think out West were up 15% and really excited about the projects that the team has positioned us in there and the execution against those projects.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and next question is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now live.","John Lovallo - Bank of America","Hey guys. Thank you for taking my call. The first question is a very interesting comment about your balance sheet strength, liquidity and earnings growth increasing your strategic and financial flexibility. I just want to maybe dig in a little bit deeper there and how you guys are thinking about A, acquisitions, are there bigger targets out there that might make sense for you guys to get deeper in your markets? And then B, your appetite for share repurchases, considering the $400 million that you put in place and what we think is a pretty big dislocation between your current stock price and reality?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","John, good morning. I'll take the acquisition part of that question. It is very much a big part of our capital allocation plans. We've been actively looking and we are actively looking. The two acquisitions we did this quarter were somewhat small, but they were \u2013 put us into a new market and was accretive in another market that we really like and believe in. We have several more that we're looking at over the next few quarters in the year and probably $400 million to $600 million of purchase price on those is what we're looking at today. We continue to be primarily interested in private builders with very high quality teams where we either consolidate share in markets that we already operate in or enter new markets and further expand the footprint across the country. That's been the primary focus to date.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah and John this is Bill. In terms of our capital allocation, obviously flexibility is key to us right now and we still see great opportunities in our housing markets to continue to invest in that and aggregate market share. And obviously acquisitions are an important part of that as well. With that flexibility, we have begun to repurchase shares. We began repurchasing shares about a year ago. And as we've stated before, we want to be consistent in that. We want to be able to do that consistently over a long-term with our first step or first benchmark in that beginning to keep our outstanding share count flat. And clearly we're on track to do that here by fiscal 2019.","And I think the key for our share repurchase program is we want to be able to continue to do it consistently and then increase it incrementally over the next year, and then over the longer term we will evaluate that alongside all of our other opportunities at different points in the market.","John Lovallo - Bank of America","Okay that's helpful. And then as a follow-up, in fiscal year 2019, you guys reiterated that there'll either be a debt or equity raised out of Forestar. What will it take kind of to get things moving there on that front? I think clearly issuing the equity out of Forestar I think would be a major catalyst for your shares. And what do you guys kind of need to see before you'd be comfortable doing that?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Well we've been focused first and foremost on putting a bank facility in place. And so that is ongoing. That's going very well. We expect that to get completed by the end of this next quarter \u2013 by the end of the fiscal year, which has been our target. And alongside that, we'll begin the process of preparing Forestar for the public markets. So filing a shelf, working with rating agencies to prepare for the debt markets with the target of then having them in position to go to the public markets next year. Now we would probably anticipate a debt offering first, as they have very little debt on their balance sheet. And so we would do that, certainly demonstrate the ability for them to raise debt capital and then have an eye on the equity markets as well. We certainly believe that an equity raise for Forestar is an important part. I do agree with you there. But at this point we're focused on bank facility first and then likely debt market second.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And Forestar has $370 million of cash on their balance sheet today, which is sufficient for their near term working capital needs, especially once they get the bank credit facility in place.","John Lovallo - Bank of America","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman and Associates. Your line is now live.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Hey guys. Good morning.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Great job on the orders. Very impressive considering some of the other mixed data points we're seeing out there. So I generally think about your inventory \u2013 your homes in inventory that you provide us every quarter as a pretty good leading indicator of where you kind of see the volume side of the business going since such a high percentage of your sales are specs. I think you mentioned inventory is up about 8% year-over-year, which is obviously solid growth, a little bit below kind of the double-digit range you've been growing the business recently. So I guess I was just curious if you think about your 2019 guide for 10% to 15% top line growth, do you have implied in there kind of an implicit organic growth expectation versus what you might expect to see coming through M&A given the pipeline you're looking at today?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","In our forward guidance on growth, Alan what we're looking at is purely organic. The M&A work we're planning to execute it but our 10% to 15% growth we believe is very achievable with the organic lot positions we have today.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Okay. So any M&A would be potentially additive to that?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","To within a 10% or 15% yeah, so if...","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Okay.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","...within that range.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Within that range.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Got it. And second question again kind of on the inventory topic within the industry. We have seen new home inventory starting to climb up a little bit. I think some of that might be a function of maybe some of your peers entering the entry level space and expect more than they traditionally have. It doesn't sound like you're really seeing much pressure on the incentive front or pricing side from competitors. But as you look into the back half of the year and you look at some of the results your peers are reporting, is there any conservatism on your side under the premise that some other builders might incentivize to drive their volume numbers up? Obviously you guys have grown very consistently, but others have not been quite as consistent. So if they do start to incentivize, how do you think about that affecting your business and your overall inventory position?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","So, yeah the decision to incentivize or not and how it impacts us is a community by community decision and very specific. And we would monitor and react or proactively take action at a given community. And that's what our local teams are monitoring that day to day to day, ensuring that we're having the sales pace we desire for a given community while maximizing returns in that community. So from a macro level at sort of the perspective we have here at the corporate office, we are entrusting our local divisions to make those right decisions to drive their pace and achieve the returns they're looking for. Not feeling that we're going to see a lot of competitive market margin pressure broadly space because we're seeing that every day to day and we're posting margin returns that we are at today from the communities.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah and generally we would agree we're still not seeing much inventory growth out there especially at the affordable price points. We're still at very limited supply in the marketplace which is allowing us right now to raise price and reduce incentives which is showing up in our margin.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","That's great to hear. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi thanks. Good morning everyone and congrats on the results. And also hope David is feeling better. First question I just kind of wanted to circle back to a question on demand. Obviously you've gotten a couple of questions already on it. But I think it bears warrants some focus just given what's gone on in the market the last week or two and some of the, as previously said, mixed results from the competitors. Your results really stand out in contrast and kind of recognizing that you said you thought there was good demand throughout the quarter and across your footprint even California. Clearly it seems like there is some contrasting data points out there and couple of builders pointing to May being a little softer. Even your competitor earlier this morning talking about even some weakness on the first-time front, which is particularly surprising. So again I guess I just wanted to, in my first question, just revisit and maybe asked another way, the order growth that you saw or the sales pace that you saw, obviously adjusting for seasonality, that \u2013 was there any I guess change in patterns? Was May a little bit weaker? Or was June a little bit stronger that's of note?","And as it relates to the first-time strength, do you feel that you're perhaps just better positioned from a price standpoint and an affordability standpoint that allows you guys to perhaps be a little bit better insulated from any minor or moderate demand volatility?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Sure. Mike, I'll take a stab at that. I think you have several questions in there. So I hope I'll hit them all. But for the quarter, we saw a typical seasonality. So we saw a very strong demand as we moved throughout the quarter and just typical seasonality as we moved into the early summertime. We do believe that our outperformance as it pertains to our sales really is because of our positioning and our product offerings across the country. If you look at our results this quarter, it'll be posted in our supplementary data after the call, but Express was 37% of our sales and closings and our new Freedom brand is now 3% of our sales. So those are very affordable product offerings that we are very focused on keeping affordable. So there's still extremely limited supply at affordable price points. And so where we can get that product on the ground, we continue to see very robust demand and no sign of weakness at those price points. So I think that's the main reason that's differentiating us when you look at our sales versus some of the others out there in the industry today.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Appreciate that Jessica. So thank you for that. I mean I guess second question just the strength on the gross margins coming in above your guidance and you expect it to also be achievable in the fourth quarter. It seems like some of that will carry over into fiscal 2019 as well, as you're expecting a little bit higher pre-tax. And I'd assume kind of driven roughly equally by gross and SG&A. I guess as the demand environment, to the extent that it does change at all, is that something where \u2013 I mean when you're looking at the gross margins where they are today, do you see that as kind of a peakish-type number where you feel that the gross margins don't necessarily need or shouldn't go much higher and that now you can use more of a pivot if you need to towards maintaining or ensuring that volume growth? Or is that something that you'd like to see go even higher over the next year or two?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah Mike. Thanks Mike. As we've stated pretty consistently, we're first focused on returns. And so we operate our business community by community making the decisions each day balancing pace and price, margin and absorption to generate the best return on our inventory investment. And in this limited supply environment, with very strong demand and with our positioning, in a great position for that demand at affordable price points, right now the market is giving us the opportunity to reduce incentives and increase prices. And that results in higher gross margin. So in a market environment such as this, we're seeing that opportunity. But we will continue to focus on returns regardless of how the market may change in the future. We're really primarily focused on returns first and foremost.","That being said, with what we can see in the market today, we see a healthy market. We see very good demand. We still see a very good balance of supply and demand. And so that's reflected in our guidance both for the fourth quarter and our preliminary guidance for 2019. We see an environment where we should be able to maintain our gross margins in the range of where we are today and where we reported in the third quarter. There could be quarters that are slightly higher than. There would be quarters slightly lower. But we expect to be able to maintain margins at a sustainable level around the same level as Q3.","Implication for our operating margin increase next year assumes relatively flat gross margins with the current level with continued leverage on SG&A.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning all.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So we were out looking at places in Northern California since everyone is talking about it just the other day and it was very clear to us that your spec approach enables you to get orders intra quarter versus someone taking an order for let's say January or February. So I think that helps support what we're seeing in your orders. But relative to that, could you comment on the spread of specs versus backlog orders, the gross margin, A? And then B do you think there is an impact of rising existing inventory on new home sale pace within their specific markets? Thank you.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah first Ken on the margin on specs. Clearly in a market like today, with limited supply, our margins on specs are better than usual. The spread between our margins on specs versus build jobs is tighter than normal because we're in a rising price environment, limited supply and we have inventory on the ground. So that's resulting in better margins than normal. And then in terms of the order pace and the reports of orders in a market is certainly affected by the amount of supply, hard to sell houses if there's not much supply. So clearly as we have introduced new communities, introduced product at affordable price points in markets that did not have it before, I do believe we're unlocking demand and releasing pent-up demand that's in markets today.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And as we look at existing supply that's out there in the marketplace, the first place we look at available supply is in our own neighborhoods. And we're seeing that less than half the homes we have in our inventory are available for sale. We're selling a lot of homes before they're completed, before \u2013 during the construction process. And so we're not seeing excess new home supply coming to bear in the places we're most concerned about, which is at or near our neighborhoods.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you Ken.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is now live.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Bill the comment that you made of raising price and reducing incentives in environment where some are seeing a little bit of a pause in orders. Just can you talk a little more about that? I know you just spoke to where inventories are but what do you think that you're doing that's allowing you to have that success during the period of time where it's perhaps wobbling a bit for some others?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I think it starts with positioning. It's positioning our product in our communities at an affordable price and having available inventory as well our spec strategy. I think customers are looking for a home that they can have some certainty on when they can move at. And so I think that's put us in a good position to be able to move price and not have to incent very much today. We balance that always with first and foremost focusing on returns and achieving our target sales pace in each community. And we're also always keeping an eye on making sure that our products remain affordable. So while we are certainly seeing some increase in pricing and net incentives today, we will continue to make sure that our products remain affordable.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And our scale, clearly both nationally and locally, is a huge driver of us being able to keep our costs in check. Nationally, on the materials side, we've got fantastic partners that are helping us navigate a rising cost environment. And when you look at our true stick and brick or just building cost, our purchasing teams have done a fantastic job on that front as well. And our local scale has really helped us along with our Express Homes business model, limiting floor plans, limiting options and building the same floor plan and house over and over and over again, so our trades can be very efficient and we can pay them less for that work, but they can make more money because they can get through so many more houses being that much more efficient. We continue to see this quarter our revenues slightly outpace our stick and brick costs on a per square footage basis on a year-over-year basis and the cost inflation we saw on the stick and brick and both the lot \u2013 the lot cost side was right around the mid-single-digit range.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Then roughly Forestar it seems like you're off to a good start. As you project out 12 or 18 months, how do you think how the business is run and what the results look like is influenced by Forestar? How's life different as you have that integrated and start to scale that?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah as we see life, we're starting to see that life take shape now where we're being much more collaborative early on in deal flow and working with Forestar and determining which projects would be good candidates for Forestar to bring to market. And they're identifying some opportunities organically that will be accretive to the Horton portfolio as well as their third-party builder sales. So we're excited about seeing that growth that they have, the capital that they have today and will increase over the next year, is going to be an exciting time for them to recruit more folks to their team and continue to build out their operational capabilities over the next 12 to 18 months. And that's what \u2013 frankly what we're most excited about is really putting a great organic team together that's going to be a national lot developer with access to deep pools of capital at a cost advantage to what that marketplace is like today.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","That's helpful. Great. Thank you.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on the response to one of the prior questions on costs. I think you said stick and brick was up mid-single digits, A, was curious if you could give us whether that includes labor and then B, outside of lumber, what are some of the other areas that you're seeing the most meaningful cost pressures?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","So mike the stick and brick when we use that phrase we really mean labor and materials. So it's all inclusive. We continue to see that mid-single digit cost inflation being driven almost solely by labor. Although we think we're doing a great job keeping our labor costs in check, it is a tight labor supply environment and we're having to continue to pay a little bit more to get our houses built, but we're more than happy to do that in the market we're in today. And are working to continue to be as efficient as possible to reduce labor costs where we can. Outside of \u2013 lumber has been a cost pressure. It probably is the headliner. A little bit of noise commodity-wise to concrete. But generally speaking, anywhere we've seen an increase we've had a category where we've been able to offset it. We're now nationally exclusive in over 30 product categories. And those don't all renew at the same time. So each year when we go back out to market with our national exclusive agreements that are renewing, we've had very good success in either just locking in our current pricing and not having to take a price increase or even reducing our prices further. So really appreciate all of our trade partners out there today that are helping us along the way.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's interesting. Thanks. Then on the gross margin conversation, as it relates to next year, it's interesting because just given how quickly and meaningfully you've ramped up your option portfolio over the past year-and-a-half plus, would think that a greater mix of deliveries next year will be coming from land that was originally optioned and normally you'd see some trade-off on gross margin. So can you just talk to are we seeing that mix occur and just the pricing power is such that you're able to overcome that or just how should we think about that over the next year?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah Mike we've been seeing that mix shift over the last several years. Three years ago or so we were around 30% option lots and now we're north of 50%. And so we've been able to \u2013 we certainly pay more for a finished lot when we buy it from a third-party developer. But we've been able to obviously improve our returns through that process. And with our focus on executing well community by community, we've been able to offset that increase in lot price and still maintain good margins. And so we still believe we're in good position that even as our option percentage continues to rise further, we believe our operations are in great shape to be able to absorb that and keep our margins at the level relatively close to today's level.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks. Good luck.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit to I guess the rollout that you're seeing within the Freedom product. I mean it sounds like that's definitely gaining some momentum there. And so can you talk to what you're seeing on that side?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah, Susan. Thank you. We are enjoying some success with Freedom. It's rolling out slower certainly than Express rolled out, but we expected it was going to be slower but it's growing. I think it's about 3% of sales right now, which is a significant increase from where it was. It's growing as a part of our overall product mix. And that's overall against a growing backdrop. So it's doing really well. We get that product on the ground and we see the buyer really like the product that we're offering, the sense of community we're trying to create in an affordable platform for those buyers where we can take a retiree that's a little concerned about monthly expenses and still try to give them a lot of the lifestyle value of the Freedom Home or the Active Adult neighborhood in a plan that's exactly right for their lifestyles, two bedrooms, a flex room, two-and-a-half bathrooms, it's a great focus for us in a one-story home.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","So you'll see in our brand stratification that we'll post after the call, the ASP on Freedom today is right around $260,000 and that typical home Mike talked about is about 1800 square feet. So focused on keeping it as affordable as possible just as we have with our Express brand.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful, that color. And then I guess can you talk a little bit to what you're seeing just in terms of some of the labor and the raw material side of things there. Obviously we're hearing of a lot of inflation coming through with some of the suppliers. Can you talk to how you're thinking about that?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Certainly on the labor side one of the things we look at is our build times. And we have seen our teams maintain consistent build times for the past several years from when we start a home to complete it, that time has not moved but by a few days up or down on our completions and deliveries. And so part of that speaks to the spec strategy we have, part of that speaks to the local scale we have in given markets and long and deep relationships with those labor suppliers. And as Jessica mentioned before our returns-focused approach to the communities to drive to the pace, we believe is appropriate and creates a more efficient platform for that labor, so that they're able to get to more houses, get to more simplistic processes in those houses. And they can frankly charge us less per square foot but still make more money for themselves on a day-to-day basis. So we're really excited about the results we're seeing there and how our teams are delivering and staying on top of that labor.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. So going back to the gross margin question. Very, very strong performance here and looks like it will be sustained into next year. As we think about earlier in the cycle, normal margin range was closer to 20%, now we're 150, 200 basis points above that. What do you see as the major drivers of that? And also just related to that, on new deals, do they pencil to the higher gross margin rate in the pro formas? Or do we need to see this favorable price versus mix to kind of sustain this higher level that we're seeing now?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I know I sound like a broken record a little bit. But we do focus first and foremost on returns. And then the market in each community then and our ability to achieve our sales pace then helps us determine whether the margin will be higher than pro forma or lower than pro forma.","So when we are pro-forma-ing a project, yes, typically the gross margins are in the high teens to the low-20s. It's usually somewhere in that range. But really our underwriting hurdle is to achieve a 20% net return on inventory investment based on the pre-tax income of the project. And that is always at 20% or better on every investment that we're making.","And so, yeah, we're in a good environment right now. There's very \u2013 I think the \u2013 really, the main driver is there's very limited supply of new homes in the market, especially at affordable price points. And with our positioning and the execution of our teams and the continued improvements in efficiency throughout our business, I believe those are the primary drivers behind what has now manifested itself in our gross margins here this quarter.","One other aspect in our gross margins, which we've talked about a bit last year, we had a period where our litigation and warranty costs were a bit higher than normal. The last three quarters or so, those costs have been at a more normal range. And so this quarter, 60 basis points of our year-over-year improvement in gross margin was from a reduction of litigation and warranty costs. We do expect those levels to remain pretty consistent going forward, which is again as part of our guide for margins to remain consistent.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","The other sustained improvement in our gross margins that we expect is from lower interest costs as we continue to de-lever our homebuilding business. And we think that's a big advantage in terms of what we've done with our balance sheet and the limited interest costs we now have to carry and cover in our gross margin.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it, got it. Very helpful. And second question on Forestar, obviously, with the successful rollout of the Forestar plan. Looking ahead to the capital raise, the 40% leverage ratio on a net debt to cap basis that you're targeting for that, that's normally what you would see for a homebuilder?","One might think that on a land development business somewhat higher risk might merit lower targeted debt to cap. Obviously, there's no debt at the moment or so far off from it. But just wanted to understand the thinking behind that to that level?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Sure. We stated 40% or less. Today it's significantly less than that. Today they have a negative leverage. And so as we look at the 40%, we look at that as a longer term cap, really kind of a maximum level that they would operate at, which certainly is comparable to some homebuilders, but when you look across the homebuilder universe, there's builders operating at a higher level of leverage than that. But they're not going to be at 40% overnight. It's something that as they grow out their platform, as they grow out their earning capacity, that that would be kind of a maximum level over time.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And the way we expect to run Forestar is really not what, I think, people traditionally think about a historical land developer platform. We're really thinking of Forestar as a lot manufacturer that's going to have D.R. Horton, the largest builder in the country, as one of its largest customers who needs an immense amount of finished lots. And there is a shortage of finished lots across the entire country today. So we think Forestar has a very unique opportunity to take advantage of that opportunity in the market. And plan to run with the modest leverage to help them grow that platform that there is a need for in the industry today.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","That would be a much more efficient model than you've seen in the land development business and not going to be large concentrations of individual assets. It's going to be spread across a broad geographic footprint with fast turning lot deliveries.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Production focused, return focused developer.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is now live.","Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, Good morning, guys. This is actually Soham Bhonsle on for Jack this morning. Just wanted to revisit the issue of buyer behavior and wanted to see if you guys are seeing any change there today in terms of square footage being bought or buyers moving to ARM loans today?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","No, we're really not, which really to us points to the market still being affordable, at least where we're positioned in the market. We continue to see our FICO score be very strong. We saw our first-time homebuyer percentage tick up. Our average square footage is relatively consistent. And really even the percentage of our buyers that are purchasing an attach product, whether it be a duplex or a townhome, hasn't risen that much either. So kind of all of those signs for us point to the market still generally speaking, in most parts of the country, is pretty affordable. There's just a lack of supply which does impact demand.","Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay great. That's helpful. And then second one was on order growth next year. And so sort of as we think about the drivers for growth next year, how much of your order growth is going to be driven by community count versus an improvement in pace, especially as you face higher land, labor and material costs?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","So Soham, we don't ever guide to community count officially for a reason. It's one of the hardest things for us to manage. We really focus internally more first on our houses and our lot position. And that'll tell you where we're headed. As long as we have the houses and the lots that tells you that we are going to be replenishing at a minimum our community count if not ultimately growing it. We have said that we would expect it to grow at some point. We still haven't seen that. It was down 3% year-over-year, but it was essentially flat sequentially. So feel very confident about our ability to meet our 10% to 15% consolidated revenue targets with 278,000 lots owned and controlled and almost 30,000 homes in inventory today.","Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I guess another way to ask it is do you continue to see pace improvement into next year?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yes.","Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Beyond today?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yes.","Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Thanks very much. My first question related to the West. I think you indicated that you are continuing to see some very strong results out there. I think you said absorptions worth about 15%. I think that would imply that the community count was probably down about a comparable amount since your orders were about flat and so I was wondering if you could...","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Steve, I was actually \u2013 I probably pulled the number out of my head and I should've looked at the schedule. Our absorption pace was actually up 7%. Yeah...","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","...in the west. So the community count would imply to be about down 7%.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","All right. Well that defuses that question because 7%...","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Sorry about that.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","No problem. So let me shift gears then. One of the things I was thinking about was related to your capital allocation and in particular repurchases as well as the M&A. So on the repurchases side, I think you said that you upped your authorization \u2013 or you have a new authorization of about $400 million. That replaces I think a $200 million authorization, but you've only used I think a little less than half of that over its life. And so I was curious if you could talk about the degree to which the $400 million is likely to be pursued opportunistically, or if it's going to be programmatic. And if there was any sort of valuation metric that you would be using to get opportunistic if that's what you chose to do?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Steve. As we've begun our share repurchase program, we are programmatic about it. We're going to be consistent for the time being. Our expectation is to keep our outstanding share count flat in 2019. Our authorization for $400 million is essentially a 15-month or a 5-quarter authorization to extend it out through September of 2019, whereas previously was ending in July. But we do expect to spend the majority of that authorization. We expect to spend a higher percentage of that authorization than we did the prior authorization, which ended in July.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's helpful. And then on the M&A side, historically as you've looked to acquire companies, the main focus generally centered around land banks. And historically you and many others also focused very much on a price-to-book type valuation methodology. Was curious if you could talk about the $400 million to $600 million that you think you might be willing to spend in the upcoming year or so. If there would be anything different about that this go around? And if so, what would those differences perhaps be?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I think, we're going to look at those metrics you referenced and attributes of a good land or lot position. Most importantly, we're looking at good operating teams and the people that would be joining the company. We're looking at what their particular lot supplies are, what markets they serve, whether they are in geography that we currently exist in and how we would be complementary to each other there, whether they are in a new geography. And is that a place we'd like to get into and expand our footprint?","It's a lot of the same ways we've always looked at it. And most importantly bringing on good people has been consistently the thing that pays back on an acquisition year after year, are adding good people to the team. That's the most important part of the whole process for us. Because after the land bank you acquire on day one is gone, you have the people.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Got it. Great. Thanks very much, guys. Great job.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Jay McCanless from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now live.","Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. First question, any color on July, what you're seeing from order trends?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Really just more of the same in line with our business plan and I think we're very well-positioned to finish the year out strong.","Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then a two-part question on California. Could you talk about what percentage of the current community count is located there, and then also just talk about land availability. You've got a couple of tough comps coming up for orders over the next two quarters and just seeing what the land availability is like to drive the neighborhoods and the order growth out there?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I think in the short-term, we feel pretty good about the \u2013 the land availability is already kind of crystallized in the lots and flags for short-term sales. In terms of the longer term, California is always a challenging land market and we have teams that are very focused on positioning us to be in front of what we believe is the best part of the market, which is affordable housing, below certain price points in various submarkets. And that's what our focus has been to continue to execute against those price points and that's where we're seeing our growth coming from by and large.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And then Jay we don't disclose our community count by state or by region. However, I can assure that California is about a third of the exposure this cycle is what we had last cycle. Really by choice we've got more diverse product offerings and a more diverse footprint where we can go find acceptable and attractive returns across the entire country.","So although we really like California and we're very happy with our investments there they are at a lower level this cycle compared to prior cycles.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And Jay I would tell you that within California and across our geography the travels that D.R. has had, Davis had, I've been out on the road the past six to eight weeks, we continue to see the same things. Very enthusiastic and energized sales teams and the models seeing good activity and demand in our communities and neighborhoods and the land positions that we're looking at are very strong, opportunities we have under contract, about to have under contract and are currently bringing through development or our third-party developers are bringing to market.","Really excited about the position we have against a backdrop of a market that has good job growth, undersupplied in housing, still a very accommodative interest rate environment and good consumer confidence on the outlook for the economy. So we are very enthusiastic about where the market is right now.","Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. It sounds great. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.","Michael J. Murray - D.R.

Now I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.","David Auld","","Thank you, Jessica and good morning. In addition to Jessica I am pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, recently promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill Wheat, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; ","Before we review our business and financial results with you I\u2019d like to take a minute to recognize Don Tomnitz on his recent retirement and thank him for his leadership, advice and support over the years. On behalf of the entire D.R. Horton team I\u2019d like to congratulate him on an outstanding carrier of 31 years with the company, 15 years as our CEO. During Don\u2019s tenure we grew to become the largest homebuilder in the United States and have maintained that position for over 12 years. We look forward to still working with Don in a consulting role as he continues to be involved in a number of areas of our operations.","Now onto our results. In 2014 while demand for new homes across most of our markets remained relatively stable we generated greater than 20% growth in both revenue and pre-tax income by successfully leveraging our platform as the nation\u2019s largest and most geographically diverse homebuilder. Our national market share is the largest in company history. We have closed 46% more homes than any other builder in the recently reported 12 month period and we are positioned to generate further growth. ","In the fourth quarter our homes sold and closed increased 38% and 25% respectively and we had another good quarter of profitability with $250.8 million of pre-tax income and a 10.1% pre-tax operating margin. ","Our increase community count, well stocked supply of land, plots and homes provide us with a strong competitive position. Based on a 29% increase in the value of our sales backlog and our October sales growth that exceeded 20% on a year-over-year basis we expect further double-digit growth in home closings, revenues and pre-tax profits in 2015. Our continued strategic focus is to leverage our competitive position to generate double-digit growth in both revenue and pre-tax profits while improving our cash flow and increasing our returns. Mike?","Michael Murray","Net income for the fourth quarter increased to 19% to $166.3 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to $139.5 million or $0.40 per diluted share in the year ago quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 24% to $250.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to $202.8 million in the year ago quarter and home building pre-tax income increased 25% to $236.6 million compared to $189.4 million. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 33% to $2.4 billion on 8,612 homes closed, up from $1.8 billion on 6,866 homes closed in the year ago quarter.","Our average closing price for the quarter was $279,100, up 6% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a 4% increase on our average home size and a small increase on our average sales price per square foot. Bill?","Bill Wheat","","The value of our net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 41% from the year ago quarter to $2 billion and homes sold increased 38% to 7,135 homes on a 10% increase in average active selling communities. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 2% to $281,700. The cancellation rate for the quarter was 28%, down from 31% in the year ago quarter.","The value of our backlog increased 29% from a year ago to $2.9 billion with an average sales price per home of $289,100 and homes in backlog increased 21% to 9,888 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter was 76%. We expect backlog conversion rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 to be around 75%, which is higher than our long-term first quarter average.","We also expect our home closings for the full year of fiscal 2015 to increase 20% to 30% compared to fiscal 2014 based on the current relatively stable housing market conditions. Please note that percentage changes in our average active community counts and our quarterly net sales orders by region for fiscal 2013 and \u201814 will be included in the supplementary data we referenced earlier which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website after this call. Jessica.","Jessica Hansen","","We continue to experience strong growth in profitability in the heart of our business in our D.R. Horton branded communities which accounted for the substantial majority of our sales and closings this quarter. We are also pleased with the progress and performance of the rollouts of our Express Homes and Emerald Homes brands. Our Express Homes brand, which is targeted at true entry level buyer focused primarily on affordability is now being offered in 24 markets and eight states, with the significant majority of our Express sales and closings to-date coming from Texas and the Carolinas.","This quarter Express accounted for 10% of our homes sold, 6% of homes closed and 4% of home sales revenue. The average closing price of an Express Home in the fourth quarter was $169,000. For the year Express accounted for 7% of our homes sold, 5% of homes closed and 3% of home sales revenue. Customer response to our affordable Express product offerings has been extremely positive and we expect to have Express Homes communities open in the majority of our markets by the end of fiscal 2015.","Emerald Homes, our brand for higher end move up and luxury communities is now available in 34 markets across 14 states. In the fourth quarter 7% of our homes closed were priced higher than $500,000, accounting for 17% of our home sales revenue, up from 5% of homes closed and 13% in revenues in the same quarter last year. For the year 6% of our homes closed were priced higher than $500,000, accounting for 16% of our home sales revenue up from 4% in homes closed and 10% in revenues in fiscal 2013. We plan to continue to steadily introduce new Emerald Homes communities across more of our markets in fiscal 2015. Mike?","Michael Murray","","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 20.5%, down 20 basis points sequentially from the third quarter. The sequential margin decrease was primarily driven by a 70 basis point impact from cost increases in excess of sales price increases and changes in our product mix. The decrease was partially offset by a margin increase of 30 basis points from lower relative warranty and litigation cost, 10 basis points from lower interest and property tax cost and 10 basis points from a lower purchase accounting impact from acquisitions. ","Our fourth quarter incentive level was essentially flat with the third quarter. Compared to the prior year our home sales gross margin decreased 140 basis points primarily to due to the combined effect of cost increases in excess of sales price increases and higher incentives. As we have discussed on previous calls our incentive levels were extremely low in most markets during fiscal 2013 and early 2014, but incentives returned to normal levels in many markets during the course of 2014 with significant variations across our communities. ","With the very strong performance of our express communities so far we expect this brand to grow quickly as a percentage of our product mix which will help us generate strong growth in both revenues and profits. But will likely bring our average gross margin percentage down in fiscal 2015 from our current level. In the current stable housing environment we generally expect our average home sales gross margin to be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations that can range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix and the relative impact of warranty, litigation and interest cost. As a reminder our reported gross margins include all of our interest cost. Historical detail on the components impacting our home sales gross margin will be included in the supplementary data on our website after this call. Bill?","Bill Wheat","","Home building SG&A expense for the quarter was $241 million compared to $186.6 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of home building revenues our SG&A improved 40 basis points to 9.9% this quarter compared to 10.3% in the prior year quarter. Fiscal 2014 SG&A as a percentage of home building revenues was 10.6% compared to 10.7% in fiscal 2013. During 2014, we made significant investments in our SG&A infrastructure to support our current and expected growth and we expect to leverage these SG&A investments in 2014 and move closer to our annual SG&A goal of 10% of home building revenues.","In the first two quarters of fiscal 2015 we expect our SG&A as a percentage of home building revenues to be seasonally higher than in our third and fourth quarters as we typically deliver fewer homes in the first half of the fiscal year than in the second half. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","","Financial services\u2019 pretax income for the quarter increased 6% to $14.2 million from $13.4 million in the year ago quarter. 88% of our mortgage companies loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our home building operation. FHA and VA loans accounted for 42% of the mortgage company volume this quarter down from 45% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company had an average FICO score of 719 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. Select historical data from our mortgage company including loan product mix will also be included in the supplementary data on our website after this call. David?","David Auld ","At the end of September, we had 20,600 homes in inventory, of which 1,500 were models, 11,200 were spec homes and 3,900 of the specs were completed. Our construction in progress and finished homes inventory increased by $159 million during the quarter. Our fourth quarter investment in lots, land and development totaled $618 million of which $353 million was to replenish finished lots and land, and $265 million was for land development. ","In 2014 we invested $2.3 billion in land, lots and development. At September 30, 2014 our lot portfolio consisted of 125,000 owned lots with an additional 59,000 lots controlled through option contracts. 69,000 of our lots are finished with 32,000 owned and 37,000 optioned. Our 184,000 total lots owned and controlled put us in a strong competitive position in the current housing market, with a sufficient lot supply to support strong growth in sales and closings in future periods.","As we invest in new communities for all three of our brands our main underwriting criteria is a minimum annual pretax return on inventory of 20% defined as pre-tax income divided by average inventory over the life of the community. We expect each community regardless of brand to achieve this target by optimizing the balance between absorptions, margins and inventory levels that is most appropriate for that community. For reference our total home building pretax return on inventory has improved 560 basis points over the past two years from 5.5% at 2012 to 11.1% in 2014 and we expect to make further improvement on this metric in 2015, as we improve our pretax profitability and manage our inventory levels efficiently. Mike?","Michael Murray ","","During the fourth quarter we recorded $3.2 million in land options charges for write-offs of earnest money and deposits -- for earnest money deposits and due diligence cost for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded $18.1 million of impairment charges of which $15.7 million were in our East region primarily related to long held inactive and underperforming projects in the Washington D. C. area that we intend to sale to improve returns by redeploying the capital into more productive assets. Our inactive land held for development of $332.8 million at the end of the year represents 14,000 loss, down 17% from June and down 33% from year ago. We are proactively working through these older unproductive assets to redeploy the capital, thereby improving the cash flows and returns. ","We continue to formulate our operating plans for each of our remaining inactive land parcels and we expect that our land held for development balance will continue to decline during fiscal 2015. We will continue to evaluate our active land parcels for potential impairments. These evaluations may results in additional impairment charges in future periods but the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate as they have in the past Bill?","Bill Wheat","At September 30th our homebuilding liquidity included $632.5 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $582 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility. We had $300 million of cash borrowings and $92.7 million of letters of credit outstanding on the revolver. Our gross homebuilding leverage was 39.4% and our homebuilding leverage ratio net of cash was 34.5%. During the quarter we've repaid $137.9 million of our senior notes at their maturity in September. Our homebuilding debt maturities in fiscal 2015 are $158 million and our public notes outstanding at September 30 totaled $3 billion. Our fiscal year end shareholders' equity balance was $5.1 billion and book value per share was $14.04, up 12% from a year ago, Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Looking forward, we would like to highlight some of our future expectations which are based on the current relatively stable housing market conditions. In fiscal 2015 we expect to close between 34,500 and 37,500 homes and generate consolidated revenues of between $9.5 billion and $10.5 billion. We anticipate our home sales gross margin for the full year in fiscal 2015 will range from 19.5% to 20.5% with potential quarterly fluctuation outside of this range. We estimate our homebuilding SG&A expense to range from 10% to 10.3% of homebuilding revenues for the full year with the first two quarters of the year being higher than this range and third and fourth quarters at the low end or below the annual range. ","We expect our financial services operating margin to range from 25% to 30%. We are forecasting our fiscal 2015 income tax rate to be between 35% and 36% and our diluted share count to be approximately 370 million shares. For our first fiscal quarter 2015, we expect our number of homes closed to approximate the beginning backlog conversion rate of around 75%. We anticipate our first quarter home sales gross margin will be around 19.5% to 20% subject to potential fluctuations from product mix warranty and interest cost. And we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the first quarter to be around 11% of revenues, David?","David Auld ","In closing our fourth quarter and 2014 growth in sales, closings and profits in relatively stable market is a result of the strength of our operating platform and we are excited about our opportunities ahead. This quarter, the value of our sales and closings increased by 41% and 33% respectively and we generated another solid quarter of profitability with consolidated pretax income of $250.8 million on $2.5 billion of revenue. For the year, the value of our sales closings and backlog increased by 27%, 30% and 29% respectively and consolidated pretax income increased 24% to $814.2 million on $8 billion of revenue. We also made considerable progress this year toward our long-term goal of producing positive cash flow from operations. Whilst still growing the business our cash used in operations of $661 million improved by $570 million from last year's level and we expect further substantial progress in our cash flow performance in 2015. ","We remained focused on growing both our revenues and pre-tax profit at a double-digit pace while improving our cash flows and increasing our returns. We are well positioned to do this with our solid balance sheet, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our three brands, attractive finish lots and land position and most importantly our tremendous operational team across the country.","I would like to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and accomplishments this year and we look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operations to make 2015 an even better year. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question today is coming from Steven Kim from Barclays. Please proceed with your question","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital","Hey, guys good results. Wishing you guys a proud Veterans Day. I wanted to ask you a quick question regarding incentives. I think you had indicated that your incentives were flat sequentially, which I think is going to perceived positively by folks who have been concerned that you are going to be ramping your incentives pretty significantly. You have also talked about increasing the share of your business, your volumes that\u2019s going to be coming from Express and I was wondering if can talk specifically about your strategy around incentives as you have seen Express evolving and whether you see the approach you are going to be using for incentives being different for the Express communities, then for the Emerald or the Horton communities and what that\u2019s is going to mean for incentives going forward?","David Auld","","Steve it\u2019s David. The market we find the market to be relatively stable and in fact we had significant pricing power last year in Q1, Q2 we saw that slide down, increased incentives but really just back to normal market type conditions and right now we feel pretty good about kind of where we are in the market and what\u2019s taken place out there. ","Michael Murray"," ","And in terms of our approach to you know incentives across our brand, Steven we don\u2019t see a significant change from where we have been in the past. We manage our incentives at community by community level and we go in regardless a brand with our business plan for each community and we look to achieve that and if depending on how the market responds then we adjust our incentive levels. I think that would apply to our approach really across all three of our brands.","Bill Wheat","","Clearly with the Express we are providing a tremendous value to the buyer in the marketplace today and so we are not seeing a significant level of incentives across the board in Express. Community by community we are going to manage to what that market is but within Express we are seeing from market acceptance and a buyer that\u2019s been underserved.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital","","Yeah, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s exactly what we are looking for. The second question relates to the use of speculative building and I think you guys in your prepared remarks gave us some numbers. I wanted to just generally though speak about or ask about what you are seeing in the marketplace and what\u2019s your intention going forward is with respect to the role of specular building. Some of your peers have indicated that they are sort expecting to go into the spring selling season with a higher level of spec activity with the hope of capturing those buyers who have chosen to sell their house first before trying to sign a contract for another one and so were looking for quick move in. ","I guess A, do you generally believe or agree the presence of this kind of buyer is -- would make having more specs than normal historically a good strategy entering spring selling season? Are you preparing for that and are you seeing your competitors taking steps to prepare for that yet?","David Auld","","Have not really seen significant competition out in the market from other builders on the spec build program. That has always been what we've done. We've always tried to look at the next quarter out and align ourselves for what we believe demand will be based upon what we're seeing that day. Spec building is a good consistent way to manage communities and drive absorption that's just something we've always done. ","Jessica Hansen ","","And as a reminder Steve about 70 to 80% of our closings each quarter are specs. So when you're looking at our reported gross margin that's essentially a spec gross margin. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets","David Auld ","Good morning Ken.","Jessica Hansen ","Good morning Ken. ","Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets","So a rather different approach to the forward year this year. The growth that you gave in terms of your closings and I think everyone is going to be happy it sounds like that you are disclosing community count, is that accurate. ","Jessica Hansen ","We're not actually disclosing absolute community count but we are giving you two years of historical data of what our community counts done in percentage terms at a regional level. ","Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Then what is the underlying, and I apologize if I missed it with all the numbers you're giving but the 34,500 to 37,000 unit closing what does that imply for community count growth? ","Bill Wheat","In terms of community count growth we actually expect the increase in our community count we\u2019re at 10% this quarter we expect that to moderate in to 2015 and we could be relatively flat on year-over-year basis for the whole year. Any increases would be more in the mid to single digit range but clearly our expectation, as we have shown in the last couple of quarters is for improvement in our absorptions per community and that\u2019s really what we plan to drive the 20% to 30% increase in our closings next year. ","Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Interesting. So that's actually largely coming from absorption. So related to that and David we had talked about this earlier in the year with the success you guys have been having with Express because it\u2019s going to be rising as a percent of orders and closings, if you could highlight the kind of the dynamic between the volume you're seeing and the revenue. So I think you basically said it was like 5% in closings, 3% of revenue. How does one think about the incremental flow through of you get the volumes but since it's less ASP the margins can be the same but you're pulling less dollars through? I mean do you think this 1.5 million starts certain share as it relates to single family homes, is this going to happen at a lot lower price point that Express is a characteristic of?","David Auld ","Well I can tell you our model, our thought process us we're going to grow every brand. Now the Express brand is going to grow faster because we're introducing a new product into an underserved market across the country and there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand that we're picking up with that brand. We're not growing Express at the expense of Horton. The Horton brand will continue to grow and the Emerald brand really were just rolling out still. I mean it's got a lot upside.","Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Yes, I think you're heading to a sweet spot there. Is that -- the average price, is it kind of saying, did you talk about how much you think the price is down given the business, the product mix for next year?","Michael Murray","I think we're looking going forward Canada at a flat ASP hard to predict because the potential changes in mix that we'll be seeing. But as David said we're looking to grow all the brands Express growing probably at a faster clip than the other brands but we're still seeing good growth in demand across all brands and still seeing some markets where we have price appreciation which helps to offset a bit of the mix changes. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","","Hi. Thanks. Good morning and nice quarter. ","David Auld ","Thank you.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","The first question I had was I guess circling back to Express but asked a little bit of a different way and I think you started to hit on this in talking about community count but with your outlook for growth next year being I guess you're saying primarily driven by an increase in absorption, is that going to be primarily driven by the higher mix of Express or is there going to be perhaps growth in certain regions that maybe have a lower ASP or a faster turn. Just trying to get a sense because to have absorption up 15%, 20% or more next year I think that\u2019s probably pretty much ahead of the pack right now in terms of how most of the builders are thinking about \u201915, if haven\u2019t articulated it explicitly and so just trying to get a sense is that really the Express Homes initiative or is it a regional mix or do you have a view of certain of the markets that\u2019s a little bit different?","David Auld","","Thank you. This is David, Michael. I think the Express is certainly a factor in it and regional growth is also a factor. We\u2019re very strongly positioned right now in Texas and Carolinas and Florida and those are growth markets. And so we expect to do well or better there than we have in the past and Express as we continue to roll that out we are seeing high unit absorptions there. So it\u2019s -- that\u2019s why we think overall we\u2019ll see pricing power in certain markets but the Express brand at that price point as it grows and becomes a bigger percentage is going to keep our average sales price pretty much flat and we think that\u2019s a good thing.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","Right, no it makes sense. And I guess just circling back on the incentives for a moment, just wanted to clarify you said that incentives in the fourth quarter were flat sequentially. I would presume that was on closings not orders so if that\u2019s correct just trying to get a sense of perhaps on an order basis the orders themselves as you are bringing in the new sales over the past three months were the incentives on those order also relatively stable versus the prior quarter and as a result should we infer that the gross margin for next year coming in a little bit is primarily driven by a mix I think as you have stated.","Michael Murray","","I think that\u2019s a pretty fair characterization of everything Michael. Incentives have been flat on the closings that was correct and we are probably seeing a similar flat trend in the sales line right now. So that has brought us down for the full year margin expectations for next year from where we were in fiscal 2014.","David Auld","","And clearly with Express driving much high absorptions in volume but slightly lower on a gross margin side but as it grows to a bigger mix of our overall business that\u2019s the primary driver for us moderating back to our normal gross margin range of around 20%.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen East from ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group","","Thank you. David congratulations on your role.","David Auld","","Thank you, Stephen.","Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group","","If I look at call it your first six weeks or so a couple of different questions, one where your first focus and actions have been and then when you look out a bit longer what vision do you see for Horton? Everybody has got their own twist on things so how maybe does your vision differ a little bit from DTs as you move out three, five years?","David Auld ","","I guess the initial focus is really getting our handle on this public position role Stephen I have always been behind the curtain kind of guy and being pushed out front is different for me. Three to five years down the road I think my goal is just to continue the excellence companies had, focus is on consistency really on a day-by-day, subdivision by subdivision execution. I feel like our position in the industry today is so unique, the fact that we have been the largest for as long as we\u2019ve been the largest, the geographic footprint that we have it really is, if we just execute and do what we can do on a day-to-day basis we should have a great three to five year run.","Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group","","Okay, I appreciate that. And then different topic if you look at the SG&A, your goal has always been 10% and I guess my question here is most builders yourself included have talked a lot about hey, during the downturn we've gotten a lot more efficient. We've been able to do more with less people et cetera. Why shouldn't we expect in this, maybe even in 2015 but why shouldn't we expect that SG&A to drop down below the levels you run in previous cycles?","David Auld ","Well, I'm probably going to get in trouble for this but that is my expectation. If we do not, because we're more efficient, we do have great operators out there, the launch of the Emerald, Express that we've been through the last couple of years, we did have to build some infrastructure and ramp up and I have told all these guys and all the people out there in the field that our expectation is to leverage that position and become more efficient. So that is my expectation. The accounts are going to disagree with me.","Jessica Hansen ","That might be a little bit longer term view too and not a fiscal '15 call Steven.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Hi, good morning. David, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that I think one of the focus was going to be to improve cash flow. Operating cash flow was negative for the past three years. So I was wondering when or if we should expect an inflection point in that and when you actually plan on starting to generate cash?","David Auld","","I think right now we expect to be relatively flat this year. If the market remains stable or even gives us a little bit more we could beat that.","Bill Wheat","And flat even cash flow this next year would be an improvement of $660 million. So that would be a substantial improvement but I think specifically I think we're pretty close to that inflection point.","David Auld ","Yes.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Okay. Second question was there has been some speculation or percolation, I guess on Texas and oil prices and things like that. I was wondering if you had any comments you wanted to share on what you've been seeing recently. I know it's pretty early but just any thoughts there would be helpful.","David Auld ","Texas remains strong for us. I think if oil prices stay down it could soften somewhat but any softening we see in Texas, I think low oil prices should create additional demand in the other markets. So we're Texas based but we're significant in really every market in the country that we want to be in. So it's pretty good balanced for us. Could actually be beneficial.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Hi, good morning and really nice quarter. Just wanted to get some color on the impairment charge of $21 million in the quarter. I know you had one for $57 million in 3Q. Any color about this would be great and what should we think about charges going forward?","Bill Wheat","Well Bob the charges we took this quarter were primarily in our Washington D C area. We had a couple of long lived old projects that we had for a quite well that were inactive and we evaluated the market and had some opportunities to sell those projects and so we're looking to move forward with those, redeploy that capital. We\u2019ve consistently been working through our older land positions, bringing most of it into production in our home building operations and most of that not requiring an impairment charge when it comes into operations. ","So looking forward we're going to continue to evaluate all these projects in the market that we're in and look to make that capital work for the company as quickly as we can. When we do elect to sell something, when that's the best option for us, that has traditionally produced the bigger impairment charges and hard to predict when or if those things will be occurring.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Okay, that's helpful and I think it's for Bill. You guys had a very robust balance sheet, net debt to home buildings in the mid 30's. You're obviously trying to drive better financial performance with 20% ROI inventory. What's the goal? How should we think about the balance sheet in the context of land spend is going to continue next year. Looks like you might burn a little cash as you grow the business. What's your target for net home building debt-to-capital? Thanks and good luck.","Bill Wheat","You bet. Thanks, Bob. From a net debt-to-cap we've consistently said we wanted to stay out or below 40% to 45% range. Clearly we're bit below that right now and we're comfortable in the mid 30's as well and really so as long as we are in a good solid position we have flexibility. Right now our first priority as we look at our business, look at the opportunities in the marketplace to generate returns in our business and that\u2019s going to be the first priority for our investments of capital. ","With that being said we feel like we are in a great position in our land position. So we are not having to grow that position significantly right now. So right now in terms of land and development expectations, spending expectations for fiscal \u201915 we would expect that to be relatively flat with fiscal \u201914, right now but that will depend also then ultimately on what we see in the sales environment in the spring, if things are much stronger than we expect in the spring we might expect -- we might wind up investing more than we did in fiscal \u201914 but conversely if you go the other way as well. ","So first and foremost we are going to look at the business. Secondly, we will continue to handle our debt obligations as we move forward and continue to pay the dividend.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Goldberg from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","David Goldberg \u2013 UBS","","Thanks good morning everybody and congratulations David.","David Auld","","Thank you, David.","David Goldberg - UBS","","My first question, I was wondering if you can get a step back and just think a little bit if you guys just kind of take us through the actual procedure to determine what kind of spec you guys want heading into the next year, the spec count now under construction is up 24%-25%. It\u2019s inline with obviously your kind of closing guidance for fiscal \u201915. But if you kind of go through the mechanics of how you get to that number with your local operators I think that will be helpful in terms of the assumptions and kind of puts and close you put into the process.","David Auld","","Well David, I kind of always keep saying this and it gets monotonous but it really does come down to specific demand or expected demand within a community within a sub-market within a division and we build these models for these programs based on our position in that community and what kind of demand or absorption we think it will give us at the margin we want to make. And so from a very simplistic standpoint and it varies throughout the year but we generally like to have about three months of sales at three various stages of inventory coming out of the ground. ","So if it\u2019s a community doing till a month that will be carrying six packs in that community, two completed, two at frame and two at slab. And then sale into that inventory, supplement sales with build out. As you go community by community and add it all up that\u2019s how we get to the numbers we get into. ","David Goldberg - UBS","That\u2019s very helpful and just as a follow-up question I was wondering if you can talk about the kind of leverage you are seeing in land, on the land acquisition side and what we should expect as you move to more Express series land purchases? I would assume there is little more financial leverage, little bit easier to option that land. So maybe you could talk about kind of what are seeing in the market and what you think that means for the balance sheet as the [patio] shift a little bit more towards Express is that going to be more free cash flow generative as you move forward, less free cash flow intensive, I guess how we think about it?","David Auld","","I think on the leverage side I mean when there was nobody out there developing lots we -- and there were finished lots on the ground, that we could buy at very advantageous prices we ended with a lot of owned lots and one of the prior questions was about focus. One of the things that I think we need to do is move back to our historical 50-50 owned versus option plots and as developers are coming back into the market, one of our primary objective is to maintain develop, maintain and support those relationships. So that we have people to delivering lots in front of us and the high absorption communities, the high absorption model of Express it is a perfect place to get some body in front of us doing it.","Jessica Hansen","","David, we are pretty much down on the 50-50 on our finished lot position and we have made good progress on our overall owned position but we are still not there. We\u2019re about 68% owned, 32% options so we are headed in the right direction to get to that 50-50 split that David mentioned.","Michael Murray","We have got some good development partners out there and we are going to try to grow this relationships and strengthen them.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mike Roxland from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Roxland - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Hi, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on your new role David.","David Auld","","Thank you, Mike.","Michael Roxland - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Can you just talk about some of the progress you have made on improving your construction efficiency with respect to the Emerald brand. Obviously that\u2019s a new brand for you guys and you have experienced, I think from growing pains with the product and just wanted to see where you are in the learning curve and how the efficiency in terms of the construction has improved let\u2019s say quarter over the last couple of quarters?","David Auld ","I think we are learning that buyer and that market and adjusting different processes and procedures to meet the expectations that, that buyer has and I think our original, some of the original product we put out we probably were building more for ourselves than for the customer and we are adjusting that and really just drilling down and putting into the houses what that buyer really wants. And I guess it\u2019s going to create efficiency and improve our overall performance of the brand.","Michael Murray","Specifically Mike we haven\u2019t measured the -- we don\u2019t have in front of us the production turn times for each by brand. So we really can\u2019t comment any specific changes this quarter versus last.","Michael Roxland - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Got you. But just suffice to say have you seen an improvement in the margins that you are generating from that product relative to a couple of quarters ago?","David Auld","","Yes we have. Yes, as we drill down and understand what that buyer wants we are generating higher margins.","Michael Roxland - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Got you. And then just last question, you mentioned that your incentives were flat quarter-over-quarter. I think in last quarter you mentioned that you weren\u2019t happy with the absorption pace as you raise your incentive levels. Is it fair to say now that you are happy with the absorptions that you are seeing on an aggregate basis and that if these continue there is no need for you to discount any further because you are happy with the sales pace overall?","David Auld ","We are on plan meeting our absorption targets. So yes we are happy with where we are right now and so that\u2019s\u2026","Bill Wheat","Yes in total we are certainly pleased with where we are and what we are seeing overall but again we don\u2019t necessarily manage it at a global level. We\u2019re going to manage at each community. So we have some communities where we may be cutting back on incentives because we are exceeding our absorption targets, some might be right on track, some might be a little short. So we are going to increase incentives. So but in total absolutely a 38% increase we feel like the aggregate result is definitely in line with where we want to be.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","Good morning.","David Auld ","Good morning.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","In terms of input cost just curious if you could talk a little bit about the trended land cost where we are as you are working through your inventory, if that is something that\u2019s changing meaningfully? And then also your assumptions in terms of building components and what trends happened there? And then eventually curious on how you think about that how that is matching up with your average selling price expectation for 2015?","Jessica Hansen","Sure Eric. Our land cost has remained relatively flat as a component of the overall cost going into our house. We called out some of the other things that did impact our margin this quarter but land remained relatively flat.","Bill Wheat","And in terms of the other input cost on a year-over-year basis we have seen some cost pressures, our stick and brick cost on a per square foot basis were up about 5%. On a year-over-year basis, sequentially they are up about 2%.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","As you think about those factors into \u201915, a year where I think you talked about no real expected change in ASP, some of that a function of mix how do you think about that balance between those factors?","David Auld ","I think the mix is probably the biggest driver of the flat average sales price. We do and are experiencing pricing power in a lot of our markets.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","Steady as she goes.","David Auld ","Yes, consistency is I guess is kind of a right now, we are seeing a lot of consistency on the market at the subdivision level, at the division level and I think it\u2019s going to be a good year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks and congratulations to David and Mike on your new roles.","David Auld","Thank you, Nishu.","Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I wanted to ask first about the October sales trends, obviously a strong number, 20% plus in the context of what we have been seeing from just the industry in general but somewhat of a slowdown from the pace in the September quarter. How should we think about that I mean obviously going into year-end I imagine there is a real push. So is that just month-to-month volatility maybe around the year end or have you seen some slow down into October?","Jessica Hansen ","Nishu that shows that we get for given more than we normally do on a monthly basis. But we wanted to give a little bit of color but as we always have said a month does not make a quarter. So we're letting you know that our October sale phase was strong and we feel good with what we've seen thus far even though we're only 11 days into November and greater than 20% in October. As David said earlier we're on plan to deliver what is in our business plan and you'll have to wait till January to see what we deliver for the quarter.","Michael Murray","I wouldn't read anything special into whether we accelerated or decelerated in October. I think in general we would still say it's a very good sales environment, still a very good sales month for us. 20% was the floor. ","David Auld ","Nishu, we're looking for consistency, month to month.","Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay and second question the 20% return on inventory metric, the pretax income divided by the average investment in the community over the life of it. That sounds like a local at the divisional level. So I imagine that's not fully loaded with the entire expense structure. So my question is how would we translate that number to the overall D.R. Horton corporate level and how -- what is your target for that number? I mean let's say that 20% translates to, I don't know to 15ish%, what's your target and when would you expect to get there?","Bill Wheat","Nishu, first of all definitionally that 20% is a fully loaded number at that community level. So we look at our project pro formas and performances on a fully burdened basis to drive that 20% average pre-tax return on the inventory investment in that community. So that will translate up as a goal to the total. Obviously we're not there yet. We\u2019re little over 11% on a consolidated basis, including any impairments we've taken but to get all the way to 20% on a consolidated basis, I don't have a timeline for when it's going to be there? But that is what we're pushing the bar too and that's what we're measuring ourselves against internally. ","David Auld ","Steady consistent improvement in the ROI is the goal when we feel like it's we're doing the things today that should achieve steady improvement.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is from Michael Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Dahl - Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks. Wanted to ask just as a point of reference if we go back to the mix of communities, thinking about the absorption, could you give us a sense of just how much of a difference in absorption there is between Express, Horton, and Emerald?","Michael Murray","Yeah, in general Mike our Express communities on absorption basis is about double our company average ball park, which is kind of inline with where our expectations would be and then Emerald is certainly lower than our company average but obviously the dollars per home is much greater.","Michael Dahl - Credit Suisse","Got it and then I guess on a related topic, than if we think about the margin guide for next year, 19.5% to 20.5%, is that - I mean I guess what's the biggest delta and I guess you did mention it could be higher or lower than that range quarter-to-quarter, what's the biggest driver that you think of that could push it to either the low end or the high end based on what you're seeing today.","David Auld ","I think the fit to low end would be a change in market conditions where right now we've been experiencing stability in the market and slight improvement kind of month-to-month quarter-to-quarter. We had a reset on values at spring which we responded to with additional incentives. But since that we're operating kind of on flat waters right now. ","Michael Murray","And then absent a change in market conditions I really feel the product mix changes as we roll out Express, primarily is the wild card in terms of exactly how that translates to margins quarter-to-quarter is probably the biggest driver and is assuming the market stays stable.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Yes, hi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you can provide some color on what you are seeing in the market, if you are seeing less competition for land parcels, if there is any geographic color on what you find most attractive and maybe just the average size of new deals you are looking at.","David Auld","Well competition in the market is always there. We had a very [brief of] opportunity in 2011 and \u201912, really we were the only ones buying. But since then everybody is back. Right now we are pretty much in a replacement mode mark-to-market. The markets that are generating high levels of sales is where we are putting most of the dollars. And I don\u2019t remember the third part of the question.","Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","Average size maybe in terms of number of lots?","David Auld","","Typically we underwrite to a two year cash back program. So it depends on the absorption that we should be generating out of that on an average. So it\u2019s 50 to 100 lots probably.","Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","Great, thanks. Just secondly, a follow-up on the mix of buyer profiles and I apologize if you gave this earlier in the quarter but do you have the mix of orders, your first and first time move up?","Jessica Hansen","","Sure, Jade and we only have that data from the buyers that use our mortgage company which is about 50% of our buyers this quarter roughly and we were at 39% first time homebuyers for the quarter.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Megan McGrath from MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners","","Good morning, thanks. I guess most of my questions have been answered but did want to ask as a follow-up to that last question any thoughts on the recent news from the FHFA and as a follow-up to that, I know it\u2019s hard to some times to get data on those who didn\u2019t come through the system but any sense of what\u2019s the bigger issue for your buyer, is it down payment typically or is it you know more a DTI issue? Thanks.","David Auld","","In terms of the FHA, FHA clearly there is a lot of talk going on in terms of our assumption as we look at our business. We are not assuming any change in the mortgage environment, just the same current mortgage lending standards. Any changes going forward we will deal with those as they come.","Jessica Hansen","","In terms of the biggest issue Megan really anything we tell you is going to primarily anecdotal but we do hear DTI is one of the bigger categories that our buyers struggle with today which is why Express we feel has been very positive for us. We can\u2019t control our buyers debt level but we can control the sales price of the houses we are selling and so if we can help with that piece of the debt to income metric we have seen a lot of success on that front.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners","","Great, thanks helpful. And I guess just as a follow-up on the balance sheet and capital allocation it feels like going through this earnings season we have seen a bit of a higher level of announcements around share buyback from homebuilders. Certainly with your announcement on expect to share count, it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s something that you are looking at but maybe give your thoughts on why it\u2019s something that you don\u2019t feel is something you want to pursue?","David Auld","","Right now we still see tremendous opportunities to invest in our business. We are generating improving returns. We are seeing the opportunity to grow at an improving return. So right now that is our highest priority. We would never rule out buybacks at some point in the future but right now we still see great opportunities in our business.","Operator","","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Alex Barron from Housing Research Center. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Barron - Housing Research Center","","Thanks and good morning and congratulations on the quarter and everybody in their new roles.","David Auld","","Thank you, Alex.","Alex Barron - Housing Research Center","","I wanted to focus a little bit on Express I am sorry if you already covered it and I missed it. But I think you said that deliveries -- or the orders were 10% and the deliveries were l believe 7%. How do you guys see the what percentage are you guys kind of thinking or aiming at for 2015 and also what kind of sales rates, I guess are you guys thinking or experiencing so far in Express and last question on Express how many communities do you have currently and how many do you expect to have by the end of next year?","Jessica Hansen","","Sure, Alex. As we said for the quarter that Express is 10% of our home sales and 6% of our closing. For the full fiscal year it was 7% of our home sales and 5% of our closings and we don\u2019t have any set targets for where that\u2019s going to go in fiscal 2015 but we would continue to expect we would continue to expect to ramp-up our community openings in \u201915 and have the sales and closings follow. We have talked about over the next few years we think Express could be everywhere from 25% to 30% of our unit.","Alex Barron - Housing Research Center","","And do you guys track the number of [new home] buyers that you have seen so far in this quarter or this year?","Jessica Hansen","","We don\u2019t, Alex.","Alex Barron - Housing Research Center","","But do you expect that to be a meaningful size of your buyers I guess through the Express range?","David Auld","","You know that certainly possible Alex and certainly where we are on the calendar there is more of those that have the potential to come back in to the market but that\u2019s not something we are specifically targeting necessarily.","Operator","","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Don Tomnitz, President and CEO, D.R. Horton. Mr. Tomnitz, you may begin.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Joining me this morning are David Auld, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Bill Wheat, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Murray, Senior Vice President of Business Development; and Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Communications.","Before we get started, Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Some comments made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you, Jessica. The spring selling season is well underway. Our net sales orders in the March quarter were up 57% sequentially in the December quarter and at 9% from the second quarter of last year. Our average sales price increased by 10% year-over-year to $278,900, driving a 20% increase in the value of our net sales. Our solid sales performance resulted in an 18% increase in our backlog value compared to the prior year quarter, putting us in a strong position for increased revenue and profitability in the second half of fiscal 2014.","Our team of operators across the country also delivered outstanding profitability this quarter, with $201.9 million of pretax income on $1.7 billion of revenues, resulting in a pretax operating margin of 11.6%.","Housing market conditions remained favorable and continue to improve in a manner consistent with our long-stated expectations for the housing recovery. As expected, we are seeing the pace and the strength of the recovery vary significantly across our local operating markets, mostly tied to improvement in each markets economy is measured by growth in jobs, household incomes, household formations and increases in consumer confidence.","D.R. Horton is well-known for operating homes for the first-time and first-time move-up buyer, with 56% of our homes closing at an average sales price of $250,000 or less this quarter. We are experiencing solid demand and profitability in the heart of our business in our D.R. Horton communities.","Our high-end, Emerald brand continues to grow and is currently being offered in 27 markets across 10 states. This growth is evident as 6% of our homes closed this quarter were priced higher than $500,000, accounting for 16% of our home sales revenue, up from 3% on homes closed and 9% on revenues in the same quarter the prior year.","We believe that the true entry-level buyer is underserved in the current market, especially after the significant increases in home prices in the last 2 years. Therefore, we recently introduced a new brand, Express Homes, targeted at the true entry-level buyer that is focused first and foremost on affordability. Our rollout of Express is in the very early stages, just getting off the ground in 13 markets and 4 states. The price points of an Express Home will vary from market to market, but will consistently focus on providing an affordable entry-level home.","We look forward to growing all 3 of our brands and product offerings to gain market share across all price points as the recovery continues. We are positioned to grow revenues at a double-digit pace with strong operating margins for generating increasing returns. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Our consolidated pretax income increased 42% to $201.9 million in the second quarter from $142.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Our pretax income as a percentage of consolidated revenue was 11.6%, an increase of 170 basis points from 9.9% in the year-ago quarter.","Homebuilding pretax income increased 50% to $191.7 million from $127.4 million, and financial services pretax income was $10.2 million compared to $14.7 million. Net income for the second quarter increased 18% to $131 million or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to $111 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Mike?","Michael Murray","Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 23% to $1.7 billion on 6,194 homes closed, up from $1.4 billion on 5,643 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $271,200, up 12% compared to the prior year, driven by pricing power and an increased mix of larger move-up homes. David?","David V. Auld","The value of our net sales orders in the second quarter increased 20% from the year-ago quarter to $2.4 billion. Homes closed -- homes sold increased 9% to 8,569 homes, on an 11% increase in active selling communities. Our average sales price increased 10% to $278,900. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 19%, consistent with the year-ago quarter. The value of our backlog increased 18% from a year ago to $2.8 billion, with an average sales price per home of $280,700. And homes in backlog increased 5% to 10,059 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the quarter exceeded our expectations at 81%. We expect our third quarter backlog conversion rate to be around 75%, consistent with our long-term average rate. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the second quarter was 22.5%, up 210 basis points from the year-ago quarter. 160 basis points of the margin increase was due to improved market conditions resulting in higher selling prices in excess of cost increases; 30 basis points was due to lower amortize interest in property taxes as a percentage of home sales revenue; and the remaining 20 basis points was due to lower relative cost for warranty and construction defect claims.","Sequentially, our gross margin improved 20 basis points from the first quarter, primarily due to lower relative costs for warranty and construction defect claims, with little impact from market conditions. We expect that further improvements from this quarter's 22.5% in gross margin will be challenging. As long as market conditions remain stable, we expect to maintain strong gross margins generally in the range of our last 4 quarters, with quarterly fluctuations due to product and geographic mix.","We are positioned to grow revenues at a double-digit pace with strong operating margins while generating increasing returns. We expect revenue growth to be a stronger driver of our earnings growth going forward rather than margin expansion. David?","David V. Auld","Ongoing SG&A for the quarter was $187,900,000, or $187.9 million compared to $155.1 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of homebuilding revenue, SG&A improved 10 basis points to 11.1% from 11.2%. While we continue to build our sales and production capabilities where necessary, we expect to see modest improvement in our annual SG&A percentage as we continue to work to our target of 10%. For our third and fourth quarters this year, we expect our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues to decrease sequentially on higher expected revenues.","The improvement in our gross profit and SG&A percentages expanded our homebuilding pretax margin to 11.3% in the current quarter, an increase of 210 basis points from 9.2% in the year-ago quarter. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Financial services pretax income for the quarter was $10.2 million, compared to $14.7 million in the year-ago quarter. This quarter continued to reflect the more competitive pricing environment, whereas the year-ago quarter benefited from unusually favorable market conditions which produced higher-than-normal gains on sale of mortgages. 90% of our mortgage companies loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations.","FHA and VA loans accounted for 43% of our mortgage companies volume this quarter, down from 49% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company during the quarter had an average FICO score of 716 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. First-time homebuyers represented 42% of the closings handled by mortgage company this quarter compared to 50% in the year-ago quarter. Mike?","Michael Murray","Our construction in progress and finished homes inventory increased by approximately $142 million since December. We had 17,600 homes in inventory at the end of March, of which 1,400 were models, 8,600 were speculative homes and 3,000 of the specs were completed. In our second fiscal quarter, our investments in lots, land and development totaled $560 million, of which $376 million was to purchase finished lots and land and $184 million was for land development.","At March 31, 2014, we owned 125,000 lots and controlled another 47,000 lots through option contracts. 60,000 of our lots are finished, of which 33,000 are owned and 27,000 are optioned. We are well-positioned to meet demand with our 172,000 total lots owned and controlled. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Our unrestricted homebuilding cash totaled $930.8 million at quarter end. At March 31, we had available capacity on our revolving credit facility of $654.5 million and no cash borrowings outstanding. Our homebuilding leverage ratio, net of cash, was 38.4%, and our gross homebuilding leverage was 45.5%.","The balance of our public notes outstanding in March 31 was $3.6 billion. Our $500 million principal amount of convertible notes mature on May 15. Holders of these notes may convert all or any portion of their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on May 13. For the notes they convert, we intend to settle them with common stock. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","In closing, this quarter, our pretax income increased 42% to $201.9 million. The majority of our operating metrics continue to improve on a year-over-year basis this quarter, highlighted by the value of our sales, closings and backlog, increased by 20%, 23% and 18%, respectively. Our net sales orders increased 57% sequentially on a 3% increase in average active selling communities. And our pretax operating margin increased 170 basis points to 11.6%.","We are well-positioned to improve our profit and return metrics with our broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our 3 brands, an attractive finished lot position and a solid balance sheet. We continue to focus on our core D.R. Horton brand, as well as striving to become the leading luxury builder with our Emerald brand. We believe the next leg of this recovery will be driven by the true entry-level buyer, and we're prepared to capture that demand with our recently introduced Express brand.","We like to personally thank all of our D.R. Horton team for another great quarter. D.R. and I request that you keep up with the good work and finish off the spring selling season strong.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now host any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from David Goldberg of UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to ask, it feels like, in addition to the increased absorption pace, the better tone, it feels like you guys are differentiating your performance a little bit from some of your peers. And I was wondering if you could talk about, do you think that sales effort is it product, is it geography, is it a little bit of both? Maybe how you rank order what you think is causing some differentiation in terms of performance?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think it's a combination of all. But I think if you remember, we had and we still have the broadest geographic footprint on the industry. And during the downturn, we kept our footprint, we consolidated our divisions within our footprint in anticipation of a housing recovery, and we're now prepared to continue to expand those markets where we kept our footprint. So clearly, we're not dependent on any one market, and there are weak markets across the country, so we're able to supplement those weak markets with stronger markets in our footprint. So clearly, I think our geographic footprint is a key to our great performance.","Bill W. Wheat","And as you know, David, we're always very focused on our execution and our operation of the business controlling our cost, and we're always focused on sales. So I think that's just been a hallmark, a consistent aspect of our approach to the business.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Definitely. And then I just had a follow-up question on the Express brand and the rollout, is that going to be kind of done on a market-by-market basis, because it feels like the entry-level coming back, I agree that it's the next leg of the recovery, but it's been a little bit sporadic in terms of where we seen it. Do you see it kind of rolling out nationally, or do you see it kind of a market-by-market basis kind of a slow rollout?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, as you know, at Horton, we like to dip our toe in the water before we jump completely in. So clearly, we're going to roll out the Express brand on a market-by-market basis, focusing perhaps more on the affordable markets than the higher end markets. And we will roll it out on a national basis, but we're going to focus first and foremost on where we feel like we have the best chance of affordability.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Previously, you talked a bit about having some plans put in place in case the spring didn't materialize the way you wanted it to. I was wondering if you could just talk about the quarter and what kind of parts of those plans you actually implemented, if any, and just kind of how the quarter progressed relative to your expectations when you last spoke to us?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, our sales improved on a month-to-month basis sequentially each month in the quarter. And as we mentioned in the last quarter's conference call, we expected to meet -- that there was challenge in demand in any of the markets. We indicated that we are more than well-prepared with our low-cost basis and our low construction cost to be able to increase incentives as necessary. We did increase incentives some within second quarter, primarily toward the end of the quarter, but not significantly. And we'll continue to do that because one thing that we're focused on is inventory turn hitting our absorptions in each one of our respective markets.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then moving to your specs, previously, I think, there has been discussion about specs getting higher margins than dirt sales. I was wondering if that was still the case. And if -- how your -- back to David's questions about potential differentiation, how you thought your differentiated spec strategy relative to some peers might have been impacting your quarter?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, our spec strategy is still clearly at a very important part of our business. We're getting closer back to a more normal environment as pricing power is still there in some markets, but it's not across the board as much as it was. And so today, our spec margins are more in line with our dirt margins. And over time, we would expect that our build jobs will have slightly higher margins than our specs.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And really, we've managed our specs very, very well over the years, as you know. We look at [ph] this account for over 60% of our sales. And they have one thing in common, they like to put a buyer on almost quickly as possible, and also collect the commission quickly as possible. So we're well-prepared to meet that realtor support and demand that we have across the country. But typically, if you look at our spec percentage, it went down from 55% to 49%, our completed specs declined and our sales -- our specs greater than 6 months were pretty much stable, so we're in a very strong position spec-wise.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mike Roxland from Bank of America.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question I had was on the incentives. And Don, I think you mentioned that you increased incentives and that was more oriented towards, I guess, the back half of your fiscal second quarter. So wanted to get a sense of how much incentive has increased, and what your approach is with respect to incentives on a go-forward basis?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, Mike, we've taken a very targeted approach to incentives. That's community by community. Each community has their sales absorption plans and they make sure that they are meeting the market, meeting the competition to hit those plans, so they need to add some incentives, they do. In general, we saw a very slight increase in our incentives over the quarter, but we really expected to see that. Some markets increased incentives, some did not. We're still seeing many markets where we're increasing prices and incentives are still very low. So it really is in line with our overall assessment of the market is that the market is improving very differently from market to market. In some markets will see incentives, and some we will not.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just suffice to say it was at the margin in terms of the amount of incentives that you increased in aggregate?","Bill W. Wheat","For the quarter, it was a slight increase on the margin. And of course, that's coming off a very low incentive levels a year ago, abnormally low incentive levels a year ago. So really, we just view that we're coming back to a more normal level where community-by-community basis, some having incentives, some do not.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And taken into consideration the increase in ASPs and the pricing power we've had over last couple of years, I think it's only natural that incentives begin to kick in some.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Appreciate that. And then my last question is, can you just provide some color around further operating leverage and the additional opportunities you have to drive that lower? Is that more of a function at this point of the double-digit increase in revenue that you're expecting? Or are there actually additional cost takeouts that you could pursue that would help drive that -- drive further operating leverage?","Bill W. Wheat","So the primary driver would be increased volumes. As you well know, our long-term target on SG&A is 10%. We're working our way there, but we're not there yet. But as volumes increase, we would expect to get there. There's always places that we can continue to get more efficient throughout our company, we continue to focus on that. But we would believe that the larger driver of those efficiencies going forward would be volume increases.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Kenneth Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","As you guys are bringing this new product line on for first-time buyer, other builders have talked about their new product targeting this -- the new buyer being a lower margin but higher-turning product. Do you think it's kind of set to come out at the margins, that gross margins that you're now delivering?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We think that, obviously, on that first-time mover -- first-time buyer market with margins are more challenging. We're budgeting as close as we can to our current margins, but probably slightly lower. But don't forget, we're planning on turning that product line as much as 3 times per year. So basically our return on that segment of the business will be just as good, if not better, than our normal business. In fact, it will be better.","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, we will expect much higher absorptions in those communities, and so certainly in a high much higher absorption, you can take a slightly higher margin and you'll see as good or better returns in entry level community.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Slightly lower margin.","Bill W. Wheat","Slightly normal on returns.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","All right. I got that ratio. Now in terms...","Bill W. Wheat","We like to have a higher margin and higher turn, but that would be a beautiful thing.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. So for your orders sequentially, you kind of -- you came in a little bit above, I think, your long-term seasonal rate of just a little above 50%, kind of flattens out generally in the third quarter. Is that what you're seeing now is one question. And second, you referred to community count being up 3% sequentially. Could you refer to it year-over-year, please?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Our community count was up about 11% year-over-year, and I think we'd expect to see that community count continue to grow year-over-year, albeit at a slower pace than 11%, probably single digits -- high single digits for the balance of the year.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And the seasonality of orders you're seeing so far?","Jessica Hansen","Yes. So in terms of what we're seeing today, we're only 3 weeks into April, so we really don't have a whole lot to share, but we would expect our strongest sales quarters to be our fiscal second and third quarters of the year. So with our positioning, we would expect to have a strong Q3.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Especially after having overcome the tough comp that we had in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, I wanted to ask about Emerald and Express and how to think about those longer-term in the context of your strategy. This recovery in downturn has been choppy. First, there was first-time buyer, then it's been entry-level -- I'm sorry, then it's been the move-up buyer. So should we think about Emerald and Express as kind of medium-term plays to -- that you might put more capital into depending on where we are in the cycle, or is this a longer-term shift to a more multi-brand strategy?","Donald J. Tomnitz","So longer-term shift to a multi-brand strategy. We believe, from our perspective, that we have underserved that luxury buyer, and that was the reason we started focusing on the Emerald brand. It also helps us gain entry to some of the master-plan communities, where there are no or very few custom builders because of a lack of financing for those. And so we're able to backfill the space left by them because banks are still not lending to that small custom builder and provides us a great entry with a great capital position and a great balance sheet to become a major player on that higher end market, especially in master-plan communities. So we're focused on truly becoming the leading luxury builder with that brand over the next 3 to 4 years. On the Express side, there's no question that with the price increases that we've experienced in our industry over the last couple or 3 years with all the pricing power we have had, we've really depleted that pool of affordable buyers. And so as a result, by going down into the price range where we think we'll be in a typical market somewhere between 120 and 150 on the price point, but that truly is going to create for us a whole new pool of affordable buyers that let us expand our footprint and our revenues.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. That makes a lot of sense at the lower end of the market, especially that comes back. But in a rising interest rate environment, affordability will be stretched and the amount that a dollar of mortgage payment buys will be stretched across all price segments. So are -- will there be, or are you planning to, or are you in the stages of implementing reactions to add across your D.R. Horton brand as well, or is that something more you're going to think about as interest rates rise?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Clearly, as interest rates rise, I think that the Express brand is even going to put us in a stronger position, because as buyers have more difficulty qualifying, just as we saw 6, 9 months ago as the 30-year mortgage moved up, then we had higher cancellation rate during that time period and was primarily because of the fact that lack of affordability. So key, I think, to expanding our business on a go-forward basis in a rising interest rate environment is to be able to offer a lower-priced but competitive, well-built house.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Dan Oppenheim of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Mark Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was just wondering if you can talk a bit about Express in terms of just how different it's going to be from what you're doing currently in some markets. And then if we look at Mobile and some other places you're currently building at that price point, is it going to be -- so is some of it based on the success you've had there in terms of selling homes at that price point? Is it going to be continuing in terms of the -- just what something along those lines? How should we think about it overall in terms of just doing something different in terms of construction at a lower price point and such?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Certainly, on the express side, we believe we're going to be able to turn that inventory a lot faster because the cycle time on the construction side of the business is going to be significantly less and we are focusing on that -- those cycle times on Express, but also across the other price points. But if you take a look at Express in general, we are going to be offering essentially a product that's not going to require options, not going to require upgrades. It's going to be basically a turn-key operation. When those people show up, they basically are going to be able to not have to go to the design center and purchase a lot of upgrades and options because they have difficulty qualifying, so basically, it's going to be pretty much a turn-key product.","Daniel Mark Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great, okay. Sounds like it will definitely meet a segment market that will work well there. And the second question, wondering, you talked about slight increase incentives at the end of the quarter, and how have you seen that in terms of as it's gone into April and how are you thinking about the environment here?","Jessica Hansen","We're continuing to do what we would do on a day-to-day basis, which is meet the market on a community-by-community basis and do what we need to do to hit our targeted absorption.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Dan, we're in an extraordinarily strong position, because as we've talked about on other conference calls, we've accumulated a very attractive land and lot position over the last couple of years. We're glad we're not on the market having to be aggressive on the land side today, because we've got built in gross margin in our existing land supply. So as a result, we assigned certain absorption level for each community, and we're going to move forward with our low cost structure, our land side and our construction side in order to meet our target.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question was on the Express brands, and I think it's a great idea and I do believe that the first-time buyer is definitely -- there are different reasons why I believe that buyer hasn't come back to the market. Certainly, affordability is at the top of the list, but I also think there is a lack of product out there as well, so I think it's a great idea. On that rollout, you said you typically kind of initially dip your toe in the water and go from there. Is -- how should we think about that in terms of timing? I mean, would 2014 be more of kind of the initial stages, and would we expect to see a more aggressive rollout in '15 if the expectations are met? And also from the land side, you mentioned a faster turn business. Is that going to be all kind of finished lot option take downs, are there going to be any land banking perhaps? Or would any of this be developed through your own development machine?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, clearly, on the Express side, we have our targets. And 2015, it will be a much greater growth rate than what it is in 2014. I can tell you that D.R. has given us guidance in terms of where he wants to be with Express in 2015, and our goal is to hit this aggressive targets. On the land side, we're focusing right now on finished lot deals. And in terms of having to develop land for Express, we may very well have to do that. But I will remind you of our strict underlying guidelines, and we're adhering to those as we move forward even into Express. And that is our goal is when we buy piece of land, that we get our initial land expense back within 24 months, and Express will adhere to those guidelines.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. On the gross margins, appreciate the color there, and I believe what was stated earlier on the call was that further improvement will be more difficult and that you'd expect gross margins to be in the range in the last 4 quarters or so. That would seem to imply that the number that you did in this most recent quarter being at the high end of that range, are you kind of saying in a way that there's a little bit of expectations for the back half of the year to be lower than the first half of the year, albeit modestly?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I don't -- go ahead.","Bill W. Wheat","No, no, we're not really saying that we expect margins to go down. What we're saying is we expect any further significant increases to be challenging. We really don't expect significant increases or really any significant decreases in margins, but we feel like they'll operate in a range similar to where we've been the last few quarters, including this quarter. Obviously, there is a number of -- there are number of factors that could push margins up or compress margins on an individual quarter. We expect some fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter. But in general, we expect to stay in the same range we are right now.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Mike, we've had tremendous, as you know, pricing power over the last couple of years, and that's one of the things I think that's depleting the pool of buyers out there. So clearly, with our Express brand, we're going to try to increase that pool. But yet, at the same time, we don't see major pricing power opportunities in as many markets as what we've had in the last 2 years.","Bill W. Wheat","We are focused first and foremost on returns. We have achieved a lot of pricing power, a lot of operating margin, improvement over the last couple of years. Now we're focusing on maintaining that, improving our volumes to drive stronger returns. So continuing to increase to strengthen our returns versus where we've been.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just one last quick one, SG&A, down 10 bps year-over-year, I think in the first quarter it was down 30. Should we expect a similar type of kind of just modest year-over-year improvement? I know longer term, you're still trying to go for the 10%. But in terms of the back half, should we kind of expect a similar type of 10, 20 bp improvement?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Clearly, with most of -- with approximately 60% of our annual closing is coming in the second half of the year, we are anticipating stronger SG&A performance in terms of decreasing our SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the second half of the year. So we would not be happy with a 20 bp decrease.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, I'm referring to year-over-year. So I certainly would expect it to be materially lower back half versus first half, but just as you look at on a year-over-year basis.","Donald J. Tomnitz","With our expectation that it would decrease by even more in the second half than you would infer for the year, it will also decrease by even more than the 20 basis points we've been showing.","Operator","Is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about DT's comments regarding the first-time home buyer potentially returning. We've heard from a lot of people, Texas is strong and benefiting from sustained investment in oil and gas. What's your kind of expectation for other geographies that don't have that tailwind? And what do you think the timing is for something like that where we see this category open up?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, clearly, I think if we gain job growth in this country, which I think ultimately, we're going to experience and I think, clearly, that's where a lot of those first-time home buyers are going to come from. But I also believe strongly that as we move into this recovery, first-time home buyer is not participating at the level that a lot of our political leaders would like for them to be participating. And I think that they will see some encouragement from the government in terms of trying to get more and more people into entry level homes. So my focus is really the affordable buyer, job creation, as well as a little help in the politics.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. So you need some things to come together for that to work out in the relative near term.","Bill W. Wheat","I think that was a take-away close there.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I'm supposed to do the take-away close.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Go ahead. Tell me.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I'm supposed to do the take-away close. We wouldn't be getting into the Express brand, if we didn't feel like that, that was the next segment of the business to recover. And clearly, I do see more favorable job growth, and I think a lot of that job growth is more on entry-level jobs and that's going to translate into entry-level buyers. So improved job growth in the country, as well as I think that we start looking at the underwriting guidelines and moving forward to try to get more people qualified, I think that we're going to get some help on the qualification side. And I think you're seeing that with several lenders today.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Very helpful. Switching gears a little bit. Average order price on new homes in the quarter was up 10% against a very tough comp from last year. Do think you can sustain that kind of price appreciation during the balance of the year? How should we think about that? Should it tail off in the second half? Or do you think kind of a mid-single-digit full year price increase is achievable?","Bill W. Wheat","It's hard to make it a call quarter-to-quarters. But in a specific discrete time because of mix changes and things like that. But we said consistently that we do expect -- we still expect further price increases, but we expect it to moderate down into the single-digits. Whether that will occur in Q3 or Q4 or sometime in fiscal '15, we can't tell you. But we do expect it to moderate back to the single-digits.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Stephen East from ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I know you haven't talked about Express at all this call. But I will ask you a couple of questions on the first-time buyer. I mean, in our field research, we're definitely seeing a comeback and we're seeing some of that credit availability that you just mentioned. Are you seeing a meaningful change? Your sales to first-time buyers were down year-over-year. But have you already reached the inflection point? And is that turning as far as you all are seeing in traffic, in demand, et cetera? And are you starting to see that drive to qualify type of activity going on?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think the biggest thing that we're seeing is the lack of affordable buyers out there. And as we increased our prices, new pricing power over the last couple of years, as I say, we depleted that pool of the first-time homebuyer. And our goal is to have a more competitively priced product with Express. And as I said, we are focusing on, in a typical affordable market, somewhere between $120,000 and $150,000 as an average sales price. So we have not had product offerings in that price point. So I think it's more of us trying to bring those people into the market as opposed to those people being out there and being underserved and driving to qualify. I just think it's a function of there's just not the product out there for those people to qualify. And if we can get that product price point down, then I believe there are people out there who truly will buy just simply because they've been priced out of the market.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And are you having to -- for the Express product, are you able to utilize some of that land that you already got on your books? Or is this primarily going to be new purchase-type of land base?","Bill W. Wheat","It will be both, Stephen. There are some properties we have that we can bring out. And it will be a good fit for Express. But then there's also finished lots out there in areas that have been underserved that because there hasn't been anybody out there building this kind of product that are available to us as well. So we will look at all sources. But yes, it will help us a little bit on our land held piece, too.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just quickly one last question to follow on what Bob was asking about, other regions. I mean, this definitely -- your performance this quarter turn from Texas to a lot of other regions at least from the order perspective. And we haven't necessarily seen that from all the other builders. What do you all think is going on in your markets that's allowed you to start to see that meaningful improvement?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I think clearly if you take a look at our West. Our West had better sales and better closings. And that's a function of us over the last year and 2 years, taking good land positions in California and just now bringing those to fruition with model grand openings. So I think that clearly helped a lot. If you look at the East, the East performed well for us. And that's because David Auld was the previous regional president for the East. And the only reason he's sitting across on this conference call table is because of his performance in the East. But we entered into a lot of rolling option and a lot of good land deals in the East during his tenure. And they were penetrating those markets deeper. And we expect to continue to do that. The South, on the other hand, it's been strong all during the downturn, and it continues to be strong. But it's being -- to our credit, the South is being outpaced, as we always said, by the East and the West. And we said that will be a great position for this company to be in because the South region held us up and supported us during the downturn. And as Rick Horton said, the best thing that could ever happen to him is for the East and West to take the pressure off of him. So they are doing that today. And we're in a great position.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to just mention that I totally agree with your strategy to go after the entry level. I mean, as I recalled last month, I think this is really where the puck is going. And I really congratulate you guys on really being unique and sort of skating to where the puck is going, so good job with that. And I'm looking forward to learning a little bit more about the timing of how you roll out Express. I know there was already a question asked on it. I wanted to sort of roll something -- run something by you though. When we look at the job growth figures that have been coming across, generally speaking, the numbers in raw units or raw numbers of jobs have actually been pretty good for a while, and yet household information has been very depressed. We have our view on why you haven't seen that translate into household information. I'm curious as to what you are seeing in your markets. Are you hearing that your entry -- that the entry-level buyers, who are coming out, are saying to you, \"It's been really tough to get to this point where we can actually buy a home because we haven't been able to -- it took us a lot to get jobs?\" Or are you hearing that it's the type of jobs that they have been having that have required them to take longer to accrue the savings to buy the homes?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I think most of the jobs being created in this country, Steve, are entry-level jobs. And as a result, just by definition, I think they're having to save a lot longer. I think the other thing that I was talking about earlier, the help from the political side, is with the high student loan debt that these people get, these college kids are graduating, young adults are graduating. And there's work on the political side that would help relieve them of some of that burden with the college debt. So as a result, even though they are graduating from college, many of them have had difficulty finding higher-paying jobs. And secondly, they're burdened with typically $26,000 with the student debt. So a function of getting them that entry-level job, which is pretty much a lot of them having to go into at perhaps a lower salary than what they expected, and some relief on the student loan debt, I think, that pool begins to grow.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","We've looked into the student loan issue. And what we've seen mostly has been an initiative in Washington to sort of prevent predatory servicing, I guess, you could say, but not necessarily in terms of forbearance or forgiveness so much. Have you been hearing something more specific to forbearance or forgiveness of current outstanding student loan balances?","Donald J. Tomnitz","As I'd like to say, I watch too much Fox News. But on Fox Business News yesterday, there was a discussion on that. And I just caught the headline as I was walking by the conference room. So I don't know specifically about that, but there was a discussion yesterday on that in terms of how they can work with the people who have the college debt. I don't know whether that's forgiveness, forbearance or whatever. But I think you're going to have some relief.","Bill W. Wheat","I think that there's recognition that it's an issue and it is holding back economic growth, I think there's a general sentiment that there will be some improvement or help along the way.","Donald J. Tomnitz","We're helping everyone else, we might as well help the college students.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. Well, that actually would have to be very encouraging. Your land spend figures that you gave this quarter suggest that you spend about 22% of your revs on land spend. It's about the lowest we've seen since the downturn. I was curious as to whether you anticipate maintaining this very strict control on land spend for the rest of the year, and in particular, whether it is -- you would expect to spend maybe a little more on land suitable for your Express or if you think you really got enough there, just like you do in the rest of your business.","Michael Murray","I think we made a lot of early investments in the cycle that have allowed us to be very selective at this point and focus, as Bill said before, on the returns. So I think we're seeing some -- a lot of replacement of lot costs that's coming through. Bringing some of our land held back into production will help support some further growth. But I don't see a huge expansion, Stephen, in the push on land at this point. I think we're going to stay pretty focused and disciplined at this point moving forward. The Express model, we're going to prefer the finished lot deals, as DT said, but where necessary, make disciplined investments on projects that meet our return hurdles.","Bill W. Wheat","That owned and controlled position of 170,000 lots, that will support much higher revenues than what we're generating today. So we believe that we can increase our revenues on the lot supply we have. And then if we need to augment it -- so at some point down the line, we will. But today, we feel like we're in good position.","Donald J. Tomnitz","We are clearly focused on one thing on the land side, I assure you. And that is how do we get our initial investment on our land back within a 24-month period. And that's going to apply to all 3 brands.","Bill W. Wheat","But even just to replenish our lot supply, there's still a significant spend. They're still on pace of a $2 billion year in terms of land act and land development, just to replenish and keep our lot supply where it is. And so this is not that we're not investing, we're just not necessarily growing our investment from the current level right now.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. Well, I remember about a year ago, you made this comment, DT, that you wanted to limit your land spend to things that you could get your money back in, in 24 months. And I hand it to you, that was good timing because that was at a time when the market was feeling really ebullient.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG Capital.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. But I wanted to just get your take on Texas specifically, obviously your home market, knocking on almost 40 years there. It seems like a lot of the competition has been carving out Texas commentary this quarter, job growth, taxation, whether it maybe reading a lot about population addition numbers pretty encouraging. Are you seeing more builders come in? Is it more competitive than it was maybe a year or 2 ago? Are there more builders? Is your lot supply adequate there? Is land pricing disproportionately rising in Texas versus other markets? Just some color you can give us on the state overall.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, obviously, D.R. started in Texas in 1978. And I will tell you, you can go to almost any community and turn the corner, and there are multiple builder signs on every corner, 20 to 30. So Texas is one of the most competitive markets, but it also has few barriers to entry. And that's one of the things that makes it so attractive, and that is that land prices are still competitively priced, so we can deliver a competitive lot. And there's ease of entry in terms of not having to go through, as we do in a number of markets, a 2- to 3-year entitlement period. Most of our land, we can get entitled and plotted within a period of 6 months or less. And there are adequate general contractors to develop lots down here. So in general, we think Texas has been a strong market. It's a very competitive market. We continue to lead every market in Texas. One of the things we're most proud of recently is that we're on our way to being #1 in the Houston market. We've been in the Dallas\/Fort Worth market #1. And we're focusing on San Antonio and Austin. And I'll tell you that all of those markets are very, very strong for us and we're very competitive in those markets.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So it sounds like it's always -- it's sort of a status quo, I mean, always been a good housing market and it doesn't [indiscernible] the others...","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I think it's a good housing market because of the strong economy and as well as it's a great place to live with the people coming in and being able to buy a nice house that's affordable. And land prices are competitive. So there's no income tax in the state of Texas, so there are a lot of attractive reasons and the weather is great here. So I don't know why. There aren't many states that are as centrally-located with as many attributes as the state of Texas has. I mean, we've been a leader in Texas, and we'll continue to be the leader in Texas as we move forward.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just, I mean, how do you think about Emerald in terms of size and mix? I know it's a tough thing to answer with numerator, denominator mix and that sort of thing moving around. But how big could Emerald be? I know you rattled off some numbers early on. I missed some of those. But I think you said 6%, I believe. I mean, how do think that number could play out over time?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I think we said it all when we said we are focusing on being the leading luxury builder in the U.S. And we anticipate that, that's a good growth segment for us and very profitable growth segment for us. But we're expanding it where it makes sense. And just like we said on the Express side, we started slow, dipping our toe in the water. And we found a great success in that market, great demand for our product out there. And the product line that we're offering is extraordinary in terms of finish out and quality of homes. So we expect Emerald to continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of our business. And as I said, our focus is how do we become the leading luxury builder in the U.S.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask if you could clarify your comments on backlog conversion and how you would expect that to trend in the balance of the year. Do you think 4Q levels could reach what was achieved this quarter? And longer term, do you think normal backlog conversion should be below 70% or something in the 70% to 75% range normal?","Jessica Hansen","Yes. There definitely is seasonality, Jade, to our backlog conversion rate. As we said earlier, we'd expect it to be around 75% in our third quarter, which really is our historical average at this point, if you look over the last 10 years. And then traditionally, our fourth quarter would be a higher backlog conversion rate than our third quarter. With as many homes that we sell and close in the same quarter, it's hard for us to give you guidance much further out than the next quarter. But yes, I think we'd expect our backlog conversion rate to increase somewhat in the fourth quarter from whatever we end up doing in the third quarter.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then as far as a normal conversion rate, do you think something in the 70% to 75% range is a normalized level?","Jessica Hansen","I think in the back half of the year, yes. And in the first half of the year, seasonally, it's usually a little bit lighter.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And we thought it was abnormal that we had an 80% backlog conversion in the second quarter. But usually, second quarter is slower or lower backlog conversion than the first quarter. So I guess, our builders out there just decided to close a lot more homes in the second quarter than we anticipated.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Great. On financial services, the operating margin increased sequentially, which accounted to some of the mortgage banking trends we have been seeing. Do you expect the margin to moderate in coming quarters? Or do you think the current level has absorbed most of the competitive pressures?","Bill W. Wheat","We think we've absorbed most of it, thus far. Obviously, we don't -- we can't tell what the future holds. But we certainly are encouraged when our volume is going up. And typically, in the quarters, when we have higher volume in our financial services segment, we'll see a better operating margin. And so Q3 and Q4 typically will show a better margin than we do in Q1 and Q2.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","First question on Express. Is the initial crop of neighborhoods there going to be repurposed D.R. Horton neighborhoods? Or is that something you might be pulling out of mothball? If you could just talk about that.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think it's a combination of both with a lot of them are new option lot deals that we entered into. And typically, it's in a market clearly where we've already been building the D.R. Horton brand and we're trying to increase our affordable buyer pool in that market because we have seen people coming into our model homes in the D.R. Horton brand, who can't qualify because of the pricing power that we had over the last couple of years. So primarily, it's expanding and supplementing our existing markets.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I was going to ask if we could dig in to the financing questions because while I would guess you're waiting on Washington to decide it wants to get back into the entry-level housing market, have you been hearing from bankers that they're willing to buy higher FICO paper -- excuse me, lower FICO paper, a little bit more risky paper on the average Express buyer even with mortgage rates sitting where they are now?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Actually, we've heard the same thing you've heard on the media over the course over the last 60 to 90 days. We, from our mortgage company perspective, don't see a lot of institutions willing to buy that kind of paper. So as a result, it's limited from that perspective.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could sneak one more in. When you were talking about the luxury builders, private luxury builders not getting a lot of financing from the banks, could you -- what are you seeing on the land development side? Are the banks willing to do development lending now? Or is that still a very small or closed business?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Very, very limited. And thank goodness for our strong balance sheet because, frankly, as we've worked through that supply of finished lots that were generated in '07, '08 and '09, we've had to begin developing obviously. It takes a strong balance sheet to be able to do that. Clearly, that small builder, small developer, not back in the business because of lack of capital.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jim Krapfel from Morningstar.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","To what extent did weather push out closings, negatively impact orders or lead to incremental cost in the quarter? It appears that there wasn't much effect in the closing side.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, we have a policy at D.R. Horton. And it's a sincere policy. And that is we don't want our division presidents to give us a weather report. And so we're not really -- we work with our broad geographic footprint to the extent that we did have weather-related issues is really a nonevent.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what were the cost ASPs per square foot in your closings this quarter?","Bill W. Wheat","On a year-over-year basis, our revenues per square foot were up 9%. We usually talk about our vertical costs, our vertical's stick and brick costs during the quarter on a per square basis were up 10%. So essentially, our costs and our revenues increased at about the same rate on a per square foot basis. Now in aggregate per unit, revenue still exceeded our cost increases.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the cost side, where do you see that trending going forward? You said you see some moderation in that inflation.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think costs are going to continue to increase. We are fortunate that we have a lot of volume in most of our markets so that we can be more competitive with our subcontractors on the cost side. But clearly, labor is one of the cost components that's going up. And lumber, I don't think is going to come down nearly as much as what it did last year. It seems like it's going to hang high at where it is currently right now. But it's a day-to-day process for our purchasing managers to work with our vendors and our suppliers and our trades out there to get the benefit of the volume that we can offer our vendors and our trades.","Operator","Our final question today is coming from Alex Barr\u00f3n from Housing Research Center.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","I wanted to ask on the Express homes. Are you guys going about your marketing strategy in a different way, meaning are you trying to target those entry level -- those renters more directly? Or are you kind of going the traditional way of just kind of waiting for them to show up at the communities?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I think it's a different type of marketing. I know that as you clearly are trying to attract the entry-level buyer, a lot of them living in apartments. And so we try to do a special marketing with the apartment complexes that are near us. And another potential pool are the people living with their -- the college graduates and others that are living with their parents. And I think we do that primarily through realtors. I also believe that our Express brand, that it's going to be easier for perhaps parents to help their children get into homes because they could help them a lot easier with a lower price point, as we have, with the Express brand than they can in a standard price that's with D.R. Horton. So I look at both those avenues as trying to get with the realtors to make sure that the parents or the kids who are living at home, we can attract them with a lower price point as well as focusing on those apartments.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","And also wondering if you guys have considered doing a stock buyback, given how cheap your stock is this year?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, we don't -- I don't really want to comment on the stock buyback. I do know one thing on our business that's pretty general. And that is our focus is how do we get to a free cash flow position. And I think, Alex, if we adhere to our business plan that David is helping us implement, I think that we'll clearly get to a free cash flow position. And when we get to a free cash flow position, we're going to be in a position to do a lot of things. And one of them will be perhaps buying back our stock. But the key is how do we get to that free cash flow.","Operator","We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management at this time.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you. And thank you for joining this call. D.R. and I and David want to thank everybody in the field because we had one heck of a quarter, as you know, and we turned in a sterling performance in the month of March, and we appreciate that. The key is how do we go forward, execute the business plan in Q3 and Q4 and deliver a very, very outstanding year for us in 2014. We're welcomed to have David onboard. He's a good addition to the 38th floor up here. And we've got a great team of people here as well as in the field. So thank you very much. And as I say, execute the competition and don't take any prisoners.","Operator","Thank you. That does concludes today's teleconference.

We made $27.7 million in net income in our first quarter, and we are focused on maintaining profitability in each upcoming quarter. The spring selling season begins soon, and our sales and operational teams across the company are energized and prepared for increasing traffic and sales activity with homes available in inventory and a good supply of finished lots to meet the potential additional demand.","If 2012 is the first year of the U.S. housing recovery, we expect it to reflect uneven improvement across our operating markets with some markets experiencing increases in demand and others remaining weak. We remain flexible with a profitable business model at current demand levels but have the ability to increase our production in response to a stronger demand.","Although macroeconomic and housing conditions remain soft, we are cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2012 after achieving almost a $50 million improvement in pretax income compared to the year-ago quarter. Mike?","Mike Murray","In the first quarter, our homebuilding operations generated pretax income of $25 million, and our financial services operations generated pretax income of $4.2 million. Income tax expense of $1.5 million primarily represents state income taxes.","Our net income for the quarter was $27.7 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $20.4 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 16% to $884 million on 4,118 homes closed from $761 million on 3,637 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 3% compared to the prior year and was flat sequentially at $214,700. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Net sales orders for the first quarter were up 13% from last year to 3,794 homes on a 3% decrease in active-selling communities. In the December quarter, our average sales price on net sales orders of $217,000 was up 3% compared to the prior-year quarter and down 1% sequentially. Our cancellation rate for the first quarter was 26%. Our sales backlog at December 31, 2011, increased 18% from the prior year to 4,530 homes or $975 million. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 16.8%, up 120 basis points from the year-ago period. 100 basis points of the increase was due to cost improvements and decreased incentives and discounts. 60 basis points of the increase was due to a reduction in amortized interest and property taxes. Also contributing 40 basis points to the margin increase was a reduction in the cost of remaining development obligations for completed projects and collection of old development receivables in excess of previous estimates. Partially offsetting these increases was an 80-basis-point decrease related to costs for warranty and construction defect claims.","Sequentially, while incentives and discounts were flat, our gross margin improved 70 basis points, again primarily due to a reduction in the cost of remaining development obligations for completed projects and collection of old development receivables in excess of previous estimates. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Homebuilding SG&A expense for the quarter, which includes corporate overhead, was $119 million, essentially flat with the year-ago quarter, on a 13% increase in homes closed. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A was 13.4% compared to 15.5% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting both the improvement in volume and our continued efforts to reduce costs.","We also continued to see the benefits of our aggressive debt reduction over the past several years, as homebuilding interest expense was down 57% from the year-ago quarter to $6.9 million, and our first quarter homebuilding interest incurred decreased 21% to $27.9 million. Mike?","Mike Murray","Financial services pretax income for the quarter was $4.2 million, which included $1.7 million of recourse expense. 83% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. Our mortgage company handled the financing for 60% of our homebuyers this quarter with virtually all loans meeting eligibility requirements for sale with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae.","Government loans accounted for 57% of our mortgage company's volume this quarter, down from 61% in the year-ago quarter. Our mortgage company's new borrowers during the quarter had an average FICO score of 710 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 91%. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","This September, our total inventory increased by approximately $30 million, excluding non-cash items. We increased our investment in residential land and lots by $40 million and reduced our homes in inventory by $10 million. Our homes in inventory at the end of December totaled 10,200 homes, down 300 homes from September. As of December 31, 1,100 of our homes were models, 5,700 were speculative homes and 2,700 of the specs were completed. We expect our number of homes in inventory to increase in the March and June quarters in response to seasonal demand. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","In our first fiscal quarter, our investments in land, lots and development costs totaled $229 million, which reflects that we continue to find good opportunities to open new communities and replenish our finished lot supply. Future investments in finished lots, land and development will remain largely dependent on our sales base. We remain focused on managing our supply of owned, finished lots in line with our sales demand in a low-risk, capital-efficient manner.","At December 31, 2011, we controlled approximately 115 lots of which 86,000 are owned, 29,000 are option. Our current finished lots supply includes 22,000 owned lots and 23,000 option lots. We also expect an additional 27,000 of our total controlled lots to be developed within the next 12 to 18 months for a finished lot pipeline of at least 72,000 lots available to us over the next 2 years. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","We used $3 million of cash in operations in the December quarter, primarily due to our investments in residential land and lots and a reduction of accounts payables, offset by our net income and decreases in mortgage loans held for sale and homes in inventory.","We ended the quarter with $1 billion of homebuilding unrestricted cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, we repurchased $10.8 million of our 6.5% senior notes due 2016. The balance of our public notes outstanding at December 31 was just under $1.6 billion, with no maturities until May of 2013. Mike?","Mike Murray","At December 31, our homebuilding leverage ratio, net of cash and marketable securities, was 17.5% compared to 17% a year ago. Gross homebuilding leverage at December 31 improved 650 basis points to 37.4% from a year ago due to debt reductions and increased equity. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Before we move to Q&A, we wanted to share our expectations for some of our operating metrics. With 4,530 homes in backlog and an expected conversion rate below 90%, we expect fewer closings in Q2 than in Q1, consistent with recent years\u2019 trends. Seasonally, Q2 and Q3 experienced the strongest sales demand, which then results in our strongest deliveries in Q3 and Q4.","Our current expectation is for home sales gross margin to remain in the mid-16% range. We anticipate a seasonal increase in SG&A expense in the second quarter primarily due to payroll taxes and seasonal advertising, which will result in a higher SG&A percentage in Q2 versus Q1.","In Q3 and Q4, variable components will increase the absolute SG&A expense amount. However, our SG&A percentage should improve as we close more homes and leverage our fixed cost structure. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Simply put, our business feels more positive. We're entering fiscal year '12 feeling better than we have in 6 years, and it's been a long 6 years. We've started the year with $28 million of net income and double-digit percentage increases in our sales, closings and backlog in the first quarter.","January sales are also up year-over-year in line with our expectations. Both our gross margin and SG&A percentages improved versus last year, and our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong.","While the housing industry and the overall economy have not gained significant traction, we are increasing our market share by finding attractive opportunities across our markets that are producing improved results for D.R. Horton. We remain focused on achieving profitability in each quarter and for fiscal year '12.","As always, we want to thank all of our DHI team members. We've been the largest builder in America for the past 10 years, and you have just delivered a tremendous first quarter. We are very proud of the results you have produced, and we look forward to a great fiscal year '12. We\u2019ve worked hard to position our company for profitability. Now let's go lead the industry into the next up cycle and sell more homes, leverage our fixed cost and continue to outperform the competition.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we'll host any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Goldberg from UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question was on the change in FICO score. Sequentially, it feels like it's up a little bit versus where we were, maybe not too -- so much first quarter of '11 -- of '10, excuse me -- yes, excuse me, fiscal first quarter of '11, but certainly throughout kind of fiscal '11, it seems like it's come up. Is that mix shift, or are you guys seeing any change in underwriting at this point?","Stacey H. Dwyer","I don't think there's any substantial change in underwriting. We noticed the same thing you did, that Q1 was a little bit stronger. It was in line with Q1 last year but stronger than the balance of fiscal year '11. I don't know that we can attribute to that in -- to anything in particular.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, easy enough. Next question was a little bit more theoretical. I kind of wanted to look out, and Don, I think, in the prepared remarks, you mentioned that community count was down 3%. And I kind of wanted to talk about, as you look forward into the recovery, how do you think the land position that you have today supports the growth pattern and the growth expectations that you have? And if you think, if you could kind of think about your land position in terms of the usability, given current conditions, and how active you're going to have to be in the land market, do you think you control and own enough and option enough land now to go out and grow the way you want to, outside of the kind of increasing the leverage in existing communities?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I do believe we have adequate lots for the next 2 years, as I mentioned in my comments. I do believe, as we work through this calendar year and somewhat into calendar year '13, that the finished lot supply in good markets is going to be depleted. And we're focusing on tying up as many good deals as we can currently to, in anticipation of that. Clearly, at some point in time, we'll have to get back into the land development business, as we have been in the past. I want to remind you that our go-forward plan is to have a lean -- really, a light and lean land supply. Our current underwriting guidelines require that with any land that we invest in and any land that we develop, that we get our capital returned in 18 months, sometimes, at the worst-case basis, if it's a great deal, 24 months. But currently, our plan is and has been for the last several years, as we move forward, anything greater than a 2-year supply, we're going to be partnering with other land developers and make sure that they hold those lots that will require greater than 2 years, as opposed to us holding them on our balance sheet. So I feel good about where we are. We still are, clearly, the preferred buyer of banks and developers because we're the largest builder. We're also starting the most specs of anybody in the market. And we're selling the most homes of anyone in the market. So I feel like, as we continue to work on a depleted land and lot supply, we continue to be the preferred buyer.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering, you talked about being cautiously optimistic of the -- about the spring here, and that\u2019s a bit less quittable [ph] than your comments over the expectations in recent years, but wondering how that relates to the thoughts in terms of specs. You've done a very good job of managing that in the past. How much more do you think you will build based on the cautious optimism that you have right now?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, frankly, we're cautious. I think, clearly, we have clearly repositioned this company, have it in a great position today to capitalize on the market that is going to materialize, given the current economic situations. I think the cloud that hangs over us and the reason that we use the adjective \"cautious\" is because there are a lot of issues both internationally as well as nationally that we have no control over. So as a result, we're just focusing on probably the next 12 months ahead when we say \"cautious\" because there is an election coming, there are a lot of issues on the table and we don't know how those are going to impact the homebuilding business, Dan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask -- a very interesting statement you made about developing 27,000 lots, I believe you said, over the next 18 months. So I wanted to understand the dynamics of that. Does that mean -- is that simply a statement about the lack of availability of finished lots and, therefore, the need to develop? Is this coming from lots that are -- projects that are mothballed? Or is this the pursuit of new projects, new development opportunities in the market?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, Nishu, I can clarify just a bit. The 27,000 lots, those are lots that we own today that are either partially developed or undeveloped but that our expectations with our current business plans would anticipate that we would begin to develop those lots in the next 12 to 18 months. Obviously, the choice of whether to invest the capital and develop those lots will be dependent on our sales base. But in terms of looking at our land and lot pipeline, those 27,000 lots are available to us to be developed and to be finished for our sales if the sales warrant it.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it, got it. So this is coming from your own land pipeline. Now the general view, I think, that investors have taken that mothballing becomes a necessity because -- had become a necessity because demand had shrunk and that therefore there were certain areas where it became unprofitable to build. Is this then a tentative indicator that demand is spreading back to that, let's say, areas that were C grade before and that the economics are becoming more feasible? Or how should we interpret that?","Bill W. Wheat","No, this is really no change in our outlook in terms of C markets, as you call them. We still have about 43,000 lots that are mothballed that we do not expect to be developing within the next 12 to 18 months. Some of those might come online after that time frame, but some could be much significantly longer.","Donald J. Tomnitz","The demand clearly is still in the A markets, and that's where refocusing. And clearly, to the extent that we bring a portion of those or all of the 27,000 lots into development, those are going to be in good locations where basically, heretofore, we've been able to find option lots that would have precluded us from having to develop the lots.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, I -- hello?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, we're here.","[Technical Difficulty]","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On a cell, so sorry if there's any static. The first question was just on comments with regards to January and you also, if I heard you correctly, say that the housing industry hasn't yet gained significant momentum. And so the question, in effect, is there's been a lot of speculation around current demand and to the extent that there is a lot of views that there is some positive momentum here. How are we to think about the -- entering the spring, are you seeing things pick up at all? Or is it just more along the same type of pace that you're currently seeing in fourth -- that you've saw in the December quarter?","Donald J. Tomnitz","What I can tell you is, as you know, Don Horton and I spend quite a bit of time in the field, 2 to 3 weeks a month. And both his travels and my travels, which have been to separate markets, as we visit with each and every one of our sales people as we travel through the markets, indicates that our sales people are optimistic because their traffic's up and there are more buyers in their models each and every week that we have progressed since December. So obviously, December is a very slow period of the year for us, with the holiday season and so forth. But certainly, into January, we felt very, very good about our traffic and our sales.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Second question, I guess, maybe a 2-parter, if I can cheat a little bit. But you mentioned community count down 3% year-over-year. I was hoping maybe you could share what you expect that to be, community count growth in 2012. And secondly, if you could highlight any regions that were, let's say, stronger than corporate average or weaker than corporate average.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I think that the 3% down is just, it's an accounting issue. It's a point in time. And we expect our community count and count in the rest of the calendar year '12 to increase, and that's going to be contingent, obviously, on our ability to find good and profitable land and lot deals. I'm going to refrain from commenting on markets because of 2 things: One, I think Bobby [ph] does a great job of grading the markets; and secondly, I think that our good markets need to be kept to ourselves as we continue to exploit the markets ourselves, as opposed to letting our competitors know about our good markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with ABW (sic) [KBW].","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","It's Jade Rahmani from KBW. I wanted to ask about the deferred tax asset. We are seeing quite a few banks recapture their DTA after several quarters of profitability. And you guys have been profitable for 4 quarters in the past 2 years and indicated you expect to be profitable each quarter this year. Do you expect to reverse it this year? And is this a once-a-year review that happens with your fiscal year end?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, Jade, we do review this every quarter. And I can update you on where we are this quarter. If you recall, last quarter, at the end of our fiscal year '11, we commented that one of the significant pieces of negative evidence that weigh into our decision is the fact that we have been in a cumulative loss position on a 3-year trailing basis. And based on the way the standard reads that we have to apply, that is a piece of evidence that is very difficult to overcome to justify reversing the valuation allowance. At September 30, that 3-year loss position was at $445 million. At December 31, that 3-year loss position has dropped to $355 million. Our expectation is that we will emerge from a 3-year loss position by our fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and at that time, that significant piece of negative evidence gets pulled out of our valuation. And at that point in time, then that could be the earliest possible quarter in which the valuation allowance could be reversed. And at that point, we will have to weigh in on how profitable our year has been, how significant it has been and how sustainable we feel our earnings stream is at that point in time as we look forward into fiscal 2013. And we certainly do expect the valuation allowance to be reversed. Q4 this year would be the earliest, and, but there is the chance that it could be a few more quarters into fiscal '13.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just to follow up, I want to confirm, as a profitable company, that you expect to pay no federal cash taxes so long as you have this significant DTA? And then secondly, once the reverses, just technically, that you would be accruing a tax rate in your income statement.","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, second part first. When we reverse the valuation allowance, we will be accruing our standard income tax expense. In the past, that has been, for federal and state combined, around a 38% rate. That would be our current estimate after we reverse the allowance. In terms of taxes paid, there will be state taxes that we would to expect to pay in the states where we are profitable. Right now, our estimate on that is around a 3% rate on our pretax income. We will, perhaps to the extent we have taxable income overall, have to pay a slight amount of federal income tax due to the alternative minimum tax requirements in the tax law. They won't let you get away with 0 tax. Right now, our estimate for what we might have to pay in Alt Min Tax is 2%, an effective rate of 2%. So that's what's reflected in our current quarter. We have a 5% effective income tax rate. That reflects 3% for the state, 2% for federal. Now Alt Min, when you pay it in the future, we will get to use that as a credit against future income in later years after we've used up our NOL against future years of income.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Don, you mentioned that you spend a lot of time in the field. And you also commented in your opening remarks, or one of your comments, that your business feels more positive. I was wondering if you could elaborate on those 2 comments and share with us any patterns or themes that you've been picking up from your buyers and what's driving them to take the plunge right now, if there's any kind of elasticity towards rates or, really, what themes you're picking up on.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I think the real key factor is that the availability of foreclosed homes still remains low. And, but most importantly, the process through which the buyer has to go through in order to have a small-percentage chance of securing, actually, closing, on a foreclosed home is very laborious. Furthermore, the state of most of these foreclosed homes are in a difficult position. They require quite a bit of work. And even though the buyer has to come up with a down payment and with our homes, they typically would have to come with what we call a lot of cash out of pocket to make the foreclosed home more livable. So if you take a look at that process and those factors associated with foreclosed homes and then take a look at the fact that they can buy a new home in a new community that has better school systems, in many instances, and better neighbors than what they're living around, then in many instances, we have the best buy for that buyer out there in a timely process. Also, you have to remember, a number of these buyers are all of the sudden becoming qualified or they're getting the down payment, and they don't want to have to wait 3 to 4 or 5 months to see if they're going to get a foreclosed home and be able to close on it and then take the cash out of their pocket to own it. The new homebuying process today is a very seamless process and a very timely process. With the number of specs that we have available out there on the ground for realtors and our buyers, we offer the preeminent buy relative to the foreclosed homes.","Stacey H. Dwyer","I think another factor that's driving some of the demand, Adam, is we've had very high affordability for a while. But rents were also relatively low. And now we're starting to see more headlines and hear from more of our buyers that they are seeing their rates increase, and that improves the equation when they're looking at their house payment compared to their rent payment.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's interesting. So the consensus seems to be out there that we bottomed and the outlook is getting more favorable. And so I think, when that happens, people start looking a little bit more -- looking out further into the future and thinking about what the longer-term earnings power is. Can you -- for all the builders. Can you share any thoughts on what you think 3, 4, 5 years out, what you think the earnings power in margins might look like?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I would say to you that, clearly, there've been a number of small- and medium-sized builders who have left the market. They do not have the financing. If you look at the public builders, we have continued to acquire more and more market share in each one of our markets. As we continue to control the land and lot supply, which is necessary as we go forward, and of course, with our strong balance sheet, that affords us the opportunity to control the land, control the lots and to be able to, most importantly, develop the lots when the demand increases. I believe that D.R. Horton, as a company, has an opportunity to continue to acquire market share and increase our market share in each and every market. My personal goal, and again I'll say my personal goal, as we go through all of this, is I believe that, 5 years out, that we're coming very close to our 50,000 units that we closed in 2006. So that tells you what I think the possibility is for us in this industry.","Bill W. Wheat","Just to tag on with operating margins, in terms of our historical operating margins, we have always targeted a 20% gross margin, 10% SG&A, so 10% dropping to the pretax line. So we are working towards that. We're not there today, but we believe we'll continue to progress. And as the market improves, we will get back to those historic operating margins, as well.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And perhaps, the last thing I'd like to say is that, clearly, if you look at all of our competitors in the industry, we have the strongest balance sheet in the industry. So clearly, we have the balance sheet to get to that 50,000 units and continue to meet the demand as it moves forward and continue to take market share.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Locker from FBN Securities.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","You guys bought back, what, 3 million shares or so, just to offset some of that dilution on the convertible. I just wanted to see what your idea of that going forward was, if you're going to offset more by buying more shares maybe possibly lower or how you looked at the dilution factor of the convertible.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Sure. We had an opportunity in the spring where we still had an abundance of cash above our $1 billion target goal. We were, at the same time, retiring debt and increasing our land investment, and we were also taking the opportunity to retire some stock at prices we thought were attractive at the time. Going forward, we're closer to the $1 billion target cash that we have, and we're going to be weighing all of those opportunities, going forward. Our capital structure on the debt side is much more in line with what, where we need it to be. Our gross leverage is now down under 40%, but we're starting to see more opportunities to invest in our core business, as well. As demand increases, we'll need some of our capital for cash -- or for homes in inventory. So we're going to be weighing those. So I don't know that we have any firm expectations of what further share repurchases would be, but we're going to take care of the core business first.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","And if you\u2019re modeling, if your share price averages $14 going forward, would that count in the diluted share count, going forward?","Stacey H. Dwyer","The diluted share count is actually an earnings calculation, and we need to earn a certain amount of net income. Right now, I believe the number is around $70 million in a quarter, before the convert would become dilutive because, for the calculation to include the shares, we would add back the interest that's flowing through our income statement related to the convert. So it's really more than the stock price. It's the amount of earnings that we have and whether the share count would be dilutive. And actually, if we earn $70 million even if the stock is below the 13.06 [ph], we would include the shares.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Widner from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Michael R. Widner - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Without going into kind of market-by-market detail, I was wondering if you could talk about, sort of on a percentage basis, where would you describe markets as sustainably or, at least apparently, sustainably getting better and getting closer to, not necessarily normal, but substantial improvement? And how, what percentage of the markets would you say are still kind of stuck in the mud, for lack of a better word?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I'm going to be very general because, again, I don't want to talk specifically about our markets any longer. But I would say to you, as Don Horton says, the Sun Belt continues to be where a lot of people want to live and are focusing on living in the future. So those markets are good for us. And as a comparison, I would say that the North continues to be weak for us compared to the Sun Belt markets.","Michael R. Widner - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got you. So and then another question, I guess. You talked about getting back to 50,000 units. Obviously, that's a pretty robust growth trend from here. One way to get there is kind of 25% growth a year for the next 5 years, or another way is that it takes 10 years and it's slower growth. So just as you contemplate kind of how all this nonsense unfurls both in the U.S. and globally, what's your expectation?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, first of all, I qualified that as a personal goal. I thought that was a major accomplishment for us in 2006 to close 50,000 units, more than any builder in the U.S. had ever closed before. And certainly, we led industry with that number. I don't know if it's going to take us 5 years, I don't know whether it's going to take us 7 years. I just know that our balance sheet is positioned for us to be able to come back to that number more quickly than many anticipate and certainly quicker -- more quickly than other competitors in the industry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets.","Steven Bachman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Steven Bachman, in for Bob Wetenhall. Just a couple of quick questions. You made several comments on SG&A towards the end of your prepared comments. But in terms of the full year, do you expect SG&A to be relatively flat in '12 versus the $480 million in '11?","Stacey H. Dwyer","We would expect our percentage to be improved compared to '11. A lot of what the absolute dollar amount does, though, will be dependent on the absolute level of homes closed because a portion of that is going to be a variable cost. So if we have significantly higher homes closed, the dollars will be higher. If we have flat homes closed, then we would expect our dollars to be lower than what we incurred last year.","Steven Bachman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. And I guess the follow-up being, the cancellation rate was 26%, which is on the low end compared to the last few quarters. We were just wondering if you were seeing any trend shifts in cancellation activity or if it was just noise in the quarter.","Mike Murray","Probably just noise in the quarter. We're still seeing a lot of the same drivers of cancellations, primarily mortgage qualification.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Barclays Capital.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My first question relates to your comments that, as, that if the recovery occurs in '12, which I think it will, but if it does, you expected it to be not uniform across the country. Some markets will outperform others and that sort of thing. I was curious as to whether or not you could give us an idea, the markets which you are seeing or anticipating to see greater -- stronger trends, what does your margin profile look like in those markets, understanding that some geographies tend to have better margin profiles, generally speaking?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, again, I would say to you, and I'm not going to, again, not going to speak specifically about specific markets, Steve. But again, if you look at our Sun Belt markets and certainly our coastal markets, I think that's clearly where we\u2019re seeing some of our best gross margins today. And I think there's a reason for that, and I think a number of our coastal markets have had horrific declines in lot prices over the course of the past 5 or 6 years. And in many instances, we're offering houses, finished houses for what the lots were costing 5 or 6 years ago, so there's an incredible buying opportunity for people who have that -- who can qualify and who want to own a second home in those markets.","Bill W. Wheat","And there will be additional information in the 10-Q on a regional basis. We report our 6 operating regions in our segment reporting in our financials and in the MD&A that will have some commentary around the reasons why certain regions are more profitable and what's driving the changes there as well, so there will be some additional color in the 10-Q.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And I just came out of one of our markets where our gross margins were running 25% to 30%. And you wouldn't believe me if I told you that, and I certainly wouldn\u2019t tell anybody where I was. So as a result, we do have some markets that are over-performing.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, well, that's great, and that's good to hear. I guess my second question relates to your comments about your personal goal, getting back. I don't want to make too much of this. I know that it can be misinterpreted. And that's -- my intent is not to belabor it, but -- so my question relates to, as we look forward, what we can expect in terms of market share for Horton, which obviously, I know that, that's something that you work very hard and are very proud about, maintaining strong market shares in your markets. At the peak, we saw an unusually large percentage of the starts in the country that were single-family detached for sale. And the conventional wisdom today is that it is unlikely that the mix of starts at the, as we get back into recovery, will have quite the same proportion of single-family detached for-sale housing. So I was wondering, A, whether you've factored that into your thinking of where you think you can grow and the targets you set internally; and then secondly, whether or not you think there's an opportunity to alter your mix of products so that you can capture more of whatever starts happen to come through over the next 5 years.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Okay. Well, first of all, let me say, clearly, it goes without saying, but I want to say it, clearly, and that is we're interested in growth, but we're always at this company interested in profitable growth. So notwithstanding the fact of my personal goal, we're never going to achieve my personal goal if the profitability is not there first. Secondly, we have, as a company, and especially in the 2003, '04, '05 and '06 time period, had a myriad of products out there on the marketplace, anywhere from single-family detached to single-family condos, detached condos, to townhouses, to triplexes, to podium-type buildings. And so we're capable, as we've proven, to build any type of product. Where we see the demand today clearly is in single-family detached with a small smattering of townhouse and, to a lesser extent, detached condos, single-family detached condos. So as a result, what we're focused on today is single-family detached. When that market becomes saturated, then we clearly have the experience and are prepared to move into the other different types of housing products, which we've proven that we can do in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Two questions. If this is the bottom of the market, it\u2019s kind of a good problem question. But your discipline around not buying land, wanting to be a short builder to avoid the, some of the issues we had at the peak of the last cycle relative to the long-land position, it kind of, it's -- you're really limiting your upside, I would say, given kind of your low net leverage at current levels, as well as the potential DTA. Can you kind of talk about how you're balancing the conservative approach you've taken through this, in the last few years relative to the fact that, if you do buy land and builders tend to make outsized margins on land versus the vertical construction cost, what should we look for because, I mean, you do -- and especially lands, finished lands running out?","Donald J. Tomnitz","What you should look for is for us to continue to lead the foray into increasing our sales, increasing our closings based upon acquiring additional land and lot positions, as we continue to do today. Our only caveat is, is that we're not going to risk our already sterling strong balance sheet by getting into land positions that are in excess of 2 years. And we believe that we can continue to produce the kind of volume and the profitability by laying off anything that's greater than 2 years to an investor or to a partner to hold that land that's in greater than 2 years. No one in the home building industry that I know of, including ourselves, were intelligent enough to figure out when to start laying off land quickly enough. So all of us ended up trashing our balance sheets within -- and had future impairments based upon our inability to determine how much land we should hold at a specific time. So I guess, after all these years with Horton, 28 years, and D.R. being in the business longer than that, we've got our balance sheet back to the strongest in the industry. We're not going to risk that in anticipation of a market that may have a future dip. And who knows what the market may bring? Currently, we sort of think that this is the bottom of the market. We're not certain. If you\u2019ll recall, back 3 and 4 years ago, there were a number of people who were a lot smarter than we, or at least they thought, who were out picking out finished lots deals and land positions, and basically, the market continued to work downward from that position. So once again, our position is we're going to grow profitably and we're going to grow faster than virtually any other builder, but we're going to do it in a sane way to preserve our balance sheet.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just I -- on the mothballed units, Bill, you talked -- I thought I heard you say 43,000. What was that last year and last quarter? Because I thought it was a bit lower even though it's staying about 20% of your inventory dollars. And then can you talk about the distribution of these mothballed lots relative to your comments around finished lots and the end markets expiring over the next 2 years? So does your excess lots, mothballed lots, happen to coincide where development of lots is going to have to occur?","Bill W. Wheat","In terms of the number of mothballed lots, we're 4-flat with a quarter ago. And a year ago, we were at 44,000, so we're down about 1,000 there. And then in terms of the location of our mothballed lots, typically, these are in areas that are a little bit further out from where the development is occurring today. It will take some market improvement and market expansion in general before we would feel the need to bring some amount of that land on. And then the other element that characterizes some of the, our held land is the fact that it would take significant development investment to bring that, those lots to market. And today, the returns aren\u2019t sufficient to justify that additional investment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Smith from JMP Securities.","Michael G. Smith - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Just most of my questions have been answered, but I'll do a follow-up to something you said, DT. You -- I'm just trying to understand this a little bit better. You talked about, I think, if I remember correctly, earlier you were saying that the overall housing market wasn't getting a whole lot more traction. But clearly, you guys are seeing a pick-up, and you said even specifically in December and January, seeing a pick-up in your traffic levels and the number of buyers you have in your models. So I'm assuming, and you mentioned this briefly, that you're kind of chalking that up to market share gains. Is there any way for you to either quantify that or give more color on it? I mean, is it sort of universal across all your markets, more concentrated in some markets than others? And how do you get a sense of what those market share gains are and how strong they are, other than just anecdotally noticing that maybe the overall market is pretty flat but you guys are obviously doing better on the traffic front?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think a lot of it has to do with DR and I being in these markets and assessing the situations ourselves. Clearly, I will say to you, as I said earlier, where we're getting better traction than -- is in the Sun Belt areas and the coastal markets than we are in the northern markets. And I think that will continue to be true.","Stacey H. Dwyer","There's generally, in each of our markets, at least one firm that tracks the relative performance of the homebuilders in that market, so that information is generally available. And we can track by specific market what our market share is based on either sales or building permits, generally are the 2 metrics that are tracked.","Michael G. Smith - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","So then let me ask you as a follow-up. Going forward, the sort of optimism part of the cautious optimism, is that based more on the idea that you guys will continue because you're in a strong position and you have the balance sheet that you do, and you guys will continue to gain market share in at least most of your markets versus optimism that the worm is turning on the overall housing market? I mean, could you see a sort of flat 2012 in the overall market but you guys continue to outperform because of those market share gains?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think that we could see a slight improvement in the overall market for the entire industry in 2012. We would be disappointed if we didn't get our lion's share of that increase, so as a result, it's just slow methodical improvement. We don't expect the new home industry to go back to 750,000 units overnight. I believe that, for the new home industry, clearly, as I've said before, that we are seeing some drivers coming our way from people tired of dealing with foreclosures and short sales, and also the affordability that's present in the new home industry today. So as a result, all those factors combined, I think there's going to be a slight upward trend in 2012 and, hopefully, a slightly better upward trend in 2013 as the economy, U.S. economy begins to recover and we start generating some new jobs in this country. The one driver that we're missing in our industry and the reason we're scrapping around in the marketplace trying to get additional market share is because there are no new jobs being created of any significance. And until we get our act together, the new job creation -- the new home building industry will continue to scrape along the bottom with little ups and little downs, but no significant improvement.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Barr\u00f3n from Housing Research Center.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","So my question is, when we met, I guess, about a year ago, I think, at the time, your company's goals were to kind of focus on reducing debt and using the free cash flow for that purpose. And I guess, kind of where you sit now, I'm wondering if you're still going to -- if that's still part of the strategy, to kind of keep one foot on the brakes and one foot on the accelerator or if you think your $1 billion of cash would be more towards the use of buying land? Like, how -- I mean, given that your optioning land, it doesn't sound like you need a lot of capital, so how are you thinking about that?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, clearly, we're cautiously optimistic, and I think that's a good analogy: We've got one foot on the brake and one foot on the accelerator because, again, we don't see any substantial, significant, immediate improvement in the industry. It's going to be slow and methodical as we work our way back up, so we are very, very, very protective of our $1 billion in cash. And we are also very, very conservative, so we look forward in terms of land positions. And as I said earlier, we're not interested in buying anything where we have to get our capital back in greater than 2 years right now, and frankly, most of it's 18 months. So we're prepared and positioned and experienced to do whatever is necessary to capitalize on an expanding market, if and when we see a substantial increase in the market.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","Okay. My other question is, are you starting to see or hear anecdotally that people who went through the foreclosure or short-sale process and have been renting for the last few years, are they starting to come back into your sales offices to buy? And if so, how are you capitalizing on this trend, if that's what's happening?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I think we have seen those people. And we have people in our own company who have gone through the short sale and the foreclosure process who thought they were going to get a great deal, and many of them have come back and bought a D.R. Horton home, thank you. But at the same time, I think that, that's still a very laborious process, as I've said.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Yes, and Alex, I think you may be asking a different question in terms of people who actually had their home foreclosed on and are now looking to buy another home. Is that right? We'll assume it is. But yes, we do see some of that. There's a certain time frame after a short sale and a little bit longer time frame after a foreclosure where people can come back into the market. And their credit doesn\u2019t reflect the effects of those occurrences. So we have seen some of that picking up, and that's one of the things that we've mentioned a few times. Our mortgage company has the DHI Mortgage Home Buyers Club that helps people work toward home ownership, and we have been working with some people who have been through those situations before.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Susan Berliner from JPMorgan.","Susan Berliner - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just want to talk a little bit about the mortgage side, I guess, with regards -- just would love your updated opinion, are DTAs mostly behind you guys at this point? And have any of your customers talked about mortgage availability being a little bit easier over the past couple of quarters? Or where does it stand?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I don't see any -- well, as Stacey said earlier, the mortgage qualification process is still a strenuous process. And it's -- the mortgage companies, in general, have higher underwriting guidelines than they had 3, 4, 5 years ago. So we don't see any relief in that respect at all.","Susan Berliner - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And mortgage put-backs, are those kind of behind you, do you think, at this point?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We still have a few of those coming back to us. We have had very few relative to the number of mortgages that we underwrote over the years. We continue to be well accrued for any potential put-backs. And frankly, we evaluate each and every put-back, and to the extent that we disagree with it, we're fighting very hard with those mortgage companies who are trying to put those back to us for reasons that are difficult to understand.","Bill W. Wheat","Then in the current quarter, we did have $1.7 million of recourse expense, so still some impact there. And our total accrual or reserve in the mortgage company remains at about $32 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless from Guggenheim.","James McCanless - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","First question, could you please repeat the guidance you gave at the end of the prepared remarks?","Stacey H. Dwyer","At a very high level, Jay, without reading the whole thing, we basically said: with a lower backlog and a conversion rate below 90%, fewer closings in Q2 than Q1; strongest sales in Q2 and Q3 lead to strongest closings in Q3 and Q4; gross margins to remain in the mid-16% range; sequential increase in SG&A expense in the second quarter, which will result in a higher SG&A percentage, but in Q3 and Q4, higher absolute SG&A but lower percentages.","James McCanless - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then the other question that I had. On last quarter's conference call, I believe there was a discussion about culling neighborhoods, unprofitable neighborhoods, culling unprofitable specs. Where are you with that process? And has the sales activity that you've seen over the last 2 months, has that changed the process? And just a general update on what you're thinking with those now.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Clearly, we have continued the culling process of our lower-margin subdivisions. We try to retrade them initially, rework the sales price on the lot. If the seller is not willing to do that, then we exit that subdivision. Where most of that happened, quite frankly, is in the Carolinas, and we've made a lot of progress in terms of culling our lower-margin subdivisions in the Carolinas. It's a continuing process, and even though we believe we are entering into profitable contracts, at times, we don't, and we go back and rework those contracts or cull those. But that'll be a continuing process of the company.","Bill W. Wheat","It's the same thing on our spec inventory. It's a continual process month to month, week to week. Our sales teams are focused on moving aged inventory and keeping our spec inventory in line with sales, so it's just an ongoing part of our management.","Donald J. Tomnitz","But as far as our specs are concerned, we continue to offer the right number of specs in the right number communities. Every once in a while, we'll get an aged spec, and there is an incentive to move that spec. But it's a strong position for us to be in because realtors across the country sell -- still sell a large percentage of our homes, for which we are very grateful because they bring a qualified buyer to us, and it's a seamless process once that realtor brings that buyer into our sales office.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Most have been asked and answered, but I was just thinking about this commentary that we had just wrapped up on spec. And slow methodical overall, but it does seem like the industry -- one of the bigger opportunities for the industry is this notion of higher rents and continued higher rents. So just wondering sort of philosophically, you've always been a spec builder. Specs ramp into the seasonal demand period, as well, but have you, this year, maybe thought about your spec business a little differently, given the rise in rents? Is there anything you can talk to there, just sort of conceptually?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I think, one -- the answer to your question, our spec strategy has not been dictated or changed much by the rent increases that we've -- that other buyers -- or renters are experiencing. I will say one thing: They may be disappointed with the increases in the rental rates, but one of the big factors that's preventing them from becoming a non-renter is the fact that either their credit history needs to be improved or the fact that they don't have the down payment. So as a result, as Stacey mentioned earlier, our Home Buyers Club are taking those people and converting them into homebuyers as we educate them on the financial system, which most of those people are good credit risk. It's just that they have not understood the financial reporting system and gotten themselves into some difficulty in terms of their credit history. And our Home Buyers Club is doing a fantastic job of converting those people into homebuyers. And most of those that we get through the process and graduate are D.R. Horton buyers.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then on the mothballed side. I mean, is it basically coming down to employment levels? Obviously, a lot goes into what makes a mothball not a mothball, going forward. But how do we think about -- is it new home pricing? I mean, obviously, you've probably written this stuff down. It doesn't make sense to sell it here. But does employment need to move out to those areas? Or is it we need to see 10%, 12% price increases? I mean, how are you thinking about the mothballed generally?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think, generally, we have less, as we mentioned, land. It's all in a continuum of probably from 1 to 10 years, but most of it's somewhere in the 3- to 5-year range, my perception is. And as the depleted -- as the lot supply, the finished lot supply becomes depleted, and that's going to be one driver. The second driver is just, clearly, the land component of a finished lot today in many markets is nominal, and so as a result, we're going to have to have some increase in housing prices to justify being able to pay the land seller something for their land or for our land to have the value that we've got on it in our books today in order to bring it into development. So I think it's a function of 2 things. But clearly, we're depleting the finished lot supply. And as we finish -- we deplete that finished lot supply, we're going to have to start developing lots. And as a result, there's going to be some increase in the value of housing prices as that depleted lot supply occurs, and land will become developable for us that we've got mothballed.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani from KBW.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick follow-ups. One is on the watchlist. I didn't hear you guys give a brief update, if you care to share that? And then secondly, the FHA regionally disclosed additional risk reduction steps, including requiring indemnifications from certain lenders. Wondering if you think that could have any impact.","Mike Murray","Jade, on the watchlist, we had a watchlist of $363 million at the end of December, which is slightly up from $354 million at the end of September. But primarily, that's been pretty much in-line, and that's reflective of the more stable market conditions we've seen.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jessica Hansen, Vice President, Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Please go ahead.","Jessica Hansen","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019.","Before we get started, today's call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different.","All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-Q this week. After this call, we will post an investor presentation and supplementary data to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News & Events for your reference. The supplementary data relates to our homebuilding return on inventory, home sales gross margin, changes in active selling communities, our product mix and mortgage operations.","Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.","David Auld","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning.","In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","The D.R. Horton team delivered a solid third quarter of 2019. Our consolidated revenues increased 11% to $4.9 billion. Pre-tax income was $627 million, and our pre-tax profit margin was 12.8%. The spring selling season was solid and our homebuilding gross margin improved sequentially. These results reflect the strength of our operational teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer affordable homes across multiple brands.","As we\u2019ve discussed on our last few calls, affordability concerns caused some moderation in demand for homes in late fiscal 2018 and early fiscal 2019. And in response, we increased sales incentives to improve our sales pace. Interest rates on mortgage loans have since decreased and we reduced the level of incentives offered as the spring progressed. We continue to see good demand and a limited supply of homes at affordable prices across our markets. At the same time, economic fundamentals and financing availability remain solid.","We are pleased with our product positioning and our sales volumes of the June quarter and in July, which were in line with our expectations and normal seasonality.","Our strategic focus is to continue consolidating market share while growing our revenues and profits, generating strong annual cash flows and returns and maintaining a flexible financial position. With the conservative balance sheet that includes ample supply of homes, lots and land to support growth, we are well-positioned for the remainder of 2019 and future years. Mike?","Mike Murray","Net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 5% to $475 million compared to $454 million in the prior year quarter. And net income per diluted share increased 7% to $1.26. Our consolidated pre-tax income for the quarter increased to $627 million, and our homebuilding pre-tax income was $562 million.","Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 11% to $4.7 billion on 15,971 homes closed, up from $4.3 billion on 14,114 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was down 2% from last year to $296,400, while the average size of our homes closed was down 3%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill?","Bill Wheat","Net sales orders in the third quarter increased 6% to 15,588 homes, and the value of those orders was $4.7 billion, up 8% from $4.4 billion in the prior year. Our average number of active selling communities increased 9% from the prior year and 1% sequentially. Excluding the builders we acquired earlier this year, both our third quarter net sales orders and our average number of active selling communities increased 3% year-over-year.","Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $302,000, up 1% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 20% compared to 21% in the same quarter last year. Jessica? ","Jessica Hansen","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 20.3%, up 100 basis points sequentially from the March quarter. The sequential increase in our gross margin from the March to June quarter exceeded our expectations and was primarily due to lower incentives and lumber costs.","Based on today's market conditions, we currently expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to increase sequentially from the third quarter, subject to possible fluctuations due to product and geographic mix as well as the relative impact of warrantee, litigation and purchase accounting. Bill?","Bill Wheat","In the third quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 8.1%, flat with the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, homebuilding SG&A expense was 8.8% of revenues compared to 8.7% last year. We remain focused on managing our SG&A efficiently while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports opportunities to increase our market share over the long term. Mike?","Mike Murray","We ended the quarter with 29,200 homes in inventory, 14,800 of our homes were unsold, with 9,200 in various stages of construction, and 5,600 completed. Our current inventory of homes puts us in a great position to finish the year strong. Our homebuilding investments in lots, land and development during the third quarter totaled $875 million of which $470 million was for land and finished lots, and $405 million was for land development.","Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for new communities remained consistent at a minimum 20% annual pre-tax return on inventory and a return of our initial cash investment within 24 months. David?","David Auld","At June 30th, our homebuilding lot position consisted of 300,000 lots of which 39% were owned and 61% were controlled. 29% of our total owned lots are finished and 55% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. We continue working to increase our lot position being developed by third parties by supporting the expansion of Forestar's national lot manufacturing platform and expanding our relationship with lot developers across the country. Our current lot portfolio includes an ample supply of lots for homes at affordable price points and continues to provide a strong competitive advantage. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Financial services pre-tax income in the third quarter increased to $48.1 million from $30.3 million in the prior year quarter. Financial services pre-tax profit margin for the quarter was 40.2%, up from 31.2% in the prior year, due to improved loan sale execution. 98% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 58% of D.R. Horton homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 45% of the mortgage company's volume.","Borrowers' originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 720 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 51% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, up from 48% in the prior year quarter, reflecting our continued focus on offering affordable homes for entry-level buyers. Mike?","Mike Murray","Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary is a publicly-traded residential lot manufacturer, now operating in 50 markets across 20 states. At June 30th, Forestar owned and controlled approximately 37,400 lots of which 24,100 are under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer. During the 9 months into June 30th, Forestar delivered 2,224 lots and is on track to deliver 4,000 lots in fiscal 2019, generating $320 million to $350 million of revenue and deliver approximately 10,000 lots in fiscal 2020, generating $700 million to $800 million of revenue. These expectations are for Forestar\u2019s standalone results.","Forestar's making steady progress in building its operational platform and capital structure to support its significant growth plans. During the quarter, Forestar issued $350 million of senior notes. Forestar's liquidity, capital base and lot position at June 30th are sufficient to support their planned delivery through fiscal 2021. Subject to market conditions, Forestar expects to opportunistically access the equity and debt capital markets to provide additional long-term growth capital, while managing to a net leverage ratio of 40% or less.","Forestar hosted their quarterly earnings call last Thursday and has an updated presentation on their Investors site at investor.forestar.com that describes Forestar's unique lot manufacturing model, and its significant growth and value creation opportunity. David?","David Auld","DHI Communities is our multifamily rental company, focused on suburban garden-style apartments with current operations primarily in Texas, Arizona and Florida. During the quarter, DHI Communities sold its second apartment project located in Houston for $60 million and recognized a gain on sale of 22,600,000.","DHI Communities has five projects under active construction, one project that was substantially completed at the end of the quarter, which we currently expect to be sold in early fiscal 2020. DHI Communities\u2019 total assets were $167 million at June 30th. Bill?","Bill Wheat","Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet strength and multi-year earnings and cash flow generation have increased our flexibility, and we are utilizing our strong position to enhance the long-term value of the Company.","During the first nine months of fiscal 2019 our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $605.7 million. At June 30th, we had $1.6 billion of homebuilding liquidity, including $578 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage ratio improved 370 basis points from a year ago to 18.5%. The balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion, and we have $500 million of senior note maturities due in the next 12 months.","At June 30th, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $9.6 billion, and book value per share was $26.08, up 14% from a year ago.","During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $56 million. We also repurchased 3.7 million shares of common stock for $159.3 million, utilizing the remainder of our outstanding authorization. Our stock repurchases for the first nine months of the year totaled 9.8 million shares for $375.5 million, resulting in a 2% decline in our outstanding share count at the end of the quarter compared to a year ago.","Subsequent to quarter end, our Board issued a new authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock with no expiration date. Our top priorities for cash flow utilization remain to consolidate market share by investing in our homebuilding business and strategic acquisitions, reduce homebuilding leverage, and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Jessica? ","Jessica Hansen","Looking forward to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect to generate consolidated revenues in the range of $4.75 billion to $4.9 billion and to close approximately 15,700 to 16,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 20.4% to 20.7% and homebuilding SG&A in the fourth quarter to be approximately 8.1% to 8.3% of homebuilding revenues.","We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin in the fourth quarter in the range of 31% to 34%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24.5%. For the full fiscal year 2019, we still expect to generate cash flow from homebuilding operations of least $1 billion and we expect our outstanding share count to be down approximately 2% at the end of the year, compared to the end of fiscal 2018.","Based on today's market conditions, our expected growth for fiscal 2020 is currently in the mid to high-single-digit percentage range for both consolidated revenues and homes closed. We expect to get further fiscal 2020 guidance on our November earnings call. David?","David Auld","In closing, our results reflect the strength of our long-tenured, well-established operating platform across the country. We're striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets, and to expand our industry-leading market share.","We have been the largest builder by volume in the United States for 17 consecutive years. According to Builder Magazine's recent Local Leaders issue, in 2018, we were the number one builder in all of the top five U.S. housing markets. And D.R. Horton was a top 5 builder in 31 of the top 50 housing markets.","We are focused on consolidating market share, while growing our revenues and profits and generating strong annual cash flows and returns, while maintaining a flexible financial position. We are well-positioned to do so with our conservative balancing, broad geographic footprint, affordable product offerings across multiple brands, attractive finished lot and land position and most importantly, our outstanding experienced team across the country.","Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus on hard work. We are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Your line is now live.","Carl Reichardt","Good morning, everybody. I wanted to talk a little bit, just first of all, on the South Central and the Southwest regions where orders were off a little bit. Can you just talk, maybe Mike or David, about community count versus absorption rates there? I think Southwest is short communities now and the plan is to kind of -- to re-grow those reasons?","Mike Murray","Yes. What we're seeing in the Southwest is that we are short communities relative to where we were. And frankly, that's a function of our success we've had in those markets.","We've sold communities at faster paces than anticipated, and the replacement communities are not yet on line. And we will be looking to replace those communities replace those flags.","South Central, frankly, is going up against a very tough sales comp. Last year, I think, they work over 20% in this quarter. And while their community count\u2019s going to be about flat, absorptions did not grow as much. But we're frankly pretty satisfied with the absorptions we have there this year, based on what we saw in the late fall and early winter, and then, seeing the margin expansion that we've been able to achieve with a little stronger selling season.","Jessica Hansen","And the specifics will be in our supplemental presentation available with our call, Carl. But just for reference, our Southwest active selling communities were down 13% year-over-year, right in line with the sales orders, so, very strong absorption still out of that market.","Carl Reichardt","And then, just as a follow-up, we've talked a lot about local market share and the advantages that can bring. And we've seen some peers of yours move to lower price points, and they're delivering on a greater order growth than you but at margins that are well below. Can you talk a little bit about as to whoever meets the road here in what has been a softish market? Can you talk about how you've been leveraging market share to protect those margins, grow those margins and keep your absorptions reasonably strong? Thanks, guys.","David Auld","We've been in this affordability push for the last five years. We have incredibly well positioned communities, very deep and lot supply. And it's not something that is going to continue to outgrow the overall percentage of what we grow. It has driven growth for the last three or four years. It's fully rolled out. And from a competitive standpoint, yes, there are people pushing down in price, they're having give away more margin than we are, because they're not as well positioned or as deeply positioned as we are. So, we feel very good about what we've done, where we've done, and feel very good about the pace and margin balance that we're now executing, so.","Carl Reichardt","Thanks, David. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is now live. ","John Lovallo","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on the $1 billion share repurchase authorization. That seems like a little bit of a pivot for you guys, and we think it's pretty positive. But, maybe you could just give us a little help on what drove the decision? And then, in terms of expected cadence of repos, would you expect to be kind of consistent buyers each quarter, more opportunistically, how should we think about that?","Bill Wheat","Yes. Thanks, John. This is Bill. This is the next step for us. We've begun being a more consistent repurchaser of our shares over the last couple of years. And generally, the pace of our repurchases have been increasing over the quarters, with opportunistic fluctuations when we see a pullback in the stock. But, we're repurchasing shares out of our cash flow. And as our cash flow is increased, we've increased our repurchases. So, we see this authorization is kind of the next step in that process. We do expect to continue to be a consistent repurchaser, but we will see some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, depending on obviously the opportunities. ","The authorization has no expiration date. So, it doesn't necessarily imply a specific cadence or specific time frame, they would all be spent. But if you like, that was the appropriate amount to authorize, to put out in front of us and signal to the market that we're going to continue to be a consistent repurchaser.","John Lovallo","Yes. That makes a lot of sense. Okay. And then, in terms of July kind of being in line with normal seasonality, and then that coupled with the 2020 outlook that you guys put out there, it seems like the market is doing reasonably well here. I mean, one of the pushbacks that we get from some folks is that lower interest rates kind of resulted in some pull forward orders over the past couple of quarters. That doesn't seem to be the case. But, I just wanted to get your view on that.","David Auld","That's not my belief. I can tell you. I think that there is tremendous opportunities, tremendous demand in the affordable market, households, the employment, jobs being created. And there's just a limited amount of supply even today. So, I think, the demand is there, if you can position and drive a price that they can buy.","John Lovallo","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thanks. The next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman and Associates. Your line is now live. ","Alan Ratner","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Nice job with the margin improvement. I think, we were actually surprised that you were able to drive that level of improvement. And at the same time, it looks like you had a lot of success selling specs in the quarter. I think, this is the first time in quite a while where your homes and inventory is actually down slightly year-over-year. So, just curious if you could talk a little bit about -- did you see -- was that a concerted effort to drive that spec count lower during the quarter or was that just a function of where the demand was? And I guess, more broadly, with your inventory position down slightly, is that by design, or are there some headwinds that might be slowing the construction cycle, labor, or weather, et cetera? Just talk through all that, would be great. Thank you.","Mike Murray","Sure. Thank you, Alan. This is Mike. What I would touch on is that seasonally, we would expect to see our homes inventory build in the earlier quarters and then start to kind of run down as we satisfy some of that spring selling demand. I think, this quarter, we had 38% of the homes we closed this quarter were sold in the quarter as well. And so, a lot of that reflected with the enhanced margins, our reduced incentives and seeing a buyer return to the market and a little bit of tailwind on some material costs, most notably lumber. We have inventory position where we like it right now, coming to our fourth quarter. We have more inventory right now than we had this time last year. And we expect to be well-positioned at September 30th to start fiscal \u201820, as well. We're not seeing any real times [ph]. I mean, we're continuing to do what we do.","Alan Ratner","Got you. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just on the pricing environment, you mentioned pulling back on incentives. Can you talk a little bit about the percentage of communities where you raise net prices, either through lower incentives, or for outright based price increases? I think, your order price actually ticked higher year-over-year, which was first time in quite a while, but I know there's a lot of mix involved there. So, are you seeing pricing power? What percentage of your communities or which markets are you seeing it in, and to what magnitude? Thank you.","Jessica Hansen","Generally, most of the improvement in our gross margin was driven purely by lower incentives, and not from pricing power. I would say today versus at any point, really, last year in fiscal 2018, we still have less processing power today than we did a year ago. But the pullback in rights has helped. So, it's a little bit better sequentially in that regard. But, the main drivers to our gross margin in Q3 and also what we're expecting, in terms of improvement in Q4, is more from the pullback on incentives. And that continues roll back and then it is pure pricing power.","Alan Ratner","Do you have those numbers handy, Jessica, just percentage of ASP that are incentives today versus a year ago, quarter ago you kind of see? ","Jessica Hansen","So, we don't typically quantify incentives, because to us, whether it's price or if it's something flowing through cost of sales, it all falls out in the margin. So, to us, margin is a best grade and we don't typically try to quantify incentives that way.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is now live.","Eric Bosshard","To follow up just to make sure we understand the path forward with incentives and pricing, talk about your comfort of what you're doing in both those areas. Now, if the progress that you saw in this quarter is the new normal, or if you feel like there's further opportunity in the area of incentives and price?","Mike Murray","I think, Eric, it\u2019s something we continually measure and manage community-by-community. And our operators in the field are making those pricing decisions to meet the market that they see in front of them. So, I would expect that we would, as Jessica mentioned, in the gross margin guidance, continue to see a little bit improved margin into our fourth quarter. Based on the selling environment we're in today and the strength of the buyer that\u2019s coming to our doors, we feel really good about that. I think, we're going to see some further expansion in margin and as well as maintaining the pace that we're at.","Eric Bosshard","And then, secondly, the guidance looks like now your full-year deliveries will be at the high end of the range you established earlier. What's different within that? Is that a better market or better market share? How would you sort of segment between those two factors that are contributing to you getting to the high end of the range?","Mike Murray","I think, it's just a better visibility. As we've gotten through the spring way and we've been able to see our pace continue at a solid base, we have a greater confidence level in our ability to sell and sell through the homes that we have and deliver on during this fiscal year. Just the sequential improvement visibility, I think was the primary factor. It's a very solid market as evidenced by our ability to pull back incentives throughout the quarter. And I think we're still seeing a very solid market out here as we go into our Q4.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.","Truman Patterson","Good morning, everybody. First, I wanted to look at your option lot count. As a percent of total lots, it ticked down a little bit sequentially. I figured, you guys would have continued increasing this, given Forestar, et cetera. Could you guys just discuss a little bit about what drove this in a lean environment in general, are you seeing the availability of option land or developers improving?","Mike Murray","In terms of the change in the option percentage, Truman, I think, that number is very dynamic. It moves, every time we sign a contract or take down lots or cancel a contract. And so, there's a lot of volatility in that. Directionally, the general trend we've had over the past few quarters and past few years, frankly, as we've been working on this has been to push it higher. And we're continuing to work at that. We\u2019re working with developers, both Forestar and other third-party developers constantly, looking for ways to expand that controlled lot position and partner with them to deliver communities and lots to us. Availability, it's still a tough job to find the right land and to get it entitled in today's market, and bring it into production. It is something our team across the country works very hard at every day.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Thanks for that. And then, you guys gave us a little bit on 2020 guidance, I believe mid to high-single-digit revenue growth. Could you just maybe break that out how you're thinking about market conditions? And with that, your all's community count growth possibly versus absorption improvement?","Jessica Hansen","Sure, Truman. That's our preliminary fiscal 2020 guidance. So, today, it's only July, we're going to stick with just consolidated revenue growth in homes closed in the mid to high-single-digits percentage range. And we'll give further breakdown and color in November when we completed our fiscal year end.","Mike Murray","Obviously, the only perspective we can give on that is based on today's market conditions. So, that's assuming that conditions remain relatively consistent with today.","Truman Patterson","Directionally, would you assume that your core community count continues to grow?","Jessica Hansen","We've never given specific guidance on community count, and we're just going to stick with what we currently expect for fiscal \u201820. And we may have a little bit of nonspecific guidance, but color on community count in November, but today, that's what we feel comfortable with our preliminary guidance.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Thank you. Nice quarter.","David Auld","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Your line is now live.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the results. The first question I had was on sales pace, and I guess a little bit of a pace versus price question, but, more focused around sales pace. You\u2019ve had some competitors that have sales pace up anywhere from mid-single-digits to healthy, very healthy double-digit rates. You guys are a little bit more plus or minus flattish this year. But in contrast, you've had strong double-digit sales pace growth for the prior three, four years. So, my question is, are you just at a point and the mark, your own shift towards first time, which kind of led the industry, kind of in a more of a steady state, and it's kind of taking the market as it is? Because it seems like, most of the builders talk about this improved strength or improving strength at entry level that's driving that higher sales pace, whereas you might already have been there and benefited. I'm trying to just reconcile that because obviously also, it seems like you're a little bit more comfortable today, not necessarily adhering at any price, adhering to the double-digit top-line growth and focusing a little bit more on a balanced approach.","So, just trying to get a sense of -- long-winded question, I apologize, but that more flattish sales pace, kind of how that reconciles with some of the other builders we're seeing, and versus your own positioning over the last few years.","Mike Murray","Michael, thank you very much. This is Mike. I think, the way to start with the answer to the question is, we've tried to move to the entry level to the affordable product positioning that\u2019s expressed five years ago. And we had been out rolling that out and seeing very good absorption in demand for that product very well received over the past five years. And we did fuel a lot of years of double-digit top-line growth in units.","We, as David mentioned on the call, secured a lot of very good long land positions and opportunities in that. And we are now -- we're at a place in our rollout that is fairly mature, we're getting good absorptions for immunity. And from a balanced perspective, we're looking at the pace and price and focusing on what's driving the best returns for our inventory investments. And that's what we're seeing today is that we've got a pace that we're very, very satisfied with in our communities looking at each one of them individually, and then looking to see what can we do to adjust incentives, adjust product offerings, to enhance margins, that then increases overall return in those communities as we're working through.","So by and large, we have done the rollout to the entry level. And now, we're looking to kind of, if you would, turn the sales on the business plan a little bit to maximize the returns we're getting out of those communities, and continuing to look for new communities to replace those. So others -- we've been saying for a long time, as we've opened up communities, we see great demand, and we were not able to satisfy all that demand. So, some others have come in and are helping to meet a bit of that demand. But we still feel really good about our positioning and the performance we're getting out of this. ","Michael Rehaut","I guess, secondly, on the lot positioning. I noticed that the option lot percentage ticked down a point sequentially in the third quarter after, again, several years of very impressive growth and gains in that number. How should we think about the optional lot percentage course over the next couple of years? Obviously, the low-60s kind of exceeded your goal or hit your goal faster than expected. Should we kind of expect this type of range to be more of the new normal, or is there kind of another leg up in the option lot percentage over the next of couple years?","Mike Murray","I think, you asked the question the right way in the term of years to look at this. It is a fairly volatile measurement and we have been very fortunate the past several quarters, it has been nothing but increased. But, it will bounce a little bit from time-to-time. But directionally, over the next few years, we would still expect that controlled lot position to climb above its current level. I would say that there's going to be a rapid accelerated leg with that or anything we can point to as a catalyst to take it immediately up 3% to 5%, 7%, 10%. But continually, as we're continuing to adjust our business to focus on returns, we're looking to continue to control more land and partner with more third parties in delivering lots to the builder.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Your line is now live.","Matthew Bouley","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask back on the inventory side, just looking at the finished versus under constructions back. It looked like the finished spec was a little higher as a mix than it typically is. Can you just elaborate a little on why that is? Obviously, you gave us that near-term margin guide, but just kind of any implications around margins or incentives from where that finished spec position is? Thank you.","Mike Murray","We certainly are in strong position to sell and to deliver on what our guidance is for Q4 fiscal \u201819, and fiscal \u201820, and the finished spec position gives us an ability to sell and close homes in the same quarter. So, we're pleased with that positioning, but really no, really implications on our margin guide. We expect our margin to still tick up into Q4 and feel good about our positioning in the market to continue to maintain margins at that level. ","Jessica Hansen","We have a very strong focus on completed an unsold specs over a period of time. And that number for homes greater than six months that have been completed and unsold, have stayed in a really tight 400 to 600 homes range, which on our overall base of inventory of on those 30,000 homes is very manageable. And as Bill said, we feel like we\u2019re in a very strong position for Q4.","Matthew Bouley","Okay, perfect. And then, just secondly, back on the closings guide, 7% to 9% in the fourth quarter, but, just looking at the backlog units. And as we just talked about that inventory units are down year-over-year so, clearly the backlog conversion is stepping up nicely. So, is it really just what you're seeing in the sales environment in July, is labor perhaps loosening? Just what are you guys seeing that's allowing for that type of improvement in backlog conversion? Thank you.","Mike Murray","I think, one of the things to discuss on is that we have a fair bit of completed homes both unsold as well as sold that will be delivered in the fourth quarter. In the aggregate, our homes and inventory are up year-over-year. They're down sequentially, which is seasonally, what we would expect in our business plan. So, we have the homes out there, we're going to close in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.","Ken Zener","Good morning, everybody. So, if we could just do a little math here. Basically, you were running a lot more pre-built homes in 1Q, so you closed higher percent in 3Q as how I look at here your 38% number that you disclosed for intra quarter orders closing. What I'm interested in is your closing for 4Q at the low end, 15,700 up to 16,000, that's interesting and that you have a -- that's a pretty high percent of your under construction, which is how you do everything. Can you explain why that low end of guidance, which is 54% of units and that construction will be up from 49% last year. I know you have specs pre-built homes, which is normal and you had a last year. So, are you getting higher conversion cycles or what is it?","Jessica Hansen","Well, to be specific about the completed specs that we've referenced a couple of times, we have 6,000 -- actually 5,600 completed specs at the end of this year. Last year, we only had about 3,600. So, we are in a very strong position to deliver on that guidance. And right behind those completed specs, we also have homes that are close to completion that we can also sell and close in the same quarter.","Ken Zener","Now, using that same logic where you guys -- well, you guys referred to seasonal order pace, so kind of your pace sequentially. And in prior years, you'd given guidance where your implication was because of the entry level or other type of products, you saw greater absorption. Is there -- so my question to you is, I mean, is there any reason, as you gave guidance for FY20 that you'd see anything other than normal seasonality?","Jessica Hansen","Not that we see today. I mean, we don't have a crystal ball to what the spring selling season looks like. But, where we sit today, we anticipate normal seasonality.","Ken Zener","And then, last question. Could you, given the mix in the third quarter of 38%, I think there's normally 35% inter quarter closings. What was the spread, would you say, between those pre-built homes being ordered and closed versus your backlog?","Jessica Hansen","The stuff we sell and close in the same quarter is almost 100% homes that were already started going into the quarter.","Ken Zener","And the margin differential between those and backlog?","Jessica Hansen","We generally just look at our spec margin versus our build job margin. And generally, our specs run at slightly lower gross margin than our build jobs. But, they turn faster. So, from a return perspective, they're always accretive.","Mike Murray","And then, roughly 80% of the homes closed are specs. So really, our overall margin really does reflect larger spec margin.","David Auld","I would say that the houses we sold and closed in the quarter, we probably achieved a better margin on those than we would have, if we would have sold them in the first quarter or the second quarter.","Mike Murray","Right. Yes, it is interesting dynamic. ","David Auld","I think, that is part of the margin lift we saw and expected.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko with SIG. Your line is now live.","Jack Micenko","I wanted to sort of back up on incentives a little bit. I think, it's been pretty well telegraphed in the market that a large competitor\u2019s been using incentives to meet a volume goal. And I think some other market peers and you also sort of called it, the margin beat this quarter. Is it -- I guess, I'm curious, is it the market and some of those pressures getting better? And David, earlier you talked about positioning of your assets, certainly market segmentation and entry level. Your margin improvement, is it -- how much of it is those three items? Is that the market just getting better or is it\u2026","David Auld","I would say the affordability we gained, affordability in the quarter because interest rates dropped, lumber prices reduced a little bit, which both those things helped I think margin. But, I can tell you, we get up every day thinking about positioning and how we're trying to put the right house, right lot, right community and then have it priced to turn. And so, -- and I know, it\u2019s psychoish to say this, but we really don't look at the other builders much. So, we're just trying to get better in our community presentations, our community offerings and stay competitive every day. So, I would say, it's more Horton than the market, but I'm probably a slightly biased.","Jack Micenko","Okay. And then, on the apartment business, I know it started out, it's been kind of a smaller initiative, but I think you\u2019ve built so far a lot of these near master plans as we already doing. Is that mandate or the strategy changed? I mean, are you still merchant build? Do we see a pivot to some homes and release cash flow? Obviously, there is a couple -- the public's is feeling the same thing. And then, just a reminder on project level financing, is that all on Horton\u2019s balance sheet, are you partnering, how do we think about that a year from now?","David Auld","I'd say, when we started this, we thought it was going to work hand in hand with our home building operations. Where we started it was in communities where we had apartment zoned land, we owned that typically we would have sold and felt like we could drive higher value for our shareholders by building it out and selling it. Our long-term strategy is to sustain and then scale that program. And whether we buy -- whether we hold them, sell them is going to depend on market and cap rates and pipeline, fields we got coming. Right now, as we're learning the business, we're selling. And they actually -- even Bill Wheat was a little skeptical going into it, but they're driving pretty good returns. And as we look at our pipeline of stuff that's under construction right now, it looks like a business that's going to be able to -- we're going to be able to scale.","Jessica Hansen","Jack, in terms of financing, it's all on our balance sheet today, but we are assessing what that looks like in the future. And we'd expect to utilize some level of third-party capital at some point.","David Auld","And ultimately, it comes back to people. And I can tell you, what our community guys have done in a establishing platform, and getting the right people in the right slots has been very impressive. So, we like what we see so far.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. ","Stephen Kim","I wanted to talk a little bit about your 2020 guide. In particular, this year, you decided not to include a margin guide in 2020, and just wanted to get into that a little bit. Obviously, there's a lot we can't know about what the next year is going to bring in terms of the economy and demand, from rates. But, there are two things, two factors that I think we can maybe think about, qualitatively. One is the margin on specs, and the second is the lumber benefit, which is you're seeing near-term. On the specs, David, I believe you mentioned that you thought that margins on specs are usually a little lower than the built to order, but not right now, and in part because of the drop in rates, I mean actually, so folks wanted to close quickly and lock in those rates. That benefit to your margin on your specs relative to BTO, I would assume shouldn't -- we shouldn't assume that's going to continue unless rates drop further, which is not something that I would assume you would bake into your outlook.","And then, secondly, in some of the lumber benefit, I'm thinking -- we don't know how much that was. I'd be curious if you could give it to us. But, I assume that benefit shouldn't be assumed to continue in 2020 either. So, these are two things that may be in the margin next year. Are there material offset to these things that you could point to that might give us some hope that margins could grow next year?","Jessica Hansen","As we've kind of outlined, we get preliminary guidance with what we feel comfortable with today that we can commit to for fiscal 2020. And it's all subject to today's market conditions. We're going to focus as we always have on maximizing returns. And gross margin is going to be a product of both the overall market and what it takes from a price and pace perspective community-by-community to maximize returns. And so, we're not going to try in July to give any sort of gross margin color for fiscal \u201820, other than continuing to make sure, we're balancing pace and price to maximize returns.","David Auld","I may have misspoke. But just to clarify what I thought I said. The houses we sold and closed in Q3 were at a higher margin than if we would have sold and closed the houses that we sold and closed in Q1 -- specs. Because incentives have abated, and we are seeing less of a need to incentivize a finished house to get it under contract and close.","Jessica Hansen","But, what I said earlier about spec margins generally being lower than build job margins is still true. That was true this quarter and that would be in any base case scenario we have.","Stephen Kim","And I guess, could you give some color with respect to the lumber benefit? You didn't really talk specifically about that. Could you just dimensionalize that for us in some manner?","Mike Murray","We probably would quantify that as about in our sequential margin improvement. Probably about 20 to 30 bps of tailwind came from lower lumber costs in the homes we closed this quarter versus when we closed in the second quarter.","Stephen Kim","And then the last one for me. I think, you mentioned somewhere along your remarks that the build -- the cycle time had not changed. So, your cycle time hasn't improved, and it hasn't deteriorated, I assume, is what that means. And then, therefore, I guess, I'm thinking into next year, or just as we go forward, if we're going to improve the returns without the margin, is it possible for you to do that effectively without increasing or shortening your build time on average?","Mike Murray","We're not seeing our build times lengthen this year and they have not contracted as much as we would have liked. But, that does remain an area of focus to us is how do we be better stewards of the capital and turn that capital more efficiently, and getting build times to be as efficient as possible is certainly a huge part of that. And that's something we do get up every day and think about how to do that. I mean, David talked about, we try to enhance margin every day, we also try to enhance the build time. We talked about our cash flow cycles. That's a big part of our cash flow cycle. You're exactly right. That is an area we need to focus on.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.","Mike Dahl","My first question was still around kind of the pace versus margin or return discussion. And following up on, Jessica, what I think you just said and what Mike and David also touched on earlier. I know, it's not all one size fits all. But, at a high level, what I'm trying to figure out is, you go into the year with a, generally speaking, kind of a unit goal, you put inventory on the ground that positions you to meet that. And so, the question is, as you go through the year and demand kind of fluctuates? Is it the right way to think about what fits best from your results that the swing line is actually on gross margins versus upside or downside on units? Just because I think there's still a question of, whether there's some bigger picture strategic shift in the way you're thinking about volume versus margin or returns at this point, or if this is really just a function of market dynamics?","David Auld","I talk about one of my divisions, margin is the great. If you do a great job of positioning the product for the price point and demand that exists, then you're going to run a very high margin, in excess of 20%. If you do a very poor job of positioning price point, product, then you're probably going to run a lower margin, because you're -- we are going hit a certain pace, we are going to maintain production in the community and then, adjust out that process. So, we do put a plan out there, we do have expectations. And when we get everything right, the margins run very, very high, when the markets working with us, the margins improve. So, we are going to run at a pace.","Mike Dahl","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. ","Mike Murray","Yes. In the short term, that margin grade is what the difference is between how well we do and how well we want to do. But in a little bit longer term, we can moderate, adjust the pace, based on market conditions, as we're seeing to maximize the return. And more broadly, as we've over the past 5 years, 10 years, coming out of the downturn, attained a lot of market share and scale, we've been able to then focus on how best to maximize the company's return on equity, and what are some of the levers we can pull there and consistently driving cash flow creating opportunities for us de-risk the balance sheet, invest in new opportunities for us to grow the business or to return more capital to shareholders, as we think it\u2019s the most creative way to drive value for our shareholders.","Mike Dahl","Okay. Thanks for that. And then, my second question is just a follow-up to Steve's question around lumber. You quantified that as 20 to 30 points sequential benefit in 3Q. I was wondering what the sequential benefit is in your 4Q guide versus 3Q, specifically related to lumber? And then, can you give us at a higher level, your direct cost trends on -- I know your home size is shrinking, so maybe on a per square foot basis would be helpful.","Mike Murray","I\u2019ll comment on Q4 first. So, it's a bit of a tailwind on lumber is a component of our guide of a sequential improvement of 10 to 40 basis points in gross margin in Q4. Don't have a specific component of that, because mix will impact that in actuality, but it is a component of our guide for sequential increase.","Jessica Hansen","Yes. And outside of incentives and lumber, really our revenues per square foot and our cost per square foot were relatively flat sequentially, other than the two pieces that we called out which drove the improvement in gross margin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the Jade Rahmani from KBW. Your line is now live.","Ryan Tomasello","Good morning. This is Ryan on for Jade. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first, thinking bigger picture, do you think that the fundamental structure of the homebuilding industry is really too fragmented and therefore presents an opportunity for someone like D.R. Horton to consolidate over the intermediate term?","David Auld","We've been consolidating. And I can tell you, our plan is to continue to consolidate. If you look at the industry when we went public, it was -- public builders were about 3% of the overall market. And every year, since then, the publics have gained more market share and we have gained more market share against the other publics. I for one don\u2019t see the change.","Ryan Tomasello","And I guess, dovetailing off of that topic. Do you think that there are material scale economies that would further benefit the Company in the majority of your markets, or is that process somewhat over -- is that thought process somewhat overblown?","Mike Murray","That's the big focus of ours. While we're certainly the largest volume builder in the country, we're not number one in every market. So, we're focused on what can we do in each market to aggregate market share and become the largest builder. We're top 5 in 31 of the top 50 markets. So, we see plenty of opportunity to still consolidate market-by-market and really that happens at community level every day.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Jay McCanless from Wedbush. Your line is now live.","Jay McCanless","The first question I had, could you talk about how orders trended on a monthly basis through the quarter? And then, if you could quantify what you see so far in July?","Jessica Hansen","Jay, I think, we answered the call, David mentioned that we've seen in our June quarter and our July sales through -- we can't talk about today yet, but through most of the month, we've just seen normal seasonality and in line with our expectations. So putting this right where we want to be to deliver the fourth quarter we\u2019ve talked about.","Jay McCanless","Okay. And then, I think you\u2019ve all commented on it a couple of times. But the expansion of the affordable product has basically been completed. I was wondering, if that applies to Freedom as well. And maybe what you're seeing from active adult demand, and also move up demand? Since most folks have been focused on affordable, would love to hear how some of these other sectors are performing?","David Auld","The Freedom brand is still early in the rollout. We have gotten much better at positioning that product. But we're not anywhere near where we want to be, at this point. I will say that every community we\u2019ve rolled out seems to be a little better positioned, a little better reception from the customer. And it's a brand -- it\u2019s going to be a part of this company for a long time. And I think we'll at some point approach 10% plus of our deliveries. The luxury brand, again, we continue to get better at it, nowhere near where we want to be. It gives us areas to focus. Right now, the affordable product lines have driven returns and growth, and we pay our guys based upon returns and profits. So, their focus has been on delivering what the buyer wants. But, there will be a point in time where that will drive a better return than entry levels, at least it has been in past cycles. So, very happy with everything we're doing. We\u2019ve just got to get better.","Operator","Our final question today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now live.","Buck Horne","Question, I think, you talked on the number of benefits you're getting. I was wondering, if you quantify or is it a little bit either on cost per square foot or otherwise, just how labor costs have been trending throughout the quarter? And also, what you're seeing in terms of land inflation that's out there? And my secondary question to that would just be, how you\u2019re pricing lots that are coming from Forestar, how do you negotiate those prices?","Mike Murray","So, first of all, your question in terms of labor costs, we're not seeing a lot of other changes really in our steak and bread cost. So, labor costs right now quarter-on-quarter holding in flat, we're pleased with the relationships and the teams we have out there negotiating this. Land and development costs are always a challenge that we work back against, a lot of our deep positions and market scale of health with that, and we've now seen a lot of lot cost inflation coming through on this quarter\u2019s closings. So we're happy with the benefit that's produced.","And then, the third part of the question, I think is Forestar\u2019s lot pricing. We look at for an opportunity that we bring to Forestar that we have tied up, we negotiate with Forestar and they have returned hurdles and metrics that they have to achieve. And our land teams what those are and they'll bring those projects to them and then negotiate take down structures and the pricing to achieve those return hurdles. And if it works for both parties, we go forward with the deal that Forestar does it. If it doesn't work, we can't find a way to make it work, then it's not a deal Forestar does. For an opportunity that Forestar sources, we have the opportunity to get up to have the lots tied up, but that's really, write a first offer or first refusal on those parcels. And, they have their return hurdles; they are out there competitively bidding it in the marketplace with other builders. And they'll work with us where it makes sense. And they'll work with other builders where it makes sense as well. So, they sell both to Horton and they sell to third-party builders as well.","Buck Horne","One last one in there, just to switch gears to the mortgage market a little bit. There was some concern or some questions out of the industry with the FHFA discussing -- letting the path around DTI [ph] loans and debt to income ratios letting that have to fire in early 2021. And we\u2019re a long way up from there. But just wondering, if you could give us a feel or do you have any metrics around, how many of your buyers could be affected by a change in those underwriting framework, how many of your buyers have DTI ratios over 43% or anything around that could help?","Jessica Hansen","Sure, Buck. I think you\u2019ve kind of hit the nail on the head with how we would start, which is 2021 is a long ways out. So, I think a lot can happen between then. And does it fully expire and go away or does some middle ground be reached between now and then, we'll see. It's a long ways out. In terms of our buyers and their debt to income for the buyers that are utilizing our mortgage company, on average for our entire mortgage company this quarter, the DTI percentage was about 42%. So, we do have a decent amount of our buyers that would be at that 43% or above. But, that doesn't mean just because it's the patch were to go away for conventional, there's not a product for them, they\u2019d still be eligible potentially for an FHA loan. And then, the first question we also always ask is do you have other sources of income that we can verify that we haven't yet, to go into that equation?","So typically, any sort of change that gets implemented like that, is not 100% fallout. Our mortgage company just -- mortgage company does a phenomenal job of working with buyers in our pipeline to find them the different products. And if this patch were to expire, which I don't know that that's any of these base case scenario right now, I feel confident that we figure our way through it with without a lot of fallout.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","David Auld","Thanks, Kevin. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in November. And to the D.R. Horton team, outstanding quarter. Thank you. We are forever grateful up here for what you guys do out there. And I guess, we'll talk to you sooner than November.","Jessica Hansen","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you.

We are currently offering Freedom Homes in eight markets in seven states and expect to have Freedom committees open in at least a third of our 78 operating markets by the end of fiscal 2017.","As we work towards completion of our Express Homes rollout in fiscal 2017, we are excited about the expansion of Express into our Western markets where customer response has been just as strong as in our early markets. In the fourth quarter, entry-level homes marketed under our Express Homes brand accounted for 28% of our homes sold, 29% of homes closed and 20% of home sales revenue and, for the year, they accounted for 27% of homes sold, 26% of homes closed and 18% of home sales revenue.","We also remain dedicated to offering homes for higher-end move-up and luxury buyers under both our D.R. Horton and Emerald Homes brands. In the fourth quarter, homes priced greater than $500,000 were 7% of our homes closed and 19% of our home sales revenue, and for the year, they accounted for 7% of homes closed and 17% of home sales revenue.","Mike?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 20.5%, up 20 basis points sequentially from the third quarter and up 60 basis points from the prior year quarter. The sequential improvement in our gross margin was primarily due to controlling cost increases, while also reducing incentives or raising prices in communities where we are achieving our targeted absorptions.","In the current housing environment, we expect our gross margins to continue to remain in a relatively consistent range of 19% to 21%, while balancing pace and price in each of our communities to optimize returns on our inventory investments. We have been able to achieve a gross margin slightly higher than 20% over the last two quarters. We may still experience quarterly fluctuations ranging from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix, purchase accounting and the relative impact of warranty, litigation and interest costs.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","In the fourth quarter, SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 8.8%, flat with the prior year quarter. SG&A expense for the quarter included $15.5 million to write off an acquired trade name that we are no longer using and to increase our legal reserves for a recent court decision which we plan to appeal.","Homebuilding SG&A for the full year improved 20 basis points to 9.3% compared to 9.5% in 2015, as our increased revenues improved the leverage of our fixed overhead costs. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring that infrastructure adequately supports our growth and we expect to further leverage our SG&A in 2017.","Jessica?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Financial services pre-tax income in the fourth quarter was $28 million. For the year, financial services pre-tax income was $89.1 million on $296 million of revenues, representing a 30% pre-tax operating margin. Our financial services profits for the fourth quarter and fiscal year decreased from the prior year, primarily due to an increase in our estimated loan loss reserves in the fourth quarter and increased overhead costs to comply with additional regulations.","94% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the fourth quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 57% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 48% of the mortgage company's volume compared to 50% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company this quarter had an average FICO score of 718 and an average loan to value ratio of 89%.","David?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","During the quarter, our total number of homes in inventory decreased by 9%, a normal seasonal trend after our strongest home closing quarter of the year. We finished the year with 23,100 homes in inventory, of which 1,600 were models, 11,800 of our total homes were spec homes, with 8,300 in various stages of construction and 3,500 completed. Compared to a year ago, we have 17% more homes in inventory, which places us in a strong position at the start of the year to achieve double-digit growth in revenues in 2017.","Our fourth quarter investment in lots, land and development totaled $747 million, of which $467 million was to replenish finished lots and land and $280 million was for land development. For the year, our total investment totaled $2.7 billion, an increase of 23% from 2015. We plan to increase our investments to replenish our land and lot supply in 2017 at a rate to support our expected growth in revenues.","Mike?","Michael J. Murray - D.R.

Consistent with our focus on building strong relationships with land developers, our option lot position has increased 65% from a year ago, while our overall lot position increased 18%. Our 205,000 lot portfolio is a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market and is sufficient lot supply to support solid growth in both sales and closings.","Bill?","Bill W.

We also recorded $11.4 million of inventory impairment charges, the majority of which were in our Southwest and East regions. These charges primarily related to strategic decisions to sell land. We will continue to evaluate our inventories for potential impairment, which may result in future impairment charges, but the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate.","During the fourth quarter, we also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $7.2 million related to one of our operating divisions in our Southeast region.

We will now host questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you please ask one question and one follow-up. Our first question today is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, my first question, just thinking about the job you guys have done on the entry-level and you guys have had a tremendous first-mover advantage there over the last year or two. And as I listen to all the other builders on their conference calls this quarter, almost everybody's talking about entry-level increasing their exposure there, opening new communities. And when I look at your order numbers this quarter, which came in lower than where you've been trending in recent quarters, curious if you're seeing any increased competition there that might have affected that sales pace, maybe some more incentives as calendar reporting quarter builders kind of gear up for some closings there?","With your guidance staying unchanged, it sounds like October bounced back, so any more color you can give on the sales pace and the competition you're seeing on entry-level would be great. Thank you.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Alan, this is David Auld. From the competitive standpoint, I feel like we're as well or better positioned today as we were starting last year. So I think it's a fourth quarter sales number, we just had a lot going on and tough comp the year before, and it put us right in where we thought we'd be for the year. So if we look at October, October looks good, so.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Got it. And I appreciate that David. And then, I think you mentioned, I might have misheard this, but your community count was down about 5% year-over-year, if that was correct? And I know you've been talking about that growth resuming there to something more in the low to mid-single-digit range. So just curious if that came in below your expectations in the quarter and when you would expect to see that inflect positively?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Hi, Alan. You're correct. Our community count was down 5% year-over-year and it was down 2% sequentially. It's one of the hardest things for us to predict, so we don't give formal guidance on community count. As we continue to get more information and we are into November of the year, right now, we expect our community count to be relatively stable versus the current levels, which would infer that it would continue to be down on a year-over-year basis in somewhere of a low to mid-single-digit range like we experienced this quarter.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Alan, this is David, our expectation is double-digit growth, and I can tell you that the operating plan going forward supports the guidance we've given you, so \u2013 and the expectation on them (22:03) next year, so.","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And our targets are all based on an annual basis, so we're really focused on that double-digit growth in revenues and pre-tax profits annually. Quarter-to-quarter, you have some variation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So can you \u2013 the can (22:30) rate normally kind of creeps up in the fourth quarter consistent with what we saw last year, but I'm just trying to tease out labor constraints and all these types of things, because it seems like while you refer to backlog conversion, if you use your units under construction ratio, you're actually coming in a bit lower closings as a percent of units under construction than you normally do. Is there something that's impacting that trend? It seems like you would have had perhaps more units. I'm not sure, if you can just comment on that.","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We hit the high end of our guidance range, so I would say we delivered on what we anticipated and we're excited about the fact we have 17% more homes under construction today going into the year to position us very well to deliver on those targets for 2017. But Q4 was right in line with the guidance we gave.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Oh, no. I'm saying for 1Q.","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","That are 76% to 80% backlog conversion?","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah, (23:37).","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","It's about in line with what we experienced last year and what we expect to do in Q1, which is a nice increase on a year-over-year basis, in terms of absolute units.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Last year Q1, in fiscal 2016, Q1 was a 76% backlog conversion rate and with this implied conversion rate, that would imply high single-digit to low double-digit growth in Q1 versus last year.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Well, I'll follow up on that. But then, I guess, for the order pace, which we look at seasonally for you all, it seems like it came in just a little lighter than your normal seasonality. And I need to see your supplemental today, but certainly compared to 2015, 2014, and 2013, it was a little lower. Was there any one region that was kind of driving that? And I know in your supplemental you'll have that. I just wonder if you could publicly comment on that before the supplemental comes out.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Well, we commented that five of six of our regions were up in terms of those absorptions, and so, really, no, it wasn't really one region that sticks out at all. We're making sure that this time of the year that we're positioning ourselves with our inventory levels and by community to be prepared to deliver on what we're going to do next year and in each community, they deliver the closings that we expected in the quarter, and we're in the position we expected to be to deliver fiscal 2017.","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And the only region we were down in was our Southwest region, which is our smallest operating region. It's only a couple of markets, the biggest one being Phoenix, which we've talked about the last couple of quarters where we're repositioning and are excited about introducing Express into that market, so we do expect our absorption to start to pick up, but this quarter, that was the only region that we saw decline in our absorption. So very excited with what we continue to see across the country.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Just one last question on the orders front or a couple questions on the orders front. Could you give us some \u2013 could you quantify to some degree what October looks like maybe either in percentage terms or versus the fiscal fourth quarter?","And then, when you look at the fiscal fourth quarter, it was the easiest comp that you had of the year and you had some pretty good growth rates the prior quarters. As you look at the market, what do you think was changing versus maybe the last two or three quarters, the growth rates that you posted?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Stephen, with regard to our October sales, we feel really good about our October sales. We were up over the prior year, in line with where we thought we'd be, and it's definitely supporting the outlook we have for the year, in terms of underlying market factors, we're not seeing significant changes. We continue to see both in looking at the numbers as well as talking to field, visiting the field operations, continued strong demand across the brands, and we're not in any way alarmed. We're in fact very encouraged and positive about the way 2017 looks and our positioning for 2017.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, the second question I had for you, your lot option strategy, you put a lot more under option. As you look at moving forward, I assume you'd prefer to continue to do that, but as you look at the market in actuality, what's that market giving you? Can you grow that percentage of options meaningfully in 2017 or was this something that was just opportunistic that came through? And then, could you just talk a little bit about what the trademark was and why that transpired?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Stephen, with regard to the option contracts, we did see tremendous progress we've been making in that program. It's not any one opportunistic situation. It's been market by market, operating division by operating division, working with local developers to improve our option lot portfolio. We made a 65% increase this year over last year. I don't think we'll see that kind of growth going forward in the option position, but I do think we're going to get it closer to a 50\/50 balance from our 55\/45 balance under option today.","I'll let Bill talk to the trade name.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah. And Stephen, with respect to the trade name, this related to one of the acquisitions that we did two or three years ago. We have recently changed over all of those communities to our core brands, to our Horton Express brands. And so, no, we're no longer using that name, and so, we wrote off the remaining balance that we had that had not yet been amortized. So, pretty ordinary course of business as we integrate acquisitions over the years following the acquisition date.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And Stephen, on this lot option program, we're just being good partners for the people that have the ability to put lots on the ground. And when we look at our driving philosophy on flag by flag, month by month absorptions, I mean, that makes underwriting land and lot option contracts a much easier program for the people that have borrowed money to put the lots on the ground. So we're just being nicer and we're going to continue to be nice.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Timothy Daley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hello. This is actually Tim Daley on for Nishu. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is regarding the backlog conversion ratio. So it seemed to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and you're guiding for it to be up in the first quarter 2017 as well. So some of your peers have been mentioning labor shortages being a tailwind \u2013 or a headwind to this metric rather, but it doesn't seem to be the case for you in 4Q and apparently not in 1Q.","I just wanted to dig a little bit into this and mainly regarding the Express versus the D.R. Horton brand communities, just because assuming that the Express communities have a bit quicker cycle times, could you just explain a bit of this mix to us and what do you expect trending into 2017? Thank you.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","So a lot there in that question. Let me try to take some parts of it. Looking at labor, certainly labor is tight across the markets. We feel that our market positioning, the leading market positions that we have give us access to great labor partners, and we're able to provide a lot of work for those. As David mentioned before, running a consistent absorption space community by community helps us in negotiating and giving that labor a secured place to go to work every day.","But we do hear that our guys are working very hard every day to secure adequate labor, provide quality homes, and we monitor our build times brand by brand, and that would be the best way we would have to see if we're having a global impact of labor shortages in our deliveries and we're not seeing our build times really lengthen or cycle times extend for how long it takes us to build a house. So we're very pleased. Our guys are doing a great job and gals doing a great job performing in that regard.","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And Tim, in addition to being very focused on building that option lot position, we have a focus on improving our backlog conversion, and that's what you're starting to see come through. A big part of that is our Express brand, but we're doing better in Horton as well and are going to continue to try to drive a better backlog conversion as we move forward, although there can be some choppiness to that from quarter-to-quarter as well.","Timothy Daley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Just quickly, just to clarify, so was both Express and Horton up year-over-year on a backlog conversion by brands percentage in the fourth quarter?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We don't have that in front of us right now, Tim, but I'll be happy to take a look at it and get back to you.","Timothy Daley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. No problem. Thank you though. And then my second question, just digging a bit into the margin guidance for financial services revenue, seems to be \u2013 it's down year-over-year from 2016 to 2015, and you essentially are expecting it to be flat in 2017. What was the main factor that influenced the reduction year-over-year into 2016 and what gives you the confidence that these margins will stabilize into 2017?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Really, two primary things, Tim. Last year, we saw abnormally high margins in the financial services business as the industry started to price in a lot of the extra costs that were coming related to regulations, and this year, those costs came in. So we saw a significant increase in compliance costs in our business there as we implemented all the new rules and regulations and that certainly impacted our overhead cost there as well.","And then one other big factor for us more specifically, we did have an incremental increase in our reserves for our loan portfolio in fiscal 2016, and in fiscal 2015, we actually had reductions in those reserves. So you had an opposite effect in our overall margins in the business 2015 versus 2016. But really, the run rate of around 30% has been historically a very normal operating range for financial services, so we feel like in fiscal 2017, we should be back about to a normal level.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore. Please proceed with your questions.","Stephen S. Kim - Evercore ISI","Thanks very much. Can you hear me?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah, sure.","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yes.","Stephen S. Kim - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks very much. So yeah, you've reiterated your outlook for double-digit growth, and I guess, I just wanted to make sure, does that include an assumption for ASP growth? And in that vein, I was wondering if you could give us a little more clarity as to whether the community count growth in the quarter was more hampered at high-end communities or lower end communities or were there any particular regions that sort of stand out in terms of where you're having a little bit more of a harder time than others in growing that community count. Thanks.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Stephen, if you look at our guidance for next year, our unit growth, the range there is 8% to 13% growth and the revenue number is at 10% to 14% growth. So there would be very slight assumption of price appreciation which is about what we've seen, very low single-digit at best. So not much, but a little bit. And then the second part...","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah, in terms of our community count, we have seen that decline pretty much across the board, which is what caused our 5% decline on a year-over-year basis, on an average basis. It's in line with what our business plan looks like and we continue to drive better absorptions out of the vast majority of our communities which is why we continue to see our sales improvement and the majority of our business plan in fiscal 2017 is just like 2016. We do expect to continue to drive better absorption out of the majority of our flags.","Express will continue to help us with doing that and the launch and the beginning rollout of Freedom Homes, which is a very similar business model to Express, is going to help as well.","Stephen S. Kim - Evercore ISI","Absolutely. Great. I guess the second question...","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Stephen, it's David Auld. Our long-term goal is double-digit growth. So we are going to be positioning to maximize our returns generating double-digit growth. So the community count is going to balance out. As our absorptions have picked up, it's come down, but as a cycle in the market, we will be adding communities to support that growth.","Stephen S. Kim - Evercore ISI","Great. That's encouraging. With respect to the cycle, I was wondering if you could comment on one other issue which relates to a build-to-order versus more of a spec model approach to the production. We've heard some people say that build-to-order model has certain advantages, I was curious if you could comment on your opinion generally as to the advantages of spec model versus a build-to-order, and if there's any sort of perspective on where we are in the cycle, that might inform your buyers one way or the other.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Well, to me, build-to-order spec depends on where you are in the cycle and what is the biggest constraint in the market. If selling the house is the biggest constraint, then you're going to do whatever the buyers want you to do, and it pushes you into that build-to-order model. But if labor is the biggest constraint, if location and land position is the biggest constraint, then you're trying to create the most efficiency you can and best value you can for the buyer and that is a production start spec model.","And if you look at our margins over the last two years, three years, they're the most stable in the industry. And it's because we are very disciplined in when we start, when we sell and when we close these homes and create the most efficient, maximize the labor trade that we have and that's why we are doing a better job than our competitors out there, so.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Jason A. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. It's Jason in for Mike. I was hoping if you could give us a little more color on the pricing and incentive trends that you saw that occurred through the quarter across the different product lines. How much is your pricing up versus your land and construction cost and which markets do you currently have the most pricing power right now as you're looking across your footprint?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We continue to see a nice increase in our revenues per square foot, Jason. They were up about 4% both year-over-year and sequentially, and our costs both year-over-year and sequentially were only up about 2%. So that is part of the gross margin pickup you're seeing, being offset by slightly higher land costs flowing through. But really, it's across the board, you continue to see our Express price point move up, primarily driven by a change in mix, as we roll in some of those western markets, as I mentioned in the scripted comments, but we do have pricing power out there today, because there's a lack of inventory particularly at those entry-level price points.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And right now, Jason, we continue to see very consistent margins across all of our brands. They're all within a very tight range around our company average, so no major differential in margins, cost or pricing dynamics, really in any of our brands right now.","Jason A. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then, just in terms of the gross margin, obviously, a nice improvement from last year. I wanted to see how much of that was driven by mix from a geographic or a product standpoint. And then, as you have been underwriting new land deals, have you been able to maintain a consistent underwriting standard or have there been any adjustments as you look across the platform?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We really haven't seen a big differentiator in the driver of margin. We've seen kind of general improvement across the platform. As David mentioned before, or Bill, our brands have produced very consistent margins, close to the company average. With regard to our underwriting hurdles, we've maintained the same underwriting hurdles we've had and our primary focus is return on the inventory investment that we'll have in a community and a return of the initial committed capital of 24 months that we've been talking about for a few years now. So we've been able to maintain those disciplines and still invest significantly in replenishing our land and lot supply.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call. The first question I had was just on south central orders being down slightly year-over-year. I was wondering if you can just give us a little bit more color by major city in Texas.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Overall, Texas has been strong for several years now, and especially, Dallas Fort Worth area certainly stands out, continues to be a very strong level. Certainly, the growth rate has moderated versus where we were, but still maintaining at a very strong level.","Our sales in Houston, the second largest in Texas, was up year-over-year. So we've continued to see that at a very strong level, as we continue to move back down the price curve and making sure that we're staying at an affordable level in the Houston market. Austin, San Antonio, the other two major markets also just very solid consistent results, and when you're comparing versus where those cities and where the state of Texas was last year, that's at a very strong level of performance.","John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. And then, if we think about the gross margin, just curious what you're expecting in terms of purchase accounting impact from Wilson.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Very minimal. If you look at our supplemental information, we've had really no quarters more than about a 10-basis-point to 20-basis-point impact and certainly don't expect any more than that going forward as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Please proceed with your question.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning. On the mortgage side, I think you said 57% captured, 48% FHA VA for the company overall, right? Wondering if you can break that out a little bit more on Express. Are you capturing more of the Express buyer? And I know there's been, obviously, some loan limit issues across the country, but is your FHA percentage higher at Express or lower than the company average?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Sure, Jack. The FHA percentage is higher, I don't have a specific number in front of me and I don't have the capture rate for Express in front of me, but I do believe that it's higher than the company average as well. I'll be happy to take a look at that and get back to you after the call.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then, switching over to Freedom, I'd imagine that's a different \u2013 obviously, a different buyer profile. So how are they financing? Is it heavier cash? Is it too soon to tell? Is there anything noteworthy out of sort of the Freedom buyer in terms of how they're paying for their homes?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I think, generally, we're pretty early with that launch to have any kind of generalizations to say what that buyer has been doing. We did see in a lot of our Express communities in Florida a lot of that buyer profile coming in with either very significant down payments, low mortgages or even cash buyers. So we're excited to see how that unfolds, but we'll have to get back with you as we see that happen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Susan Maklari from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Just further on the mortgage market, we saw from the Fed yesterday, their Loan Officer Survey that perhaps there's been some modest or moderate loosening in terms of mortgage lending. Is that something that you would say that you've seen, especially maybe among that Express buyer?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","To the extent there's been any loosening, it's been very modest, really similar to what we said over the last couple of years. Any loosening has been very modest. Nothing that's moved the needle significantly in the market, but we would certainly expect that over time, probably, we continue to see a little bit more loosening, as the economy improves, as the mortgage market continues to improve.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, in terms of thinking about geographic footprint and sort of maybe expanding in certain markets on the back of the Wilson acquisition, just are there any areas that you feel like maybe you're perhaps relatively under-represented in and would be interested in further expanding?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","That's something we look at regularly. We have talked a bit internally that we've been working to improve our operations in the Northeast and feel like we're making good progress there. And over the next couple of years, we think we're going to see some good results there. As well in our Southwest, the Phoenix markets are starting to come back a little bit. So we've been making some more investments there and increasing our community counts there. So we'd expect us to see some pick-up in our Southwest as well.","And beyond that, we look at potential business acquisitions, we look at potential market startups, but we don't have anything new to announce there at the moment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good morning.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Just two things. Curious, first of all, on where we are in the cycle, how you're thinking about managing your land investment. Obviously, I heard your comments about option land, but curious how you're thinking about managing through that at this point.","And then, secondly, you talked about Freedom becoming one-third of the market \u2013 in one-third of your markets by the end of the year. Curious how \u2013 if that is incremental to what you're doing with Express, if that's going to take lots from Express or if we should expect for that price point or that piece of your business to grow even incrementally from where you are with Express?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Well, from the Express, Freedom standpoint, we're not thinking this is just going to replace Express positions. We do believe this Freedom brand is a good vehicle to drive growth and support our double-digit growth across the company. So in the rollout, the flag count, what was the \u2013 I'm sorry, what was the other question?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Cycle. Where we are at in the cycle.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Cycle. Well, I think we've got a good 2017 position for it and in my travels, Mike's travels, Don Horton's travels, the feeling in the market, the attitude, the excitement of our people, 2017 feels like it's going to be a very good year for us.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And beyond that, from a land positioning standpoint, we're replacing lots and we're expanding where we're driving higher returns, and we're going to continue to do that.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","How much of that \u2013 if I could just follow up on that, how much of that is the market and how much of that is that you have positioned yourself optimally to participate in what feels like is the strongest piece of the market? Can you differentiate between that?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","It's not just the Express market that feels good right now. It's the Horton brand feels good. We've gotten a lot better at executing our Emerald offering, product offering. And I guess I spent the month of September driving the Carolinas and looking at our flags and talking to our people. We've got a business plan for the Carolinas. I'll be very surprised if they don't exceed that plan significantly. I say it all the time, it's just good to be us. I don't have a \u2013 obviously, we can't operate in a vacuum, so the overall market is strong. But we are so well-positioned today that it really is just good to be D.R. Horton.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Megan McGrath from MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Good morning. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on the cost side. You mentioned controlling your costs better and that was part of your outperformance on the gross margin. So just curious if you could give any more color on that. Is it pushing back against the suppliers more in terms of price increases or is it more sort of operational in nature? Would love some more color and detail on how you're controlling your costs in this environment.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Well, Megan, what we've been doing is we've been working with national trade accounts. We've been working with suppliers in that regard to optimize our buying efficiencies. We've been with large market shares in many of our markets, most of our markets, we're able to work with labor and get very competitive pricing there. But we're also looking at ways to be more efficient executing a business plan in a neighborhood that drives an absorption rate that allows for the suppliers and the labor partners to be efficient with their business and give us pricing that is reflective of that efficiencies.","At the same time, we've been able to reduce incentives or raise prices once we achieved those absorption paces. And I think those two factors have been very helpful to our margins over the past few quarters. They were very, very, very flat for several quarters in a row and we're starting to see some of the benefit of that execution and that discipline we've had in the field.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful. And I apologize if I missed this, but can you give us an update on the rollout of Express in California?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We're still in the early stages, but certainly are increasing community counts out there, Northern, Southern and Central California. And so, we expect that to be definitely a source of our growth in fiscal 2017.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Very excited about California.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Will Randow from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I just had a couple of follow-ups from prior questions. I guess, first, from a seasonality perspective, gross margin was actually up sequentially in this fourth quarter, and that's not the historical trend where you're typically down 50 bps. So I guess, can you talk about what type of price increases you were able to implement over the past quarter or so to drive that? You mentioned in the prior question, mix, but if you could talk a little bit more about that. And what read-through there is for your 2017 guidance for gross margin. Stated differently, is 20% flat kind of, I'll call it, a low-ball number or how do you think about that?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","So we've been very pleased, as we said in our scripted comments, with what we've been able to do the last couple of quarters. It's really been a cumulative effect of our efforts and really just driving that consistent absorption to be able to increase our margins. So when we look at 2017, we still do expect the biggest driver of our bottom line to be incremental SG&A leverage due to the higher volumes.","But if the spring's good and we continue to meet our and exceed our business plan, then there could be some upside to our gross margin. Where we sit today, we feel comfortable saying it'll be right around that 20% with some quarterly fluctuations that could be in the 19% to 21% range, because there are some things outside of just price and land, lot and labor and materials that can impact our gross margin, which is why we do continue to give you that slightly broader range and stick with around 20% for the full fiscal year. But we'll update that, Will, as we continue to move throughout the year and have better visibility to the spring.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, as a follow-up, if you could hit specifically on \u2013 if you put out what percentage of communities got priced this quarter and also share your inflation trends in the three buckets separately of lumber, labor and land.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","No, Will, we don't really have that information as far as percentage where we raise price. That's managed at the local level. But overall, our revenue per square foot did go up 4.4% on a year-over-year basis and 3.7% on a sequential basis. So we're clearly seeing a fair amount of price appreciation in a fair sample of our communities across our business today. And to the extent that this is there and we got the opportunity to continue to do that or reduce incentives, we'll continue to do that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the spec home versus to-be-built sale question just a little bit, I mean just on an absolute count, it looks like your unsold units are up a little north of 20% year-on-year and on a per community basis, you're probably up maybe closer to 25%. Are you seeing a narrowing of the margin differential between specs and the contract sales to the point where that's what's giving you a lot more comfort to raise your unsold unit counts? Or is this more of a means to keep your labor more occupied and keep the trade base busy with the tightness in the labor market?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","It's more latter, community by community, we manage our inventory levels, manage our production, in order to hit the production schedules and the sales pace that we're expecting going forward and we feel very good about our positioning right now. When we look at our overall units and our completed units, they're right in line with our business plans. In fact, when we look at our aging on those, which some of that information will be in our filings later on, our aging is actually improving, so that's something we monitor very closely as well. So overall, we feel good about our positioning.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And just kind of separately, have you guys talked or been in any sort of partnerships with any of the \u2013 or any single-family rental operators about working with them to whether it's at the tail end of a community's lifecycle, let one of these rental providers come in and buy a group of homes, or partnering with \u2013 maybe doing contracts for a larger chunk of production?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We have not been in any kind of a formal or broad agreement or discussions with anybody about that. I would imagine in some communities we have sold a home here and there, to single-family rental companies of various sizes, whether it's an individual investor or a large public company. But it's not a significant component of our business today nor do we have any national type relationship or regional relationships.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could comment on what you would expect for backlog conversion rates to trend throughout the year if the Wilson acquisition has any impact on that and if just overall you think it will be similar to 2016.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Jade, we really only have good visibility a quarter out on that. So we provided our Q1 conversion, which would be a slight improvement on our conversion versus last year in Q1, and certainly, our goals are to continue to get more efficient and part of that will be to continue to improve our backlog conversion and so that would certainly be part of our goals for the year, but we will only provide the guidance quarter-by-quarter, as we have visibility to the upcoming quarter.","Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","On average selling price, are you expecting it to remain relatively stable mid-$300,000 mark? Or should we expect a downtick mix based on the growth in entry-level and the Freedom initiatives?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Hard one to predict, Jade, but we have seen the ability to continue to move that ASP up in spite of Express being a bigger piece of our business, so as we look forward to 2017, our best educated guess is it will be flat to slightly up.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","David V. Auld - D.R.

Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Office; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our D.R. Horton team finished this year with an outstanding fourth quarter. Pre-tax income increased to $339 million on $3.2 billion of revenue. And our fourth quarter pre-tax operating margin improved 60 basis points to 10.7%. Our sales absorptions continued to improve during this quarter as homes sold increased 19% on a relatively flat community count. This reflects solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands, which are enabling us to expand our product offering and industry-leading market share.","For the year, while demand for new homes across most of our markets remained relatively stable to moderately improved, we generated growth of 30% or greater in both our home sales revenues and home building pre-tax income by successfully leveraging our platform as the nation's largest and most geographically diverse homebuilder. Our consolidated pre-tax income for 2015 increased 38% to $1.1 billion on $10.8 billion of revenue and 36,648 homes closed.","Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pre-tax profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing our returns. During the fourth quarter, we generated $512 million of cash from operations, bringing our total cash generated by operations for the year to $700 million. Our return on inventory, defined as homebuilding pre-tax income divided by average inventory, improved 170 basis points in 2015 to 12.8%. With a sales backlog of 10,662 homes at the end of September; solid sales trends in October; and a well-stocked supply of land, lots, and homes, we are well-positioned for 2016.","Mike?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Net income for the fourth quarter increased to 44% to $239 million or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to $166 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 35% to $339 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $251 million in the year-ago quarter, and homebuilding pre-tax income increased 27% to $302 million, compared to $237 million in the prior-year quarter.","Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 27% to $3.1 billion on 10,576 homes closed, up from $2.4 billion on 8,612 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $288,600, up 3% compared to the prior year due to an increase in our average sales price per square foot.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The value of our net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 22% from the year-ago quarter to $2.5 billion, and homes sold increased 19% to 8,477 homes, while our community count remained relatively flat. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 3% to $289,500. The cancellation rate for the quarter was 27%, down from 28% in the year-ago quarter. The value of our backlog increase 10% from a year ago to $3.1 billion, with an average sales price per home of $295,100, and homes in backlog increased 8% to 10,662 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter was 83%, within the range we guided to on our third quarter call.","Jessica?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","We are experiencing solid demand, revenue growth, and profitability in our D.R. Horton-branded communities, which accounted for the substantial majority of our sales and closings this quarter. Emerald Homes, our brand for higher-end, move-up, and luxury communities, is available in 46 markets across 18 states. In the fourth quarter, homes priced greater than $500,000 accounted for 17% of our home sales revenue and 7% of our homes closed. For the year, homes priced greater than $500,000 accounted for 16% of our home sales revenue and 7% of our homes closed.","Our Express Homes brand, targeted at the true entry-level buyer focused primarily on affordability, is being offered in 48 markets in 15 states, with the significant majority of our Express sales and closings to date coming from Texas, Florida, and the Carolinas. This quarter, Express accounted for 22% of our homes sold, 21% of homes closed, and 14% of home sales revenue. The average closing price of an Express home in the fourth quarter was $191,000. For the year, Express accounted for 18% of our homes sold, 15% of homes closed, and 10% of home sales revenue.","We're striving to be the leading builder in each of our operating markets with all of our brands. And we plan to maintain consistent, broad product diversity over the long term.","Mike?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 19.9%, flat with the third quarter. The consistency in our gross margin this year reflects the stability of most of our markets today and the normalization of housing market conditions. We are raising prices or reducing incentives when possible in communities where we are achieving our targeted absorptions. And we're also working to control cost increases.","All of these factors have enabled our gross margins to stabilize within our normal historical range. Our general expectation for fiscal 2016 is that gross margins will remain relatively stable with fiscal 2015 levels. In the current housing environment, we continue to expect our average home sales gross margin to generally be around 20%, with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21%, due to product and geographic mix and the relative impact of warranty and interest cost. As a reminder, our reported gross margins include all of our interest cost. For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect our home sales gross margin will be in the high 19%s to 20%, consistent with our margins during fiscal 2015, which were in the high 19%s the entire year.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In the fourth quarter, SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues improved 100 basis points to 8.9%, compared to 9.9% in the prior-year quarter. Homebuilding SG&A for the full fiscal year also improved 100 basis points to 9.6%, compared to 10.6% in fiscal 2014, as our increased revenues this year improved the leverage of our fixed overhead costs. We are pleased that our homebuilding SG&A in fiscal 2015 was 40 basis points below our long-standing target of 10%, and we expect further improvement in our SG&A leverage for fiscal 2016.","Jessica?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","Financial services pre-tax income in the fourth quarter increased to $37.3 million from $14.2 million in the year-ago quarter. And for the year, financial services pre-tax income increased to $105.1 million from $45.4 million in fiscal 2014. Increases in our financial services profits for the fourth quarter and fiscal year were primarily due to improved loan sale execution, higher average loan amounts, and leverage of fixed overhead costs. 89% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the fourth quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 52% of our home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 50% of the mortgage company's volume, compared to 42% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company this quarter had an average FICO score of 715, and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","At the end of September, we had 19,800 homes in inventory, of which 1,600 were models. 9,700 of our total homes were spec homes, with 6,300 in various stages of construction and 3,400 completed. Our construction in progress and finished homes inventory decreased by $314 million during the quarter, and our number of homes in inventory decreased by 7%, a normal seasonal trend after our strongest home closings quarter of the year. Our completed specs decreased by 6% during the quarter.","Our fourth quarter investments in lots, land, and development totaled $590 million, of which $305 million was to replenish finished lots and land and $285 million was for land development. Our residential land and lot inventory increased by $54.5 million during the quarter.","David?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","At September 30, 2015, our portfolio consisted of 174,000 lots, of which 118,000 are owned and 56,000 are controlled through option contracts. 67,000 of our total lots controlled are finished with \u2013 of which 33,000 are owned and 34,000 are optioned. Our 174,000 total lots owned and controlled provide us a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market with a sufficient lot supply to support solid growth in sales and closings in future periods.","In 2016, we expect our total owned land and lot inventory balance to be in line with or slightly higher than 2015. And we also plan to increase our optioned land and lot position. In 2015, we invested $2.2 billion in land, lots and development. And in 2016, we expect that our investment level will increase by more than 20%.","Mike?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Our inactive land held for development of $202 million at the end of the year represents 11,100 lots, down 13% from June and down 21% from a year ago. We continue to work through each of our remaining inactive land parcels to improve cash flows and returns, and we expect that our land held for development will continue to decline.","During the fourth quarter, we recorded $5.1 million in land option charges for write-offs of earnest money deposits and due diligence costs for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded $21.2 million of inventory impairment charges, of which $12.2 million were in our East region, and $9 million were in our West region. These charges related to two long-held inactive land parcels that we sold during the quarter and one long-held project in production. Each of these actions resulted in improved returns and redeployment of capital into more productive assets.","We will continue to evaluate our inventories for potential impairment, which may result in future impairment charges, but the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate, as they have in the past. Also, during the fourth quarter, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $9.8 million related to one of our operating divisions in our Southeast region. Our total goodwill balance after this impairment is $87.2 million.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","At September 30, our home building liquidity included $1.4 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $865 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility. We had no cash borrowings and $110 million of letters of credit outstanding on the revolver.","Our gross homebuilding leverage was 36.1%, and our homebuilding leverage ratio net of cash was 25.1%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at September 30 was $3.3 billion. And we have a total of $543 million of senior note maturities in fiscal 2016. At September 30, our shareholder's equity balance was $5.9 billion, and book value per share was $16, up 14% from a year ago.","Based on our solid balance sheet, liquidity, and current and expected levels of profitability and cash flow, our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 28% from the most recent dividend paid to $0.08 per share.","Jessica?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","Looking forward, we would like to highlight some of our expectations for next year. They are consistent with what we shared on our call in July and are based on the current relatively stable to moderately improved market conditions.","In fiscal 2016, we still expect to generate a consolidated pre-tax margin of 10.5% to 11%. We also expect to generate consolidated revenues of between $12 billion and $12.5 billion and to close between 39,500 and 41,500 homes. We anticipate our home sales gross margin for the full year of fiscal 2016 will be in the high 19%s to 20%, with potential quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21%. We estimate that our annual homebuilding SG&A expense will be in the range of 9.2% to 9.4% of homebuilding revenues, with the first two quarters of the year higher than this range and the third and fourth quarters below the range.","We expect our annual financial services operating margin to range from 30% to 33%. We are forecasting our fiscal 2016 income tax rate to be between 35.5% and 36%, and our diluted share count to be approximately 375 million shares. We also continue to expect to generate $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flow from operations.","Our fiscal 2016 results will be significantly impacted by the spring selling season, and we will update our expectations each quarter as our visibility to the spring and the full year becomes clearer. For the first fiscal quarter of 2016, we expect that our number of homes closed will approximate a beginning backlog conversion rate in a range of 75% to 78%. We anticipate our first quarter home sales gross margin will be in the high 19%s to 20%, and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the first quarter to be in the range of 10.5% to 10.9% of revenues.","David?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","In closing, 2015 was our third consecutive year to generate 30% or greater increases in both home sales revenues and homebuilding pre-tax income. While significantly growing the business, we also generated $700 million of positive cash flow from operations. And our annual return on inventory improved 170 basis points to 12.8%. This is a result of the strength of our people and our operating platform, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead.","We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace while continuing to generate positive cash flows and improved returns. We are well-positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet; industry-leading market share; broad geographic footprint; diversified product offering across our D.R. Horton, Emerald, and Express brands; attractive finished lot and land position; and, most importantly, our outstanding team across the country. We'd like to thank all of our employees for their great work and tremendous accomplishments this year, and we look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operations in 2016.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question and answer session. Our first question today is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Wetenhall, your line is now live. Perhaps your phone is on mute. Please pick up your handset.","Collin A. Verron - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Sorry. This is Collin filling in for Bob. Thank you for taking my questions. So prices were up by about 3.4% on a consolidated basis. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what prices were doing on a brand basis and how much of a headwind the change in the product mix was.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","In general, across the board, community-by-community is where we're seeing pricing. On a brand basis, mix is a big factor. On our Express brand, as we've been rolling it out into more markets, the more recent markets we've rolled it into are at a higher ASP. So we have seen an increase in our average ASP in Express, as we've expected to see. On the Emerald brand, again as we're rolling that out across the country, we've seen that have a fair amount of fluctuations from quarter to quarter. But in the current quarter we're in the mid-$500,000 range.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Collin, this will be in the supplemental information we'll put out after the call, but our closing ASP for the quarter on a sequential basis was up across all brands. It was mix that brought the overall down sequentially slightly. And on a year-over-year basis, we were essentially flat in Emerald but up substantially in Express and Horton.","Collin A. Verron - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you. And then as you look forward into 2016, how do you see your portfolio on a brand-by-brand basis kind of as a percentage of total deliveries? And what are your expectations on gross margin for this?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We continue to expect both Express and Emerald to grow as a percentage of the business, as they did this year. As we roll them out into further markets, we would expect by the end of fiscal 2016 that we would have Express into most of the markets that we expect it to be in. And in terms of percentage of revenues, certainly could be nearing the 20% level. And Emerald, in terms of percentage of revenues, would start moving up \u2013 further up into the higher single digits.","Collin A. Verron - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Strong quarter. Good job in the quarter.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Had two questions for you. First of all, it seemed like your cash flow guide was a little low and your cash balance at the end of the year was a little high. By my reckoning, even if your land spend were to increase 25% \u2013 I think you said more than 20% is what you thought \u2013 your cash flow could still be pretty similar to what we saw in 2015, if my numbers are right. And I think you got about $550 million or something that we're looking for in debt paydown next year, which is going to leave your cash balance pretty elevated. So I was curious, first of all, if you could talk about why your cash guidance is sort of so much lower than what you did this year. And then, secondly, sort of where you feel comfortable with your cash balance residing?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","As we look forward \u2013 Steve, this is Bill \u2013 a lot of the level in which we will reinvest or the level in which we will invest depends on what we see in the sales environment in the spring this next year. So at this point, as we look forward, we feel comfortable that a $300 million to $500 million range will occur even with a reinvestment level north of 20%.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's possible we might invest even higher than that if we see sufficient strength in the market or the need. But if we stay at around that 20% level, yes, your calculations are in the ballpark that we could be at the higher end or maybe even above that range on cash flow. But we're certainly in a flexible position, and we'll adjust our investment decisions based on what we see in the market as we get into calendar 2016.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. So my next question relates to M&A. We did an analysis, and it looked like over the last 15 years, that Horton's pretty much \u2013 you guys are the only ones that have really grown your business outside of acquisitions or at least grown your market share outside of acquisitions. And, at the same time, there's a pretty wide gap in price-to-book valuations among the public builders. And my question is, what's your opinion on the M&A opportunity that you see over the next year? And is there any reason you might prefer privates or publics when you look at the opportunity set?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Steve, this is David. We're continuing to look at opportunities. We're in the position we're in because we've been disciplined about it and trying to find the right cultural fit when we do combine. If you look at our history of merger and acquisitions, the culture and fit has typically been more important than the assets that we're acquiring. So we're going to be disciplined and opportunistic. But, yes, we are looking continuously and believe that where we find a good fit at the right price, it's an additive to our company.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks very much, guys. Good job.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","Thank you, Steve.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Thank you, and congratulations on a nice quarter. Just to follow on Steve's question a little bit. You will have a lot of cash sitting on the balance sheet, Bill, even in your scenario and paying down the debt. So if you could talk a little bit about, with that excess cash, what you would like to do with it, and a bit more generally your capital allocation for 2016. You gave the land spend guidance. But where is it happening, and what percentage of these communities are 24 months or less? Is that still a big focus for you? And just where you expect that community growth to be next year?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","The level of community growth.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Steve, this is Bill. I'll start at the back end. We are still working with our 24-month cash return as our base underwriting guidelines. And vast majority of the land we're buying will fit within that. We're certainly in a flexible position, and occasionally strategically we might go outside that box. But vast majority of the time we're staying within 24-month cash return.","In terms of community count growth, we've stated we expect it to be relatively flat to slightly up. Low to mid-single digits would be probably the top end of the growth expectations. Really, we're looking across our business. We've seen significant increases in the Southeast over the last couple of years, but we're seeing a few markets perhaps starting to show some signs of life further north, and in the Southwest as well, that perhaps we could \u2013 it may be time to show some growth there. So really looking across the breadth of our business.","As we look at our cash flow expectations for the year, of course, we did announce an increase in our dividend, a 28% increase in that, so that's already out there as far as the use of our cash. We are going to remain flexible and opportunistic around investments in the business. Great position to be in with $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion of cash today heading into the spring. And then we want to see what the spring demand is and decide our level of reinvestment in the business there, but still feel comfortable with that and still be able to generate $300 million to $500 million of free cash flow next year.","The debt maturities of $543 million are certainly a priority for us. Again, flexible position. We certainly have the cash to be able to pay it all in cash if we were to so choose. Our current expectations is that we would refinance a portion of that and pay off a portion of that in cash, so that our net balance would decrease a bit. Past that, really, our mantra is remain opportunistic while remaining disciplined. And all things could be on the table, but we want to keep our options open.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks. Very thorough there. And then if you look at what all the other builders have been talking about, the labor, the costs, et cetera, maybe you all could frame how much costs are up year over year, both labor and on the land side. And then just what you're seeing on the labor side. Some of your peers have said they expect it to get a lot worse before it gets better, and what you all are seeing and how you're going to offset it moving forward.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","Stephen, this is the first quarter that we did see, on a year-over-year basis, our revenues tick up in \u2013 per square foot \u2013 in excess of our stick-and-brick costs, which would be both our labor and materials. Our revenues per square foot were up about 4%, whereas our stick-and-brick per square foot was up 3.5%. The sequential trend was good as well. Our revenues outpaced our stick-and-brick. You didn't see that flow through as an increase to our margin because we do have slightly higher land costs today. But, as we mentioned, our margin's stable in spite of higher land, labor, and material costs, and we were able to offset the majority of that with pricing this quarter. So we've been working on that this entire year to get that back in check, and happy to say that we got there by the end of the year.","In terms of labor, I mean, David will probably speak to how we feel about labor overall.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Stephen, David. No question; labor is tight. The reports coming out of other builders \u2013 I mean, we're not immune to it. I think we have mitigated it by having the best operating team in the industry. And the relationships that our people have with vendors, suppliers put us at the front of the line. So it flows back to the time with a company, time in a market.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","And what I believe is the number one competitive advantage, which is our people.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","David, do you expect it to get worse in 2016?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think it's going to get any better.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","I do think we're approaching \u2013 the market continues to improve. The latest jobs report did show 30,000-plus construction jobs being added. Why it's taken this long to start adding those jobs I'm not sure, but hopefully that's a trend of something that's going to take place. And we will re-staff our production so that we get back to a normal national building environment.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","All right. Thank you.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, sir.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to go back to some of the market discussion, and I think, Bill, you mentioned there may be some areas that are showing some signs of life and maybe deserve some more investment. So I guess if you guys could give us a little more color on where some of those markets are and just the overall cadence that you're seeing in some of the key markets in your footprint, because you've described it as relatively stable to slightly improving. I think some of your peers have seen a bit more volatility as of late. So any color there? And also if you could quantify October sales being solid, what's that actually mean relative to what we were seeing this quarter?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Mike, going backwards, October sales were \u2013 we're happy with our October sales level in line with our expectations, but as we always said, one month does not quarter make. And looking at individual markets, we've been very happy with our Texas performance, which is our South Central external region, primarily. Continue to see good performance in the Southeastern part of the country. And as (31:14) in the communities we invested in there, we've built a great presence. And perhaps some of the markets out west in Arizona are starting to show some encouraging signs as well. But it's hard to really quantify market by market when we look at this.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Okay. And then second question, just around the goodwill impairment. So in the Southeast, just curious, is that related to a legacy position, or is that one of the more recent acquisitions? Can you talk about the factors that drove that and if there are any other implications we should be thinking about on a go-forward basis, whether it's what that means for margins or sales out of that region?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That related to one division within our Southeast region. That was the Huntsville market that we entered as a result of the Breland acquisition in 2012, and that was as a result of some challenging market conditions in Huntsville. And I don't look for any read-through to any other markets or margin effect anywhere else.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","And Huntsville is a relatively small division in terms of our overall platform.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Ken.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, David, kind of wrapping up this year, and I wonder if you could comment. I mean, obviously, under your tenure, you kind of just started disclosing information a little differently than Don did in the past. The question I have for you is about seasonality in your business, because you guys, with the release that you give after this conference call, we can see kind of the trailing-three-year seasonality in orders. And when you look at your year-over-year results, what it shows is increasing absorption. But that actually occurred all in the first quarter seasonally. You didn't go down like you normally did.","Can you talk to or kind of address if, when you think about the cadence of your business, which I assume you look at it seasonally, do you still expect that kind of slightly higher absorption rate, which is new the last few years, to unfold in kind of that first quarter? Or do you expect it to go down like it did historically, about 20%? Because it seems like you guys kind of changed the cadence of the business a little bit in recent years.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","Yeah. We would still expect to see normal seasonality in the business, which would infer a decline in Q1. Sales \u2013 we don't guide to sales for a reason. It's really hard for us to estimate what our sales are going to be. We did give guidance for the full year on closings. So clearly we have to sell at least that many homes, if not more. So we do feel like we're going to close between 39,500 homes and 41,500 homes for the full year. But, as you saw in Q4, and as we've talked about, we're not going to be at a 30% growth rate moving forward.","We did that for three years straight, and \u2013 going to be hard to do that again. But we do think our consolidated revenues will be up 10% to 15%. And Q1's typically our softest quarter, and we do expect to see normal seasonality in Q1 and really not know what the year holds until we get to the spring.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Ken, this is David. I'll also say that weather did impact kind of the process last year. And we had a great year because we have great people. But tight labor and weather conditions are a reality in this industry. So that kind of made some things shift around a little bit. But, yes, we're a seasonal business. We plan to build, sell, and close based upon what the historical seasons have been.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good. And I appreciate that. I just was asking because the last two years in the first quarter, your pace actually went up modestly. So I just wanted to understand how you thought about that. But it sounds like it's somewhere between what we had in the last few years and the usually down 18% sequential pace, somewhere in that broad range.","Can you talk \u2013 David, you said you don't expect labor to get better, but I mean you are, I believe, the largest homebuilder. And it would seem that that issue would impact you most. But closings, et cetera, et cetera, you've been able to navigate it. I mean, is it that you're paying people more, perhaps? Because it really \u2013 all the smaller builders' issues would seem to be magnified. Can you just explore that a little bit more, because it really does seem to require a little more explanation how the largest person is navigating this issue while the smaller guys can't do it?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think we're paying people more. Actually, I think we got a lot of efficiencies and benefit from our overall market share and presence. You guys are going to get tired of me saying this, but it really is the people. We got the \u2013 one of the toughest markets, toughest weather conditions, toughest labor markets, is our Dallas-Fort Worth area. And those two guys, because they have been in the market for 20-plus years, because they have a direct relationship with the vendors and suppliers, make a call and get people to show up. And you just can't put a \u2013 you can't quantify that and put it into a model.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","And they're both also perfect examples of where local market share and building specs on a consistent basis really comes into play. So that, coupled with their experience is really why we think we've been able to not have that show up as much in our results as it has in others'.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","But it's not just Dallas-Fort Worth. We've got people like that in every market. So.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And could you just comment on the gross margin between spec and backlog, if that's relevant now? Thank you very much.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","A word about our normal relationship between spec and overall. Spec margins are a bit below \u2013 100, 200 basis points below the company average, which is about normal.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","They were about 200 basis points below build jobs.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Below build jobs, yeah.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the company average is slightly...","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Much closer, probably about that.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","Yeah. We feel about 70% of what we closed this quarter was a spec. So the margin we reported is essentially a spec margin.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael J. Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and also nice quarter.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Michael.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning. Thank you.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","Thanks, Mike.","Michael J. Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question I just had was on guidance, and just wanted to make sure \u2013 it appeared that essentially you reiterated all the components of fiscal 2016 guidance with perhaps the exception of giving a little more clarity to SG&A. Before, I think you said below 9.5% of consolidated revenue, and now you're saying 9.2% to 9.5%. Do I have that right?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","Mike, we actually on our last call only gave the consolidated pre-tax margin as official guidance. We had some sidebars as we got into the Q&A. But our official guidance in July was just for the 10.5% to 11.5% consolidated pre-tax margins, so we did reiterate that on this call. And then our SG&A guidance for fiscal 2016, which is \u2013 this the first time we're giving what we would consider to be our official SG&A guidance \u2013 is for 9.2% to 9.4% of homebuilding revenues.","Michael J. Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And then \u2013 I appreciate that. I think that sounds right. Yeah, some of that was on the Q&A, I guess. And just to be clear also on the SG&A. You're talking about the homebuilding revenue inclusive of land sales. Is that right? And that's also how you're describing it for 1Q? Is there a way for us to get a sense of what you're anticipating land sales to be?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","No. As you indicated to me earlier today, our land sales are choppy, and we do know that. But when we look at our SG&A, we look at it all in, as a percentage of our total homebuilding revenues. And that lines up with our income statement, with \u2013 \"total homebuilding revenues\" is actually our line, but is inclusive of both home sales revenue and land sales revenue.","Michael J. Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Yeah. Just \u2013 obviously creates a slight incremental challenge with modeling, but I guess we can talk about that later. Also, on the fiscal 2016 outlook, I think, Bill, you mentioned expecting community count to be up low to at most mid-single. I would presume, given that it looks like, at least from a trend perspective, Express 4Q activity stronger than the full fiscal year, that that would \u2013 that the fiscal 2016 should have a higher proportion of Express versus 2015. Would that then result in sales pace improvement of at least 5% to 10%, just from that continued shift alone?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Obviously with our guidance of 10% to 15% revenue growth with low to mid-single digit community count, where we are anticipating incremental absorption improvement, and part of that \u2013 one driver of that \u2013 is the continued rollout of Express. As it has been this year, as a contributor to some absorption improvement, we do expect further absorption improvement driven by Express, as well as our efforts to continue to be more efficient across all of our brands across all of our communities in the company.","Michael J. Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just one last one if I could. The land investment north of 20%, obviously a pretty strong number, and certainly we're not at mid-cycle levels yet. Although I would think that at this point, at least from your peers, maybe not growing that incremental investment as aggressively, not all have reported that yet. But when you talked about the 20%-plus growth, is that reflective of more development versus finished lot type of takedowns, or just from a bigger-picture perspective, you're also talking about lots growing, I would assume, not at the same rate as the 20%-plus. So just kind of give us a sense of what's the drivers there, because obviously there are other builders out there that are maybe taking a slightly \u2013 I would presume \u2013 slightly more conservative view as you get deeper into the cycle.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. Mike, yes, there is a distinguishment we need to make between the level of investment we're going to make versus the level of our inventory balance \u2013 our land inventory balance on our balance sheet. We do expect to grow our spending, our investments, by more than 20%. We do expect some increase in our development spend in that expectation and then some increase in our absolute spending for land acquisition. Our percentage of our land acquisition spend has been pretty consistent, and around half of that spend has been for finished lots. And we would expect that to continue, especially as we increase our option lot position and continue to add to that and buy finished lots there. So there's still a very strong element of finished-lot purchases in that. But even with an increase in our spending or investment level of greater than 20%, we only expect our balance sheet \u2013 our land inventory balance to be relatively stable to slightly grow. So what we're essentially doing is replenishing our lot position, and that's kind of what we've been doing for the last year to two years, is essentially replenishing our owned lot position, but to do that at an increased closing level requires an increase in investment.","Michael J. Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. That's very helpful. Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. I wanted to ask about the backlog conversion ratio, which you guided for, for the first quarter. I think you said 72% to 74%, kind of low to mid-70%s.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","Nishu \u2013 Nishu, hang on a second. We guided to 75% to 78%.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, okay. Sorry. Sorry, 75% -","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","I just wanted to make sure everybody got that and didn't write down your 72% to 74%.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sure, sure. No, no, appreciate that. You folks have had eight quarters in a row of your backlog turnover ratio being higher on a year-over-year basis. I mean, that's a terrific achievement in light of the pressure that the industry has been facing and obviously have been discussed here in the Q&A already. This would be the first quarter where you would be down on a year-over-year basis. So I just wanted to understand that a little bit better. Is this just a reflection of the issues that you were discussing, the delivery and the labor challenges? Are you changing in terms of the sort of units that you're building \u2013 less specs, maybe? Just wanted to understand the drivers of it being lower year over year.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Nishu, I think you hit on it. We did touch on some of the factors that are affecting us. There was \u2013 it rained in a lot of places. Not making any excuses for that, but we still looking for next year, the full year, to revenues to be up 10% to 15%. And we're going to see our first quarter conversion rate, we believe, to be a little lower than it was last year.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","I think there were 24 inches in -","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","\u2013 24 inches in our major markets in Texas in May. And so we lost about two months of starts, and that's \u2013 we were able to drive the conversion at the end of the year because those houses were started. But it \u2013 right now, today, if we had more houses, we'd be at a higher conversion rate.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","First quarter was our lowest quarter (46:09)","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. So then it's more temporary issues as opposed to changes to operating procedures, such \u2013 let's say building less specs or (46:20)","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Absolutely.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Our primary goal is to continue to improve the efficiency metrics of this industry and of our company. And conversion rate is a major goal for us.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Which is why it was improved eight quarters in a row.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Appreciate that. And then the second question \u2013 and, Jessica, I won't say the number because I'll probably get it wrong again \u2013 but (46:46) I think you guided to in the low 30%s on a margin basis. A lot of folks expected at the beginning of this year the margins in that business, being very high for them, to converge back to normal. From your 4Q, which was very strong, it certainly doesn't look like that's the case. But \u2013 so what are you thinking about when you guide to the financial services margins being down year over year? It doesn't seem like any of the momentum has been lost there. Is that just a view that, look, longer term this doesn't look to be sustainable? Are you seeing anything in your business now which led to the low-30%s expectation? And, yeah \u2013 so what are your thoughts behind that?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","Sure. A couple of things, Nishu. Our financial services team has done an outstanding job the last couple of years \u2013 well, and really longer than that \u2013 but the last few years they've seen outsized operating margins as what we would've expected from them historically. They continue to have just better loan sale execution and higher loan amounts this year, which helped them leverage their SG&A better.","But we also had a slightly unusual item this year in terms of a $10 million reduction in our loan loss reserve. We were actually successful in some negotiations with mortgage purchasers for amounts lower than we originally anticipated. So we did lower our reserve amount in Q4, and the full-year amount was $10 million. So that was a slight pickup to their margin this year, which we aren't expecting to repeat in 2016, coupled with \u2013 we just don't know if we're going to be able to sustain the higher operating margins that they've been running for the last two years. So they'll continue to operate as efficiently as they can and do as well as they can. And as we move throughout the year we'll update that guidance if that 30% to 33% doesn't look right.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Appreciate the thoughts.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good morning.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good morning. Two things. First of all, I think, Jessica, you pointed out that the revenues per foot ahead of the cost per foot, ex-land, for the first time in a while. I guess the two questions in that \u2013 what's changed within that, and is that sustainable? That's the first thing I wanted to ask.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","We'll see if it's sustainable. We're guiding to essentially flat gross margins next year. So that would infer that we do expect labor to continue to be a challenge. But our goal next year is going to be to continue to keep those in line. If we're able to get more pricing and improve our margin as we move throughout the spring, we will. But where we sit today in November, we feel pretty comfortable that we can offset any labor and material and land increases with our sales prices.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Now, the progress with sales price kind of moderated through the year, and I understand there's moving parts within mix. Is there a belief that with a better demand environment, there's more of an opportunity with price in 2016 than you experienced within 2015?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In an improved demand environment, I would say yes. But where demand conditions are today, we feel comfortable at our absorptions and our community levels. And so we have a kind of a balance, if you will, an equilibrium, at the community level we're comfortable guiding to right now.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","And then in terms of our overall ASP, obviously, as Express continues to become a bigger mix, we're not going to expect our ASP to continue to climb at the same rate, because we do have mix impact impacting that as well.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And then the second question \u2013 I appreciate \u2013 you commented you want to wait to see the spring to determine some of the land spend and some of the overall spend, also talking about growing 20%. I guess from a bigger strategic picture at this point of the cycle, are you still trying to grow the overall inventory, or are you trying to match the spend to what you sell, or are you trying to spend a little less than what you sell? Where are you at this point of the cycle in terms of your investment relative to what you're selling through?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say we still think that there's legs left in this cycle. I mean, we're not even close to what is a historical demand. So we're trying to be very judicious and value the capital we have. So I'd say some kind of balance. One quarter, it may look like we're \u2013 didn't buy enough. The next quarter it may look like we bought too much. But it's a balanced approach to drive efficiency throughout the entire company. We don't want too much land. We don't want too little land.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think, Eric, to follow-on what David said that we would expect that to be at a replenishment level to slightly higher. But all the while looking to be more efficient with our capital. More efficient with our inventory to drive a higher turn. A higher backlog conversion, a higher rollover of our assets to be better stewards of that capital. To drive the return on our invested inventory up.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","That's why one of our major goal is to substantially increase our option land position where we're at a balance today at 68% owned. Obviously, our long term, we'd love to be much closer to 50%\/50% split there, and so to the extent that we can increase our option position much more efficient with our capital, lower risk as well, we'd like to do that. So it's still a goal.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Susan Maklari from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","Good morning, Sue.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","You guys have talked a lot about how you have already expanded Express and sort of the future of that brand. And yet it sounds like the bulk of that business remains focused in Texas and the Carolinas and Florida. As you think about it moving further and getting into increasingly more markets, should we expect that the core will remain focused in those areas, or to what extent do you expect to diversify to these other markets?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we opened 24 new markets with Express in fiscal 2015. That puts us in 48 markets out of the 70-plus we operate in. So -","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Florida was a major entrance this year. And as we add to other markets, we're starting to add markets in the West now, that's adding to our presence. That starts to change the mix a bit, and we'll diversify a bit from where we are. But I think still our long-term expectation is really Texas across the Southeast including the Carolinas and Florida will still remain the core of Express, might even remain the majority of our overall volume. But we do continue to diversify as the rollout continues.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then you saw very strong order trends in the Southeast. Was a lot of that driven by Express? Or can you talk a little bit about what you saw there?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","A lot of it was driven by Express, Sue. We've opened a lot of new communities because of a lot of new investments all across the Southeast in all of our brands. So we saw a very nice pickup in our absorptions, coupled with an increase in our community count that really drove their order increase this quarter.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","But when we look at our home sales revenue on a year-over-year basis across all three of our brands, all three of our brands increased at a strong double-digit pace. Clearly, as we've expanded Express and Emerald, they've grown at a higher percentage as we rolled them out. But all three of our brands grew at a strong double-digit pace.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Please proceed with your question.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Wondered if you could put a little context around the absorptions? Obviously, you've seen a companywide improvement. But when I think about Express versus Horton versus Emerald, how should we think about community absorption per brand? Is it like 8-4-2? Is it 10-6? (55:27) Is there a way you can sort of, rule of thumb, give us some context on how to think about that, as a follow-up to the prior question given Express is driving such order growth and absorption improvement?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","It's less about brand than it is about return on investment and the pace of absorption to drive the highest return. It's a balance of margin, sales base, and deliveries. So that's something we look at project by project, market by market to maximize the return to the company and the shareholders.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thanks.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","We have Horton projects doing significant absorption. And it really is all across the board.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. So community by community, not brand by brand?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Correct. Yes, sir.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then, just as a follow-up to some of the \u2013 it looks like you're going to probably delever further next year. You talk about a cash number that sounds conservative, potentially, next year, and then, you're increasing your option versus your owned to mix presumably as well. Saw the dividend raised this quarter. Where is the right leverage ratio? I know you've bought back stock in the past to offset some dilution. What do you think about buybacks? Just kind of where do you think the balance sheet and capital looks like sort of a year from now from a leverage ratio, and what else do you do with your cash?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We do expect incremental improvement in our leverage, I think, as we move each year into the cycle, I think we think that's prudent, and a prudent management of our balance sheet. So what that gives us is a lot of flexibility. And it gives us the potential to be very opportunistic. So, to the extent that a great opportunity comes along, we've got of plenty of room on our balance sheet and plenty of liquidity to be able to take advantage of it.","So, from our standpoint, that's really what we're trying to maintain: this flexibility and the ability to be opportunistic. I talked earlier in one of the responses to the previous question about our priorities for cash flow around we increased our dividend, we're going to continue to invest in the business, and we'll adjust that based on what we see next year. We do expect incremental reduction in our debt. And then past that, our mantra is opportunistic but disciplined. We certainly have done some limited share repurchases in the past. I would say that's not near the top of our list right now given the opportunities that we see to invest in our business and generate a strong return in our business.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","At this point in the cycle, we believe having flexibility and liquidity is a good thing and will give us an opportunity to take advantage of investments that \u2013 we'll be the only one bidding. So we like that environment.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. You guided to 375 million on the share count next year. Is that the right number?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","Yes.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Tomasello - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. This is actually Ryan Tomasello on for Jade. Thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to the labor costs, I was wondering if you could provide a bit more color on what trades in particular that you have been seeing the most pressures in, and if these labor constraints have been more concentrated to certain markets than others.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Ryan. It's David. It depends on the market \u2013 framing labor, Sheetrock labor, electricians, A\/C. I mean, every major trade in certain markets have been stretched very, very tight. So \u2013 this is the last weather comment I'll make, that when you can't start a house for two months, concrete, labor, and material becomes very, very tight. So it's a market by market, trade by trade.","Ryan Tomasello - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great, thanks. And then just on the land market, you guided to the 20%-plus incremental spending. Can you just give a bit more color on the growth in the level of competition? We've heard certain peers saying that competition has been decreasing slightly. What markets are currently more attractive than others, and have the labor constraints caused you to change your underwriting on new land purchases? Thanks.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","The labor's not going to impact our \u2013 I mean, we're going to deal with labor, and we're better positioned to deal with it than anybody else. So that's an advantage to us. Where we're going to invest, where we're looking at, it changes quarter to quarter. And right now today, we have markets we're underinvested in and are working hard to drive \u2013 to get a level of investment there that allows us to grow at what we think the market will give us.","Ryan Tomasello - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Susan Berliner from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Susan A. Berliner - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications","Good morning.","Susan A. Berliner - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just one quick question, and, Jessica and Bill, you may laugh. But after reporting a quarter like this and seeing your ratios, can you update us with your conversations, at least, with S&P and Fitch with regards to an IG rating?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Certainly. We have active communications with them, in-person meetings with them as well. And certainly the progress that we're making in our business, the improvement we're showing in our liquidity and in our leverage, are all positive things that rating agencies love to see. From our standpoint, if we continue to improve and continue to show the progress and do what we've said we're going to do, we certainly believe that our metrics and the way we're operating our company are consistent with an investment-grade rating.","The actual decision and timing of when that will be is certainly out of our hands. From our standpoint, though, the decision point or the goal of being investment grade isn't the end. What our goal is, is to be in position, and once it has been achieved, that it can be sustained over the long term through the cycles. And so, from our standpoint, when it happens doesn't really matter. It will happen, and it will be sustained.","Susan A. Berliner - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great.

In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on the call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our D.R. Horton team finished the year strong. Pretax income for the fourth quarter increased 9% to $660 million on $5 billion of revenue and our pretax operating margin was 13.1%. For the year EPS increased 13% to $4.29 per diluted share and consolidated pretax income increased to $2.1 billion on $17.6 billion of revenues. Our consolidated pretax margin for the year was 12.1%. We closed 56,975 homes this year, an increase of over 5,000 homes or 10% from last year. Our homebuilding return on inventory was 18.1% and our return on equity was 17.2%. These results reflect the strength of our operational teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands.","Our homebuilding cash flow from operations in 2019 was $1.4 billion. Over the past five years, we have generated approximately $4 billion of cash flow from homebuilding operations while growing our homebuilding revenues by more than $9 billion or 117% and our earnings per share by 186%. During these five years in addition to organically growing the business, we have invested approximately $1 billion on acquisitions and returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while reducing homebuilding debt by $1.3 billion.","As a result, our return on equity increased by 540 basis points, while our homebuilding debt to capital ratio decreased by less than half of its level five years ago. Our strategic focus is to continue consolidating market share while growing both our revenues and pretax profits, generating strong cash flows and returns, and maintaining a flexible financial position with a conservative balance sheet that includes an ample supply of homes lots and lands to support growth and a good October sales base, we're well-positioned as we begin 2020.","Mike?","Mike Murray","Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 11% to $1.35 per share compared to $1.22 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 8% to $505 million compared to $466 million. Our consolidated pretax income increased 9% to $660 million in the fourth quarter from $608 million, and homebuilding pretax income increased 3% to $594 million from $578 million. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 10% to $4.8 billion on 16,024 homes close, up from $4.4 billion on 14,674 homes closed in the year ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $299,500, flat with the prior year.","Bill?","Bill Wheat","Net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 14% to 13,130 homes, and the value of those orders was $4 billion, up 16% from $3.4 billion in the prior year. Our average number of active selling communities increased 9% from the prior year and was flat sequentially. Excluding the builders we acquired earlier this year, our fourth quarter net sales orders were up 11% and our average number of active selling communities increased 2%. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $302,300, up 1% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the fourth quarter was 23%, down from 26% in the same quarter last year.","Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 21%, up 70 basis points sequentially from the June quarter. The sequential increase in our gross margin from June to September exceeded our expectations and was primarily due to lower sales incentives. Based on today's market conditions, we currently expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter to be consistent with the fourth quarter, subject to possible fluctuations due to product and geographic mix, as well as the relative impact of warranty, litigation and purchase accounting.","Bill?","Bill Wheat","In the fourth quarter, SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 8.5% compared to 8.4% from the prior year quarter. The increase in our fourth quarter SG&A year-over-year was primarily due to compensation accruals related to increases in our stock price. For the full year, homebuilding SG&A was 8.7% compared to 8.6% in 2018. We did not achieve SG&A leverage this year after we lowered our revenue growth expectations in our fiscal first quarter and worked to align our inventory levels and operations with our revised expectations throughout the year. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring our infrastructure adequately supports our growth and we expect to improve our SG&A rate in 2020. ","Jessica? ","Jessica Hansen","Financial services pretax income in the fourth quarter was $61 million and the pretax operating margin was 44.8%. For the year, financial services pretax income was $166 million on $442 million of revenues, representing a 37.6% pretax operating margin. 97% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 63% of our homebuyers.","FHA and VA loans accounted for 48% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume. Borrowers originating loans with the DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 720 and an average loan to value ratio of 89%. First time homebuyers represented 50% of closings handled by our mortgage company, up from 49% in the prior year quarter, reflecting our continued focus on offering homes at affordable price points for entry level buyers.","Mike?","Mike Murray","We ended the year with 27,700 homes in inventory, essentially flat with last year 16,000 of our total homes were unsold, of which 5,200 were completed. Our fourth quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $990 million out of which $610 million was to replenish finish lots and land and $380 million was for land development. For the year, we invested $3.7 billion in lot, land and development.","David?","David Auld ","At September 30th, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 307,000 lots of which 40% were owned and 60% were controlled. 30% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 54% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. We continue working to increase our lot position being developed by third parties by supporting the growth of Forestar\u2019s national lot manufacturing platform and expanding our relationships with lot developers across the country. Our current lot portfolio includes an ample supply of lots for homes at affordable price points and continues to provide a strong competitive advantage.","Mike?","Mike Murray","Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary is a publicly-traded residential lot manufacturer, now operating in 51 markets across 20 states. At September 30th, Forestar\u2019s lot position consisted of 38,300 lots of which 29,700 are owned and 8,600 are controlled through purchased contracts. 79% of Forestar\u2019s owned logs are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under the master supply agreement.","Forestar exceeded its guidance for this year by delivering 4,132 lots and generating $428 million of revenue for its fiscal year ended September 30th. Forestar expects to deliver 10,000 lots and generate $750 million to $850 million of revenue in fiscal 2020 and to deliver 12,000 lots and generate $900 million to $1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2021. These expectations are for Forestar\u2019s standalone results.","Forestar's making steady progress in building its operational platform and capital structure to support its significant growth plans. During the quarter, Forestar issued approximately $6 million of its common stock in a public offering. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $100 million which will help support Forestar's future growth. After the issuance, D.R. Horton\u2019s ownership percentage of Forestar decreased from 75% to approximately 66%.","Forestar plans to opportunistically access the capital markets as necessary to provide additional capital for long-term growth. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and is targeting a long-term net debt to capital ratio of 40% or less.","We are excited about Forestar\u2019s growing operating platform and the value this relationship will create over the long term for both D.R Horton and Forestar\u2019s shareholders.","David?","David Auld","DHI Communities is our multifamily rental company, focused on suburban garden-style apartments with current operations primarily in Texas, Arizona and Florida.

During 2019, DHI Communities sold two multifamily rental properties for $133,400,000 and recorded a gain on sale of $51.9 million. DHI Communities\u2019 total assets were $204 million at the end of the year. We expect DHI Communities assets to increase significantly in 2020 as its pipeline of multifamily rental projects grows. We also expect to sell two rental properties in 2020.","Bill?","Bill Wheat","Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet strength and operating results have increased our flexibility and we are utilizing our strong position to enhance the long-term value of the Company. During fiscal 2019, cash generated by homebuilding operations was $1.4 billion, bringing our cumulative cash generated from homebuilding operations for the past five years to approximately $4 billion. At September 30th, we had $2.2 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1 billion of unrestricted home building cash and $1.2 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facility.","Our consolidated leverage improved 100 basis points from a year ago to 25.3%. And homebuilding leverage improved 440 basis points to 17%, the balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at fiscal year-end was $1.9 billion and we have $500 million of senior note maturities due in the next 12 months.","Subsequent to year-end, we issued $500 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2024.

As a result of our share repurchases this year, we reduced our outstanding share count by 2% compared to a year ago.","The Company's remaining stock repurchase authorization at September 30th was $895.7 million with no expiration date. Based on our financial positions and outlook for fiscal 2020, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 17% to $0.175 per share. We currently expect to pay dividends of approximately $250 million in fiscal 2020.","Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Looking forward to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion and our homes closed to be in a range between 12,100 and 12,400 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter to be approximately 21% and homebuilding SG&A in the first quarter to be around 9.5% of homebuilding revenues. Based on today's market conditions, our expected growth for fiscal 2020 is still in the mid to high single digit percentage range for both consolidated revenues and homes closed. We currently expect to generate consolidated revenues for the full year of $18.5 billion to $19 billion, and to close between 60,000 and 61,000 homes.","We are forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2020 of approximately 25%, and we expect to reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 2% at the end of fiscal 2020, compared to the end of fiscal 2019.

We are well-positioned to do so with our conservative balance sheet, broad geographic footprint, affordable product offerings across multiple brands, attractive finished lot and land position, and most importantly, our outstanding experienced team across the country. We congratulate the entire D.R. Horton team on closing the most homes in a year in company history, and we thank you for your hard work and accomplishments. We're incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations in 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","John Lovallo","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first of all, the cash flow from operations target of greater than $1 billion could be interpreted as being somewhat conservative, given the 2019 performance of $1.4 billion, and what appears to be set up here for improved profitability in fiscal year \u201820. What do you see kind of as the biggest variables here? And is there any reason that you can point to why cash flow would be lower on a year-over-year basis?","Bill Wheat","John, we expect to generate consistently strong cash flow in excess of $1 billion. Year-to-year that number can move around a little just depending on timing of investments and homebuilding, and given that were early in the year and we want to see how demand goes through the year that could impact our investment levels in the business. So, a greater than $1 billion is certainly a solid range and that gives us flexibility then as we move through the year and we\u2019ll update that estimate as we need to.","John Lovallo","Okay. That makes sense. And then, last year, I think, you guys outlined potential acquisition target range of $400 million to $600 million. How are you guys thinking about that heading into 2020 and what does the pipeline look like?","Bill Wheat","We\u2019re still actively looking at some opportunities, John. But, we're very selective and wanted to be very targeted in what we're doing there. So, while we're looking at some, they\u2019re very hard to predict when they are actually going to happen. This year, we don\u2019t have that same level of clarity to a number that we had at this time last year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman and Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Alan Ratner","Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on a strong close to the year. So, my first question, I\u2019ve always kind of thought about the homes and inventory data point that you guys provide is a little bit of leading indicator in terms of how you see the business growing over the next few quarters. And, I think, this is the first quarter in a while where you\u2019ve actually been down a bit on a year-over-year basis. And I'm just curious, as you think about that mid to high single digit growth targets in 2020, should we start to see that number move higher or is there any kind of change in the way you're thinking about having specs on the ground and homes in inventory, and maybe any shifts in demand for to-be-built homes versus spec that would be potentially driving that number lower than I would have suspected?","Bill Wheat","I think, Alan, we're seeing it, similar breakdown between our to-be-builts and our available homes that we have in inventory. But, we're excited, looking at going into this year with a good demand environment and opportunity continue improving our returns and part of the way we\u2019ve talked about last quarter of improving returns is to focus on improving our home inventory turnover. And so, that\u2019s something we're excited about the opportunity to deliver on in fiscal \u201820.","Alan Ratner","And then, I guess, just a follow-up on that but implied there I guess is you are still confident that you can maintain the very high backlog conversion rates that you've delivered in the past and while keeping a lower inventory level, and in total, is that the way to interpret that?","Bill Wheat","I think you will see our inventory level increase from where we are at this point in the year. But, we're looking to be more efficient with the capital. So, we look to see a higher overall turnover rate.","Alan Ratner","Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just ask one more. Investors, obviously, have been very focused on the 10-year treasury yield, which has been climbing off of recent lows off late and still incredibly low levels from an absolute standpoint. But, you mentioned the strong sales environment in October, which obviously coincides with that move up we've seen in recent weeks. How do you see the rate environment today? I mean, is there any -- would you see maybe pull forward from buyers that are trying to jump in before rates continue to move higher? Is it not a concern at all of yours in the marketplace? Any commentary you can give just in terms of what you're thinking about are seeing on the ground from the rate environment would be helpful.","David Auld","I think, anything that impacts affordability is always going to be a concern. I will say, when you look at what drives homebuilding, which is job growth and overall economy, we feel very, very good about what's happening there. And homes, they're affordable as they're going to get. I do think yes, there may be a little bit of pull forward demand. But, right now, the market feels really, really good.","Jessica Hansen","And Alan, it\u2019s one positive came out of last year at this time, and what we experienced, it was a renewed focus in the field for us to stay and make sure we have this affordable product offering, kind of regardless of what interest rates are doing. So, we continue to see our average square footage come down slightly. It was down about 3% on a year-over-year basis again. And we've proactively gotten the houses out there that we believe are affordable in today's market and will continue to adjust as necessary to whatever rate environment we find ourselves in. But, clearly, today is a little bit better rate environment than it was last year at this time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please proceed with your question. ","Carl Reichardt","Thanks. Good morning, all. I wanted to ask David a little bit about the competition especially for entry level in terms -- lots in particular, number of your peers are making a move in the direction that you made some time ago. And you've had a couple of smaller peers talk about how it's been harder to find assets out but they'd like to build smaller homes. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing competitively? Obviously, the lot supply is what it is and it\u2019s strong, but you'll be looking for more, they'll be more looking in the same area as you are. So, I was just curious as to your thoughts there.","David Auld","Carl, we compete every day. And yes, I do think that you\u2019re seeing more people attempt to get lower in price point and drive better affordability. But again, like we've talked about in the past, our positions are very long, very deep. And we don't intend to give up market share and that -- so that\u2019s servicing that bar.","I will say, demand is still very, very deep. And I think, from my travels that supply is still tight, especially as you achieve true affordability, so. But, we take a lot of comfort in the fact that we've got a long runway and very affordable position, deep and long, so.","Carl Reichardt","Thanks, Dave. And then, Bill, I want to follow up on Alan's question about inventories. I think, we made a few reclassifications to what's unsold versus we move models I think, but thinking back I think three years ago or so where you entered the year, feeling like you were short a little bit of inventory and it hurt you from a delivery perspective, I just want to make sure you are not feeling that way now, you feel comfortable the inventory you got in the ground as you head into this first quarter, is there -- and you\u2019re not feeling the same way that you did three years ago.","Mike Murray","Paul, this is Mike. And I would say, it\u2019s different from three years ago that not just we feel really good about the focus we\u2019ve had on housing turns and how to improve that as well as having lots on the ground to support the starts that we\u2019ll need to be making over this quarter to support what we hope to be really robust spring selling season. So, three years ago, we were struggling not just with the inventory levels of housing, but also with our finished lot positions behind that.","Jessica Hansen","And we feel very comfortable with the 60,000 to 61,000 annual target, but the reason we right now wouldn\u2019t say we're comfortable moving higher than that for this next fiscal is because where we're starting from a homes\u2019 perspective. So, 60 to 61, we feel very comfortable with.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Truman Patterson","First, I wanted to touch on the SG&A. It came in a little bit above your guidance. Could you just walk us through the drivers of this and how we should think about incremental SG&A going forward? I'm really thinking about 2020. You mentioned some leverage. But, you guys are guiding mid to high single-digit revenue growth, which is pretty much what you all did in 2019 and your SG&A was kind of flattish. Could you kind of break it out why 2021 would improve while 2019 didn\u2019t necessarily tick down?","Bill Wheat","Sure. Truman, this is Bill. Specifically, in the fourth quarter when we missed our guidance, that was specifically due to some of our compensation accruals are tied to changes in our share price. And as our stock price increased pretty sharply in the fourth quarter, we had to increase a number of those accruals, and that entirely accounts for the miss versus our guidance for the Q4 SG&A rate.","As you look back over the full year of \u201819 and as we look forward to \u201820 though, it\u2019s a little bit of a broader discussion. As you recall, in fiscal 2019 at the start of the year, we had expectations to grow more to double-digit pace. But then, very early in the year as we saw softer market in the first quarter, we lowered our revenue expectations. But, we had our infrastructure in place and homes in place, homes and inventory obviously to support a higher revenue number. So, really throughout this year, we\u2019ve been working to adjust our inventory levels and our operations to kind of fit that lower revenue expectation. And we\u2019ve been running typically about 10 basis points higher than the prior year all year along.","As we go into fiscal 2020, while we have the same revenue expectations that we ultimately achieved in \u201819, we feel like our positioning is appropriate for that revenue. And with mid to high single-digit revenue growth, we should see SG&A leverage. And so, we do expect to improve on our SG&A rate versus 2019 as we go into fiscal 2020.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Thanks for that. And then, on the financial services side, I think, it\u2019s the best result you guys have had in history. Could you just walk us through the drivers of this, and possibly, how sustainable it is going forward?","Jessica Hansen","Sure. Truman, it was mainly due to favorable market conditions just because of low interest rate environment. So, that was by far the strongest driver. And our mortgage company though has also done a fantastic job working on becoming more efficient, they\u2019ve improved their capture rate. I think, 63% this quarter was one of the highest we\u2019ve seen in quite some time. But, normal historical operating margin is more in the 30% range, the low 30s. And we do anticipate that\u2019s what they\u2019re ultimately going to return to. But, no question this year was a very strong performance for that business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard","Good morning. A question on gross margin, as you look at price and incentives and gross margin, curious how you would compare your thinking for the coming year relative to the year you just completed?","Bill Wheat","I think, we're going to see frankly, Eric, more the same. We see lower levels of incentives than where we've been sequentially through the year, margins have come up nicely, as we walk from the second quarter low that we've had. We've been very intentional about trying to manage that to drive the best returns. And looking into fiscal 2020, as clear as plan all shows, this -- we\u2019re expecting margins to be about flat kind of where we've been in the fourth quarter.","Eric Bosshard","And then, secondly, in terms of Forestar and option, can you talk about the progress you've made and where that number is going, and how it's going, you would -- how you would characterize how it's going?","Mike Murray","Overall, we feel really well about the progress we've made to get to 60%. I know that's a little bit bouncy quarter-to-quarter. And we\u2019ve talked about, it's a dynamic number that measured in any quarter and it's going to move a little bit directionally. I hope to get a little more progress on that this year, and the trend continues. Forestar continues to add to their operating platform, add their team, which is a great first source for us, for a third-party developer. And at the same time, we work really hard developing relationships with other third-party developers as well, and continuing to expand those relationships that we have in various markets. And getting people in markets, we have not historically been able to get developers to step in and complete lots for us. It's an ongoing, long-term process.","Eric Bosshard","And the destination ultimately, the 60%, where would you like that number to get to and over what time frame?","Mike Murray","Hard to say, an ultimate number, higher than where it is today. But it's something we'll probably be working at very hard for our entire careers here at D.R. Horton.","Eric Bosshard","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Kim","Yes. Thanks very much, guys. Mike, just wanted to clarify one thing, you just said I think with respect to margins in 2020 that you're thinking you could probably be flat with where you were in 4Q \u201819. So, in other words, kind of around that 21% gross margin in 2020 is kind of what you're thinking. Right?","Mike Murray","Yes, sir.","Stephen Kim","Okay, great. I just wanted to clarify that. That's great. The second question relates to SG&A. So,","I believe, Bill, you were talking about the impact of the stock-based compensation in 4Q, your September quarter, you made adjustment to your accruals for the higher stock price. I was wondering if -- there shouldn't be any lingering impact from that. Let's say, if your stock price would remain flat into next year, should there -- the reason I'm asking is because 1Q guide on SG&A is for flat, even though your closings are up about 7%, just kind of like what you're thinking for the year. So, just trying to figure out why we wouldn't seem a little more leverage in 1Q, like you're expecting to see for the full year?","Bill Wheat","Right. Yes, the change in the accrual should not have any lingering effect that you are correct in that assumption. As we look at our absolute level of SG&A spend going into the first quarter along with our revenue guide, we believe 9.5% is the level that we feel like we will be at. If you do go back a year ago though if you're comparing year-over-year, in the first quarter, we had some, I hate to say benefit, but we did have some benefit from a reduction in our stock price last year. So, some of those accruals were pulled down a year ago in the first quarter. So, it\u2019s simply timing on that basis, but it does move the needle a bit. It can move to 10 to 20 basis points.","Stephen Kim","Got it. Yes. That's very clear. And then, lastly, I think, in your opening remarks, you talked about October off to a strong start. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more. Are we seeing in any way an acceleration into October in anyway, either in terms of being able to reduce incentives at a more aggressive pace or any other kind of color you can provide around the demand environment in October?","David Auld","This October feels so much better than last October\u2026","Stephen Kim","Sure.","David Auld","It\u2019s hard not to be a little bit excited about what the year brings. I can tell you we're not thinking that we\u2019re going to see a margin expansion because I do believe there is going to be more competition. But, where we see the business right now today is very, very solid and feel comfortable, at least today with sharing that -- we are looking for pretty flat margins going forward. As you know, we\u2019re not typically the most optimistic group out there.","Stephen Kim","Right, but just the hardest working. I appreciate it, guys.","David Auld","Yes, sir.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Bouley","I want to start with the question on the Q1 gross margin guide consistent with Q4. Can you just go through some of the sequential puts and takes in that? So, I guess, what are you guys assuming around incentives and direct costs, and perhaps if there is any purchase accounting that\u2019s still rolling off?","Jessica Hansen","It\u2019s really just looking at kind of our core lot level gross margin and assuming all else remains equal, so really no impact, one way or another from warranty and litigation or interest or property taxes. Now, those can move the needle quarter-to-quarter but they are really hard to project. So, right now, they are approximately 21%, would assume those are relatively in the same range as they were in Q4. And then, we're able to maintain a flat pricing environment or a pricing environment that is increased at the same level as our cost. So, that\u2019s what we saw this quarter sequentially -- well, actually sequentially we saw an improvement because of the continued pullback on incentives, which we think we're through the most of. But, our revenues per square foot were up about 2%, stick and brick costs were up about 1%.","Matthew Bouley","Okay. Thank you for that color, Jessica. And then, I want to ask about some of the regional trends as well because it looked like the South Central really accelerated. So, any elaboration if you guys are sort leaning into Texas again. You guys have seemingly pulled back a bit there the past couple of quarters. And then, I guess, any color on the West and California as well?","Mike Murray","So, I think -- let me take second part of your question first. California and the west, we're seeing good sales trends out there. We've kind of refocused ourselves on maintaining affordability. And at the price points, we're offering our teams out there doing a great job executing for those buyers. And we're seeing the buyers respond.","In Texas, it's home. We've been dominating here for a long time and we will continue to do so. And those communities are performing exceptionally well, great teams on those projects. And the economy is strong here. And the interest rate adjustments, as David mentioned before, helps affordability. But, we have always been focused on meeting that affordable need in the State of Texas. And we're seeing great response.","David Auld","I'll just add that a lot of it\u2019s positioning. And I think coming into this year, we feel very good about the way we're positioned, and both really California with the price that we've been able to drive down to and in Texas with lots out in front of our building operation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Rehaut","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question I had was on how you're thinking about growth next year. And what I mean by that, obviously you gave the guidance, much appreciated, and in line with your prior expectations. But, if you go back over the last 5, 10 years, you've had a couple of different initiatives that I think have really been extremely helpful in driving the growth and taking share around the Horton Express around the Emerald. I think, you've talked in the past about other strategic goals to allow for a consistent growth going forward, including the Freedom Homes, the active adult, maybe even getting deeper in the East footprint as areas of opportunity. I was curious, as you look over the next year or two, how prominent those areas of strategic focus will be or the role that it will play in allowing you to continue to reach higher heights? Obviously getting to 60,000, you are up now consistently for the last three or four years, you are going up, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 closings per year. So, I was just curious, as you look at the next year or two, achieving the next ladders up of growth, is that going to be more broad-based, this kind of market driven or do you see specific games in some of those strategic initiatives that you've talked about in the past?","David Auld","I think, on the last call, Bill talked about the fact that we're only top 5, and -- yes, number 1 in 13, top 5 in 30, 32 markets. So, we've got a lot of -- a lot of runway in those markets. And as to the brands, we're trying to drive optionality for the buyers and to create a focus and product to meet everybody's needs in the market. So, I feel like we've got all kinds of runway to get better end markets. And we're not doing as good as we should be and offer products that everybody is going to want to buy. ","Jessica Hansen","So, Rehaut, in addition to product positioning and our current footprint and deepening our market share in our current footprint, we have continued to expand where we operate, and our market count this quarter actually moved from 87 markets up to 90. So, we continue to asses where those good permits and jobs and areas that are in the affordable housing on the ground which honestly is almost every market across the entire U.S. So, we will look to continue to expand our footprint as well.","Mike Murray","And then, you did mention kind of the East and the Midwest. With our acquisitions a year ago in the Midwest, we\u2019re working with those teams and they\u2019re growing their platforms. There is opportunity for that to be a stronger contributor for growth for us going forward. And then, we\u2019ve talked about the Northeast, and we continue to day by day improve our operations there, and our teams are working hard. And we think that\u2019s going to be an increasing driver of our continued growth as well.","Michael Rehaut","I guess, secondly, as you think about order growth or closings growth next year, this year, you kind of moved from sales pace being maybe flattish or slightly up to flat, and then this quarter excluding acquisitions you had more of a high single-digit type of growth, and that's consistent with a lot of the builders that have seen an improved market as well as an easier comp. As you get into next year, how should we expect the balance of community count and sales pace to influence the overall unit volume growth?","Jessica Hansen","After we cycle through this next quarter, really that\u2019s when we acquired the three companies we did and really what has been putting our community count growth in that high single digit range. So, without those acquisitions, we\u2019ve been trending in that pretty low single digit range, only 1% or 2% on a year-over-year basis. And I think, we really just kind of anticipate more of the same in fiscal \u201820. So community count is slightly up, and it can be a little choppy along the way.","Mike Murray","But, we are seeing as with our refocus on affordability and ensuring that we\u2019re driving that everywhere that we can, we're seeing improved absorption for community. And so with our guide of mid to high single digit growth on a community count of low single digit, we're assuming further improvement in per community sales price.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question.","Megan McGrath","I guess, I wanted to ask, if you think about this fiscal year 2019, we went through a lot of movements in interest rates, up and down and ticking back up a little bit. But, I guess looking back, could you tell us that anything surprised you in terms of the reaction of your buyer group to those rate moves which have been debated for a while, what would happen? And if rates continue to pick up, is there anything you would do differently or just your strategy as we move forward?","Mike Murray","Megan, we saw the buyers -- every time that affordability is constrained, the buyers have to readjust and there is certainly a pause in the marketplace. And interest rates are big driver of affordability. At the same time that as Jessica mentioned earlier, that gave us the real focus to get back into our product and think about what we are offering and try to bring housing prices down for our customers at a way that provides -- still provided a good margin for the Company, and we did that. And we\u2019ll continue to adjust to the marketplace for whatever the interest rate environment gives us. I do think one of the things that we are seeing is that there's continued job growth in the economy and there's some continued wage growth. And that's very helpful for households. And that large population, that large demographic is aging one year further down, and they're having life events that often drive them to prefer single family housing as their housing choice. And we're well-positioned to provide them with a home for that.","Megan McGrath","Great, thanks. And then, just a follow-up on gross margin, and you talked about flattish from the fourth quarter. Could you maybe walk us through how you're thinking about the headwinds and tailwinds of the big components of gross margin as we look into next year, generally, labor materials and pricing?","Jessica Hansen","So, it\u2019s really just more the same Megan. So, what we're saying in that guide is that we don't have the same level to pull back on incentives as we did this year. We will pretty much have cycled through the higher incentives that we had to institute last year at this time to drive a sales pace. So, we continue to have some limited cost pressures on the labor front that\u2019s consistently been somewhat of a headwind. But, we've worked to offset it in other categories. And generally, now that we've offset, cycled the higher lumber costs, our material costs are net neutral. Our purchasing team\u2019s doing a great job of when we do have a category that the cost is going up, they find a category where we can look to offset it. So, I think our base case would be just to be able to keep those costs in line with whatever type of pricing power or lack of pricing power we might have.","As a reminder though, the really the fiscal 2020 gross margin is going to be dependent on the strength of the spring selling season. And so, this is where we sit today. We feel good about maintaining our gross margin, around the range it is right now. But, it's really going to be dependent on the spring.","Bill Wheat","As you know, we're focused first and foremost on returns. And so, we're going to balance margin, pricing, incentives and pays to generate the best return for community. Right now, we see a good market in front of us. And so, that would indicate we should be able to maintain margins.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG. Please proceed with your question.","Jack Micenko","Hi. Good morning. Bill, I wanted to revisit the cash flow comment, I think from maybe the first leadoff question on the call. $1.4 billion this year, north of a $1 billion next year, the October issue, very nice refi of the February 2020 coming due. Is there anything around the cash flow guide contemplating the December 2020? I know, that\u2019s a 2%, that's a pretty attractive yield it\u2019s going to be probably hard to beat that. But, is any of that in the guide for cash flow for next year? ","Bill Wheat","No. That would be beyond our fiscal year. So, we're kind of looking at that as a fiscal 2021 event. So, naturally, with the 2.5% five-year notes we issued in October that does essentially provide the funds to refi and payoff the maturity that we have in the spring, the $500 million we have in the spring. So, that gives us flexibility in our liquidity as we go into the year to invest further or be able to be opportunistic as we need to.","Jack Micenko","Okay, great. And then, on DHI Communities, can you maybe help us size what those gains \u2013 obviously, it's a market transaction deal, so not looking for ZIP code, but maybe area code around maybe gains, timing. And then 2b of the question, thoughts on single family rental. There are some going that way and among your peers, someone have said it\u2019s not really for us. Just curious as you're growing the rental business overall, where your current thinking is on the single family side? Thanks.","Bill Wheat","So, DHI Communities, we mentioned, we do expect to sell another two projects in fiscal 2020. One of which is under contract to sell as of September 30th. So, we would expect the first project to close in our first fiscal quarter, and then, we expect one more over the course of the year. Little hard to comment on individual transactions around the size of potential gains until they close. But, our projects are ranging in size from high 200 units up to up to 350 to 400 units in general. And so, they are in a fairly tight range in terms of size. So, I would expect significant variations versus the ones we saw this past year.","And then, in terms of single family rental?","Mike Murray","We're continuing to look at that business, Jack. We think it's -- we have an opportunity to provide some value in that space, and we're looking for the best way we can do that right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Weintraub","I certainly understand with the strong backlog you\u2019ve got good visibility on next six months, whatever margin et cetera. I guess, I was a little surprised that when talking about labor and materials, you wouldn\u2019t potentially be anticipating more pressure as we get to later into next year, given the order growth that we\u2019ve been seeing, and given some of the inventory dynamics, which affected you this year and probably the industry as well, which would suggest there is going to be more stress on the home building complex, and so more stress on labor in particular. Any further thoughts on how you are thinking about that in your ability to be in a position? Because it sounded like it wasn't so much that you\u2019d be raising but you thought that those wouldn\u2019t be material impacts to your year ahead.","Bill Wheat","So, part of the confidence we have in our cost outlook is looking lot of a national contracts we have from our scale. Secondarily, at a local level the scale we have certainly supports great labor relationships that we've had over the years and our ability to continue to source adequate labor to build our homes on a timely fashion is very constructive for us. And there is cost pressure because the market is strong. We would also expect that there is a potentially a lower level of incentives that would help us mitigate any of those cost leakages that we had through.","David Auld","I\u2019ll just add that we worked very, very hard over the years to drive a process that has allowed us to drive more square footage with the same labor hours. And that gives us a lot of comfort and confidence that when labor does get tied again, which I anticipate it will in the spring that we are going to command the greatest percentage of it. ","Mark Weintraub","And maybe just as follow-on, did you think your local market scale access is in even bigger advantage in that type of market than what we\u2019ve been seen, and how does that play out?","David Auld","Well, absolutely. I think, it\u2019s a local market scale. I think it\u2019s also our commitment to drive a consistent production at each flag. So, we get the trade base into the communities. Our absorption in our typical community is very, very high. So, we're keeping that. And they are not looking for work while they are waiting on us to start houses. It\u2019s just a process. It\u2019s something we've been working on for a long, long, long time. And I think, we do have both, a loyal trade base and good markets bad markets. I know they're going to get paid. So, that is a competitive advantage for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Zener","Let\u2019s start with intra quarter order closings please. What percent of closings were intra quarter orders closings?","Jessica Hansen","It was right where we typically expected in call it 35%, 36% range. It fluctuates anywhere from 30% to 40%, on average, and with a little bit of seasonality sometimes.","Ken Zener","Right. So, if I do that calculation, first, what I believe was 34% last year, what that shows is your closings were up about 7% of your backlog. That's a nice cadence, but really spiked in the spec homes, year-over-year, if you just look at it at units. I ask that to get an understanding of how the margins for your spec first backlog are trending with a third of your closings being spec in an environment where pricing became firmer. Could you kind of talk about that a little bit?","Mike Murray","We saw spec margins compressed or get closer to backlog margin. So, they came up relative to backlog margins. That difference shrunk in the quarter\u2026","Ken Zener","And what would you attribute that to?","Mike Murray","As what you said, it was a firmer pricing environment, a lower incentive environment in our fiscal fourth quarter than it was say in the fiscal second quarter.","Ken Zener","Now, the guidance you gave for revenue, you talked about feeling good in October. Nice. It seemed though like -- it seems like you guys -- except for the first quarter, you guys have really been kind of following what I would consider normal seasonal trends. And then, Bill, I think, you said you expect pace to actually increase in FY20. Was I mistaken?","Bill Wheat","We do, we\u2019re expecting our community count to be up low single digit, but our overall pace to be up mid to high single digit. Yes.","Ken Zener","Why is that? What gives you that confidence is what I'm asking to expect seasonality to accelerate on a order pace basis?","Bill Wheat","Just in general, we would expect that on an annual basis, as we've seen that as we're refocusing on providing attainable housing for people that we\u2019re able to see communities perform at a higher sales per flag per week pace than other communities. I mean, so, it's something that we\u2019ve consistently seen for the past several years is that as these communities open, we're positioning them with the right inventory to get going out of the gate strong and run at very high absorption rates.","Mike Murray","And I would agree with you, Ken. We're not seeing anything different than normal seasonality though, necessarily. We do expect we can run a little bit tighter on our housing inventory in fiscal \u201820 than we did in \u201819. We started strong and as we adjusted our revenue expectations, we've kind of spent a year adjusting to align. But, we thought we\u2019re very well aligned going into fiscal 2020.","David Auld","I\u2019ll just add, our confidence level is really driven by what we\u2019re seeing out in the field. And we talk a lot about our people. We talk a lot about trying to get better year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, day-over-day really. And I would just say we are getting better. So, even though our absorption per flag has been very high through this whole cycle, we are a better company today than we were a year ago, better positioned and our people got another year\u2019s experience.","Ken Zener","Understanding it appears that way for your results. Can you talk about how you\u2019re trying to control your user side vis-\u00e0-vis vendors and if you\u2019re seeing whether it\u2019s lumber, appliances or these types of other things, perhaps what you\u2019ve learned over the last year and any changes that you\u2019re implementing for FY20? Thank you very much.","Bill Wheat","I think, we're continuing to do what we have done with a lot of our national supply partners, and they\u2019re creating a good relationship for us and for them providing a lot of consistent volume demand and potential halo effect into a given marketplace by bringing their product into the trade base. There are some follow-on benefits and we participate in that and they certainly benefit from it as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Barron with Housing Research Center. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Barron","I was curious whether you guys feel the growth in the overall industry is going to be pretty much in line with the growth you guys are guiding to.","Bill Wheat","Yes. Alex, I would think, we would continue to expect to take market share, and as we like to say, outperform the market, year in, year out, we expect to do better.","Alex Barron","Okay. So, does that mean you expect your affordable percentage of homes to I guess keep growing?","Jessica Hansen","You may not see it from a pure brand perspective in our business, but what we\u2019ve been introducing really over the last year or so is more and more entry level type houses in our Horton brand as well. So, the answer is yes, but you may not see our Express percentage of a business, climb from the mid-30s, where it is today.","Alex Barron","Got it. And then, in your financial services segment, you guys got pretty nice leverage this quarter, do you expect that to continue in 2020?","Bill Wheat","Yes. We certainly have seen some improvement in efficiencies, their cost for loan is down, they\u2019ve increased their capture rate, which provides efficiencies on overhead as well. But, a large part of the expansion margin is due to very favorable market conditions as rates drop for this year. The service release premiums are very healthy and that sort of a market and there is less competition from because there is more refi business out there. So, we wouldn\u2019t expect to sustain the same level of level margins, they should come down a bit. But, we're pleased with the continued efficiencies we're building into that business.","David Auld","And I\u2019ll just add, our mortgage company did a spectacular job this year, not only driving efficiency through their process but in aligning with our homebuilding operations to make the overall transaction better for our customers.","Alex Barron","Okay. And one last one if I may on the Forestar. As you guys are now incurring interest due to the debt you raised, is that going to be capitalized or is that going to be showing up in expenses in what you guys report?","Bill Wheat","Yes. Forestar, their active inventory is greater than their debt. So, they are capitalizing 100% of their interest into their inventory at Forestar.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning will come from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is actually Chris on from Mike. Thanks for squeezing me in here. So, my first question is just on M&A. Are you embedding any M&A in your 2020 guidance? And given the recent activity in the space, could you just give us an update how you\u2019re thinking about public versus private opportunities?","Bill Wheat","We are not embedding any M&A activity into our growth guidance. With regard to our outlook for M&A, for what's right for Horton, typically, it's been the private builders, the add-on builders that give us new capabilities, new teams in various markets. So, that's where we\u2019ll continue to have our focus right now. But, we are always open and are always evaluating whatever is right -- going to be right for us.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks for that. And secondly, are you be able to provide the percentage of communities that raised price this quarter, and any regional color, commentary you can provide on pricing power you saw in 4Q?","Jessica Hansen","So, the communities we've raised price on isn't something we typically disclose. We clearly still don't have broad based pricing power across the board. But, I would say, at this point, we've had an ability to pull back on incentives, which is a different function of price, across most of our footprint at this point, maybe a little bit less so at the higher price points where incentives have remained elevated.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Auld for any final comments.","David Auld","Thank you, Melissa. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to talking to you again in January to share our first quarter results. And to the D.R. Horton team, congratulations on finishing number one for the 18th consecutive year. You are truly the best of the best in this industry.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton.

After the conclusion of the call, we will post updated supplementary data to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News & Events for your reference. The supplementary information includes current and historical supporting data on our homebuilding return on inventory, gross margins, changes in active selling communities, product mix and our mortgage operations.","Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","The D.R. Horton team delivered a strong third quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased to $379 million on $3.2 billion of revenue, and our pre-tax profit margin improved 40 basis points to 11.7%. Our homes sold increased 13% compared to the third quarter of 2015 as we continued to see improvement in absorption per community. These results reflect the consistent solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands as we strive to be the leading builder in each of our markets.","Our focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenues and profits, while generating positive cash flows and increasing returns. During the nine months ended June, we generated $89 million of cash from operations, on track for our second consecutive year of positive cash flows.","For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory improved to 14.3%, up from 12.1% a year ago. With a sales backlog of 14,670 homes at the end of June and a well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes, we are well positioned for the fourth quarter and next year. Mike?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Net income for the third quarter increased 13% to $250 million or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to $221 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 13% to $379 million in the third quarter versus $334 million a year ago. And homebuilding pre-tax income increased 16% to $349 million compared to $302 million.","Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 9% to $3.1 billion on 10,739 homes closed, up from $2.9 billion on 9,856 homes closed in the prior year quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $290,400, essentially flat both sequentially and compared to last year.","This quarter, entry-level homes marketed under our Express Homes brand accounted for 28% of homes closed and 20% of home sales revenue. Our homes for higher-end move-up and luxury buyers priced greater than $500,000 were 7% of our homes closed and 16% of our home sales revenue. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The value of our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 14% from the prior year quarter to $3.4 billion, and homes sold increased 13% to 11,714 homes on a slight decrease on our average active selling communities.","Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $293,300. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 21%, consistent with the prior year quarter. The value of our backlog increased 17% from a year ago to $4.4 billion, with an average sales price per home of $298,600 and homes in backlog increased 15% to 14,670 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the third quarter was 78%, at the midpoint of the range we guided to on our second quarter call. Mike?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 20.3%, up 40 basis points from the second quarter. The improvement in our margin this quarter was primarily due to controlling cost increases while also reducing incentives or raising prices in communities where we are achieving our targeted absorptions. Our general gross margin expectations remain unchanged. In the current housing market, we continue to expect our average home sale gross margin to be around 20%, with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix, and the relative impact of warranty and interest costs. David?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","In the third quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense was $280 million, compared to $258 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of homebuilding revenue, SG&A improved 10 basis points to 8.9%, compared to 9% in the prior year quarter. For the nine months ended June, our SG&A improved 40 basis points to 9.5% compared to 9.9% in the same period in the prior year. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring our infrastructure adequately supports our current and expected growth. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Financial services pre-tax income in the third quarter was $29.4 million, compared to $31.7 million in the prior year quarter. 92% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 56% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 50% of the mortgage company's volume compared to 49% in the prior year quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company this quarter had an average FICO Score of 716 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%.","First-time homebuyers represented 45% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, compared to 41% in the third quarter last year. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","At the end of June, we had 25,300 homes in inventory, of which 1,600 were models. 11,300 of our total homes were spec homes with 8,200 in various stages of construction and 3,100 completed. Our construction in progress in finished homes inventory increased by $218 million during the quarter due to seasonal construction activity.","Our third quarter investments in lots, land and development totaled $823 million, of which $586 million was to replenish finished lots and land and $237 million was for land development. For the nine months ended June, our investments totaled $2 billion, an increase of 18% from the same period last year. We expect a continued increase in our investments in land and development in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year. David?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","June 30, 2016, our land and lot portfolio consisted of 202,000 total lots, of which 112,000 or 55% are owned and 90,000 or 45% are controlled through option contracts. 73,000 of our total lots are finished, of which 30,000 are owned and 43,000 are optioned. Our 202,000 total lots owned and controlled provide us a strong competitive advantage with a sufficient lot supply to support solid growth in sales and closings in future periods. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","During the third quarter, we recorded $2.9 million in land option charges for write-offs of earnest money deposits and due diligence costs for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded $5.2 million of inventory impairment charges primarily due to an expected land sale in the East region. We will continue to evaluate our inventories for potential impairment which may result in future charges, but the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate.","Our inactive land held for development of $156 million at the end of the quarter represents 9,100 lots, down 29% from a year ago. We continue to work through each of our remaining inactive land parcels to improve cash flows and returns and we expect that our land held for development will continue to decline. Mike?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","At June 30, our homebuilding liquidity included $863 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $882 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage ratio improved 730 basis points from a year ago to 30%.","During the quarter, we repaid $373 million of senior notes at their maturity and the balance of our public notes outstanding at June 30 was $2.8 billion. We have $350 million of debt maturities in the next 12 months. At June 30, our shareholders' equity was $6.5 billion and book value per share was $17.50, up 14% from a year ago. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect our homes closed to approximate a beginning backlog conversion rate in the range of 81% to 84% at an average sales price around $290,000. We anticipate our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter will be around 20% and we expect our fourth quarter homebuilding SG&A to be in the range of 8.4% to 8.7% of homebuilding revenues.","We estimate that our fourth quarter financial services operating margin will be around 35%. We expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter to be around 35% and our fourth quarter diluted share count to be approximately 377 million shares. And we continue to expect $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flows from operations for the full year of fiscal 2016.","Our expectations are based on today's housing market conditions. Our current preliminary expectations for fiscal 2017 are for our consolidated revenues to grow by approximately 10% to 15% and for our consolidated pre-tax margin to increase to a range of 11.2% to 11.5% for the full year. We also expect to generate positive cash flows from operations for the third consecutive year in a range of approximately $300 million to $500 million.","We anticipate our tax rate for fiscal 2017 will be between 35% and 36% and that our diluted share count next year will increase by approximately 1.5%. David?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","In closing, our third quarter growth in sales, closings and profits and the improvement in our pre-tax profit margin are the result of the strength of our people and our operating platform. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and continue to expand our industry-leading market share. D.R. Horton has been the largest builder in the United States for 14 consecutive years. And according to Builder Magazine's recent Local Leaders issue, in 2015, we were the number one builder in 13 of the top 50 U.S. housing markets and a top five builder in 30 of the largest markets.","Since 2009, our market share has increased from 5% to 8%. We remain focused on growing both our revenue and profit at a double-digit annual pace while continuing to generate positive cash flows and improved returns. We are well positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offering across our D.R. Horton, Emerald and Express brands, attractive finished lot and land position and, most importantly, our tremendous team across the country.","We'd like to thank the entire D.R. Horton team for their continued focus and hard work, and we are excited and looking forward to our opportunities ahead. This concludes the prepared remarks. We will now host questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today is coming from the line of Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen F. East - Wells Fargo","Thank you, and good morning, everybody.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen F. East - Wells Fargo","Good morning. David, maybe I'll ask you a little bit. Thanks for the guidance on all that. That's very helpful. And if I look at the cash flow for 2017, another year that looks a lot like this year, I guess, a couple of things. What does that imply? Again, going back to your capital allocation that I always ask you, but what does that imply for being able to grow your communities and what growth rate are you expecting? Is it in that 10% to 15% range that you have for revenues? And then, as you look out, what's your next use there? Is it \u2013 are you seeing M&A out there? Do you have more debt pay down, et cetera?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Stephen, I think, right now, we're looking at every opportunity that's out there. As we've talked before, our goal is to be consistent and kind of take advantage of situations as they appear in our market. Community count growth, I would think we're probably going to take community count up single digit, mid-single digit maybe. Certainly, paying down debt to me is always a good thing, deleveraging the balance sheet and creating opportunities as they arise is something that we believe in. And as far as our guidance for next year, I think it's just \u2013 we see a consistent solid market out there. And we're well positioned to take advantage of it and just going to continue to try to improve our execution and get better at building, selling, closing houses every day.","Stephen F. East - Wells Fargo","Okay. And just going back to the M&A, what are you seeing out there from the privates? And then, switching gears, it sounds like so, for next year, you've got your absorption rate continuing to improve. Is that really just being driven on the Express side of the world or are you seeing anything else in the markets?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well from the \u2013 the absorption rate, yes, the Express definitely drives higher absorption rates than even the core Horton brand and has \u2013 we continue to expand that brand. We're in 51 markets I think right now. We're going to continue to push that brand into other markets. And I think we will see added absorption developed on a division standpoint, improved the absorption division-by-division which drives the overall. But I do think that we will see growth in communities next year.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Stephen, this is Mike. On your M&A question, we continue to see various private builders across the country testing the waters. We've been very fortunate with the acquisitions we've made. We've been very selective, brought on a lot of good people, lot of good teams. And we'll continue to be selective. We've set a high bar internally and we're looking for the best opportunities that either expand our geographic coverage or bring us new customers, new customer segments.","Stephen F. East - Wells Fargo","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Hey, guys. Hi. Good morning and congrats on another strong quarter.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Alan.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","David, and I think I might have asked you this last quarter, too, but the option lot count, I mean, 90,000 now, you're almost 70% from a year ago, 45% of your total lots controlled option. What are you seeing in the land market that you've been able to drive that success? Because, obviously, that's going to be a huge positive for returns and it seems like you're not really anticipating those options having much of an impact on your margin because you're still keeping the same language for roughly 20% gross margin.","So, is it just that the land market is opening up and developers have access to capital and they're more willing to flip through these lots on options or are you kind of going outside the box and doing something unusual, because none of your competitors seem to have had as much success as you have?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've got a huge advantage in it. We've got a great big footprint, and our absorption per community is something that developers that are putting lots on the ground look to. So, good market, then we're going to build houses. And I think our outreach to the development community, we are a much friendlier buyer. I think it's becoming \u2013 our goal is to really partner with these guys and to put their capital at play and avoid some of the longer-term negatives of owning as a builder, as a public company. So, it's just focus, to be honest with you; focus and execution. Our guys out there have been asked to do it, and they're getting it done.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","And generally, you're able to underwrite these deals and keep a pretty similar gross margin as if you were to own that land outright or is there a margin differential when you do this? And just the final follow-up there is, is it widespread across the country where you're having a success or are there certain geographies where the majority of those option lots are located? Thank you.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","As far as across the country, we've got option. We've been able to create option lot situations in California. And I could tell you in the last market, there was never a chance of doing that. So it really is just focus. And as far as margin, yes, the margins may be a little bit lower but the returns are significantly higher. And that's, to me, we value capital. We want maximize the return we get on capital. And so, creating a nominal amount of margin for a significantly higher return is a good way of helping our shareholders, maximizing the value of the shares.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Thank you. Good luck.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you. Interested in Express from a competitive standpoint and also from a customer standpoint what you're observing evolving, as this product has continued to move forward.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Eric, this is Bill. Certainly, from a competitive standpoint, we've been very pleased with what we've seen with Express. We're offering a great value, an affordable value for buyers out there, and there's still very limited inventory and very limited supply of affordable product out there in the market. So we're still seeing what we've been seeing as we've rolled it from market to market. We've been introducing Express into some of our western markets over the last couple of quarters and we're seeing very positive responses there as well.","We've commented in prior quarters about in markets like Florida where there are perhaps more retirees, we have seen more of \u2013 a larger mix of older buyers buying the Express Homes because they see the same value there. And so that's been a nice observation as well that I think will serve us well going forward. That's just another element of demand for that product line.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","In terms of the runway with this product, both from a competitive standpoint and your ability to source land where the economics work for this product, and then as well as a percentage of your total business, where are we and what's the runway from here look like moving forward?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","We expect to continue to expand that footprint, as David mentioned earlier. Today, we're in 51 markets and 17 states. It was 28% of our sales, it was also 28% of our closings and 20% of our revenues. If you recall when we first introduced this and got the question about when this is rolled out, what does that look like. We've generally talked about, over time, about 60% of our revenues coming from our core D.R. Horton brands, 20% from Emerald, 20% from Express, which would infer probably closer to 30% in units on the Express side. I think at this point, we would tell you that it looks like we will overshoot that during this cycle, because that's where the demand is right now, and we want to cater to that demand and what we believe it's still being underserved. So, we don't have any set targets on where it could go. We'll continue to adjust our business based on what we see in the market to go capture as much market share as we can.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","We're allocating capital based upon the highest returning projects. And right now, we have been pleasantly surprised with the demand for Express and have actually seen higher margins than we originally underwrote, and higher absorption levels than we originally underwrote. So, it is a great way to improve returns for the shareholders.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hello, gentlemen, Jessica.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Thanks, Ken.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, David, if you \u2013 I mean, we talked a long time ago about the housing market prices. Your Express Homes, obviously, it's differentiated. It's only 20% of revenue but it's obviously contributing to your volume. So, if you do that 28% of closings, 20% of revenue, you're at a house at about $210,000 in terms of price point. So, what does it mean?","I mean thanks for giving the FY 2017 guidance, many other builders wouldn't do that. What gives you the confidence? I know you have your visibility into 1Q based on your units under construction. But what really gives you the confidence to be making these statements about the back half of 2017, A? And then, B, because it seems as though, as you get this growth, could we be seeing flat to down pricing on your average sales, realizing turns are offsetting that?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","On the pricing front, right now, we're anticipating it to stay essentially flat. But, yes, it could trend down with Express continuing to become a bigger mix. What we are seeing, though, is the markets we're rolling Express out in today are the higher priced markets, so it's not as much of an incremental drag on our ASP as the initial rollout was.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Right now, Ken, California is probably going to be, we think, a very successful Express market for us. We are early in the process rolling out there. It's \u2013 typical Express, only California's going to be over our average sales price right now.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Ken, when we look at fiscal 2017 and our visibility and our confidence level, it's simply a reflection, number one, that we do see a good market. Right now, it's a good stable healthy market, some variability market to market certainly, but it's a relatively stable market. But what we see the most is our positioning. Across our divisions, our division operators are doing a tremendous job of positioning communities, positioning lots in front of those communities and really executing well on our product offerings today.","And so as we begin to look forward the next several quarters, the next 18 months or so, we really do have good visibility and confidence level to be able to deliver consistently at a double-digit pace on the revenue line, continue to drive some additional SG&A leverage to improve our operating margin, and improve our returns. And so we felt like it was appropriate to start to give some preliminary guidance to next year as we did last year at this time for fiscal 2016. And certainly, we've been pleased that we've essentially delivered on that preliminary guidance thus far this year.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right, no, I think it's obviously nice to have that early communication. If I could go back to the gross margin still on these \u2013 on your guidance, A builder reported today modestly trimmed their guidance, another public builder talked about gross margin pressure. So it seems as though the either construction cost or land inflation, given your roughly 20% gross margin, you feel that's defensible. Is that because you're getting better pricing on perhaps on these Express than you are on the other pieces, or is it just that you bought the land at a lower targeted gross margin? I mean, what's \u2013 you can't comment on other builders but it seems as though you're not concerned about gross margin degradation next year.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","We are always very focused on gross margin, Ken. But what we've seen is that we have taken some lot costs as a percentage of revenue, taken some of those increases and they would offset them with reduced incentives and controlling some cost increases on a stick and brick side.","When we get our community to the targeted absorption levels, at those points, we're able to bring incentives down or take pricing up and protect the margin. And overall on the balance, the team has done a great job of enhancing the margin on a consolidated basis this quarter. And we feel good about with the range of the guidance we're giving on the margin that that's a defensible position for us going forward, as we continue to drive absorptions community-by-community. Part of that's been Express and simplifying some of our operations behind the scene and that and delivering a house with fewer labor hours in it to get it built, and part of it's been some of the great land positioning we've been doing over the past few years.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Ken, we feel very good about next year. I mean what we're seeing in the markets, there's not a lot of lots being put on the ground that we're going to have to compete against. There is still pent-up demand at entry level and first move-up price points. It just feels good right now.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","You guys are crushing it and I love the fact that you have that crystal ball somewhere in the office in Fort Worth into 2017. Wanted to ask you, when we're thinking about comments around 2017, it's kind of like flat ASP performance looking out. How should we be thinking about the interplay between kind of like community absorption rates versus new community growth? Because I think to get to your kind of range of 10% to 15% against flat pricing, you can either deliver faster or you can open new communities. What's the right way to think about that?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Bob, we think in 2017 it will be a combination of driving further improvement in our absorption coupled with, at some point as we move throughout 2017, an increase in our community count. Our community count on a year-over-year basis was down, which was not a surprise to us, and we would expect over the next couple of quarters, it to move up or down no more than a low to mid single-digit range. But at some point, as we move throughout the year, we would expect an increase in that community count to help drive that 10% to 15% consolidated top line growth.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Bob, we don't have a crystal ball, but Don Horton does tell us what it's going to be and we go do it.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's quite helpful. And you guys are speaking a lot about California, and I was hoping you could kind of \u2013 you know, I always think that's a cash market, not a option market. And I was hoping \u2013 it sounds like the torch is kind of being passed from really good growth in the Southeast to a very optimistic view of West Coast markets. Could you just give us some flavor of what you're seeing in terms of land buying opportunity and your expectations for growth in both Northern California, Southern California and the Phoenix market? Thanks a lot.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Bob, the growth we're looking at there is at a new price point that hasn't existed out there. And we feel very optimistic based upon the land that we've been able to put in front of that program. So do we feel more optimistic about California than the balance of the country? Absolutely not. I think Texas continues to be strong and our Southeast area just continues to outperform.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And we're introducing Express in Phoenix and certainly expect it to do very well there and expect to see some growth out of Phoenix as well. But really, the key is the affordable product that we're offering.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","It just runs at a much higher absorption. And developers typically when they see that, they feel more comfortable putting less on the ground force.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just to understand, are you saying the price point for what you're bringing to the California markets, just going to be way below competing entry level and first-time homebuyer product in the market?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not saying way below. I'm saying that the value combination is going to be superior.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","(32:19)","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","And we've been able to capture market share with that product offering.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","It makes sense. Good luck.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. And yeah, just following up on the double-digit and I appreciate the guidance there and, obviously, the confidence that that shows. So, so far in the Q&A, you've touched on, obviously, some low single-digit rate of community count growth. ASPs, selling prices continuing this kind of flattish trend that they've had this year, putting the burden, if you will, on absorption. Then Jessica, you just mentioned that in the prior question. How should we think about that? Is that absorptions across the portfolio?","So on a same-store D.R. Horton brand basis, we would see strong absorption growth there? Or is this \u2013 with \u2013 there's obviously a lot of community rotation, is this Express subbing in for other brands as its percentage grows, and naturally those are at higher absorptions. So that would drive the absorption again. How should we think about it and how you're thinking about it for next year?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Nishu, there's several pieces of it. And I think you touched on a lot of them, some of the Express communities rotating in. Also just within the core D.R. Horton communities, some of the communities that we're closing out may have been smaller communities and what's been opening are communities with larger lot positions in front of them that are going to be running at higher absorption paces that are coming on line, have been coming on line over the past few quarters and will be coming on line into the future.","So, that's where we're seeing our double-digit growth within the existing community count. And we do expect, as David mentioned, that we'd probably be growing average selling community count slightly into 2017. But the nature of the communities, each one producing a few more sales than the ones that they're replacing.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Got it. That's really helpful. And then also, consolidated pre-tax, I believe that you've kind of got it to high 10%s, 10.7% to 11.2%, I think you'd said last quarter, and I think has specifically led up this quarter. But when thinking about 2017 and, Jessica, I think you'd mentioned below 11%s for next year. A lot of that, I imagine, is coming from continued SG&A leverage. I was wondering if you could just provide some general color around that. Or also, the financial services profitability is part of the mix there as well, that's been pretty strong, consistent. So, was just wondering if you could give us your thoughts on trends on both of those.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","You're correct, Nishu, that we do expect the majority of our operating margin improvement next year to come from SG&A leverage again like it did this year. And so, we've guided specifically to 11.2% to 11.5% and we would expect our gross margins to be right around 20%, and to drive that better bottom line by further stretching our overhead structure -leveraging our overhead structure.","SG&A \u2013 or in terms of the financial services business, they did see a step down in our margin this year, which we've been expecting. They've had outsized gross margins for the last year or two. They're still operating at a very good level. We guided to Q4 for that to be around 35%. They follow the homebuilder business seasonally, so in fiscal 2017, we would expect them to have lower operating margins in the first six months of the year and then to pick up in the back half of the year like we saw in 2016. We'd expect a similar trend in 2017.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question I had was on the East region, I believe you highlighted the impairment in the quarter was largely driven by a partial sale or expected land sale there. And I was curious if that was the same parcel that you took the impairment on in the second quarter. And just more broadly regarding the East, I think when we marketed a couple, did our own D.R. a couple of months ago. Kind of talked to the East as an area of opportunity maybe doing a little bit better, gaining some share there. An area that maybe a relative to some of your other regions, there's still some share to be gained there. So, any just thoughts specifically on the impairment and secondly, on the opportunity you see in the region over the next year or two?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Michael, this is Mike. That is not the same project that we impaired. We sold that project that we impaired in the second quarter. That's no longer with us. This project is a different project. It had been an older project in land held for development. We evaluated it, determined the best course of action for us was to pull the capital out of it and move forward, redeploy that capital. And we do see opportunity for growth and improving our position in our East market.","But that's not going to happen overnight. We're working hard on it every day. We've had some changes in the teams up there and very excited about the direction they're taking us and the opportunities they're putting in front of us. But as with everything, nothing ever happens fast enough or quick enough for us, but we're working very hard to get more lots on the ground in front of us and get those communities open and drive more growth out of those.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Our public East region, Mike, just for clarification, includes our Northeast markets, which are the ones Mike was referring to, our Capital division and our New Jersey division. But the East publicly reported region also does include the Carolinas, which those are firing on all cylinders and very strong markets for us today.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. I appreciate that clarification. I guess a second question on the gross margin. Obviously, you're very clear in your guidance, but you did have a nice \u2013 a little better than expected result this quarter, and you highlighted a couple of the drivers. I was wondering if there was some particular elements of mix that also helped this quarter. And I guess looking forward, do you still expect the gross margin to be in and around 20%? I was curious on that.","You talked about Express coming in a little better than expected and, obviously, as you do more Express and more Emerald, I'd expect the efficiencies and experience to maybe result in a little bit better amount of profitability. So, again, sorry for the two-parter, for my second question again, but mix on the quarter and then some of those improved operational efficiencies or experience benefiting the margin into next year.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike. This is Bill. Nothing unusual on the margin this quarter other than just continued focus on execution and controlling our costs. We've been absorbing labor cost increases, some materials cost increases over time, and we've been working to offset those and we're making some progress there. We're getting some traction on that, while we're still absorbing increasing land costs that are coming in. So we've done, I think, an improving job on controlling those costs and continuing to push price and then reduce incentives wherever we can.","So, we did see a nice little pickup this quarter, nothing unusual in that number, and it's really just in that normal range of around 20%, we would expect to see. A move of 30 basis points or 40 basis points is not really unusual in and around 20%. But certainly pleased to post a quarter at a little bit above 20% and hopefully, we can \u2013 we're always focused on doing everything we can to maintain and improve on that while driving better returns.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just thoughts around some of the better efficiencies as you gain experience in Express and Emerald, could that be ultimately showing up as a potential positive lift or is it just another element that allows you to combat, let's say, rising land costs and labor costs?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Certainly, part of our strategy is to get better every day at what we do. The margins that we see across the three brands are actually pretty closely clustered together around the company average. And we do expect to get better in every community every day at what we do, and we have seen that. We have seen our margins moving up. And we're held to a pretty high standard to expect to continue to see those margins, making progress on them every day.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And in a market, Mike, that does continue to improve and grow, there will be cost increases that come along the way, and these additional efficiencies that we are able to glean out of the business do help offset those other cost increases.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG. Please proceed with your question.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I wanted to understand the message on backlog conversion a little bit better. So 81% to 84% for the fourth quarter. You did the midpoint of the range this quarter. If I go 84%, I get to the midpoint of the range, which I guess should mean if you had a sort of similar result this quarter than last, you'd be in the sort of \u2013 albeit, admittedly, it's a narrow range for the year on deliveries, but you'd be at the bottom half.","Is that the message, or is it conservatism on the guidance range? How do we think about that? And then on a broader base, is an 8 handle on the backlog conversion, I mean is that the new Horton norm, given the product mix is at \u2013 that number's sort of stepped up the last couple years?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Jack, there's a lot of fluctuation in our backlog conversion rate, and there's a lot of things that impact that each quarter. But if you look at the last four years to five years on average, our Q3 to Q4 change in our backlog conversion has typically been about flat. So, we are saying that it's going to go up a little bit to that 81% to 84% compared to what we did this quarter. I would not tell you there is a bunch of conservatism baked into that. As you saw this quarter, we delivered at the midpoint of our range and in some of the headlines out there it's being called a miss, even though we are right in the dead center of the guidance we've provided.","So, no conservatism on next quarter. We feel good about delivering 81% to 84%. And it's a little bit better and we're focused every day on delivering the best we can. And we would like to continue to see a backlog conversion right in the 80% range, but there'll be some quarters that are in the 70%s.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","From an operational efficiency and getting better, that's something we look at and strive to improve because that helps with the SG&A leverage, it helps with the inventory turn. Conversion rate is a great metric to determine whether you're actually getting better or not. So, we're not going to guide. Optimistically, it's a consistent market, we've got a consistent solid performance and expect to continue that.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you. And then, your FHA mix from the mortgage company was up a bit year-over-year. The rhetoric from some of the larger banks seems to suggest that they're moving away from that product somewhat with some of the inherent sort of legacy legal risks or tail risk to that program. Are you seeing any shift from FHA to private mortgage insurance in your borrower base more granularly, or is it still pretty stable?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","I'd say it's pretty stable. The difference for us is with Express becoming a bigger piece of our mix, their percentage usage for those buyers of FHA loans is higher than our company average. It's closer to the mid-40%s. So, that's really the function there.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. So our next question today is coming from Susan Maklari from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","You've mentioned the fact that you are seeing some more older buyers coming in to your Express communities, and as we think about the evolution of Express and maybe some of the demographic trends that we expect to come through, is that something that we could see sort of further come along and perhaps maybe even evolve from a marketing or branding perspective down the line?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. We are certainly focused on all the buyers that are responding to Express. And we're seeing great acceptance of Express in Florida, as Jessica mentioned before, with some of the retiree buyers and we're going to look to meet those buyers' needs and understand exactly what it is they want, and put a house on the ground for them at a great value. People that are retiring on a fixed income are looking for value in a high quality, well-built home. That's exactly in the wheelhouse of what we do. And so I think you can expect to see that we're going to try to take advantage of every opportunity in front of us including that buyer demographic.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then as we think about some of the labor issues that remain out there and the experience that builders in general are facing, do we expect any change outside of the normal seasonality in terms of your spec pace or your start pace as we go through in the next few quarters?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","We're looking at our starts pace to just kind of continue as we go seasonally to build some inventory for the spring and to be prepared for the spring selling season next year. Hopefully, it's good or better as the one we just came out of. And we're seeing \u2013 certainly, labor is always a challenging component. Our market positioning, the scale we have in so many of our markets gives us a great advantage on the labor availability front. And we watch very closely our build times and our cycle times, and we're not seeing an elongation of that. So we feel like our team is doing a great job of managing their trade base.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","The absorption per community is a great deal to expand our option lot program, but it is also a great deal to secure and keep the labor force because they come in, they start, and we build through the communities instead of start, stop, start, stop, and they're always out chasing new job sites so there's a lot of benefits to what we're doing. That's one of them.","Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. First question is on Southeast conversions that have been a little bit light year-over-year in the first three quarters. Was there anything in 2015 that made those exceptionally \u2013 the conversion exceptionally strong or is there something going on this year?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I wouldn't say there's anything unusual, John. They did certainly see very strong absorptions last year. That's moderated a little bit this year, but we're still seeing very strong growth and expect very strong growth going forward in the Southeast. They're delivering right in line with our expectations.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Moving on. Valuations across the group have risen in the past couple of weeks in particular. In your conversations with the private builders, are you hearing a general expectation for higher prices on the private side as well on the M&A front?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","We always probably have a bit of a valuation gap at the initial conversations. It takes time and that's why our bar's pretty high and we're very selective in what we're doing, and we're going to look to make the right acquisitions where it makes sense for us and the numbers work. We're not going to push. Fortunately, we're in a position. Teams have done a great job in lots and product positioning that we don't feel the need we have to push and drive on making a deal work that otherwise might not. But we haven't seen any specific rise in the past couple weeks. I mean that private builder market's not quite as liquid as the public side.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And one last one, if I may, the 11.2% to 11.5% on margin for 2017, is that a homebuilding margin or consolidated pre-tax?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","That's consolidated pre-tax.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Wanted to ask first about longer-term thoughts on SG&A. So it sounds like, based on the preliminary guide for fiscal 2017, dipped below 9%, which historically at kind of in the low watermark. And so, clearly, success at driving absorptions and some of the efficiencies have done wonders for that. If you think about other structural ways to reduce SG&A beyond those levels, we've heard some other builders talk about a couple different things. Just curious to get your thoughts on if there's anything else you're exploring outside of just continuing to drive absorptions?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The main driver, Mike, is absorption, so community-by-community, that's really where our expense structure resides. And as we continue to work to improve our absorptions, then we're able to drive better leverage on our SG&A structure both in the community and then all throughout our organization.","And each year, we look at what our expectations are to improve on the top line and then we assess how much we can leverage SG&A. But as we expect to grow top line double digit, we should expect to leverage SG&A further as well. And so, yes, that does imply we will get down below 9%, and there's not a magic floor there.","Each year, if we expect to grow, we would expect to continue to push more SG&A leverage. Certainly, some of the other things that have been talked about among other builders, we're doing a lot of those things as well. We're certainly taking advantage of technology wherever we can. We're looking to drive ways to be more efficient in all areas of our business. But there's not one magic bullet. We're looking to do \u2013 get more efficient on every line of our financials. And certainly, those things are part of it as well.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. And then second question, just going back to some of the Express discussion. And so certainly appreciate that kind of first-mover advantage has been pretty powerful in terms of even out through next year. You don't have a lot of competition as far as things that are coming to market.","What about if we look at the land deals that you're looking at today, that would be 2018 or 2019? Obviously, people have taken notice of your success at the Express part of the market. So, are you showing up and seeing significantly more competition for those types of deals as you look out the next couple of years?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Mike, we have competition in every factor of everything we do. I believe, ultimately, it comes down to execution. And right now, our people are out there executing. We are the group that \u2013 or the builder that I think makes the most sense to align with. And so we're finding the land deals we need to support the growth that we're seeking. So, do I think it's going to become more competitive? Maybe, but it's pretty competitive out there right now. We just got great people doing a great job.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

That will be in our supplementary data that we'll post at the end of the call. What we did say during our scripted comments were our homes priced greater than $500,000, were 7% of our homes closed and 16% of our home sales revenue. If you will get homes just marketed as Emerald, it's stayed constant at about 4% of our homes closed. But if you look at that in terms of units on a trailing12-month basis year-over-year, Emerald has actually grown by over 50% for us.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC","Okay. And the orders for that same group?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","The orders for Emerald were right at 4% as well.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC","Got it. And then, I guess, as far as your outlook for what you guys are calling affordable homes or Express, I'm kind of curious to see what your outlook is going forward in terms of community count growth in terms of just \u2013 do you feel that that's where the biggest opportunity is at? And I guess, the second follow-up question, where do you guys generically think we are in the cycle at this point?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know where we are in the cycle. I can tell you it feels very good right now. And you look at the number of people and the country, you look at the housing formation, you look at job growth, all of those things are positive. So, we feel very good. And as far as \u2013 you had asked about the Emerald brand, I can tell you that...","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC","The Express was the one where I was interested in, what your outlook is for that going forward.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. But the first \u2013 your first question was Emerald, right?","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC","Yes. Yes. Yes.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, as far as confidence for us, when we see that brand starting to accelerate along with how we're executing on the entry level, I mean, that to me is a pretty positive sign of what 2017 could be.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC","Got it.","David V.

So go ahead and just go ahead and ask your question again.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC","Yes. I guess, my question as it pertains to affordable homes and entry level, I feel like the entry level market has kind of been missing in action for the last few years, and you guys are one of the first to I guess kind of put your toe on the water a few years ago through the Express brand. And you've been growing it. I'm just kind of curious if you guys feel as bullish or more bullish today than you did three years ago about that segment.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","We're in 51 markets. We've got another 20-plus markets we can push into. We feel very good about the Express program. And in the markets that we have been open and operating, are we going to continue to see the kind of growth we've had? No, probably not, because there's \u2013 but the demand is \u2013 still even after three years, the demand is incredibly strong. So, it just feels good right now.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC","Well, great. Good job.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you very much. Just wanted to ask about M&A and if you could share your thoughts on a potential for a larger-sized transaction than recent deals. We noticed your leverage levels are extremely low, which created some optionality. And regarding leverage, is that based on conservatism on the cycle or a change in longer-term view about optimal leverage, or is to create this optionality around M&A?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think it's to create optionality around a lot of things, investing in the business, reducing debt. Having a lot of flexibility in the business is good, with specific regards to M&A. We continue to look at a lot of potential transactions, and we pursue those that make the most sense for us, whether they're larger or smaller, it's \u2013 we're kind of neutral to the size of the transaction. If it make sense at a small transaction, good team, good people, good positioning, we'll be interested. If it's a larger transaction that fits well with us and there's alignment in what makes sense with the other side, we would look at that as well. We're not shutting either off at any point in time.","Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks very much. And just on your guidance, in terms of the underlying economic expectations, are you assuming sort of a low to mid-single-digit growth rate in existing and new home sales?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","We're assuming kind of more of the same in 2017 as what we saw in 2016. So when we say our expectations are based on today's housing market conditions, really just more of the same.","Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I know that you guys don't want to comment on necessarily where you think we are in the cycle, which is definitely fair. But how do you believe you're positioning D.R. Horton within the cycle given generating free cash for this year and the prior year? And also, how does that influence your view on potential incremental M&A or returning share or cash to shareholders, if you will?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Will, I think we're working to stay on a very balanced, flexible position. We're putting ourselves in position to continue to grow while we continue to see the good, stable healthy market conditions we see today. But as we're utilizing our cash to further strengthen our balance sheet, that's giving us even more flexibility to be opportunistic when we see opportunities to invest and whatever form that may be. And then, certainly, if things were not to continue as strong, we're in a very strong position there as well, whether \u2013 and so really great position to take advantage of M&A opportunities, to invest further on our business. Really, we're in a very good flexible position at the moment.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And just one follow-up that's unrelated, in terms of demand pacing through the quarter, did you see any influence from a relatively hot June, inclement weather and a seasonally \u2013 a relatively warm spring, if you will?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the sales demand side, no, not necessarily. Certainly, on the construction side, when you have a dry weather, there's no disruptions there. So, from that standpoint, that's always positive. But the summer is always hot.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. Great quarter.","Operator","Thank you.

Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Our homebuilding and financial services operations turned in another great quarter, highlighted by $205 million of pretax income and a 12.1% pretax operating margin. Contributing to our bottom line results were our home sales gross margins of 21.4%, a 340 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. And our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues of 10.2%, a 200 basis point improvement.","The value of our net sales orders increased 30% from the year-ago quarter due to a 12% increase in homes sold and a 15% increase in our average selling price to $268,000. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 24%. The value of our backlog increased 56% from a year ago to $2.6 billion with an average sales price per home of $260,700 and homes in backlog increased 36% to 9,911 homes. The increase in our average sales price reflects our continued ability to raise prices as well as a continued shift in our current buyer mix to more move-up buyers. D.R. Horton is well-known for offering homes for first-time and first-time move up buyers, with 63% of our homes closing at an average sales price of $250,000 or less this quarter.","About 2 years ago, we began to experience increased demand for larger homes with more upgrades. In response, we began adding new communities and expanding our product offerings for move-up buyers. We're also offering homes in some markets targeted to second time move-up and luxury buyers. 3.4% of our homes closed this quarter at a sales price greater than $500,000, up from 2.5% a year ago. The dollars associated with these closings increased to 9.4% of home sales revenues from 7% a year ago.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Our net sales orders in the quarter reflect our increased mix of move-up buyers and our pricing power across most of our markets as the value net sales increased 30% on a 12% increase in net homes sold. The $268,000 average sales price was our highest since the second fiscal quarter of 2006. We experienced some moderation in our net sales pace in the back half of the quarter after mortgage rates began to increase sharply.","While each individual home buyer responds differently to changes in mortgage rates, we typically see some short-term moderation in buyer activity during periods of mortgage rate volatility as potential buyers adjust to the changing rate environment. We expect that most homebuyers who slow their purchase decision while rates are volatile will ultimately still buy a house since affordability remains strong and interest rates remain at historically low levels.","Over the long term, however, we believe the demand for new homes is tied more closely to economic indicators in our individual operating markets such as job growth, household incomes, household formations and consumer confidence. Additionally, we have been proactively adjusting our rate of sales while raising prices in many individual communities to ensure that our sales pace and backlog align with our construction cycles, which have been lengthened slightly. This activity ensures that our construction costs are certain before we establish the sale price of the home, which then enhances our gross margins and profitability. Through the first 3 weeks of July, we are experiencing normal summer seasonality in our sales pace.","Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","In the third quarter, our consolidated pretax income increased 184% to $205.1 million from $72.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Our pretax income as a percentage of consolidated revenues was 12.1%, an increase of 580 basis points from 6.3% in the year-ago quarter. Homebuilding pretax income more than tripled to $185.4 million from $58.3 million and financial services pretax income increased to $19.7 million from $13.9 million. Net income for the third quarter was $146 million or $0.42 per diluted share compared to $787.8 million or $2.22 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. The prior year quarter included a noncash tax benefit of $716.7 million from a reduction of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset.","Mike?","Mike Murray","Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 46% to $1.6 billion on 6,464 homes closed, up from $1.1 billion on 4,957 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $252,300, up 12% compared to the prior year driven by pricing power and a larger average home size. Our backlog conversion rate for the quarter was 68% compared to 80% in the prior year quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect our conversion rate to be around 70%, which would be consistent with historical seasonal trends and also reflects our mix shift to larger homes with longer construction cycles.","Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 21.4%, up 340 basis points from the year-ago period. 180 basis points of the margin increase was due to improving market conditions resulting in reduced incentives and higher average selling prices in excess of cost increases. 110 basis points was due to lower relative cost for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenue, with approximately 80 basis points of the 110 due to an unusually large amount of cash reimbursement of previously incurred litigation cost.","The remaining 50 basis points of the margin increase was due to lower amortized interest and property taxes. For the fourth quarter, we expect a home sales gross margin of around 21%, which would represent further margin improvement from our 20.6% gross margin in the third quarter, excluding the 80 basis point benefit from the unusual cash reimbursement.","Mike?","Mike Murray","Homebuilding SG&A expense for the quarter was $167.5 million compared to $136.4 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of home building revenues, SG&A improved 200 basis points to 10.2% from 12.2%. We are leveraging our fixed cost structure while at the same time building our sales and production capabilities where necessary. Our SG&A also improved 100 basis points sequentially, of which, 40 basis points related to a reduction in the component of our executive compensation expense that is tied to our stock price.","We expect our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues to be around 10% in the fourth quarter. We recorded no direct interest expense this quarter since our active inventory exceeded our debt level. In the year-ago quarter, we expensed $6.2 million of homebuilding interest. The improvements in our gross profit and SG&A percentages and a decrease in our direct interest expense expanded our homebuilding pretax margin to 11.3% in the current quarter, an increase of 610 basis points from 5.2% in the year-ago quarter.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Financial services pretax income for the quarter was $19.7 million compared to $13.9 million in the year-ago quarter. 86% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. Our mortgage company handled the financing for 55% of our homebuyers this quarter with virtually all loans meeting eligibility requirements for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae.","FHA and VA loans accounted for 47% of our mortgage company's volume this quarter, down from 55% in the year-ago quarter. Our mortgage company's new borrowers during the quarter had an average FICO score of 723 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 90%. First-time homebuyers represented 44% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter compared to 56% in the year-ago quarter.","Mike?","Mike Murray","Since March, our construction in progress and in finished homes inventory increased by approximately $259 million. We had 17,500 homes in inventory at the end of June, up 1,700 homes from last quarter and up 5,300 homes from a year ago. As of June 30, 1,300 of our homes were models, 8,300 were speculative homes and 2,500 of the specs were completed.","This quarter, our average community count increased 19% from a year ago. And we expect our average community count for the fourth quarter to be 15% to 20% higher than last year.","Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","In our third fiscal quarter, our investments in lots, land and development cost totaled $710 million. As we continue to find new communities and build our lot supply. Of the $710 million, $280 million was to purchase land, $263 million was to purchase finished lots and $167 million was for land development cost. At June 30, 2013, we control approximately 190,000 lots, of which 124,000 are owned and 66,000 are option. 31,000 of our owned lots and 32,000 of our option lots are finished. The 63,000 total finished lots we control at quarter and are up 31% from a year ago.","Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Our total available homebuilding liquidity at June 30 was $1.2 billion, which included unrestricted cash of $608 million and available capacity on our revolving credit facility of $549 million. The balance of our public notes outstanding at June 30 was $2.9 billion and we had no cash borrowings on our revolver. At June 30, our homebuilding leverage ratio net of cash was 36.6% and our gross homebuilding leverage was 42.3%.","Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","In closing, this quarter was D.R. Horton's most profitable third quarter since 2006 with $205 million of pretax income. All of our operating metrics improved on a year-over-year basis this quarter. The value of our sales, closings and backlog increased by 30%, 46% and 56%, respectively. Our pretax income increased 184%. Our pretax income margin increased 580 basis points to 12.1%. Our gross margin on home sales revenues increased 340 basis points. Our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues improved 200 basis points. And we are continuing to experience pricing power in many of our markets as evidenced by a 15% increase in average sales price.","D.R. and I would like to personally thank all of our D.R. Horton team. You are executing our business plan superbly. We continue to be in a preeminent position in the industry as a company. So keep taking good care of our customers and finish strong in fiscal 2013.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host any questions you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is actually Rob Hansen on for Nishu. I wondered if you could kind of clarify some of your comments regarding the increase in mortgage rates and then what you saw with demand kind of slowing in the back half of the quarter? Ultimately, what were the kind of inter-quarter trends and how that kind of relates to what you've seen in July so far?","Bill W. Wheat","As we stated, we did see just some moderation in our sales pace in the back half of the quarter. Each of the months of our quarter were up year-over-year. But we did see the pace decline a bit in the latter half of the quarter really beginning and during the month of May. In terms of the demand trends, that's really, really all we have to say about that. Clearly, we know that mortgage rates were rising during that time. As we stated, there is some -- we typically see some short-term impact from rates on the timing of purchase decision by some buyers and that's something that we're -- each of our communities are working with our buyers on a case-by-case basis.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think also impacting it was the fact that rates moved up rather dramatically in a very short period of time, they've come down some since then. And as rates moderate, I believe that the buyers will come back in the market. They're just trying to assess their situation. Frankly, a lot of the buyers were counting on trying to pick the low in the pricing and the low in the interest rates, and they're a little bit shocked or disturbed by the fact that rates have moved up from where they were. But clearly, demand over the long term is driven more by the economic indicators and, clearly, those trends still tend to be positive in most of our markets.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then, on the luxury builder that you started with the closings being -- and I think it was a very small number, 3.5% of closings greater than $500,000 this quarter. Where do you see this in the future? How's the kind of backlog trending in that group there?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Actually, we're just at the beginning of our Emerald product, and we are rolling that across the country. We believe that we have an excellent opportunity to increase that to a significant portion of our business over the next 3 to 5 years and believe we're in a very competitive environment, both cost-wise and price-wise to compete with the small and medium-sized undercapitalized custom builders who really aren't in the market. So we feel very optimistic about that. It's a part of the market that we identified a couple of years ago that we thought would be coming on strong and it is, and we're well-positioned to continue to capitalize on it.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Don, this question falls under the category of trying to interpret your body language over the phone. You don't sound as quite as enthusiastic as you did last quarter. I didn't hear a lot of commentary as to your outlook. So can you update us on what your thoughts are in light of the moderate slowdown that you've seen?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, moderate slowdown. If I don't sound optimistic enough for you, I guess I didn't drink my Red Bull this morning. But the bottom line is I think that we're on a wonderful position as a company. Our balance sheet has never been stronger. Our land and lot position across the country has never been stronger. Our sales, improving 12% in units, we were proud of, largely because of the fact that we have done a fantastic job increasing prices and taking advantage of pricing opportunities in a number of our markets. We didn't have that pricing power back a year ago. We do today. And we are focused on profitability in this company. We clearly have been the largest builder for 11 years. We want to continue to be the largest builder. But our bottom line goal is, the bottom line. And we are focused on that very well and produce very well.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my second question is, if that back half of the quarter moderation becomes a more permanent moderation, what would be the first or the sequential steps you take or decisions you make or changes you'd make in managing your business?","Bill W. Wheat","We manage our business community-by-community and we adjust our business every single day. You adjust pricing, you adjust your spec levels of your homes and inventory, you adjust the next take of lots that you may be looking at. So it's just ordinary course of business based on sales pace. You adjust your inventory levels and your sales efforts. But from the standpoint of moderation in sales pace, when we're still up 12% in units and 30% in dollars, we still feel like we're still generating a very good, strong growth through our sales line with our community count being up, double-digit with expectations for it to remain there. We feel like we're still very good and positioned to continue to grow the top line as well.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And frankly, Adam, maybe you are reading a little bit of my body language because I am disappointed that over the course of the 30- or 60-day period post Chairman Bernanke's speech that rates went up so violently so quickly because the homebuilding industry had made a lot of progress in the last 12 to 24 months, and it seems like one speech had a major impact on the industry and our sales, which was really ridiculous reaction by the marketplace. But secondly, what we've always focused on in the [indiscernible] CFO who preceded Bill Wheat, what we're focusing on is that we've never made a coupon payment or we've never put a dollar, or we never put a home in the bank. We always have to put dollars in the bank, and that's we're focusing on, is putting dollars in the bank and rebuilding our equity.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Dan Oppenheim from Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more in terms of the margin. You've talked a lot about the pricing power but in terms of the impact from higher prices and lower incentives, it seems somewhat modest in terms of that. Can you speak a little bit more to that is materials, [indiscernible] some of the impact, how do you think about that overall in terms of margins?","Bill W. Wheat","Margins were up 340 basis points, so year-over-year, it's very strong, of which, a little over half, 180 basis points, came strictly from improving market conditions, which is a combination of our raising sales prices more than our cost increased. So I think we're still seeing very good leverage within our margins and we do have -- we're optimistic that we can continue with more positive momentum on our margins.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then I guess wondering in terms of the comments there in terms of trends as the quarter went on, did you see -- you talked about some of the moderation. Was that from some of the new traffic? Do you have any issue in terms of can't [ph] that came in late in the quarter based on the mortgages? Or how do you classify that in terms of mortgage environment?","Bill W. Wheat","I think our traffic count is slower post the interest rate changes. And frankly, we've got good demand in all of our communities. It's just a slower demand, and it's also coupled with the fact that clearly this is a slow time of the year for the homebuilders in terms of being in -- starting in June. Typically sales start the slow down until Super Bowl Sunday. So I think it's all very normal other than the overreaction on the interest rates. And what we've typically seen is it's a short-term phenomenon. When rates are moving significantly during that timeframe, we see that moderation. But then, when things stabilize, it typically recovers. We don't see a long-term impact.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I can assure you that people who are sitting on the sidelines because interest rates are 5% versus 4.5%. We know one thing, rates are going to continue to increase, hopefully more moderately than what they did over the last 30- to 60-day period. But today, with the pricing on our products in our company in the industry as well as interest rates, it's still a wonderful time to buy a home. One of the highest affordability indexes yet.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jade Rahmani with KBW.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Have you seen any changes of note in the land markets since rates first started to increase whether it be volume of deals coming to market or competition from land buyers, or any players starting to adopt more conservative underwriting assumptions?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Not really. Land prices don't really react that quickly to interest rates and, typically, they don't react very much to interest rates at all. But land prices have worked their way up, and that's one of the reasons that we have focused on our margins versus our volume because, especially in the West, we have irreplaceable land positions out there at irreplaceable cost. And as a result, what we've been doing, I know people are questioning what's happening in our West. Well, our West, basically had increased our average sales price out there by 29.5% year-over-year. And we've had -- we earned 4x as much money out there in terms of pretax income over the same period year-over-year. So bottom line is, we're focusing on increasing our margins.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And just focusing on the Southwest and West segments, did those segments also have community count -- positive community count growth year-over-year?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes, they did. Community count in west was up 8%.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And what about the Southwest?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes, slightly up, low single digits up.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","It looks like you guys have done a lot to drive better gross margin performance. Do you think there's additional upside given the strong ASP performance in the back part of the year?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I'll tell you one factor that's really a strong indicator of our ability to do that. To answer your question directly, yes. I read recently that new home inventory is less than 4 months supply. So anytime you have less than 6 months supply, I'd say that inventory is constrained. So in most of our markets out there, coupled with the land and lot positions that we have and the construction cycles lengthening slightly, there is going to be good demand for housing going on a go-forward basis. And that's coupled with the fact that there's such a low inventory. But we got it. Okay?","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just one final question. On the SG&A line, you've -- obviously you've done a really good job of leveraging those costs. Is there other opportunities to make that work more in your favor given your expectations for better revenue?","Bill W. Wheat","Absolutely. We expect to continue to leverage that further. Our long-term goal is to have our SG&A at 10% consistently for the entire fiscal year. We're not quite there yet, so we definitely feel that there's opportunity there. And any time that we're able to raise our average selling prices, that helps significantly with leveraging our SG&A dollars.","Stacey H. Dwyer","And just in terms of expectations for next quarter, our normal seasonal deliveries are typically higher in Q4 than in Q3, which would typically help us improve our SG&A from quarter-to-quarter. And then we'd expect that to trend back up in Q1 and Q2 and then re-lever back down in Q3 and Q4 next year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Will Randow from Citigroup.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of -- one thing I'm trying to understand is when I'm thinking about home price to income, there are certain regions where they're more expensive than others, particularly when I think about California versus Texas. Can you kind of talk about what's happening in terms of activity in the last month of the second quarter there? As well as is there a greater impact in the higher price markets where affordability suffer? For first-time homebuyers, rather sorry.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Certainly, as we increased our prices especially in California, there is an issue associated with people being able to qualify for those homes. But again, there is -- in the West in particular, there is a shortage of finished homes, new homes in that market. And with -- even though we are losing buyers out of the pool who can afford our homes, nevertheless, the supply is constrained. So we're going to continue to press our pricing in that market as much as we can and let the chips fall where they're going to fall in terms of who can afford and who can't. There's still pricing power in California. There's still issues associated with getting entitlements in California. So again, we look at our land and lot inventory in California and we feel like that we're in a preeminent position and we're going to capitalize on that preeminent position and drop the money into the bottom line. In Texas, generally speaking, homes continue to be affordable here. One of the most affordable places to live in country. And house -- there's no real barriers to entry. There's no, really, constraints to being able to build our units here like there are in a lot of states. So Texas will continue to be one of our leading states in our company just simply because of the fact that there's good demand here and there are very few barriers to entry here, and our costs are better here than most markets.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And as a follow-up, you've been sitting on those assets in Hawaii, in Oahu, if I remember correctly, for a while. It's about 10% of lot count. How is that progressing?","Donald J. Tomnitz","It's progressing very well. We're getting closer. But there are a lot of political issues that always are associated with a piece of land this size. And so therefore, we don't comment on anything other than the fact that we're making nice progress over there and we're getting cooperation. And I believe the project is in the next 12 to 18 months going to make a lot of progress.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question on the -- sorry to go back to the subject of the day. But I think the clarity is helpful and I appreciate all your comments so far. With the community count growth continuing to be double digits, number one, I just want to understand if what was the community count average community count growth during the quarter? And it would seem to imply a plus or minus flattish growth on-sales pace, and I was wondering if the sales pace kind of went negative on a year-over-year basis as you went through the quarter and if that's still the case for July.","Mike Murray","We looked at -- community counts went up 19% for the quarter as we talked about, and it would imply a bit of a drop in sales per community on pace because sales were up 12%. But opening new communities, you tend to hit a ramp-up period early on in the community life as you grow that community up. So that's not initially unexpected for us to have a slight lag between opening a community and then getting the full velocity of sales you expect in that community.","Bill W. Wheat","And what's still most important to us is our dollar value of sales, which was up 30% relative to our community counts up 19%. So we are generating still more dollars through our sales line per community than we were a year ago.","Stacey H. Dwyer","And Bill had mentioned that our sales in each of the months in the June quarter were positive compared to the prior year...","Bill W. Wheat","Both units and dollars.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Right. We're not done this July yet, but July is showing what we would expect in terms of normal seasonality compared to what we saw in June.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I appreciate that and sorry that I missed the 19% number. On the pricing trends, though, also if you could give us some sense, I think part of the concern here is certainly that not only would pace slow to some degree, and of course, it's hard to parse out seasonality versus the rate impact, although clearly, there's some impact. But that also the rate of price increases would slow. Have you seen that in any of your markets? And Bill, you had mentioned one of the things you typically would do also is maybe adjust incentives. Have you begun to see any adjustments in that area? And how would that necessarily affect gross margins down the line?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Let me be very clear, Michael. We have seen no lack of ability to increase our prices. There's still, as I said, there's what 3.9 months supply of new homes available in the marketplace, and that would indicate to you that there's a shortage of new homes out there. The construction cycles are lengthening. I think our pricing power continues to increase certainly over the next 12 to 18 months.","Bill W. Wheat","No changes in incentives. If anything, our incentives are still being reduced. And as I we've mentioned, there are a number of communities particularly in the West where we have been proactively slowing our sales in order to align it with our construction cycles. And so in those cases, we're raising prices.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I don't think there's any question that interest rates adversely affected our sales increase, which was 12% on a unit basis and 30% on a dollar basis. But nevertheless, we're in a great position right now to continue to raise prices and there's a shortage of homes out there. I just don't see any negative associated with that our industry or, certainly, our company for the next 12 to 18 months.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim with Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, I know there's been a lot of conversation here about the rates. And I think that you've been very clear about the fact that you are seeing some impact on the volume, but you still believe that your pricing power is very much intact due to affordability levels, et cetera. Yet, it's also pretty clear that in the minds of most investors, that the impact of rates usually or is expected to be felt more on price actually than volume, because volumes industry-wide are so depressed. And so your comments, first of all, are interesting in that regard. And then secondly, I think that pretty much you're the first builder so far to talk openly about the fact that rates are having an impact on demand. So I wanted to touch a little bit, if I could, do you have in any way an estimate of what amount of volume impact the rates you think had? And if you said that already, I apologize that I missed it. And I guess, what I'm thinking about here is, in markets, can you talk about traffic or something like that, like traffic came down or something like that, to help us frame the conversation?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think you can take a look -- what I look at is the cancellation rate. And I think when rates went up, I think we had cans associated with interest rates going up. Our can rate last quarter was 19%, this quarter was 24%. Year-over-year, it was 23% versus 24%. So if you look at just the time period when interest rates went up, Steve, which was this quarter, and compare it to the previous quarter, I would say, the way I would measure it is the difference between 19% and 24% in terms of our can rate.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Interesting. Okay, yes. Because I usually think of cancellation rates as a seasonal event or a seasonally influenced metric because it's a -- but in any case, it is interesting you mentioned you think those cans relate to the previous quarter and there's are seasonal aspect to your sales. So I usually think of cans year-on-year. So I guess to help us understand then the can rate, did your cancellation in actual units accelerate through the quarter? I'm assuming it did. And if you were to sort of maintain that level that you -- of cancellations you've seen as you go forward, what would that imply in terms of the drag on order growth into the, let's say, the -- your fourth quarter, which is a September quarter?","Bill W. Wheat","In terms of the rate, 5% differential from quarter-to-quarter, we did see the rates higher in the back half of the quarter from that standpoint. So yes, I think Don's statements are definitely right on target in terms of the -- a way to measure the impact.","Stacey H. Dwyer","In terms of projecting that one, that one's a little harder to answer. But again, we don't think this takes long to absorb in the market. People who start shopping today are going to start shopping with a 4.5% interest rate in mind, and it won't be a difference in their expectations from when they first began looking at a home. So this is -- this will be a short-term moderation.","Bill W. Wheat","The other thing we have not talked about here is the home doesn't necessarily stay the same. What we typically see is buyers, they take a step back, they evaluate their choices and they may choose to buy a different home, they may choose to buy a 2,200 square foot home rather than 24 square foot home. They may make adjustments to the choice and that just takes time, which is why we say it typically as a short-term impact.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think everybody's just going to have to get accustomed to the fact that we're in a slightly rising interest rate environment and as like Don Horton said, who was his first salesman, this first cleanup guy and this first homebuilder, when he got started in the business. When he was sitting in this sales office, interest rates tick up 0.8%, you're not going to see anybody for a while because people are frankly a little freaked about, \"well, I missed the low.\" And, \"Why didn't I buy a home when rates were 0.8% lower.\" But those people come back and they're ultimately, most of them, going to buy. So as we work through all this, this is a normal part of our business. People are overreacting to a little run-up in interest rates here. And say, well, geez, the homebuilding industry is going to a crater just because interest rates went up. You're missing the point. We have the highest affordability index, perhaps ever in the industry. We've got pricing power and interest rates are not going to deter people from buying homes to any large extent. It may delay those purchases, but it's not going to be a permanent effect.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ken Zener with KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Don, I'm glad to see your enthusiasm is increasing here for defending. And I think you laid out a case -- I think, I'm not sure if that's what you're missing. And I think if we look at the West where you're -- myself being based out of San Francisco, I see the price, I see the limited supply. But you're balancing the margins against the ability of people to buy. And obviously, rising interest rates is what we're going to have, historically good for home prices, which is a demand generator. But if all the builders including yourself, and this is what's really surprising, are managing pace and margin, why not -- first, if gross margins are at 21%, why not shoot for 20% and go for more volume? And well -- okay, go ahead.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Clearly, we will. We feel like we've got a wonderful window here where we can continue to drop dollars into the bank as opposed to units into the bank, and we're going to maximize our opportunity. I like to say I will never forget in my 30 years in the industry, '07, '08 and '09, those are pathetic years. And the buyer had the advantage on us during those time periods simply because there was excess inventory. Now, there's not as much inventory out there. So as a result, now we have a slight advantage simply because of the limited inventory that's out there. We're still offering our buyers a wonderful metric in terms of affordability and a wonderful house at a wonderful price, the prices -- it's time for prices to go up simply because land prices are going up, cost of building a house are going up. So if you're in a home -- if you look out there waiting to buy a home for 6 months from now because you think rates are going to be better or costs are going to be better, you're missing the boat.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","True, I understand that perspective. But it seems to me, if you look at the '04, '05 period, you have decelerating orders, people care a lot about that, A. B, you're focusing at the industry and I thought correctly amidst sustained absorption, but I mean we're seeing decelerating absorption and they -- you guys can build these homes. You have the land, the industry that is. But it seems to me if the industry is -- the public builders are focused on price and pace, it points to a lower cyclical component. I mean I know the demand's out there, but you're letting some of the demand go to focus on the margin and price. Maybe it means that we're mid-cycle already. It's hard to believe at 1 million. Or there's as much slower recovery rate, which means it takes longer to monetize the volume. Can you just kind of talk about that? Because it seems like at a lower volume, it might be more profitable, but people still need that volume, the companies.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I look at our volume, and I think our volume, based upon year-over-year and sequentially, our volume is improving very nicely. There's nothing wrong with a double-digit increase in sales, units and there's nothing with our 30-plus percent increase in sales dollars. So I'm not freaking out because they're not 40% or 50%. I mean 12% and 30% are fine numbers. Now clearly, we've been in this business long enough to know that when the volume begins to decline too much, then we're going to adjust our incentives and move forward. But right now, I have no desire to do that because, like I say, we're in the heart of the market right now. We've got lack of supply. We've got wonderful pricing power that we haven't had for 5 or 6 years. And it would be a bad decision for us and for our shareholders to go out there and look for excessive volume today just so we can say, well, we had a 25% increase in units versus a 12%, because we're increasing our profit so much more dramatically.","Stacey H. Dwyer","And Ken, I'm going to answer it from a slightly different direction. We're taking different approaches in different communities. We're taking different approaches in different markets. If you look at our regional breakdown, 3 of our regions had unit increases of 25% plus. And those are markets where we've been successful in tying up a lot of land. We can replace land at prices that are similar to what we currently own, and we have a good supply in front of us. There are other regions where land prices have moved more significantly and we're going to take longer to work through the positions that we have and maximize the profits because we can't replace them. So it's a blended approach. It's not one approach or another, but it's trying to maximize the returns with the positions that we currently have.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And furthermore, I've been with Horton for 30 years. We have the strongest balance sheet in the history of our company. And why would we want to go out and just chase volume and have to basically end up with a less-strong balance sheet just simply because we're having to replace the land at a much higher price than what we can slowly work through these assets, or our margin -- or work through these assets [indiscernible] drop below.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I understand. Was the cancellation rate different by product and by region?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes.","Stacey H. Dwyer","There was some variation on cancellation rate by region. It ranged from 13% to 25%. But I don't have really any visibility into the breakdown of the product behind that. The difference in the cancellation rate, just to take that one step further, was actually pretty similar compared to the prior year. So there was just some difference in the cancellation rate in the region last year as well.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Alex Barr\u00f3n from the Housing Research Center.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","As far as I'm concerned, I think you should be feeling pretty good because your results were a lot better than everybody else's.","Donald J. Tomnitz","We feel very good and obviously, somebody got me cranked up with my Type A personality. We feel very good here, thank you.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","I guess my question is, it seems like the overall sentiment is that as interest rates rise, the guys who get hurt the most is entry-level buyers and you guys probably cater more to the entry-level buyers and other builders. Especially as the cycle has unfolded, I think you've taken advantage of land positions that maybe other people have overlooked. So my question is do you think that ultimately if rates stay here, you'll end up benefiting from kind of like a substitution effect where maybe they can't afford somebody else's home and they'll come buy yours? Or is it you think that entry-level buyers do have more challenges than which just ultimately prices them out?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I just think, generally speaking, entry-level buyers obviously are more challenged from a credit perspective in terms of qualifying for our homes. But I would also say that our focus on entry-level is certainly not a weakness, it's a strength because we've been the leader of entry-level homes for years and years and years. And just like Don Horton said back when Chairman Paul Volcker and President Ronald Reagan were President, and mortgage rates were 18% and prime rate was 21.5%, we were still selling homes. And if you listen -- what's interesting to me, I even listen to business commentators on television talk about, \"Well, geez, the first time I bought my home, I had a 12% mortgage rate, but that didn't deter me from buying a home.\" So I believe that for us and our perspective and our experience, that entry-level buyers will always be welcome at Horton and will always be a large component of our business, and we'll always work with them in terms of trying to figure out how we get them qualified for a home. And frankly, we have our Home Buyers Club, which is a part of our mortgage company, which is really a very efficient process and a very successful process that most people, most other builders don't have of getting those first-time homebuyers familiar with the credit system in this country and helping them understand what it takes for them to buy a home.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","And in terms of I guess adjusting to if the sales rate stays lower than perhaps where they were, where you want them to be, is the progression to basically just increase incentives again or to just stop raising prices? Or how does that work in your mind?","Bill W. Wheat","Well, first, our sales are not lower than we want them to be. Our sales are according to plan, and -- but it's community-by-community. Depending on what we're seeing in a community, we will adjust. Right now, we're raising prices in many more communities than we're not. So right now, it's on plan. But it is a constant day-to-day adjustment process, community-by-community.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And don't get confused, and I know you're not, Alex. For our industry to continue to grow, we absolutely must-have job growth in this country. And to date, the job growth in this country has been very minimal. And the industry cannot continue to grow at the rates that we all want to grow without effective job creation in this country.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jim Krapfel for Morningstar.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I'm just wondering what your mix of land acquisition is? In terms of raw land versus finished lots? And then to what extent are you using options on finished lots?","Bill W. Wheat","During the quarter, we invested $263 million in purchases of finished lots. We invested $280 million in land purchases, and we invested $167 million in land development.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I don't know if I missed this, but your ASP per square foot, your cost per square foot, was that -- did you say that before?","Bill W. Wheat","I don't believe we have yet. We still have positive gap in terms of ASP per square foot versus cost. Our ASP per square-foot was up 7.9% and our cost per square foot, I believe, was up 7.2%.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, finally, I know in the prior quarter, you talked about looking at M&A opportunities. Are you still looking at that?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We're always engaged in M&A opportunities, and that's really all we can say about it. We've been one of the more prolific acquirers in the industry, and we will continue to be in that segment of the business.","Operator","Our next question is coming from David Goldberg from UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question, and I think I don't want to beat a dead horse here, and I think you guys have done a very good job talking about affordability and buyers and everything. But I wanted to ask the question from a little bit different perspective. So accept my apologies in advance that we're beating this horse. But I think the question is really about variable mortgages and whether you're seeing a shift from a fixed-rate, 30-year fixed-rate product to adjustable-rate mortgages in the mortgage business? And is that something that you guys use to try to work with buyers that are having affordability issues especially in the club and trying to get folks able to qualify for loans. Have you seen a shift there? And is it something you guys would kind of push towards a buyer? You go to a 7-1 arm if the 30-year fixed-rate wasn't working?","Stacey H. Dwyer","First of all, we have not seen any significant shift at all from fixed-rate mortgages. Even at a 4.5% rate, I think everyone's happy to pretty much lock that in. And second, we will present the product alternatives that are available, but we do not try to help anyone make their mortgage decision in terms of a product.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe I said that the wrong way. So I apologize. It wasn't meant to be inferred. It just seemed like that's an option for somebody.","Stacey H. Dwyer","That's fine. Adjustable rates are out there, but there's not a big-enough spread right now between the fixed-rate mortgage and adjustable-rate mortgage to make it a truly attractive alternative. And so again, with rates where they are, even though they've moved up -- with rates where they are, if people can lock in for 30 years I think everyone feels pretty good with that for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","No, I agree. I was thinking hypothetically as we move forward, I guess was the point of the question. But totally understood.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Hypothetically, moving forward, if the spread increases, that may be more appealing to people. But right now, we're not seeing that.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And I think that's one of the things people are missing about our entry-level segment of our businesses is as interest rates do work their up and the pool of affordable buyers decreases, you increase that pool by basically different types of financial instruments and different types of mortgages. And certainly fixed-rate are great today, variable rate are going to be better and help buyers get a house in 12 to 18 months. So we'll use whatever instruments are out there to help them.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Well said. And not everyone's missing it [ph], so that's the good thing. My second question was on cycle times. And I think there was -- in the commentary, I think, Stacey, you might have mentioned about cycle times extending, and trying to match sales pace with cycle times and not getting too far out ahead of yourself in terms of the cost side and the price side. I was wondering if you guys could give us some color kind of some more color around cycle times, and if that's something that's actually easing a little bit? It seems like a lot of builders are actually metering our pace at this point, and it seems like maybe some of the subcontractors have kind of increased the size of their labor force just to try to adjust to this some increased demand in the market.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, the cycle times are increasing. And of course, that's one of the things that we -- that's reflective on our sales, because we concluded that that doesn't make a lot of sense to pre-sell way ahead of ourselves and be subject to variances and changes in our cost structure. We'd rather sell the home closer to the point in time where we absolutely know for certain the vast majority of our cost before we proceed. So as a result, a number of our subcontractors are increasing the size of their operations. But I also will tell you that there's a big percentage of subcontractors out there who don't want to grow their businesses back to the size that they were in '03, '04 and '05. So I think there is some constrained supply of contractors out there. And as a result, one of the reasons that we are pacing our sales with our construction cycle is to make sure that we're maximizing our margins as we close those out.","Stacey H. Dwyer","I think another thing that's impacting our cycle times a little bit is the move towards the larger houses. They're just going to take a little bit longer to build than the smaller square footage houses that may not have as much interior finish out work to do.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And clearly, those homes are more profitable. And as a result, if the cycle time is longer to build a home, we expect to get paid more for the home.","Operator","Our next question is coming from James McCanless from Sterne Agee.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","First question I had was the detail that you gave from Horton's mortgage operations that only 44% of buyers this quarter were first-time. Was that a function of the sample set or is that related to interest rates and people having to try and requalify or bring more down payment to the table?","Bill W. Wheat","No I think it's reflective of the shift that we've seeing really over the last 1.5 years, gradually getting back to a more normal mix for us. Historically, first-time homebuyers were around 40%, and we've been much higher than that, but it's been moving down. We did see a step down this quarter to 44%, still above the long-term average. But I think we're just continuing to move back to that more normal mix.","James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","The second question I had is, to beat the rate horse another way, is if rates continue to move higher from here, how does that affect Horton's spec strategy? Do you become a little more conservative? Just would love to get your take on that?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I don't know that rates have anything to do with our spec strategy. What has to do with our spec strategy is having the proper number of specs in each one of our communities and based upon the absorption level and what we look at is how many homes are we selling over a construction cycle and how many do we need to have at any one point of time to make sure that we're able to attract the buyer who is relocating. Or most importantly, since realtors are a very instrumental portion of our sales across the country, we want to make sure that when a realtor brings a buyer to our subdivision that we have something that we can move someone into within 30 days. So as a result of the spec strategy, they're really not impacted by interest rates. It's impacted by demand and also being able to have the product for our realtors who are very instrumental in selling a lot of our homes.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mike Roxland from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Given the rise in rates, have you seen any particular markets that were particularly adversely affected by the rising rates and by the short-term jumps? Rates went up 100 bps, and in the 30- or 60-day period, you pointed out -- but just anything that -- any particular markets that really retrenched and how you adjusted?","Donald J. Tomnitz","No, sir. It's pretty much even across the board. No significance other than if you back into what the cancellation rate like Stacey said, there were some that had some of our markets had higher cancellation rates than others. But generally speaking, there was no shift in the cancellation rates that was really different across our regions.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Are there any markets that you're considering, let's say, pulling back from yourself as you deem it to be more susceptible to rates? I know you haven't seen anything, any shift thus far. But if rates continue on this trajectory, how do you think about land investment? Are you looking to really focus in particular regions more given the fact they may be more defensive or more -- or less susceptible to widening spreads?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Not really. We're very happy with the markets that we're in and we're well diversified in most in every one of our markets from entry-level to mid-priced homes to high-priced homes. As I said, we're rolling out Emerald in most of our divisions. So we're well-positioned product-wise and pricing-wise in every one of our markets. We're looking at our investment strategy. We're not focused on rates. What we're focused on is the economy in each of our markets. That's really the driver of housing demand. If we're seeing a strong economy with good indicators, job growth, income growth in a market, then that would be an attractive environment for investment regardless of where rates are.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just last quick question. I know the Emerald product, obviously, is something that is new to you. Obviously, you've analyzed it over the last couple of years. But it's a new product for you. Can you remind us of the strategy that you're pursuing to target that end buyer and how that strategy differs, let's say, than the entry level?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, let's not get confused. We've been building expensive homes in this company for quite some time all the way back in '02, '03, '04 and '05 and what we've done is more formalized and identified the product line and come up with the product name so that we could maximize that exposure across the country. But in terms of Emerald in particular, basically, the people that we're competing directly with are, as I said before, the small and medium-sized undercapitalized semi-custom builder. And certainly, we're not trying to build custom homes with our Emerald product, but yes, we're offering luxury homes that are more well-defined floor plans which permit the buyer to choose more options. And clearly, we have a different group of subcontractors who are building those. So it's a different quality of home because a luxury buyer demands a different level of quality in the home and, basically, has a slightly longer construction cycle than our other homes. But generally speaking, we're just appealing to that luxury buyer who basically is looking for a larger home with more amenities in a better location.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Joel Locker from FBN Securities.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just wondering if you have the order breakdown per month in the third quarter to come up with the 68 22.","Bill W. Wheat","We said we were up year-over-year in each of the months, I don't believe we've given the month-to-month increases. We typically do not. We don't typically comment on individual percentages per month. We talk about the quarter and we talk but the trends for the quarter.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Right. I was just wondering if you guys had a unit number for each. But on community count, how much did that increase from the end of the second quarter to the end of the third quarter?","Bill W. Wheat","The actual -- 19%. 5%. 5% sequentially.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","5%. So was that the average or the actually ending count?","Bill W. Wheat","That's the average.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I'm just thinking, if you look at absorptions based on those numbers down about 18% per community from the March quarter to the June quarter, I mean that's -- what is usually flattish kind that scenario. At what point does it come to where you say, \"Okay, we did pricing and let's increase incentives just to get absorption rate back up.\" Because that is a pretty dramatic fall on a community count basis.","Bill W. Wheat","Seasonally, we would normally see a decline this time of the year. Yes, 18%, maybe a little bit higher drop than what would normally be. But yes, we're going to take this community-by-community. And depending on what we're seeing in each community, we'll make adjustments. You really cannot generalize what we will do across our country when we're in as many markets and communities that we're in.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Again, I'm going to go back to my original statement. We're not apologizing for a 12% increase in sales and a 30% increase in dollars. And with the kind of margins that we've increased this quarter, we're very proud of those numbers. If anybody's confused, call me.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I'll leave the rate horse alone for now. But I do want to ask about just the mix of capital being deployed in terms of the land spend. And it still seems like a large amount of the land spend is going to buy new lots, finished or unfinished relative to the amount of land being developed. You guys already have quite a large bank of land to work on. So I'm guessing I'm wondering why not reallocate more into developing what you've already got given the shortage of finished lots in the industry that's out there. Or do you feel like -- is this indicative that you feel like some of the land that you have just maybe isn't positioned quite correctly for where the target buyers are in terms of the move up or the luxury buyer?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Simply a timing issue. We've acquired the land over the course of the last 3 quarters, and we're now -- you're going to see us over the course of the next 3 quarters. We're going to have a lot more development spend than we are going to have land spend. So it's just a timing issue.","Bill W. Wheat","And you're already seeing the trend. Development spending is about double what it was last year. So it's been steadily growing as we've been bringing our new projects into line, and we're doing the development through phases.","Donald J. Tomnitz","It takes a while after we buy the land, frankly, to get it engineered and get it designed. And so if even though we want to start moving dirt as quickly as possible, there's a gap between the time we buy and the time we start moving dirt.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Can you give us sort of any quantification on what you'd be targeting to spend for land development versus new land acquisition over the next 12 months or so?","Bill W. Wheat","I think if you look at the quarter-to-quarter trends, they've been steadily stepping up and we expect them to continue to steadily step up each quarter as we go into fiscal '14. But we're not in a position to necessarily quantify the specific dollar amounts. But I think you will see steady increases in the level of development.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Frankly, right now, we're well-positioned with our land inventory as you pointed out. So now the focus is on not buying as much land as we have in the last 3 or 4 quarters but more in terms of developing what we have.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And lastly, I just was wondering if you could provide maybe some context or maybe just some perspective on what's going on in Washington the past few days regarding the bill that is circulating about the house, about GSE reform, whether or not there's going to be a government backstop for the mortgage market or not. It seems to be having an impact already on mortgage rates. What's D.R. Horton's position? What do you think -- how does that affect your thinking? And are you maybe risk-adjusting your capital spend based on what's happening in Washington and where do you think that shakes out?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, frankly, we are trying to stay out of politics. And who knows what they're ultimately going to come up with in Washington. But I feel very comfortable that we'll be able to adapt to whatever they come up with on mortgages, GSEs, or whatever it is, just like we have for the last 30 years. So I want to stay out of politics because it's...","Bill W. Wheat","No upside.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes, no upside.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the floor back to management for any further or closing comments.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Just want to say thank you. We're very proud of our quarter. As like I said before, if you're confused, call us because we're very proud of our quarter. We're focusing on profitability and, again, to quote our ex-CFO, we never can make a coupon payment or we can't make a deposit in the bank on a unit. We're making it on dollars. We're going to continue to focus on growing our company conservatively as we have, keeping our strong balance sheet and focusing on profitability. And again, D.R. and I want to thank all of our employees. You're doing an extraordinary job of competing in a good, new environment that we have out there. So let's continue to do that, and we're outperform everyone else in the industry. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Please go ahead, Jessica.","Jessica Hansen","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning.

The supplementary information includes historical data on gross margins, changes in active selling communities, product mix, and our mortgage operations.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.","David V. Auld","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I\u2019m pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our D.R. Horton team started the year with a strong first quarter, setting us up for a great 2016. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased to $241 million on $2.4 billion of revenue. And our pre-tax operating margin improved 40 basis points to 10%.","Our homes sold increased 9% compared to the first quarter of last year due to improved absorptions. These results reflect a solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to expand our industry leading market share. We plan to maintain consistent, broad product diversity with our three brands over the long-term.","Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pre-tax profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing our returns. With a sales backlog of 10,665 homes at the end of December, positive sales trends in January and a well-stocked supply of land, lots, and homes, we are well-positioned for the spring selling season and for 2016. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Net income for the first quarter increased to 11% to $158 million or $0.42 per diluted share compared to $143 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 9% to $241 million in the first quarter compared to $221 million in the year-ago quarter. And homebuilding pre-tax income increased 11% to $229 million compared to $206 million in the prior year quarter.","Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 4% to 2.3% -- $2.3 billion on 8,061 homes closed, up from $2.2 billion on $7,973 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $290,400, up 3% compared to the prior year due to an increase in our average sales price per square foot.","This quarter entry-level homes marketed under our Express Homes brand accounted for 22% of homes closed, and 15% of home sales revenue. Our homes for higher-end, move-up, and luxury buyers priced greater than $500,000 accounted for 7% of our homes closed and 16% of our home sales revenue. Mike?","Michael J. Murray","The value of our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 12% from a year-ago quarter to $2.4 billion and homes sold increased 9% to 8,064 homes on a relatively flat active selling community account. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter increased 3% to $293,700. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 23%, down from 24% in the year-ago quarter.","The value of our backlog increased 16% from a year-ago to $3.2 billion, with an average sales price per home of $297,600, and homes in backlog increased 15% to 10,665 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the first quarter was 76%, within the range we guided to on our fourth quarter call. We expect our second quarter backlog conversion rate to be in the range of 82% to 85%. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 19.9%, consistent with the fourth quarter and up 10 basis points from the first quarter of last year. The consistency in our gross margin reflects the stability of most of our markets today. We are raising prices or reducing incentives when possible in communities where we\u2019re achieving our target absorptions and we\u2019re also working to control cost increases.","Our general gross margin expectations remain unchanged. In the current housing market we continue to expect our average home sales gross margin to generally be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix and the relative impact of warranty and interest costs. As a reminder, our reported gross margins include all of our interest costs. David?","David V. Auld","In the first quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense was $243 million compared to $238 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A improved 30 basis points to 10.3%, compared to 10.6% in the prior-year quarter. As our revenue increase improved our leverage of fixed overhead costs.","We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our current and expected growth. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Financial services pre-tax income in the first quarter was $12.3 million compared to $14.6 million in the year-ago quarter. 90% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 51% of our home buyers.","FHA and VA loans accounted for 50% of the mortgage company's volume, compared to 42% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company this quarter had an average FICO score of 714, and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. First time home buyers represented 43% of the closings handled by our mortgage company compared to 40% in the first quarter last year. Mike?","Michael J. Murray","At the end of December, we had 21,500 homes in inventory, of which 1,600 were models, 11,300 of our total homes were spec homes, with 7,700 in various stages of construction and 3,600 completed. Our construction in progress and finished homes inventory increased by $291 million during the quarter, as we prepare for seasonally higher demand in the spring.","Our first quarter investments in lots, land, and development totaled $627 million, an increase of 11% from the first quarter last year. $360 million was to replenish finished lots and land and $262 million was for land development. We expect that our investments in land and development for the full-year of 2016 will be at least 20% greater than fiscal 2015. David?","David V. Auld","At December 31, 2015, our portfolio consisted of 178,000 lots, of which 117,000 are owned and 61,000 are controlled through option contracts, which represents a 10% increase in our option position since year-end. 69,000 of our total lots are finished, of which 33,000 are owned and 36,000 are optioned. Our 178,000 total lots owned and controlled provide us a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market with a sufficient lot supply to support solid growth in sales and closings in future periods.","Although our housing inventories will fluctuate as we manage each of our communities to optimize returns, we expect our land and lot inventory to remain relatively stable to slightly higher in 2016, which will result in positive cash flows. In the first quarter, we used $1.5 million of operating cash, an improvement of $128 million compared to the first three months of last year. Mike?","Michael J. Murray","During the first quarter, we reported $1.5 million in land option charges for write-offs of earnest money deposits and due diligence costs for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded $500,000 of inventory impairment charges. We will continue to evaluate our inventories for potential impairment, which may result in future charges. But the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate as they have in the past. Our inactive land held for development of $185 million at the end of the quarter represents 10,500 lots, down 24% from a year-ago. We continue to work through each of our remaining inactive land parcels to improve cash flows and returns and we expect that our land held for development will continue to decline. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","At December 31, our homebuilding liquidity included $1.2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $871 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility. We had no cash borrowings and $104 million of letters of credit outstanding on the revolver.","Our gross homebuilding leverage ratio was 35.5%, and our homebuilding leverage ratio net of cash was 25.7%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at December 31 was $3.3 billion. On January 15, we repaid $170 million of senior notes after maturity and now we\u2019ve $373 million of maturities remaining in fiscal 2016. At December 31, our shareholder's equity was $6.1 billion, and book value per share was $16.39, up 14% from a year-ago. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Our expectations for fiscal 2016 remain unchanged from what we shared on our November call and are based on current housing market conditions. We continue to expect to generate a consolidated pre-tax operating margin of 10.5% to 11% for fiscal 2016.","We also still expect to generate consolidated revenues of between $12 billion and $12.5 billion and to close between 39,500 and 41,500 homes. We anticipate our home sales gross margin for the full-year of 2016 will be in the high 19%s to 20%, with potential quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21%.","We estimate that our annual homebuilding SG&A expense will be in the range of 9.2% to 9.4% of homebuilding revenues, with the second quarter of the year higher than this range and the third and fourth quarters below the range.","We expect our annual financial services operating margin to range from 30% to 33%. We are forecasting our fiscal 2016 income tax rate to be between 35% and 36%, and our diluted share count to be approximately 375 million shares. We also continue to expect to generate $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flow from operations.","Our fiscal 2016 results will be significantly impacted by the spring selling season, and we will update our expectations each quarter as visibility to the spring and full-year becomes clearer. For the second fiscal quarter of 2016, we expect our number of homes closed will approximate a beginning backlog conversion rate in a range of 82% to 85%.","We anticipate our second quarter home sales gross margin will be in the high 19%s to 20%, consistent with the first quarter and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the second quarter to be in the range of 10.3% to 10.6% of homebuilding revenues. David?","David V. Auld","In closing, our first quarter growth in sales and profits and the improvement in our pre-tax margin are the result of the strength of our people and operating platform. We are excited and prepared for the spring selling season and opportunities ahead.","We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pre-tax profit at a double-digit annual pace while continuing to generate positive cash flows and improved returns. We are well-positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet; industry-leading market share; broad geographic footprint; diversified product offering across our D.R. Horton, Emerald, and Express brands; attractive finished lot and land positions; and, most importantly, our tremendous team across the country.","We would like to thank all of our employees for the continued hard work and we look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operations during 2016. Let\u2019s keep the momentum from January going, week-by-week into the spring.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll now host questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Nishu Sood","Thank you and thank you for all of the details as well. First question I wanted to ask, the tone that you are describing to begin the year is pretty positive. You mentioned January orders being positive. That\u2019s -- that could imply a pretty broad range, so I was wondering if you could be more specific? And more broadly, the tone that you\u2019re describing, it sounds like it is sufficient to -- the absorption momentum is sufficient to meet your revenue and closing expectations for the year. So I was wondering if you could just comment on that as well please.","David V. Auld","Well, we\u2019ve a positive tone, because we\u2019re seeing positive things happen out in the market. And with the absorptions improvement on the relatively flat community count, less pressure on margins, it was a good first quarter, and what we\u2019re seeing going into January gives us a lot of confidence. ","Bill W. Wheat","And Nishu just to share -- just a little bit more about January, we\u2019re seeing week-by-week accelerating sales pace as we\u2019d expect to see in January and certainly consistent with typical seasonality and certainly in line with our expectations and our budget. So we\u2019re feeling good about what we\u2019re seeing so far, what we produced in the first quarter, sales we\u2019re seeing so far in January are right in line with our plans and certainly is sufficient to generate the volume that we\u2019re guiding too for the year.","Nishu Sood","Great. Thanks. And second question, you folks have had a strategy of being more capital efficient, focusing on return of inventory, call with the past 12 or 18 months or so. You\u2019ve clearly been successful with that, judging from the amount of cash and liquidity that you\u2019ve at the moment. So normally a build up of cash like this is the way that you would behave, if you\u2019re expecting a downturn in the market, or if you were trying to batten down the hatches. So without an increase in the dividend or a share buyback, what are your thoughts here, and is that characterization correct? I mean, how can you be drawing back inventory when we still have 50% to 60% upside potential in single-family volumes going forward?","David V. Auld","Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re drawing back inventory. As a matter of fact, we\u2019re guiding, I think, this year to be up 15%, 20% and what we\u2019re pushing out.","Bill W. Wheat","Spending, yes.","David V. Auld","Spending, yes. So the focus on efficiency gains and returns, I think are have little to do with what we\u2019re thinking about whether the market is going to be good or bad. It has a lot to do with, I think, driving to become the best Company in the industry. And the liquidity and strong balance sheet gives us a lot of flexibility and we will see what we do with the cash. I mean, it\u2019s \u2026","Bill W. Wheat","Nishu, we still see opportunities to invest in the business. We still do expect our land spend to be up -- land and development spend to be up 20% this year. We\u2019re continuing to add lots under option contracts and control for future growth in that direction. But as David said, continuing to drive a more efficient business model for our self helps us improve our operational disciplines across the board. And that\u2019s been a consistent focus we\u2019ll have with this Company for a long time and we are seeing a lot of this results bearing fruit right now. And we will be looking to pay off debt with the existing cash. We just paid off, I think, $170 million in January and we\u2019ve another maturity in April of $370 million.","Nishu Sood","Okay.","Bill W. Wheat","So, we feel real good about it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen East","Thank you. Good morning, guys. David, could you just talk a little bit -- obviously we are getting a lot of questions about Texas and what\u2019s happening with oil. Could you talk a little bit, sort of rank order your cities as far as the percentage of your business? And maybe talk a little bit about the demand trends that you are seeing and where you all are investing within the state either -- well I\u2019m looking at, not only investing in communities, but also are you targeting either Express, or Emerald or it was pretty much across the board?","David V. Auld","Stephen, pretty much across the board on what we\u2019re targeting pushing out. The Express has been the driver, I think of market share gains, but Texas is in good shape. I\u2019ve spend the last two weeks driving the Dallas Fort Worth areas and I can tell you, if you can put a house in Texas and pretty much any market and sell it to make a margin at 250, you\u2019re going to sell houses. So we\u2019re focused on improving the value of the customer. We are focused on driving absorption levels up on a community-by-community basis and that has been a successful strategy for us in Texas. Whereas revenues and by cities, yes number one, Dallas Fort Worth, like we\u2019re 15% of the market share today. And to be honest with you, we believe we can expand that. So we love Texas.","Stephen East","All right. ","David V. Auld","We really love our operators in Texas.","Stephen East","Okay. And if I can just follow on the capital allocation that you talked about, your land and development be up about 20%? Did I understand you right, Mike, that your 370 this spring, you will actually pay that off? And then, as you look at M&A, one, what are you seeing out there, and what\u2019s your appetite for it?","Michael J. Murray","So we will with the 370 maturing, we\u2019ve adequate cash to pay that off today. And to be opportunistic if we look at any portion, some or all that in a refinancing depending upon where the markets look like and timing to hit that. With M&A, we continue to be very included, if you will, and look at a lot of opportunities. Borrowers pretty high for us and looking at acquisitions that make sense. We\u2019ve a great footprint today. We have good operations, and adding on to that is a high bar. So we are -- we would be very disciplined with on the M&A front.","Stephen East","Okay. Is the activity picked up?","Michael J. Murray","It\u2019s been running at a very high pace in terms of lots of activity for a while. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s picked up in the past quarter. It\u2019s been running at a good clip.","Stephen East","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Kim","Hey, guys. Good quarter. Lots of interesting things going on. I guess, the first question I had relates to what you are seeing with respect to the first time buyer activity and I know that at least in the entry level side as long as you to the degree those things kind of go hand-in-hand you all have been kind of leading the market with your express, but the data we look at shows that beginning in April of last year the first time buyer activity is markedly improved is now up nearly 20% year-on-year and yet, we\u2019re still not seeing your competitors indicating that they are seeing insufficient activity out there to warrant them going out there, so it\u2019s quite an unusual situation where you really seem to have that end of the market kind of to yourselves and so I guess I would just say can you shed a little light on A) are you in fact feeling a pick up in the market at the first time buyer area or second in the market since the Summer of last year. Did you -- have you seen that and B) do you have anymore current thinking as to how the competitive dynamics addressing that market may change or not in \u201916.","David V. Auld","Well as far as the market picking up, as we continue to push out the Express brand, we\u2019re continuing to see consistent absorption and demand. So we\u2019re in the process of pushing that brand out across the country and everywhere we\u2019ve gone, we\u2019ve seen good absorption and margins at or above what we underwrote them at. ","Michael J. Murray","To the competitive landscape certainly the entry level the lower end of the market is certainly the strongest right now and any time we see that in the market we expect further competition. You are right, we haven\u2019t seen a whole lot in a lot of our Markets, we probably haven't seen as much as we expected, but we do expect more as time goes on.","Stephen Kim","Great and then touching back on this interesting just position of strong of cash flow generation next year which is an unusual thing and usually doesn\u2019t happen early in a cycle, with your fairly optimistic commentary about the market and your position within it. I would just point out that your comment about a 20% increase in land spend next year would still employ a very low ratio relative to revenues which is just essentially you\u2019re basically barely replenishing what you are burning off in terms of dollars invested in land, which isn\u2019t a bad thing. Just that I would just point out, but that does still -- it sounds to me even though you are capturing that in terms to make it sound like you are sort of leaning forward on land investment. It actually isn\u2019t. It sounds to me like on balance you are being relatively judicious, very judicious actually historically in your land spend next year. And so I guess I\u2019m curious as to touching on what you\u2019ve said in the past. What you intend to do with the cash that you\u2019re going to be building here over the course of the next year? Do you for instance envision using that more for debt pay down, share repurchases, M&A, over the course of the next two to three years?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, Steven, first to your comment about this, replenishing our land supply. We feel very good about the level of our land supply in terms of what we own and we\u2019re that the 20% or greater spend that we\u2019re essentially expecting. Does replenish our land supply. We thought that is a sufficient level to support the growth expectations and guidance that we have provided, but we\u2019ve provided, but we\u2019re definitely taking a balanced approach, and keeping the investment levels within a disciplined range. And with that, that\u2019s definitely generating a lot of cash flow, as far as how we look at our cash positions today, we talked a bit about our debt -- debt maturities, to the extend the market is favorable. We would still issue new debt, to refinance rates are still certainly very attractive. And we continue to look for investments in our business. We see great investments that would push our lands spending up to 25% or 30%. We feel like a generator great return. We will do that and as Michael already talked about M&A, there are a lot of opportunities and hopefully there will be some come along that meet our threshold and this cash position puts us in a great flexible opportunistic position to be able to take advantage of that. And so today in terms of priorities, we\u2019d list investing in our business, which would include potential M&A. Taking care of our debt maturity is a long way as our top priorities and beyond that we\u2019re going to remind in a flexible and opportunistic position for the next year.","Stephen Kim","Well it\u2019s a good position to be in, so congratulations for putting yourselves in that position, thanks.","Bill W. Wheat","Thank you.","Jessica Hansen","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Alan Ratner","Hi, good morning guys, and thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter. First question is on the spec [indiscernible] homes. if I think, I\u2019m looking at the right number here, it looks like year-over-year you are down roughly 20% on completed specs, 10% on total and yes, I think that you are expecting relatively lower growth this year than last year but is there any conservatism baked in there just given some of the macro uncertainties we are seeing now where maybe just talk a little bit about the thought process and where you see your spec count heading into the selling season?","David V. Auld","I would -- this is David. I would say no baked in. We are attempting to continue to do what we\u2019ve been doing which is consolidate market share in a market-by-market program. We are measuring and trying to control the finished inventory and keep it turning, because that drives SG&A leverage and it also drives significant efficiencies in the operations, so \u2026","Bill W. Wheat","We feel like we are in a good position for the spring, started a lot of houses in the first quarter, we\u2019re going to start with a lot of houses in the Second Quarter to feed the sales that we expect, but with that just like we are with the land we are remaining disciplined community by community and so I think we\u2019ve gotten a bit more efficient with turning our specs over the last year.","Alan Ratner","Great. Thanks for that and second follow-up if I could, it sounds like you guys are pretty bullish on the January activity. I think the big concern that investors have is that the stock market volatility here is going to maybe more at the higher end cause some skittishness among buyers there so, given your diversification on the product side, have you seen any differences in buyer activity between your Emerald division and maybe down to the Express division or are the comments you had company-wide pretty consistent from price point?","David V. Auld","Actually pretty consistent. There is a slower movement on the Emerald, the higher price points are not seeing the same levels of activity that we are seeing in the Horton or the Express brands.","Alan Ratner","Is that a rate of change comment meaning it slowed over the last month or two or is that just generally speaking you will get lower absorptions which I think would be expected?","David V. Auld","I\u2019d say rate of change over the last couple of quarters. I can tell you right now January started off very good.","Alan Ratner","Great, well thanks a lot and thanks for taking the questions.","Bill W. Wheat","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard","Good morning. In terms of Express, just curious what you are seeing in the market and how you are managing that in terms of price points and also the mix of that product that\u2019s obviously been successful. But curious how you are managing that and how you are seeing the behavior of the first time or that home buyer evolving in this market.","Jessica Hansen","Sure, Eric. As David mentioned we\u2019ve been very pleased with the rollout of Express. We\u2019ve talked to you for several quarters that the majority of that business has been in Texas, the Carolinas, and Florida. That\u2019s still the case, the majority of our sales and closings are coming out of those Markets, but we are starting to see a more meaningful share from some other parts of the country and the next largest State for us actually right now is California and the majority of that\u2019s in our Southern California Markets and that is bringing our average price point for Express up. This quarter it was $199,000 dollars and so next in the quarter, more than likely we will be over the $200,000 mark with our Express homes product offering, but really just due to geographic mix and we\u2019ve been very pleased with the rollout of Express in those other markets, in addition to Texas, Carolinas and Florida where the reception still remains very strong.","Eric Bosshard","In terms of intentionality of how the product is moving in existing Markets and I appreciate the California expansion, but is there anything that is different either from a price or cost or efficiency standpoint that\u2019s materially different than where it\u2019s been or in terms of where it\u2019s going?","David V. Auld","I would say pretty consistent with where it\u2019s been, and we\u2019re going to drive where it\u2019s going. So the Express program is price point driven. So we set absorption targets and drive to that price point. So its -- we\u2019re -- I just -- the overall Express program has been well received and continues to exceed what we thought it would be when it came out.","Eric Bosshard","And then secondly in terms of your expectations for price or incentives and obviously you\u2019re going to wait to see how the spring sell in season develops. But could you speak a little bit to what Plan A looks like in regards to that relative to a year ago?","Michael J. Murray","I think what we\u2019re seeing with good absorption in the communities, its taking pressure off of the margins and its giving us in certain communities little bit of pricing power to reduce incentives, and that\u2019s been showing up positively in margins. We plan to continue that. The Plan A is to maintain the absorption pace that we budgeted for the year, and we\u2019re seeing the market being very cooperative to that.","Eric Bosshard","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congrats on a solid quarter.","David V. Auld","Thank you, Michael.","Michael J. Murray","Thank you.","Michael Rehaut","The first question I had was, just trying to drill down a little bit across the regions from the order growth perspective during the quarter, where you had for example, some deceleration in year-over-year order growth. I guess across the board but more notably in the south east still very strong at 22% growth versus, but that was versus a stronger rate in \u201915, couple of smaller regions fell off as well. So I was hoping to get any kind of color across the regions in terms of perhaps highlighting which markets right now that you might see is being stronger than others? And if there was any particular changes in community count growth that might have driven some of those regional changes quarter-to-quarter in terms of the year-over-year trend?","Jessica Hansen","We saw an increase in our absorptions in every region Mike, outside of the mid-west. And the mid-west is a very small region for us and it does include Chicago which we pointed to for a while now is being a weaker market of ours, but otherwise every region in terms of sales on a year-over-year basis was up, as we did see a decline in our community count in half of our regions. And as we noted already our count -- community count was relatively flat. It was up just only slightly at about 1% on a year-over-year basis. So we\u2019re seeing a good pick up in absorptions in a majority of our markets today I would say.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I guess, secondly just from the growth side, I think there\u2019s been a couple of questions previously around growth expectations, and your land spend up but kind of keeping your lot count flat and basically replacing what you\u2019re working through. Just thinking at the same time you\u2019re expecting I believe you said double digit growth, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, that\u2019s your goal over the next two or three years. So how are you at least from a revenue or order growth standpoint now with community count flattish for three quarters maybe for another couple of quarters here; is growth something that would be re-infused into the strategy as we think about fiscal \u201917 and \u201918. Obviously you\u2019re also creating a lot of dry powder here, building up the cash or paying down some debt incrementally. And it seems like there is a little bit of one foot on the pedal or half way on the gas pedal whereas again you\u2019re still well below mid cycle levels as an industry. So any thoughts around perhaps a reacceleration of that community count growth as we look into \u201917 or \u201918?","David V. Auld","I think we\u2019re looking for to continue, to aggregate market share market-by-market. I think we\u2019re looking at double digit growth year-over-year and profit sales and closing. So its -- we get what we believe is a sustainable program and the fact that we\u2019re generating cash and improving our balance sheet while gaining efficiency. It\u2019s just going to open a lot of opportunities for us down the road.","Bill W. Wheat","And growth is a core part of that strategy. Growth at a double digit pace is a core part of that strategy but it is a balance strategy. Our guidance for this year in terms of top line revenue equates to 11% to 15% annual increase. Our closings guidance for the year equates to an 8% to 13% increase. And so our expectations this year are to be in the low double digit range which from our perspective is solid growth and in line with our expectations, and this quarter with our sales pace it\u2019s in the range of our expectations for the year and certainly puts us in position to continue a consistent growth. Our investment levels, we\u2019ve gotten a lot of our growth the last couple of years from absorption improvements with the Express roll out while our average community count has moderated. Our expectations this year is well we\u2019ll still see absorption improvements. It won't be quite at the pace it was in prior years but we still expect solid absorption improvements. And then certainly going forward when we achieve a much better level of efficiency then perhaps in future growth at a double digit pace may come from some further community count growth. But today and for this year we expect low -- flat to low single digit of community count growth with improved absorptions to drive a double digit revenue growth.","Michael Rehaut","That\u2019s helpful, Bill. And I think just maybe to press that further that concept in terms of the shift between community count and absorption that\u2019s occurred in the last six, eight quarters. This year again it looks like perhaps a high single digit or so perhaps low double digit absorption growth with more flattish community count. To the extent that you\u2019re coming that that growth would continue to moderate perhaps due to the mix shift more fully playing out from the Express standpoint, to the extent that you\u2019re expecting double digit growth in \u201917, it would imply to the extent that the absorption continues to moderate some reacceleration in community count. Is that fair?","Bill W. Wheat","I believe that\u2019s fair. Yes.","David V. Auld","Yes.","Michael Rehaut","All right. Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth Zener","Good morning, all.","Bill W. Wheat","Good morning, Ken.","David V. Auld","Good morning.","Kenneth Zener","I wonder if you could talk about the 60% of your buyers that are not first time. Obviously it appears that there was volatility on the existing home sales number in December, some of that mortgage related but it does seem that things are decelerating a little bit on the existing side. Is there anything that would cause you concern or David, Bill, could you kind of talk about what a gumming up of that existing side might look like and how that might concern you. I know obviously Houston is starting to see rising inventory of existing and slowing existing sales. Have you started seeing in any of the markets issues with people not being able to sell their houses or anything? So that was a big part of the market last year when it started to slow down.","David V. Auld","I\u2019ll tell you Ken, we\u2019re not seeing that in the markets we\u2019re operating at. The resale market is still relatively strong with continuing positive signs, so I mean, our inventory turns are improving, our absorption per flag are improving with stable and in some cases improving margins. So we feel very good about the market right now, and are not seeing other than obviously Houston slow, but the balance of our markets are doing very, very well.","Kenneth Zener","And then if I could ask about California where you did highlight your some Express product, Jessica you talked about lifting your ASP, and then also as it relates to any of your other product. What percent of those homes do you believe are going to or towards investors be it, if you can split out domestic and\/or international? Thank you.","David V. Auld","We don't have an exact breakdown of the investors. Anecdotally I'd tell you it's very low what we are hearing about any investor sales. A lot of its just people that are moving out of a rental situation into a home that they can afford.","Kenneth Zener","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Wetenhall","Hi, good morning. Did you guys get any help with the December weather to that extent, the construction season and assist with deliveries in Q4?","David V. Auld","We had real weather in the fourth quarter in a couple of our bigger markets, across the Carolinas and really Dallas Fort Worth. But as Mike points out we have weather every quarter. So would our numbers have been better with typical weather? Yes, they would have been. But we're very happy with the numbers we posted, and I think we're going to have a great year.","Robert Wetenhall","It sounds like and especially with the start; ASP was at 3.3% and average price growth at 2.7% on the new order side. And you're talking about maintaining 19.5% to 20% gross margin. I'm just trying to get a better picture of how to think about prices being low single digit, what you're seeing on the labor cost side and if you're experiencing any delays due to labor bottlenecks and if that's been resolved. What's really giving you the confidence to reiterate your guidance for a very solid margin performance this year? Thanks very much.","David V. Auld","I think the confidence is coming from being in touch with the operators out in the divisions, and what they sense and what they feel is taking place in their markets. And across the board, our people feel very good about what's happening out there. The labor side, I would say it's still stressed, but seems to be improving, and the trade bases are starting to add people. I think a big part of the improvement we're seeing is the consistency of production in the community-by-community is allowing these trades to staff and maintain a workforce to hit those numbers. And it\u2019s taken awhile to get there, but they are adding people. I think our trade base is seeing -- is becoming more and more confident as well.","Jessica Hansen","And Bob in terms of what we saw in price changes, our revenues per square foot outpaced our stick and brick per square foot on a year-over-year basis for the second time, so we've gotten to where that's in check. Sequentially that was essentially net neutral so you saw our margin pick up by 10 basis points year-over-year, and stays flat from Q4 to Q1. We are continuing to experience higher land costs, but in about the same range year-over-year as we were last quarter. So flat gross margins.","Robert Wetenhall","And let me ask you Jessica, just on that point, are you really getting price or is the driver really a reflection of a stronger mix with the buyers towards the west coast?","Jessica Hansen","We\u2019re actually getting price. If we look at our price per square foot which is the best way we can try to look at our business apples-to-apples, we did see a low single digit increase.","Robert Wetenhall","Got it. And if I could sneak one final in; can you just give us like a way to think about Houston versus Dallas, in the sense that, it sounds like Dallas is very strong. You said Houston is soft. How do we think about that? Is there any more of a bookend you can give us? Thanks a lot.","David V. Auld","I would tell you, Bob, I spent a week drive in Dallas and a week drive in Forth Worth in January. And when I got back I told Horton I had to get out of the field, because if I stayed in Dallas and Forth Worth, I would become way too aggressive buying land. It is a go to market as I\u2019ve seen. And as to Houston, I think that there\u2019s a lot of conversation, a lot of uncertainty, a lot of volatility within the oil and gas business, which I think is making people more conservative about buying homes. I think there\u2019s still pent up demand in Houston, I think that pent up demand is growing. But it is just not the frenzy that we\u2019ve seen in the past or is really taking place in some of the other Texas markets.","Robert Wetenhall","Super. Good. Good luck, and thanks very much.","David V. Auld","Thank you, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from the line of Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Jay McCanless","Thank you. If I could, or I can touch on the labor issue, I think some people are concerned about would there be enough labor to make the number of closings in the back half of the year, that your guidance suggest. Could you talk I mean, when you talk about labor getting better and the subs adding more people, is it across the board or is it just in specific market or specific areas like framing et cetera?","David V. Auld","It\u2019s pretty much across the board. I mean, we\u2019re seeing the construction labor force increase, and I think our strive to create more efficiency in the process of building, selling homes and trying to actually take some labor out of a per foot, square foot cost of the home has paid off. And our trays are making money and we\u2019re seeing less pressure on the cost side, and I think providing more value for the customer. So we feel like we are positioned to deliver our year.","Jay McCanless","Okay. Great. And then the second question I had, on Express; could you just update us on how many markets you ultimately want to go to with that product and how far long do you think you are in that process?","David V. Auld","I think there are probably, we\u2019re in 78 markets. We probably will end up mid 60\u2019s primarily because some markets just don\u2019t. We don\u2019t allow you to do a market with your product and we\u2019re not going to give up the Horton brand to sell Express. We have a lot of opportunities still to increase our position within most of the markets, and are actively out there looking every day to do that.","Jay McCanless","Okay. And how far along do you think you\u2019re in that process?","David V. Auld","Maybe halfway.","Jessica Hansen","We\u2019re in 48 markets and 15 states today. But to echo David\u2019s comments, we haven\u2019t fully saturated the markets that we\u2019re currently in with Express. So there\u2019s more runway within those 48 plus expanding to the mid 60s.","Jay McCanless","Got it. Thanks.","David V. Auld","I mean, we\u2019re allocating capital to the programs that are driving the best returns. And right now, Express is driving great returns.","Jay McCanless","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Dahl","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions.","David V. Auld","You bet.","Michael Dahl","David, if we could go back and put a finer point on the Texas discussion, it sounds like Dallas is clearly very strong, and if I look at your south central trends overall up 7% in orders, Dallas presumably outpacing that by a decent degree. So, Houston can you give us a ballpark around year-over-year what Houston is doing? And we\u2019ve heard some other builders talk about the weakness extending down to the 250K price point. I know you said earlier, you put up -- if you can put up a home at 250 you can sell it. But is there just any additional color on trends that across the price segmentation within your Houston business that you can provide?","Jessica Hansen","Houston has been relatively stable for us on a year-over-year basis. So we didn\u2019t see a further slowdown in Houston, but we\u2019re often not seeing any meaningful pickup. We continue to see our lower priced Express homes, very steady demand, steady sales pace that has been mentioned a couple of times on the call. It\u2019s definitely softer at the higher end. But we continue to see good, steady demand for the entry level and people moving out of apartments where we\u2019re providing an attractive rent versus buy equation and driving people into the sales offices each week. So we continue to have a close eye on Houston. We are not heavily reinvesting in Houston right now. We are replenishing where it makes sense and where we can continue to add those entry level product offerings.","David V. Auld","And Michael, just to add a little more color. We have some, what I would call A plus project location positions in Houston that or maybe at the price point that we\u2019re seeing less demand for. And we\u2019re not going to accelerate or liquidate those positions, so we will see lower absorptions in those communities. And these are, they are communities we can't go replace and don\u2019t want to. So its -- we\u2019re going to protect the value and our core projects, take absorption at the 250 to 300 range. And if you\u2019re looking at what I look at, almost zero margin deterioration on the projects that are at the price point that are turning right now. And we don\u2019t nor do we want to force sales in a core project where we have been selling 350 to 450 and are just seeing our absorptions reduce. That\u2019s my color on Houston. I think probably, always going to be a tremendous market for us for a long time.","Michael Dahl","I guess just a follow-up on that last point. As you take a step back and say, look there is too much value in some of these A plus locations, to give them away. We have heard increased chatter in terms that competitors are starting to cut prices or kick up incentives. So how much of it is related to the market is trading away from you, and you\u2019re not chasing it but the market has moved on price.","David V. Auld","We are very strong in the -- I mean, we dominate the 250 to 300 -- 200 to 300 price point in Houston, and we\u2019re going to continue to dominate that. And if you look at our, the benefit, one of the many benefits of being in the orders of broad geographic footprint when the upper end in Houston slows down, the entry level in Denver accelerates. So, I mean, we have a lot of leverage to pull. My consistent comment to the people inside of the company is, it\u2019s going to be us. Because we can hit our plan and without being forced to sell a project we don\u2019t want to sell at the pace that its being running at.","Michael Dahl","Got it. That is helpful, and yes good position to be in. If I could shift gears to yet another earlier discussion around community count and absorptions and just as it relates to the guide, I think you mentioned unit deliveries up 8% to 13%. If we looked at the orders, it seems like absorptions are up about 8%. How much of the delta between hitting the low end versus the high end of the units will come from increasing your absorption beyond that 8% on a year-over-year basis versus getting more communities open and getting that community count up into a low to mid single digit range by the end of the year?","David V. Auld","We\u2019re pretty much running on our absorption targets. So, I think we will, as we continue to push up the Express brand and follow up replacing the Horton positions, I think we will see some community count growth. We don\u2019t have visibility in that today. We do have visibility in what we know we can deliver.","Michael J. Murray","It\u2019s hard to know exactly where the contributions are sitting here in January not knowing what the spring is doing the whole. We\u2019re certainly seeing good early signs, but clearly the strength of the spring selling season will help determine our year, it will determine where we land in our range or whether we could perhaps exceed our range, so it\u2019s here in January, feeling good. We feel good about our position, our preparations for the spring, and then we\u2019ll go try to execute as best we can over the next few months, and we\u2019ll know a whole lot more when we talk to you next quarter.","Michael Dahl","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Will Randall from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","William Randall","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.","David V. Auld","Good morning, Will.","William Randall","Hello. I was curious on the implementation of The Know Before You Owe or Trade If You will. For you guys how that look like? How do you feel about I guess for lack of a better term the complexity as well as days its added to closings, and if you would share some color there?","Bill W. Wheat","We really haven\u2019t seen an appreciable impact in a delay in closings. Our teams have worked very hard to prepare for the changing rules and worked with our captain mortgage company, GHM Mortgage those folks have done a yeoman\u2019s job preparing for this change as well as working with our preferred lenders. So we really didn\u2019t see a material impact on our closings for the quarter. We\u2019ll continue to improve our processes and try to become more efficient and make it a good experience for the buyers.","William Randall","Thanks for that. And then just as a follow-up, it was talked about a few times during Q&A. But on labor inflation, I think you guys are running at 2% to 3% in the prior reported quarter, well some of your competitors out there are running closer to 10%. Have you seen more inflation and has that been different for specs versus the total company?","David V. Auld","I think the labor side has been minimized for us because we set absorption targets per community and drive to that. So we have consistency within the communities. And our trades are not out there looking for work one-week and then add twice what they can do the next.","Jessica Hansen","And we are still just running a low single digit percentage increase on cost per square foot, stick and brick.","William Randall","All right. Thanks for that, and congrats on the progress.","David V. Auld","Thank you.","Bill W. Wheat","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question today is coming from John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","John Lovallo","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the call. First question is on the financial services margin, we have it at about 16% I think in the quarter versus the guide of 30% to 33%. Now was there any trade related expenses kind of lumped in there in the quarter?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, no doubt. To be prepared for the new regulations are our mortgage company financial services operation had to make significant investments primarily in personal. The effort to comply is a big one and in order to meet those regulations and provide that experience to the home buyers they\u2019ve had to increase cost there. Typically those from a seasonal basis we see our lower operating margins in our first and second quarters and our lower volume quarters, and then we typically see higher than average operating margins and financial services in Q3 and Q4. And so, the margin here this quarter in the low 20s certainly does not preclude achieving the 30% to 33% guidance for the year.","John Lovallo","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then the one follow-up would be, realizing that weather is an issue every quarter somewhere. The recent weather we\u2019ve had on the east coast is, has been pretty serious, particularly in areas like Carolina they aren\u2019t used to having that kind of impact. So I mean, are you guys anticipating any trouble in the coming quarter due to the storm?","Bill W. Wheat","Certainly do appreciate it. It has been a serious storm. It\u2019s impacted a lot of people. But we feel its fortunate it\u2019s early in our quarter, and our operating teams will be able to take care of our existing home owners in the communities and deal with the homes that are in backlog and the specs that are out there today, and be ready for sales next weekend.","David V. Auld","And I\u2019d also like to add, it\u2019s a beautiful day in Texas today. So, sun is shining on somebody somewhere everyday.","Bill W. Wheat","So buy a house in Texas.","John Lovallo","All right. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. Good morning.","David V. Auld","Good morning.","Susan Maklari","You have talked frequently about how you just not seen a lot of competition coming in to the sort of first time Express kind of price point. What you think is the biggest factor that would have to change, either from an operating kind of industry perspective or from a macro perspective that would finally push some of those years, maybe perhaps come in and kind of create a bit more competition for you there?","David V. Auld","Well, I don\u2019t -- we have a hard and tough time managing our people. I don\u2019t want to get into trying to help them help themselves. So I don\u2019t know. And all we do is, get up every day and operate and pursue to be the best we can be. I think we\u2019re tough competition. Maybe they just -- I don\u2019t know.","Michael J. Murray","But entry level housing is something we\u2019ve done for a very long time. It\u2019s a core competency of our business. And with our footprint and with that competency among our operating teams across the country, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve -- we got a lot of practice at. So it\u2019s something we\u2019re focused on, and like we said earlier, it\u2019s a good market and there\u2019s a lot of demand there. We do expect some more competition down the line, and I think that would be a natural next step in the cycle.","David V. Auld","I will say, we were first movers, and we were aggressive first movers. And I would believe that, the other companies that are also good at driving value will be following us in it. But then we bought the lion share of the finish lots and when we saw all those success, we started investment, investing in development -- developing lots of -- we just have a head start and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re coming.","Susan Maklari","Okay. And then just, following up on TRID, obviously TRID has done a great job in rolling that out. But as we do get into the spring and just started just the overall activity levels that we reached, could you see anything out there that have started to trip things up at all?","Michael J. Murray","Well the area that we\u2019ve watched the most closely that we have less visibility too or the closings with outside lenders, obviously our internal mortgage company, our captive closings that we have more visibility in that process and feel confident about that. But with outside lenders it\u2019s something we watch closely division-by-division where they have relationships with outside lenders. They\u2019re working with them to make sure that we had the visibility to hit things on time, but I think that\u2019s where the greater risk is. But I honestly think month-by-month as everyone in the process gets more used to it, I think it will get smoother and any disruptions that may have occurred thus far, I think will be alleviated over the coming months.","Susan Maklari","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","David V. Auld","Thank you, Kevin.

Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-K next week.","After this call, we will post updated supplementary data to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations Section under News & Events for your reference. The supplementary information includes our previously released data on changes in active selling communities and brand stratification updated to also include the data on our homebuilding return on inventory, home sales gross margins, price stratification and our mortgage operations.","Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our D.R. Horton team finished the year strong. Pre-tax income for the fourth quarter increased 25% to $608 million on $4.5 billion of revenue, and our pre-tax operating margin improved 180 basis points to 13.5%.","For the year, we delivered results in line with or better than the original fiscal 2018 guidance we shared at the beginning of the year, with consolidated pre-tax income increasing 29% to $2.1 billion on $16.1 billion of revenues. We closed 51,857 homes this year, an increase of 6,106 homes or 13% over last year.","Our consolidated pre-tax margin for the year improved 140 basis points to 12.8% and our homebuilding return on inventory improved 360 basis points to 20.2%. Our homebuilding cash flow from operations was $1 billion in 2018, our fourth consecutive year of generating positive operating cash flows during a period when our annual revenues have doubled.","These results reflect the strength of our operational teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton's scale across our broad geographic footprint, and our product positioning to offer affordable homes across multiple brands.","Sales prices for both new and existing homes have increased across most of our markets over the past several years, which coupled with rising interest rates has impacted affordability and resulted in some moderation of demand for homes, particularly at higher price points.","However, we continue to see good demand and a limited supply homes at affordable prices across all of our markets. And economic fundamentals and financing availability remain solid. We are pleased with our current product offerings and positioning to meet demand in the current market, and we will adjust to future changes and market conditions as necessary.","Our strategic focus is to continue consolidating market share, while growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits generating strong cash flows and returns and maintaining a flexible financial position. With a conservative balance sheet that includes 29,700 homes in inventory and an ample supply of owned and optioned lots to support future growth, we are well-positioned as we began 2019.","Mike?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Net income for the fourth quarter increased 49% to $466 million or $1.22 per diluted share, compared to $313 million or $0.82 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter included a tax benefit of $16.1 million due to the reversal of a portion of Forestar's valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets.","Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 25% to $608 million in the fourth quarter from $486 million. And homebuilding pre-tax income increased 26% to $578 million from $458 million. As previously reported, our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 9% to $4.4 billion on 14,674 homes closed, up from $4 billion on 13,165 homes closed in the year-ago quarter.","Our backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter was 89%, up from 87% a year ago. Our average closing price for the quarter was $298,500, down 3% from the prior year, primarily due to geographic mix and a 3% decrease in the average size of our homes closed, which reflects our efforts to keep our homes affordable.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","As also previously reported, our net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 11% from the year-ago quarter to 11,509 homes on a 3% decline in the average number of active selling communities. The value of homes sold during the quarter increased 10% to $3.4 billion. Our average sales price on net sales orders decreased 1% to $298,100, and our fourth quarter cancellation rate was 26%.","Jessica?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 21.6%, up 130 basis points from the prior-year quarter. 70 basis points of the year-over-year increase in gross margin was due to reducing incentives, or raising sales prices in excess of cost increases, 30 basis points was from less warranty and construction defect costs, 20 basis points was from lower interest costs, and 10 basis points was from less impact from purchase accounting.","Homes sales gross margin declined slightly from 21.9% in the third quarter, primarily due to the average cost of our homes increasing by more than the average selling price. We continue to focus on achieving our targeted absorptions to maximize returns in each of our communities, because a consistent pace of start, sales, and closings with the right product positioning drives both the highest returns and pre-tax profit margins.","Our fiscal 2019 home sales gross margin will be determined primarily by the strength of the spring selling season. We currently expect our home sales gross margins in fiscal 2019 to range from 20% to 22%, with potential quarterly fluctuations outside of this range due to product and geographic mix, as well as the relative impact from warranty, litigation, interest cost and purchase accounting. We will update our expectations as necessary each quarter, as we have better visibility to the spring and the full year comes in focus.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","In the fourth quarter, SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 8.4%, down 20 basis points from the prior-year quarter. For the full year, homebuilding SG&A improved 30 basis points to 8.6%, compared to 8.9% in 2017. As our increased revenues improved the leverage of our fixed overhead costs. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring our infrastructure adequately supports our growth and we expect to further leverage our SG&A in 2019. Jessica?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Financial services pre-tax income in the fourth quarter was $33.8 million and the pre-tax operating margin was 33.1%. For the year, financial services pre-tax income was $118 million on $375 million of revenues, representing a 31.4% pre-tax operating margin. 98% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operation and our mortgage company handled the financing for 56% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 43% of the mortgage company's volume.","Borrowers' originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 721 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 49% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, up from 44% in the prior-year quarter, reflecting our continued focus on offering affordable homes for entry-level buyers. Mike?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We ended the year with 29,700 homes in inventory 16,400 of our total homes were unsold, of which 4,000 were completed which is down slightly from last year. Compared to year ago, we have 13% more total homes in inventory putting us in a very strong position to start 2019.","Our fourth quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land, and development totaled $1 billion, of which $615 million was to replenish finished lots and land and $432 million was for land development. For the year, we invested $3.8 billion in lots, land and development. David?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We are making good progress on increasing the option portion of our land and lot pipeline and believe we can continue to increase our option lots over the next few years, while maintaining our number of owned lots relatively flat with current levels. At September 30, our land and lot portfolio consisted of 289,000 lots, of which 125,000 or 43% are owned and 164,000 or 57% are controlled through option contracts. 35,000 of our total owned lots are finished and 82,000 of our option lots are or will be finished when we purchase them.","We have increased our option lot position by 40,000 lots from a year ago. And we plan to increase our option lots further by expanding our relationships with lot developers across the country and continuing to support the expansion of Forestar's national lot manufacturing platform. Our balanced and well-positioned lot portfolio is a strong competitive advantage. Mike?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Forestar, our majority-owned subsidiary is a publicly traded residential lot development company now operating in 24 markets in 14 states. At September 30, Forestar owned and controlled approximately 20,100 lots, of which 1,600 are finished. 13,600 of Forestar's lots are under contract with D.R. Horton, or subject to a right of first offer under the master supply agreement between our two companies.","Forestar delivered 1,279 lots and generated $109 million of revenue for the 12 months ended September 30. Our growth expectations for Forestar are consistent with what we've shared on prior calls. Forestar's still on track to grow annual deliveries to approximately 10,000 lots, generating $700 million to $800 million of revenue in fiscal 2020. We expect Forestar to be consistently profitable with future pre-tax margins of at least 10%. These expectations are for Forestar's standalone results.","Forestar is making steady progress in building its operational platform and capital structure to support its significant growth plans. During the quarter, Forestar obtained a three-year $380 million unsecured bank credit facility and completed the filing of the self-registration statement, which is now effective.","Forestar still plans to access the capital markets in fiscal 2019 to provide additional capital for long-term growth. However, Forestar's current liquidity, capital base and lot position are sufficient to support its fiscal 2019 and 2020 planned growth in lot deliveries and revenues.","Forestar's separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and is targeting a long-term net debt-to-capital ratio of 40% or less. D.R. Horton's alignment with Forestar is advancing our strategy of increasing access to option lot positions and enhancing our operational efficiency and homebuilding returns. We're excited about Forestar's growing operating platform and the value this relationship will create over the long-term for both D.R. Horton and Forestar shareholders. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","At September 30, our homebuilding liquidity totaled $2.3 billion, consisting of $1.1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.2 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage improved 260 basis points from a year ago to 21.4%. The balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at fiscal year-end was $2.4 billion and we have a total of $500 million of senior notes that mature in March 2019, which we will likely repay from cash flow at maturity.","Our consolidated cash flow from operations was $239 million during the fourth quarter and $545 million for the full year. Excluding Forestar, our fiscal 2018 cash flow from operations totaled $875 million, exceeding our publicly-stated $800 million target.","Fiscal 2018 homebuilding cash flow from operations was $1 billion. During the September quarter, we paid cash dividends of $47.1 million and we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock for $52.6 million. We ended the year with a shareholders' equity balance of $9 billion and book value per share increased 16% from year ago to $23.88.","Based on our financial position and outlook for fiscal 2019, our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 20% to $0.15 per share. We currently expect to pay dividends of approximately $225 million to our shareholders in fiscal 2019. And our remaining stock repurchase authorization for fiscal 2019 is $376 million. David?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet's strength, liquidity, earnings growth and cash flow generation are increasing our flexibility. And we plan to utilize our strong position to enhance the long-term value of the company.","Our top cash flow priorities are to consolidate market share by investing in our homebuilding business and strategic acquisitions, reduce homebuilding debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","As we mentioned on our last call, we have been actively pursuing select homebuilding acquisitions across the country and we still expect to deploy $400 million to $600 million of capital for this purpose over the next few quarters. Jessica?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Looking forward for the first quarter of 2019, we expect consolidated revenues of $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion and our homes closed to be in a range between 11,000 and 11,500 homes. We anticipate that our first quarter consolidated pre-tax margin will be in the range of 11.4% to 11.7%. Our full-year fiscal 2019 results will be significantly impacted by the spring selling season. Due to uncertainty based on recent market conditions, we are only providing first quarter revenue, closings, and pre-tax margin guidance at this time.","However, we are well-positioned to deliver double-digit growth in fiscal 2019 subject to the strength of the spring selling season. We will update our expectations each quarter as we have better visibility to the strength. We still forecast an income tax rate for 2019 of approximately 25% and we expect our outstanding share count at the end of fiscal 2019 will be flat with our outstanding share count at the end of fiscal 2018. We also expect to generate homebuilding cash flow from operations of at least $1 billion in fiscal 2019.","David?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","In closing, the strength of our team and operating platform across the country allowed us to grow our revenues 14% and our pre-tax profit is 29% while generating $1 billion of homebuilding cash flow from operations. We also improved our annual homebuilding return on inventory by 360 basis points to 20.2%. We are focused on consolidating market share, while growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits generating strong cash flows and returns while maintaining a flexible financial position.","We are well-positioned to do so with our conservative balance sheet, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, affordable product offering across multiple brands, attractive finished lot and land position, and most importantly our outstanding experienced team across the country.","We congratulate the entire D.R. Horton team on our 17th consecutive year as the largest builder by volume in the United States and we thank you for your hard work and accomplishments. We look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operations in 2019.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","Good morning you all. Good to talk to you. I wanted to ask a little bit about the impact of weather on \u2013 your 4Q hurricanes et cetera if that impacted covering the fixed portion of your COGS and SG&A?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah. Certainly, there was some impact from the hurricanes in September on our closings. One of the reasons, why we pre-reported our closings and at any time we fall a bit short of our plans on our revenue line, our leverage on SG&A is impacted, and I would say that, that's the primary reason why our SG&A came-in higher than we had guided for the quarter.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And we don't actually have any fixed costs in our cost of goods so the gross margin was not impacted by the hurricanes.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","So just SG&A. Okay. Thanks. And then in terms of your guidance for Q1, so a little bit below what we were looking for. So you had some delays that moved into that quarter. Is this really just a function of your expectations that backlog conversion goes down or just sort of a as you look out orders feelings softer in an environment with higher rates and higher prices?","And then, can you also you talk a little bit about your incentive activity and what you're looking and planning and whether or not incentives are having sort of an elastic, there is a reaction by the consumer that's elastic to your incentive so they're buying when they see lower prices or you've seen that you have to drop prices sort of more than you thought?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","This is David. Market conditions really over the last four, five weeks have been pretty choppy. We haven't seen kind of the consistency at the flag-to-flag level that we have grown to expect. So when you are the size we are, you kind of get a sense that maybe a little momentum is slipping from the market to you. You have a hard time driving the number of sales it takes for us to grow double-digits.","So I'd say, Q1, we're giving you a good picture of where we are right now. Expectation-wise, I can tell you, I believe we are positioned as well as we have ever been. Our operators out there in the field have plans to produce double-digit, and we'll see what happens. Given some kind of \u2013 any kind of market at all in the spring, I think we're going to have a great year.","But right now, it's been a very few quarters where we've had to come in and release because we had given guidance and then fell a little bit short of it at the quarter. So maybe part of it's our own conservative nature up here. We don't want to put a number out there we can't hit.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","From an incentive standpoint, Carl. In the fourth quarter closings, we saw a very slight sequential tick-up in incentives from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, incentives were still at a lower level in the fourth quarter than they had been historically. As we move forward, as we're in a more choppy environment, as David said, community-by-community, we're working to maximize returns by community. And in some cases, if giving some incentive to increase pace or to maintain pace will improve return, we'll be doing that.","And so, generally, you would expect in the choppy environment for incentives to tick-up a little bit. That's reflected in our guidance here for our margin expectations in Q1. But then, we do believe fundamentals from the economy, from demographics, from housing fundamentals especially at affordable price points, is still very solid. And so, our positioning, feeling great position for the spring selling season, but realistically right now we were not to the spring. We don't have a visibility to the spring yet. And so, that's why we're maintaining a bit of flexibility here in terms of our forward guidance, because we just don't have that visibility yet.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","All right. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, and good morning. Just following on Carl's question a little bit. Are incentives working, are they getting people to make the decision to buy? And I guess I'm wondering a bit or is it more sticker shock are you seeing at that entry-level qualification becoming more problematic there? And just on the orders, by product you mentioned that entry-level was better. But if you could give us a little bit more detail on what you're seeing at the various price categories, if you would?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning, Stephen. It's only October, so it's really kind of hard to read in too much. But it has been choppy. I would say that our affordable price point flags, we continue to see good traffic and good demand. Incentives have probably not been as heavy at those levels. Anecdotally, we're seeing that in some of the higher price points, not a huge positioning for us, less than \u2013 about a third of our closings are coming from the price point above $300,000 nationally.","That buyer is probably little bit affordably stretched and taking a little bit of time to reset to a changing mortgage rate environment and some of the media conditions. We are hopeful with the midterms behind us that people can get back and focus on their lives, and we'll be moving forward. But a lot of that is really going to play itself out over the next three months. And we're excited to get to the Super Bowl, not because we're Cowboys fans necessarily, but because that's typically when the selling season kicks off. And so, that's really what we think we're going to see. And right now, it's been choppy, as we said.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And the price point really varies from market to market. But very generally speaking, Texas across to Florida up into the Carolinas, if you can put a house on the ground for a sales price under $300,000, we still see very robust demand. The further West market, call it, under $400,000, once again very generally speaking submarkets have different dynamics, but generally speaking under $400,000 in the West. So a lot of the new flags we have come to market that we are behind on some of those legs getting opened are focused on those price points.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot. And then, along those lines, you really haven't had any community growth over the last three years; it's all been absorption growth. You're still pivoting toward that entry-level, which I assume your absorptions will improve this year also. But as you look forward in 2019 and 2020, to me it looks like you've got to get some community growth going to reach that double-digit type of growth rates. Just what are you all expecting there, and am I thinking about it the right way?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","You exactly \u2013 are thinking about exactly right. And we've been frankly planning for community count to be more stable or slightly growing for the past 18 months. We got two dynamics in play. One, our communities are running at faster absorption than we probably expected. And so, we were closing out of communities faster. And then, frankly, it's taking us longer than we anticipated to get communities open. And we had continue to respond to the challenges we face and try to adjust our business plan to reflect the realities that we face in getting communities through planning, through approvals and through development. But it has taken us longer to get the new ones open and the ones that are open are selling at faster clips than we probably anticipated. So it's a function of two things on the community counts. We would expect to see community counts stabilize and trend up in 2019.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And we have the lot to show that it's going to happen. David mentioned our option lot position is up 40,000 lots from a year ago. So that is the direction the communities will come over time.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And, Stephen, we did believe we would be growing community count last year and really just couldn't get the communities online. So that is certainly in the plan for 2019.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I guess it's in terms of potential acquisitions, David, you mentioned. Are you seeing a greater willingness for some of the smaller competitors that come to table now? And I guess secondarily, if you do pursue acquisitions, it seems like they would be kind of tuck-in type deals. And it wouldn't necessarily be a straying from the asset light thesis. Is that correct?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I think you're going to pretty much see a continuation of what we have been doing. We are very interested in the culture and the ability to bring these companies into our company. So the great big deals, heavy lot deals probably don't make a lot of sense to us right now. I can tell you the deals that were closed on a very, very good companies, very good culture. People that I think will fit well within our company. So we'll see if we can get them done.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","John...","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Yeah, go ahead.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah. Willingness of potential buyers. I'll tell you is the one that we're close on today, are ones that we've been talking with for quite some time and working with for quite some time. But we would expect that going forward to the extent that there is a little more inconsistency in the market. We would probably see \u2013 expect to see some buyers or some potential sellers have a bit more willingness to sell going forward.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Bill mentioned we've been talking to these guys for quite some time. We really are serious about the cultural fit. So it is a courtship and the typical deals probably two years from the time we start to when we close on what we're working on right now.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We're not going to rush to the alter, okay?","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is it the shift away from becoming \u2013 using Forestar to become more asset light or is it just part of strategies be?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","No. This fits right in with that \u2013 this has to do with market consolidation. In a couple instances getting a platform in a new market.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Growing our platform in existing market, giving us more places to invest with Forestar.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","No, no. We are on track with our overall option lot growth, trying to become less reliant on self-developed land and lots. So, that's not going to change.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then maybe just following up on that. In terms of the capital raise out of Forestar, I mean there's, obviously, been market volatility and Forestar's stock has pulled in a bit here. Has that affected your views on the timing of potential equity raise? And I know you mentioned that Forestar is pretty well capitalized, but it does feel like the best time to raise capital, but you really don't need it. So any comments on that would be appreciated.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Sure, John. This year \u2013 this past year, the effort has been to begin building the platform at Forestar. And fortunately, Forestar was very liquid, it still is. Had a lot of cash on the balance sheet at the date of acquisition, have been \u2013 has sold some of their legacy assets over the course of the last year, raised a lot of capital and is still on a very liquid position here at September, 30, made a lot of progress on the capital structure standpoint, getting the banks' credit facility in at $380 million capacity provides significant capital flexibility there to Forestar as well, and so very pleased with their positioning.","All along, any plans for public capital raising either in the debt or the equity markets, it would be subject to market conditions and timing. Forestar is working to be in position to raise capital in fiscal 2019 as the plan has been all along. And the timing of that will be dependent on when we feel like the best market windows are. Fortunately, Forestar is in a very good position today with their capital, with their lot position to drive the growth targets that we've been talking about for fiscal 2019 and 2020 without raising additional capital. However, their plan is still to raise capital in fiscal 2019.","If we were to go-to-market today, I do agree with you, the best time to raise capital is when you don't need it and they don't need it right now. But if we were to go-to-market today we would likely go to the debt market, given just where the equity markets have been recently. But the long-term plan for Forestar does still include both equity and debt and when market conditions are favorable for equity; equity is definitely part of the plan.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Thanks a lot, guys. Good job in the quarter. Just wanted to ask a little bit about your guide and the decision not to give the full-year guide. I know you talked about the uncertainty in the market and wanting to wait until the spring selling season. And so, in that regard, I wanted to ask about your 1Q guide. You gave us the pre-tax margin, you talked about gross margin for the full-year next year 20% to 22%. But you said there could be volatility outside of that range.","In 1Q, given your pre-tax guidance would seem like it might be a quarter where you could go outside of that range. And so, I just want to make sure we're thinking about that right. Is it your belief that the margin in the 1Q for gross margin would be at or below that 20% range? Is that kind of what we should be thinking about?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","No, Steve. When we look at that consolidated pre-tax profit margin range that incorporated our thought of 20% to 22% being a range. And 20% would be a pretty dramatic move from where we are today. So we wouldn't expect that level of choppiness in our gross margin as we move from quarter-to-quarter. But we do believe is we move throughout the year until we see the spring, we don't ultimately know what gross margins will look like for the full year. So we wanted to give a slightly wider band than what we gave, say, a quarter or two ago.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Okay. Yeah. That's encouraging. Thanks for that clarity. And then the second question relates, just sort of generally, to the market environment and your \u2013 this asset allocation decisions. In particular, I'm wondering about land spend, so it was kind of running about 24% of rev this quarter and this past year.","Again, given the uncertainty in the market and your decision to sort of wait until the spring selling season to give you sort of a good heads up on where the market's going to be going, I was curious if we should expect land spend to similarly be put a bit on hold here in the first six months of the fiscal year, your fiscal year, accordingly.","And then also, with respect to options, can you give us a sense for how takedown prices are typically negotiated in your options? Are they set and fixed at the time you strike the option? Or they're more flexible? And what percent of the purchase price your deposits typically constitute in aggregate right now?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Let me \u2013 this is David. Let me speak to the land spend positioning. Right now, it's my personal belief that we're going to continue to see double-digit growth in 2019. And we are continuing to position for that double-digit growth. What we've seen so far in October is \u2013 when we start putting numbers together, the range of possibilities becomes so broad and so lighted, it's meaningless to even put it out there. So, our look is at Q1 \u2013 and I believe any way that we're going to have a good year and we are going to continue to position to that. Now when we get into the spring, if this choppiness that we're seeing now turns into \u2013 continues or gets worse, then yes, our land spend, every spend is going to significantly curtail. But right now, today, we're not giving up on the year.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We don't ever make any drastic business decisions in October. October to December is always the seasonally slowest time of the year. And so we really want to wait and see what the spring looks like before we make any big business plan decisions.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And then with your question as to the option pricing, those prices are generally struck at the time the option is entered into, typically, there's an opening price for the initial takedowns.","Oftentimes, there is a fixed-rate escalator that will start running from the initial takedown until all the lots are taken down. Not in every case, sometimes it's there maybe in a small minority of option contracts or maybe some adjustment based upon pricing achieved with the house. That's pretty rare these days.","I believe the aggregate earns money deposit today is about 6% to remaining purchase price. So that's sort of a \u2013 and again that's a collection of a lot of lot purchase contracts. So those are some generalizations and averages, but that's kind of what's out there guiding us.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Mike you said 6% of remaining purchase price just to be clear, so that include these deposit you've already put down and then you got another 6%?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","No. That's \u2013 so the 6% is what we have, we have put on deposit...","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Total at-risk.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","...or the future lot of businesses.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Okay, got it. Perfect, got it. Perfect.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Sorry.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","No, no. No, that was my confusion. Thank you very much, guys.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you. I heard the commentary about the strength of demand in the two-thirds of your business that's $300,000 and under. It sounds like you're talking about the demand has softened in the upper-third of your business and upper price points. Would love to hear a little bit more color if that's indeed what you're seeing? And then if you've seen anything changed within that two-thirds of your business that's in the more entry price point piece of the market?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I think \u2013 you would think at the higher-price points maybe interest rates impact the buyers less. But what we're seeing debt to income issues when you get over that $300,000 in most of our markets. It just seems like that buyer is having a more difficult time getting qualified. And housing valuations have been so good for so long that when people go out and take a look at a house, they could \u2013 two years ago, they can afford a much nicer house than they can today. So, there is kind of that sticker shock process going on.","And as far as demand at under $300,000, there's just not very much out there in any of the market.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Supply. So not much supply.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Supply. Yes. Not much \u2013 the demand is there, there's not much supply. So, even though demand may be restricted by affordability, there are still more buyers out there than there are that can afford it than there is product.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And financing availability is not the issue for those buyers. It really is the supply.","We continue to see our credit metrics improve even on our Express buyers that utilize our mortgage company today, their FICO scores continue to risen to this quarter at 710 compared to just our company average of 720.","And our cumulative loan to value on those is actually ticked down slightly to 90, almost right in line with our company average. So financing is there. There's just not homes on the ground for those price points for those buyers.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And certainly, we're seeing at the higher price points there is more supply available relative to the demand that's there. So the buyers have more choice whether it's an existing homes or other new homes.","At the more affordable price points where communities are established and the sales process, the mortgage process is there to support that first-time homebuyer. That's where we're focused on opening flags and bringing those products to market.","I think about half of our mortgage company's closing this last quarter were, too, first-time homebuyers. And so we're really pleased with what we're seeing there and that buyer is coming into the market.","They, call it, 10 years out of school now. They may have come out of school in 2008, not the greatest time to start your career. And they've hit a point in their lives where they are ready for home ownership. And we're very excited to see them coming into the sales offices.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","So let me just ask the question a little bit more directly. Is the change that you're seeing in the upper-third of your business, or you also seen a change in demand in the entry first-time piece of your business? That's what I guess I'm trying to figure out.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Primarily at the upper-end. That's where we primarily have been seeing weakness. And then, as David said, last four, five, six weeks, it's generally been choppy, but we would not necessarily say that's an indicator of any change in demand at the lower price points.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And maybe to answer this a little more directly. The person that came in three or four months ago at the below $300,000 price point, they could buy a 2,200 square-foot house.","Today, for that same payment, they're looking at maybe a 2,000, 1,800, 1,900 square-foot house. They still want a house, they still need a house. But their expectation of \u2013 we've seen this every time there has been an increase in rates over a relatively short period amount of time. There's an adjustment time, where the reality and expectation had to realign. So again, the alternatives are very, very limited. So if they're going to buy a house, the demand is there I guess is I'm trying to say. That it does create choppiness and it does create maybe a less consistence sales pace.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","So it really comes down to us as positioning. Every community, every market, positioning our homes, positioning the floor plans that we offer to make sure that they're at that affordable payment for that core buyer in that market. And that means it's a smaller house or buyer is going to select more of our smaller floor plan that's what we expect to see. In fact, we started seeing that this quarter.","Our average square footage on our homes closed this quarter was down 3%. And so we're positioning ourselves to make sure that there's a home for that buyer that has had to reset their expectations.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Hey, guys. Good morning. So, obviously, your business model you mentioned previously, it really thrives when you have a consistent pace of start, sales and closings. In last few years, all of those have been very consistent. So, I guess, the question is, if the choppiness on the sales front continues, at what point do you actually adjust that start pace? Because right now, David, you mentioned you're still optimistic for double-digit growth for 2019. So is it not until the spring where you start to really adjust your start pace, or could it happen potentially sooner than that if the next few months are also choppy?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We really do look at sales week to week to week, project by project. So we have not made any adjustments so far. My expectation is in the last couple of years we have seen, especially after the 2016 election, we saw sales pickup early the spring market started in December. Not sure that I am 100% bought in. We're going to see that same thing this year. But I can tell you, it would not surprise me. And again, like Jessica says, we've seen about five or six weeks so far this year. That's not a lot. But to answer your question, yes, we won't wait till April to adjust our start.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And, Alan, I'd also like to point out that at the end of September we had 4,000 completed homes that were unsold, which is actually less than we had ending fiscal 2017. So we're still seeing the projects working at the community level and we are monitoring week-to-week, community-to-community, our teams do great job of staying on top of that. They have a plan for what they believe in is happening in their sub markets and continuing to execute against that. I mean we are taking market inputs and looking at the sales pace in every community to look at the sales to adjust the starts. But we watch it very closely, and we still believe we have positioned and are positioning for 2019.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And our Division Presidents are going to make sure they're starting homes in the right communities. That's what they're adjusting on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis is putting the starts on the ground in the communities where we're seeing either more consistent or more robust demand to meet the sales and demand that's out there.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Got it. I appreciate all that color.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We talk a lot about the right home on the right lot at the right price. So...","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Got it. Okay, thank you for that. So second question, if I could. Just obviously it seems like there's a little bit more turmoil in the market today. We've heard from other builders as well. You guys I think have been running at a cost inflation rate somewhere in the low-single digit range. So I guess as you're having conversations with your trades, how have those been going? Are you starting to see any relief there? Obviously, lumbers come down. But is it a situation where cost inflation could actually slow here over the next several quarters given the softness in demand?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I think we'll be seeing that Alan. I think we will be seeing some cost pressures alleviate a bit, which will be \u2013 what has been a headwind certainly has been the tight labor market for construction. And the lumber, I think we'll see that lumber become a bit of a tailwind probably into our late second quarter, third quarter deliveries or second quarter and third quarter deliveries, late first quarter potentially. And then, we will see I think a little bit of labor moderate as others perhaps adjust their starts.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. Good morning. My first question is just around can you talk to what you're seeing from a competitive perspective in the sense of maybe some of your private peers? Are you seeing them adjust at a similar rate to what's been going on in the last few weeks? Or how are they thinking about the setup into the spring?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","It's hard to generalize what any one individual private homebuilder or any other builders thinking about. But generally, and this is from talking with a lot of private builders, their focus is generally not on returns. Their focus is generally margin house-to-house-to-house, and so they maybe a bit slower to respond to market conditions and others. They are also typically more focused on building homes to order rather than building homes to market demand and providing product that's kind of more readily available for the entry-level buyer.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then, given some of the changes that we're seeing in the market is there any change to how you're thinking about your capital allocation especially maybe as it relates to your share repurchase activity?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We've taken the balanced approach. Thus far, we have ample liquidity and flexibility to really still grow our business as well as continue to pay down debt and provide return to shareholders through our dividends and our share repurchases. We have been incrementally increasing our share repurchases, and we expect incrementally increase them further this year to offset our share price or our share creep, so they will keep our outstanding share count at least flat, no more than flat this year. But we do have room to be opportunistic. With our authorization we have room to be opportunistic there as well and so we will balance the opportunities in our potential share repurchases alongside our other opportunities as well.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And do plan to continue to reduce our debt as we said in the scripted comments that $500 million maturity this March. We believe that the lower interest costs in our business really are competitive advantage, and as we continue to pay down debt that's just one more tailwind to help us offset cost pressures in our gross margin.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for all the detail. Looking at the first quarter guidance and appreciate, obviously, all builders are kind of dealing with that choppiness. But the closings growth of, I believe the range is 2% to 7% and you talked about October been choppy. Are we to think about order growth in a similar type of mid-single-digit range? And obviously you don't kind of guide to order growth per say. But given the choppiness in the market, obviously there's been an amount of reduction in sales pace, and I presume that it takes a while to get the community count growth up and running. Should I be thinking or should we be thinking that perhaps orders were down a little bit in October? And it might be in the low to mid-single-digit range for the quarter?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's fair Mike. As we said, we don't comment our guide specifically on sales. But as we've said several times on the call about the choppiness we've seen this fall and we are behind our business plan, albeit only one month into the year. And as we said, we continue to see the good demand at affordable price points. So we're very well positioned to continue to go out sell the industry and whatever the market is out there to continue to consolidate share. But with that closings guidance that would tell you that, yeah, we're behind our plan one-month into the year so far.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. No, I appreciate that. I guess just following on to that. I mean, last cycle, you guys were pretty aggressive in being kind of a leader in terms of any types of incentive adjustments or price adjustments and pretty strong in terms of being able to, let's say, get cash flow and turnover your inventory as the market was turning. At this point, though given the nature of where we're seasonally, it sounds like you're still holding off any more aggressive type of wholesale adjustments to price, or incentives obviously still making the smaller adjustments as needed. But is that the right way to think about it in terms of obviously still expecting a 20% to 22% margin for the year and anymore type of aggressive adjustments to the pricing strategy? We probably wouldn't expect to occur this quarter more as the spring comes together?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I think you're right Mike. We're one-month into our fiscal year. We are in the slowest seasonal period of the time, historically slowest seasonal period of the time. And also occurring in that period of time, we saw interest rates move up that the buyers are dealing with. The buyers dealt with a lot of media coverage that was crazy. And so, we're not going to make any \u2013 as Jessica said before \u2013 any significant business decisions based upon this is the small step into the year we are so far. But we will continue to monitor every community at the same operating strategy we have. What pace price combination drives the best returns for each one of those communities, and the market is going to help us make those decisions.","Our fiscal 2019 margins in the range, we've given it's largely the spring selling season that's going to determine what those margins end up being. So we are very pleased with the positioning the teams have done in terms of building out their sales and construction and customer care teams, and the lot positions and the homes we have in inventory and that's going to be the execution in the spring against that's going to determine where fiscal 2019 comes out.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We're going to know a lot more in January than we know today.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Tomasello - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Good morning, this is actually Ryan Tomasello on for Jade. Just for the industry overall, I was wondering if you have an internal forecast of where you expect the new home sales and housing starts to be in 2019 for the overall market? Do you expect the market to see growth overall next year? And obviously, this wouldn't be read as a direct correlation to your results given your internal growth targets?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We honestly utilize our bank research coverage for the economist. We don't have an economist on staff that doesn't fit into our SG&A budget very nicely. But we're looking at it all of the same things, most of the people on the line probably are. And clearly, demographics are favorable the economy seems to be on very good footing. And so really as we see it today, we would believe there could be growth in the industry next year, particularly at affordable price points. So, we'll adjust as we need to, to meet market conditions. But yes, I think we would expect if builders are putting the right-priced houses on the ground. There should be growth in the industry as a whole. And whatever that growth ultimately is that D.R. Horton would outpace that.","Ryan Tomasello - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And then in terms of the land market I was wondering what you're seeing there in terms of any changes in competition given the slowdown we're seeing or any changes in pricing? And as a follow-up to that if you see any risk of increased impairments and then your land purchase earlier this year or last year as you adjust the product mix to fit the buyer base?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We're not seeing much change in sort of the land market conditions of where we have been. And we certainly don't expect any impairments or impairment risk on recent purchases based on where market conditions are today. In spite we talk about them being choppy, we're still not any kind of alarmed relative to valuations of our projects.","Ryan Tomasello - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG. Please proceed with your question.","Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Soham Bhonsle on for Jack this morning. In your prepared remarks, Mike, I think you touched on the decrease in home size by 3%. Can you maybe speak to what percentage of the portfolio you're seeing this? And is there a particular price point that those decreases are coming in?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I don't know they have exactly driven in by brand or price stratification where those are in front of me \u2013 I know Jessica's flipping through. So if we don't have it here we'll try to give it back to you. In the aggregate it's kind of where that number is that's going to be reflective across the whole thing but the majority of the lion share of our portfolio is within the D.R. Horton brand and the Express brand. So that's what's going to be driving any kind of an average \u2013 overall average movement. And it has come down a little bit as we've been starting houses in line with what we believe our buyers payments, tolerances are and then the buyers are making some of those selections to gravitate to those smaller part \u2013 smaller homes.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah. The 3% square footage decline was a year-over-year metrics. So this isn't apples-to-apples to that but I do have our sequential Q3 versus Q4 by brand in front of me. And our square-footage across all four brands declined slightly sequentially, which would be right along with what we've been saying for a while now as interest rates rise, people who need or want to buy house, just buy a little less house.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","So that combined with a little bit more of a mix shift towards more first-time buyers would generally be buying a smaller house as well would be the other component of it.","Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Right. That make sense. And then in your cash flow statement just noticed that you guys started breaking out multifamily expenditures this quarter, I believe, for the first time. Is there something to call out there? Or and then maybe thoughts on how you are approaching the market going forward?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","You know we have \u2013 I think we've mentioned it a couple of different times. We've been in the process really for the last 2 to 2.5 years of starting out internally, the capability to build multifamily communities. We've done this on land that our homebuilding operations already owned. And so it's a very synergistic business with our homebuilding business. In the past we've typically sold of partials that were zoned for multifamily. But we have developed the capabilities to build those in house, we made very good progress on that. Currently, we have four projects actively under construction and two projects that are substantially complete.","One of which is actually being marketed for sale right now. So that we've been building that \u2013 slowly internally, but it is growing. And we would expect in the coming year for it to grow a bit more and begin to see some sales of assets there as well along the way. So we felt like just in terms of our presentation, and our cash flow as it begins to grow a bit, is a small component of our business to call out that cash that would be a prudent move. So that everyone can see. You have better visibility to that portion of our cash.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And more accurately be able to calculate a free cash flow number, which I think is what most people do, since it has been so small, it's previously been in PP&E. So we wanted to get it out of PP&E to keep free cash flow clean.","Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Is there sort of a target you guys have internally to get that business to a certain point?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","It's incrementally growing, but again we have six projects going, we've got projects planned to start in the coming year. And we do believe that it's a very synergistic business to our business and there's some natural advantages that we have as with our relationships on the material side, on the land side and the synergies with our homebuilding business to build something that can create value for our shareholders over the long-term.","Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay, thank you.","Jessica L.

Horton team finished the year strong. Pretax income for the fourth quarter increased 12% to $486 million on $4.2 billion of revenue. And our pretax operating margin improved 10 basis points to 11.7%. Over the year, we delivered results in line with or better than original guidance we shared at the start of last year, with consolidated pretax income increasing 18% to $1.6 billion on $14.1 billion of revenue.","We closed 45,751 homes this year, an increase of 5,442 homes or 14% over last year.

During the fourth quarter, we generated $626 million of cash from operations, bringing our total to $435 million for the year and to $1.8 billion over the past three years. These results reflect consistent, strong performance across our broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings.","Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pretax profits, while generating annual positive operating cash flows and improved returns, with 26,200 homes in inventory at the end of the last year, positive sales trends in October and 249,000 lots owned and controlled, we are well-positioned for another strong year in 2018.

Our backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter was 87%.","As a result, our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 11% to $4 billion on 13,165 homes closed, up from $3.6 billion on 12,247 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $306,500, up 3% compared to the prior year, due to an increase in our average sales price per square foot and a higher percentage of closings in our West region this quarter as a result of the hurricane impact in other regions.","In the fourth quarter, our Express Homes brand accounted for 37% of our homes sold, 34% of homes closed and 26% of home sales revenue. And for the year, it accounted for 34% of homes sold, 31% of homes closed and 24% of home sales revenue. Homes for higher-end, move-up and luxury buyers priced greater than $500,000 under both our D.R. Horton and Emerald Homes brands were 8% of our homes closed and 20% of our home sales revenue in the fourth quarter. ","And for the year, they accounted for 7% of homes closed and 17% of home sales revenue. Our active adult Freedom Homes brand is now being offered in 21 markets across 12 states, and customer response to these homes and communities offering a low-maintenance lifestyle at an affordable price has been positive. Freedom Homes accounted for 1% of both our homes sold and closed in the fourth quarter. Bill?","Bill Wheat","The value of our net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 19% from the year-ago quarter to $3.1 billion. And homes sold increased 18% to 10,333 homes.

Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 20.3%, down 20 basis points from the prior year quarter and up 50 basis points sequentially from the third quarter. The sequential improvement in our gross margin was primarily due to lower litigation charges in the current quarter. In today's housing market, we continue to expect our average home sales gross margin to be around 20%, with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21%, due to product and geographic mix, as well as the relative impact in warranty, litigation and interest cost. Bill?","Bill Wheat","In the fourth quarter, SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 8.6%, down 20 basis points from the prior year quarter. This quarter's SG&A includes approximately $3 million of Forestar transaction costs and expenses related to the recent hurricanes.","Homebuilding SG&A for the full year improved 40 basis points to 8.9% compared to 9.3% in 2016, as our increased revenues improved the leverage of our fixed overhead costs. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring our infrastructure adequately supports our growth, and we expect to further leverage our SG&A in 2018. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Financial services pretax income in the fourth quarter was $27.7 million. For the year, financial services pretax income increased 27% to $113 million on $350 million of revenues, representing a 32% pretax operating margin. 96% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 55% of our home buyers. SHA and VA loans accounted for 46% of the mortgage company's volume.","Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 721 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 44% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, consistent with the prior year quarter. Mike?","Mike Murray","We ended the year with 26,200 homes in inventory; 13,800 of our total homes were unsold, with 9,700 in various stages of construction and 4,100 completed. Compared to a year ago, we have 13% more homes in inventory, putting us in a very strong position to start 2018. Our fourth quarter investments in lots, land, and development totaled $771 million, of which, $424 million was to replenish finished lots and land, and $347 million was for land development. For the year, we invested $3.5 billion in lots, land, and development. We are planning to replenish our own land and lot supply in 2018 at a rate to support our expected growth and revenues. David?","David Auld","This year, we achieved our previously stated goal of a 50% owned, 50% optioned land and lot pipeline. We believe we can increase the option portion of our pipeline to 60% over the next few years, while maintaining our number of owned lots relatively flat with the current level. At September 30, our land and lot portfolio consisted of 249,000 lots, of which, 125,000 are owned and 124,000 are controlled through optioned contracts.","91,000 of our total lots are finished, of which 33,000 are owned and 58,000 are optioned. We have increased our option lot position 35% from a year ago, and we plan to continue expanding our relationships with land developers across our national footprint to further increase the option portion of our land supply. Our 249,000 total lot portfolio is a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market and a sufficient lot supply to support our targeted growth. Mike?","Mike Murray","On October 5, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar Group, a publicly traded residential real estate company, for approximately $560 million in cash. D.R. Horton's alignment with Forestar advances our strategy of expanding relationships with land developers across the country and increasing our optioned land and lot pipeline to enhance operational efficiency and returns.","At the acquisition date, Forestar had operations in 14 markets in 10 states, where it owned, directly or through joint ventures, interest in 44 residential and mixed-use projects. Both companies are currently identifying land development opportunities to expand Forestar's platform. Since the closing months ago, Forestar has been evaluating approximately 15 D.R. Horton-sourced opportunities located primarily in Texas, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, two of which Forestar has already closed.","These 15 communities will yield approximately 8,000 finished lots, the majority of which could be sold at D.R. Horton in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies. Forestar's aggregate peak inventory investment for this portfolio of projects is expected to be approximately $200 million, and we expect Forestar to commit at least $400 million of capital, primarily to D.R. Horton-sourced projects during 2018.","We are also actively working with Forestar on plans for their existing projects and are in discussions for D.R. Horton to potentially purchase approximately 3,000 lots from Forestar's current portfolio. The post-merger interactions between the D.R. Horton and Forestar teams have been very productive, and we are pleased with the progress we're making on the integration. ","We are confident that Forestar's growth is likely to exceed the original projections outlined in our slide deck from June. We continue to be excited about the value that this relationship will create over the long term for both D.R. Horton and Forestar shareholders. As a public company, Forestar will continue to file quarterly and annual reports, as well as any other required public information, but they will not host quarterly conference calls.","D.R. Horton will be handling Forestar's Investor Relations to allow the Forestar team to focus solely on integration and operations during the coming months. Forestar operates on a calendar year-end and will file its 2017 annual report by mid-March of 2018. We do not expect Forestar to have a material impact on our fiscal 2018 earnings.","We plan to outline the purchase accounting for the transaction and presentation of our consolidated results, including Forestar, at our first quarter earnings release and conference call in January. And we will provide an update on our integration progress at that time. We expect to provide initial Forestar guidance for 2018 in January. We then expect to provide additional 2018 guidance for Forestar on our second quarter call in April, following Forestar's calendar year in reporting. Bill?","Bill Wheat","During the fourth quarter, we generated $626 million of cash flow from operations. For the full year, our cash flow from operations was $435 million, in line with our original guidance. Our cash flow generation exceeded our updated guidance, due to better-than-expected closings in late September and a greater-than-anticipated impact from the hurricanes on land development and construction activity.","At September 30, our homebuilding liquidity consisted of $973 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.2 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage improved 520 basis points from a year ago to 24%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at September 30 was $2.4 billion, and we have a total of $400 million of senior notes that mature in fiscal 2018, which we will likely refinance in the next few months.","We ended the year with a shareholders' equity balance of $7.7 billion and book value per common share of $20.66, up 13% from a year ago. Based on our financial metrics and positive outlook for fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 25% to $12.05 per share.","We currently expect to pay dividends of approximately $190 million to our shareholders in fiscal 2018. We repurchased 1.85 million shares of our common stock for $60.6 million, during fiscal 2017 and currently have a $200 million share repurchase authorization outstanding effective through July 2018. David?","David Auld","Our balanced-capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet strength, liquidity, consistent earnings growth and cash flow generation are increasing our flexibility, and we plan to utilize our strong position to improve the long-term value of the company.","Our top cash flow priorities are to consolidate market share by investing in our homebuilding business and strategic acquisitions, reduce or maintain debt levels, and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We expect to generate at least $500 million of cash from operations in 2018, growing to over $1 billion annually in 2020.","As we generate increased cash flows, we expect to pay down debt, decrease our leverage, increase our dividend and repurchase shares to offset dilution, with a target to keep our outstanding share count flat beginning in 2020. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Looking forward, our expectations for fiscal 2018 are consistent with what we shared on our July call and are based on today's market conditions. They also exclude any impact from Forestar. In fiscal 2018, we expect to generate a consolidated pretax margin of 11.5% to 11.7%. We expect to generate consolidated revenues between $15.5 billion and $16.3 billion and to close between 50,500 and 52,500 homes.","We anticipate our home sales gross margin for the full year will be around 20% with potential quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21%. We estimate our annual homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues will be around 8.7%, with our SG&A percentage higher in the first half of the year and lower in the second half.","We expect our financial services operating margin for the year to be 30% to 32%, with the first 2 quarters of the year lower and the third and fourth quarters higher. We forecast an income tax rate for 2018 of approximately 35.2%, and that our diluted share count will increase by less than 1%.","We also expect to generate positive cash flow from operations of at least $500 million in 2018, excluding any impact from the consolidation of Forestar in our financial statements. Our fiscal 2018 results will be significantly impacted by the spring selling season, and we plan to update our expectations as necessary each quarter, as visibility to the spring and the full year becomes clearer.","We do not currently expect Forestar to have a material impact on D.R. Horton's earnings in fiscal 2018. For the first quarter of 2018, we expect our number of homes closed will approximate a beginning backlog conversion rate in the range of 83% to 86%. We anticipate our first quarter home sales gross margin will be around 20%, and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the first quarter to be the range of 9.5% to 9.8%. David?","David Auld","In closing, the strength of our team and operating platform across the country allowed us to deliver full year results for 2017 in line with or better than guidance we provided at the start of last year. While growing our revenue and pretax profits at a double-digit pace again this year, we generated $435 million of positive cash flow from operations and improved our annual homebuilding return on inventory by 120 basis points to 16.6%.","We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pretax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while continuing to generate annual positive operating cash flows and improved returns. We are well positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offering across our D.R. Horton, Emerald, Express and Freedom brands, attractive finished lot and land position, and most importantly, our outstanding team across the country.","We congratulate the entire D.R. Horton team on our 16th consecutive year as the largest builder by volume in the United States, and we thank you for your hard work and accomplishments. We look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operations in 2018 as we celebrate our 40th anniversary year.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is now live.","John Lovallo","Hi guys, thank you for taking my questions. The first question is, as D.R. Horton becomes more asset-light, cash flow should improve pretty meaningfully, in our view, very meaningfully. Where do you think free cash flow conversion can kind of trend over the next few years? And if it is, as solid as we think at least, I mean, would you be open to more aggressively repurchasing shares?","Mike Murray","John, we're taking this one step at a time, but we've basically stated that we expect to achieve the cash flow from operations greater than $500 million this year, and we do expect that to ramp up over the next couple of years. We expect that by 2020, our cash flow from operations should be in excess of $1 billion. That's our estimate today and our guidance today. But certainly, we have - we do have high expectations for our ability to increase our option portion of our land position, and certainly, Forestar is a part of that as well. And over the next year as we build out Forestar's platform and it begins to contribute a greater impact on our overall operations, I do think we do have a lot of cash flow generation capability that could, potentially, exceed what we're guiding to now for the next couple of years.","On share repurchase, we are starting to repurchase more shares than we have historically, and our target right now is to increase those share repurchases to a point that it fully offsets our dilution, so that our share count will remain flat by 2020. Certainly, to the extent that we're able to generate more cash than we're currently guiding in time that, that could change as well over the longer term. But right now, in the three-year window, we're targeting to offset dilution over the next couple of years.","John Lovallo","Okay, that's helpful. And then, touching on the options. The 60% option percentage that you guys have out there now, you maybe have been talking about that for a bit. Has the bogey changed at all, given the inclusion of Forestar? And I mean is there anything that could prevent you from reaching much higher levels, call it, 70%, even 75%?","Bill Wheat","I think nothing's really changed with regard to the 60% target with Forestar. That's part of our strategy to achieve that. Over time, once we achieve that goal, we will continue to set higher goals for ourselves. But it's one developer, one contract, one project at a time that we make these relationships work.","John Lovallo","Thanks very much guys.","Bill Wheat","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Alan Ratner","Hi guys, good morning. Congrats on a great year and the progress on Forestar. Exciting to see that moving forward. First question on Forestar, you mentioned a few markets where you've already sourced in options and deals. I think those are all existing Forestar markets, if I remember correctly. I'm just curious, as you're ramping up the personnel within Forestar, have you looked into bringing that operation into some of your more higher cost markets like California, Pacific Northwest, where obviously, the land investment is going to be a much greater percentage of the home value; it would certainly tie up a lot of more capital there. Any thoughts on really the viability of optioning a meaningful percentage of lots out in these higher-cost markets?","Bill Wheat","To your first point, we have - Forestar has acquired a project in Florida, which is not in a market they've been operating in. And we're looking to - as we've talked about kind of bootstrap our way in, leverage the growth of Forestar into new markets, leveraging the Horton platform existing in those markets. With regard to sort of a higher-land-basis markets, we have identified a couple of projects to take a look at up in the Pacific Northwest, but because they are more capital-intensive, they may be a little slower to grow their ramp there.","Alan Ratner","Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then second question on M&A, in general, from obviously a big deal here in the space over the last couple of weeks. I want to make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. On one hand, you're definitely looking to shift the business towards more asset-light, which clearly, the market is rewarding and seems to like. On the other hand, I know you guys have always been very focused on scale in both local, as well as national and take a lot of pride in being the largest builder in the country, and certainly, there's advantages to go along with that. So, I'm just curious now as you think about the allocation of capital, would it be inconsistent for you to continue to look toward M&A opportunities on the traditional homebuilding side of the business, even if that means temporarily lengthening the land book if it comes with the benefit of increased scale?","David Auld","Alan, we look at deals every day, and we'll continue to do that. We're looking for a fit. We're looking for something that is additive that we can grow, and we look at them from the same stamp when we look at a piece of land. We're going to - it's got to be a fit, culturally, for us, for the people. But from a capital outlay standpoint, we want to return the cash over the asset base within two years. And so that makes it difficult to look at the great big deals.","We've had a lot of success integrating small private companies in over the last four or five years, like the way - like what that does for our company, like the fact that you get the return of the cash pretty quick. We'll look at them, yes. We're going to look at them, we're going to continue look at them. But it's a tough hurdle to get over.","Alan Ratner","Alright, good luck.","Bill Wheat","Thank you, Alan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.","Stephen East","Thank you, good morning guys. Just quickly to follow on Alan's M&A question. I know Forestar's not a big deal for you all, but it's a big change in the way you all operate. So, is your appetite for M&A changed at all temporarily?","David Auld","No. I mean, I think what we're trying to do is look at things on a consistent basis with a lot of discipline and does it make us better over the long term. So, kind of what we talked about before is what we're going to continue to do and continue to talk about.","Stephen East","Fair enough. Here comes my compound question here. Forestar. Several things, I sort of call its first 100 days plan, maybe, give a little bit more detail about what you all were talking about there, as you look maybe over the next year or two, how that evolves. And did I hear you right that you expect that they would commit $400 million of capital in 2018? And then if so, just wanting to understand on your land in development, the $3.5 million you did this year, does that change with the Forestar spending $400 million or so in 2018?","Jessica Hansen","Sure, Steven, I know we gave a lot of detail on the call. We've actually got a time line included in the presentation that we'll post that will outline kind of over the next year what we're planning on giving you further on Forestar. It also includes some of those numbers we talked about. But you did hear that correctly that we're planning to commit at least $400 million of capital, primarily to D.R. Horton-sourced projects starting 2018.","And that doesn't mean we're only going to use $400 million for Forestar this year. We're looking at other capital sources. Primarily in the near term, we'll likely put together a revolving credit facility, and we'll also be recycling through some of their assets and bringing that cash back in the door as well.","Bill Wheat","And Steven, in terms of our land spend at D.R. Horton, we're in year one of Forestar, and as they build out their portfolio, we will still be replenishing our lot supply in 2018 at D.R. Horton, and we expect to keep our owned-lot supply relatively flat, while we grow our option position with other land developers and as Forestar grows their platform as well. So, our land-spend in order to replenish lots and land at D.R. Horton in fiscal 2018 will continue to be at or above the same level that we did this past year. Certainly, over the long term, there's potential for that to not have to grow at the same pace and not have to replenish as much, but we've got to build out the Forestar platform, as well as our third-party developer platforms further.","Jessica Hansen","Consistent with what you've seen in each of these last few years though, we would expect our inventories to grow at a slower rate than our revenues which will drive that continued improvement in returns.","Stephen East","Got you. All right. Great answer. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Wetenhall","Hi, good morning, and thanks for all the color. Congrats on a good year. I want to go in the time machine back to 2006 when you delivered 53,000 homes. And I think that's the peak deliveries for Horton since it's been a public company. And you're talking about $1 billion of free cash flow by 2020, which is a remarkable number. So, I was just trying to figure out, like in - if you're - between 2016 and 2017, you added about 5,000 homes, and it looks like you're going to add 6,000 homes in 2018, what's the growth profile that you're, kind of, underwriting to, to get that $1 billion of free cash flow by 2020?","David Auld","Bob, we plan on double-digit growth next three years. I mean that's how we're setting up the operations of this company. And we're going to get a little better building each house. And we feel like the market has got some legs and it's a double-digit growth year over year over year, you generate a lot of cash.","Bob Wetenhall","Just to be tactical about it, you're jacked up about the outlook, it sounds like?","Bill Wheat","That's a technical term, yes, Bob. 10% to 15% growth over the next three years and continue to get more efficient and generate stronger returns, which would mean inventory will grow at a slower pace than revenues.","Jessica Hansen","And it's specifically a revenue target. This year, you'll see in our fiscal 2018 guidance, we're expecting it mainly to come from closings growth. As we go over the next couple of years, we'll give more specifics, but the target is for double-digit revenue growth.","David Auld","I will tell you, Bob, the market feels really good. The positioning of this company with its people and its communities - never been better. So yes, we are pretty jacked up.","Bob Wetenhall","Sounds good. Just one other question. Obviously, you have a very positive view of the marketplace. I wanted to get your view, if the Fed hikes next year, say 3x or 4x, does that put a damper on your ability to grow by reducing affordability? Or do you think where Horton's position in the market and renters becoming buyers, that's really not an issue, and instead, the Fed's tightening because the economy is good and they need to do it, there's job growth and that just means you're going to see more buyers? Thanks, and good luck. Congrats on a great year.","David Auld","Thank you, Bob. We're going to adjust to the market if affordability continues to drive. We're going to meet the market where we need to. The best thing that can happen for homebuilding is a strong economy and job creation. So, given those two things, we'll figure out a way to sell houses, I can guarantee it.","Bob Wetenhall","Lot of confidence. Thanks again, good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Please proceed with your question.","Carl Reichardt","Good morning guys. I wanted to talk a little bit about store count for next year. You are, I think, relatively flat on community count this year, but absorptions were up particularly well back half. As you look out to next year, do you expect to increase that store count a little bit more and that be more of a driver of order growth to support delivery volume? Or will it continue to be absorption?","Jessica Hansen","Sure, Carl. One of the hardest things for us to predict. And as I remind everyone, I think, every quarter, is why we don't give specific guidance regarding community count. But our community count was at 2% year-over-year to finish the year out. It was actually down 1% sequentially. So, as we look and move through fiscal 2018, we really expect it to be flat, no more than slightly up. So, a continued story of absorptions maybe with a little bit of community count growth to drive that 10% to 15% increase in units this year.","Carl Reichardt","Okay, Jessica. And then, Bill, just a clarification question on cash flow for fourth quarter, better than you expected, and you said part of that was due to a lack of the ability to develop, so not spend, due to hurricanes and then also some additional closings. Can you sort of parse out for me the dollars associated with each of those two elements in terms of what came in better versus what didn't happen and would go into Q1 or later quarters? Thanks. ","Bill Wheat","I don't have the specific dollars in front of me, Carl, here but the delta on the closing side, we provided revised guidance in mid-September of about 85% backlog conversion. Our operators were able to over deliver on that in late September, and we delivered 87%, so that 2% change in conversion rate would be the delta on the closing side. The remainder would be less spending on inventory, primarily in the land development side, a little bit of land back as well. ","As in the - primarily in the areas that were affected by the hurricane, there was - where there was certainly a slowdown and some disruption in activity there. And that was a little bit greater than we anticipated. And so, the remainder of that cash flow delta would come from our land activity. We would have expected our annual land spend and development spend to be a bit higher than it was. And so clearly, that's a timing thing that does slide into 2018. But even with that, we still expect to exceed $500 million of cash flow from operations in 2018.","Carl Reichardt","All right. Thanks Bill, great job guys.","Bill Wheat","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Rehaut","Thanks, good morning everyone and congrats again on the Forestar - completing that transaction. A couple of questions around that as obviously, that's kind of been the primary focus of investors and how that kind of reshapes your company over the next few years, or perhaps, continues on your current path of more optioning and better returns. When you talk about the operating cash flow outlook for 2018 of $500 million, which I think is up from your prior guidance of $300 million to $500 million, it seems like part of that is due to the Forestar shift, if I'm thinking about it right, with the $400 million of capital expected to be of Forestar to use for D.R. Horton-sourced deals. So just trying to get a sense of maybe what the operating cash flow would look like, if you netted out the Forestar investment, is it as simple as $500 million minus $400 million? I know you talked about some recycling of cash as well from Forestar. I guess that's my first question.","Bill Wheat","Mike, I think, looking at the $400 million we expect Forestar to commit in 2018, not all of that will be spent in 2018. That's the commitment to those projects. As they develop and execute over time, that - some of that will be spent in 2018, some of it in 2019. So, it's not all $400 million is going to go out on the - when you start the project. The other part of it is that Forestar does have a current portfolio of projects, a lot of lots under contracts to builders to sell over the next 12 months that they'll be continuing to deliver lots to those builders, which will bring up more capital to continue developing some of their existing projects, as well as invest in net new projects for the Forestar program. So, we're still working out the exact capital needs Forestar's going to have and expect to get more of that information back to you in 2018.","Mike Rehaut","Okay. I appreciate that, obviously looking forward to that. I guess, secondly, you also mentioned that even after the first month or so, that looks like you could exceed some of the projections for Forestar that you originally filed, you had in your June presentation. And looking at that presentation, just for example, if you take like a 2020 snapshot of those slides, where you said for Forestar could have lot deliveries of a little over 7,000 versus maybe around 1,000 in 2018, just trying to get a sense for what that upside might be.","You've already noted that - you've provided 15 sourced deals to Forestar, of which, two have already closed. And in the assumptions set on - from the presentation, I think on Slide 10, you said that the assumption there would be 8 projects for Forestar in the first year. So, I assume, obviously, we're not talking about a doubling of the projections but just trying to get a sense perhaps of what the upside might be?","Bill Wheat","We're still working with the Forestar guys to figure out exactly what those projections ought to look like. We are optimistic about the numbers we put out in that June deck that we're seeing a greater deal flow that will give us an ability to exceed these numbers. It's hard to sit here today and quantify that exactly, but we are seeing a deal flow that we expect will be greater than what we anticipated for these projections. Doubling, probably a little too aggressive to say that it's going to double at this point, but we're working hard to find every opportunity that makes sense and hits the return hurdles for Forestar.","Mike Rehaut","Great. Thank you.","Bill Wheat","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next session today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Market. Your line is now live.","Ken Zener","Good morning, everybody.","Jessica Hansen ","Good morning.","Bill Wheat","Good morning Ken.","Ken Zener","So, one of the things that we always talk about is the pace that you talked about your community count. What I'd like to focus on is your units under construction in your 4Q, so your September, and how you've made the choice to not cycle down as much, often as other builders do seasonally, which really gives you just a higher entry point into 2Q. Is there any particular reason - and I think that's what's really different about your business model versus other builders is you do build all this spec. Looking at this year, you're up 13% I believe year-over-year versus last year at 17%, community count seems to be flat in both cases, is there something happening that this year versus last year in terms of construction or your regional mix that's kind of keeping that 26,000 unchanged number at a lower growth rate than you had last year?","David Auld","No, Ken, I wouldn't say there's anything different than what we've done. We're just positioning to grow the company. And I do think that you get to a certain size of the - the positioning has to - takes a bit longer, so we purposefully put more inventory out, started more inventory late in the fourth quarter to be positioned for a, what we think is going to be a very good spring selling market.","Bill Wheat","And Ken, two years ago, I think we entered fiscal 2016, probably a little lighter than we would've liked to have been in housing inventory, for the market that we saw in front of us. And so, as we grew our year-over-year, year-end inventory position in 2015 to 2016 pretty aggressively, and we're glad we did because we were able to take advantage of that into 2016. The growth from 2016 to 2017 has moderated a little bit from that prior year growth because we were better positioned to start 2016 - we were better positioned, excuse me, to start 2017 than we were 2016. So that gave us less need to add inventory, but we still feel what units we have on hand right now, 26,300, we feel great about that positioning going into 2018.","Jessica Hansen","And just for reference, that's our overall housing inventory that's up to 13%. Our spec count is actually at 17% going into the year, which we feel very good about.","Ken Zener","Okay. And if I could use that segue to hinge on spring selling, which we approach just seasonally, where over the last few years, your pace, if you look back over the long term, and it appears usually, the pace usually sell at 15% to 18% in the December quarter. But in the last few years, it's been either up or down single-digit, which is a big change and that provides a lot greater pace momentum. Can you talk about what your base outlook is for spring selling; I realize you don't know the exact numbers, but just from the seasonal basis, what do you expect that to be historically?","Jessica Hansen","It goes in line with what we're trying to drive from a closings perspective, which is the only number we actually guide to. But if you look at it, generally speaking, we typically see a very sharp increase from December to March, although September to December's relatively flat, slightly up to slightly down. Typically, December to March, we would expect to see, at least, call it, 50% increase in our sales to kind of feel good about where the spring's headed.","Mike Murray","A lot of it has to do with how you're positioned, too, where the houses are, what communities, what submarkets. So, I can tell you right now, we feel very good about our position in this year. And I think it's the best we've done positioning for a fiscal year out of the last three.","Jessica Hansen","Houses and finished lots.","David Auld","Yes.","Ken Zener","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next session today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now live.","Buck Horne","Hi thanks, good morning. I was curious about the kind of optioned land market at this point. Not all options I guess are structured the same. So, I guess I'm curious in terms of what are the typical terms you're able to negotiate in today's market, whether it's percentage cash down, takedown commitments, the length of time you are able to get these locked up. Just wondering to kind of how far out on the time horizon you're able to control land in this current environment?","Bill Wheat","Buck, that's a deal-by-deal situation. On average, we've got about 5% deposit up for remaining purchase price. Some of the projects we control 18 months, 24 months\u2019 supply, others, we control 3 to 5 years' worth of supply in a given project, and it varies. There are certainly some we put up more than 5%, others less than 5% to arrive at that average. We work very hard at developing those relationships with the developer community. Key business partners for us in all of our markets, our division presidents, our land acquisition professionals work very hard to understand their developers and their market and who they need to partner with to get lots put on the ground and then be a good partner to those developers.","Buck Horne","Okay. And just in terms of hard cost, increases or inflation rates, just kind of what are the trends you're seeing in terms of materials, lumber, concrete and the like, in terms of cost increases going into 2018? And also, the labor situation? Any comments you have on skilled-labor availability and wage rates you're seeing into the markets right now?","Jessica Hansen","In terms of our cost, Buck, per square foot that we typically talk about, our revenues, once again, outpace our stick-and-brick costs on a year-over-year basis. We did see a slightly higher increase in both our revenues per square foot and our stick-and-brick per square foot in the first three quarters of the year. But that really was just driven by the closings mix shift that Mike mentioned in our scripted comments, because we had a higher percentage of our closings coming from the West.","So, I'd say, really, we're just seeing more of the same. If you take out the closings mix, we're seeing a very minor increase in our revenues, just enough to cover our stick-and-brick increase. And then the reason you're not seeing that flow through to an increased gross margin is we continue to have a little bit higher land cost flowing through as well.","Buck Horne","Okay. Thanks guys, congrats.","Bill Wheat","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much guys and congratulations on our really strong quarter and a good end to the year. My first question relates to economies of scale. Certainly, it is apparent from your results over the last few years, if not longer, that there is a substantive difference in terms of how you're able to translate a given level of demand on the ground up to shareholder value. And it seems that there are economies of scale that maybe weren't really fully realized or realizable 10 years ago or 15 years ago. And I was curious if you could just talk about what kinds of things have changed at the corporate level in the way you're managing your business to extract and to drive these economies of scale, and if all of them are the local level or if you've been able to achieve meaningful ones at the national level?","David Auld","Steve, during the downturn, we all had to get a lot better and look at everything we were doing and try to figure out how we could do it with a little less people a little more efficiently, and a little better or a lot better. And we - the key operators in this company went through that downturn, very painful experience, don't want to go through it again. So, we strive every day to get a little better in everything we do. And I think that has helped and has created a different operating mindset today than we had in 2006.","Mike Murray","And then, Steven, I have to add to that, just kind of overall, part of the ability to approach the business differently does come to our balance sheet structure. And we are operating in a significantly lower leverage level than we did the last time that we were at this scale. And so - and I think that's important. It does reduce our cost structure, it reduces the risk profile significantly.","And then our approach to land, we're being more efficient there, moving more towards option and having a lower-risk land strategy but also more efficient higher return strategy that allows us to still generate cash flow, while growing is a significantly different position than we were at the last time that we were at this scale. So, we like our position but we still see, obviously, plenty of opportunities to continue to improve on it from where we are.","Stephen Kim","Got it. Okay. Second question is on the M&A landscape. I think you said two things that I found particularly interesting. I think, David, you said that you looked for - you look at acquisitions pretty much the same as you look at a piece of land. And I think you also mentioned that you preferred smaller tuck-in deals. And so, I just wanted to ask a couple of questions regarding those two points. So, one is regarding - looking at acquisitions of a piece of land. Generally speaking, we thought that companies such as yourself typically don't like to pay a lot above book value for the acquisitions you look at. And similar to the way you look at a piece of land, I mean, that's where most of the opportunities, it would seem, arise from is a landholding. So, could you talk about what characteristics in an acquisition would encourage you to pay substantially above book value? And then regarding the smaller tuck-in deals, why smaller ones? Is there something about the difficulty to integrate a large deal that concerns you? Because I would think the competition for the smaller deals would be greater than for the larger deals, particularly, with the Asian companies recently on the hunt, it would seem valuations for the smaller deals are kind of getting pushed up. And so, can you just sort of describe your preference for these smaller deals and what the pipeline looks like compared to last year or the year before?","David Auld","I would say that - to start with the end, I'd say the pipeline is probably a little longer today than it was a year ago. And what we're looking for is not necessarily small or big, but - or bigger, but something that is additive to our company, that we can take and grow or integrate some of the things they're doing or the people that they have that make us better. That's - first thing we look at in any acquisition is the culture of the company. And if the culture is not aligned, the people aren't going to be aligned, it's typically not a great deal for us. And the next thing we look about is what kind of premium we got to pay and can we earn that premium back in two years? And if we can't, the deal structure is probably not right for us. We'll let Mike...","Mike Murray","With the current platform we have, we're not being - we're not motivated to pay a big premium for anything that we couldn't otherwise do ourselves. As David said before, if it's not something that's going to make our company better, it's probably something that we'd better up spend our time and effort focused in a different area. I mean, I guess the only thing that would motivate us to want to pay a significant premium over book value would be to end my career at Horton. That, that would pretty much do it, I think.","Jessica Hansen","We don't see any lack of opportunities to grow our business organically at the pace we want to grow at today. So, it puts us in a very strong position that there's no deal we have to go do to hit our growth targets.","Stephen Kim","All right. That's helpful. Just to translate, when you said the pipeline is a longer than it used to be, does that mean that it is more chock-full of acquisitions that are of interest or the opposite?","Bill Wheat","No, there are plenty of acquisition opportunities that we're evaluating to determine interest on. I mean - and it's the way it's kind of continued to be for the last several years and it's been - people - the longer the cycle has performed well, the industry has performed well, more and more people have a confidence that they feel like they can price their company comfortable. And a lot of the private builder situations, the principles, the individuals running it day-to-day-to-day are three to five years older today than they were three to five years ago. So, their perspective and outlook potentially may be changing.","Stephen Kim","Yeah it is a commonality. All right guys. Thanks very much. Congratulations and thanks very much.","Bill Wheat","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Please proceed with your question.","Jack Micenko","First question, you're looking at your Southeast operations, looks like you did a bit better, certainly than some of the peers who pointed out a lot of disruption with some of the storms. Curious what you attribute that relative outperformance to?","David Auld","Great people.","Mike Murray","Yes, obviously. That is the platform. It is people. We've got a great position there. There was an impact. There's no doubt there was an impact. There was a disruption from hurricanes. But we've got a lot of hard-working people that worked their way through it. ","Jack Micenko","Okay. And then, stepping back a bit, you're going to generate a ton of cash. Your land strategy is moving to be more capital-efficient. Kind of call it out that we're not going to see outsized buybacks, at least, in the next couple of years. I'm just curious, how do we think about - or how do you think about return on equity - improving return on equity? You talk about de-leveraging. What am I missing in this cash build and equity build? I mean, I think book value was up 13% to 14% year-over-year. Is there more to squeeze out of operations? Where does the ROE improvement come from with so much cash build?","Bill Wheat","There's always room to improve on operations, we'll continue to improve on that. And we are focused on return on equity as well. In order to better - our primary driver right now at return on equity is to continue to drive a stronger ROI. And we do expect to continue to grow revenues faster than our inventory growth to drive that. And then we're at the beginning stages of beginning to repurchase shares that will also provide an element of an improvement to return on equity over time. But we're going to walk before we run. ","We're going to begin by taking the steps towards offsetting our dilution. And when we've achieved that, then we'll see where we are, and we'll take the next steps from there. Clearly, we believe that longer term, we have significant cash flow generation opportunities that will give us a lot of flexibility down the line. But for the window that we see in the next two to three years, we believe we're comfortable today stating the loss at dilution, and then we'll take the next steps when we get there.","Jessica Hansen","And you'll see in the investor presentation that we're going to post at the end of this call, we actually have added a return on equity slide after our return on inventory, showing that our ROE, while reducing leverage pretty dramatically, has improved from 11.8% in fiscal 2014 to 14.4% in fiscal 2017. So, it's improving along with our ROI while we're de-levering.","Bill Wheat","And we do expect it to continue to improve.","Jack Micenko","Just one more. Bill, do you have a leverage target? I mean, you got the 2.4, you're going to refinance the $400 million in 2018 you suggested. Is there a leverage ratio that we should think about going out to 2020?","Bill Wheat","We have no specific leverage ratio. We expect our leverage ratio to continue to drop from now through 2020. We expect to keep our debt level relatively flat this year by refinancing, but our leverage ratio will drop this year, and then we'd expect that ratio to continue to drop through 2020, while also then increasing our dividends and increasing our share repurchase and growing our business. A balanced approach is really - that's the approach we're taking.","David Auld","It's a balanced approach.","Jack Micenko","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our final question today is coming from Dan Oppenheim from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Oppenheim","I was wondering if you can talk a bit more in terms of the success you've had with Express Homes and the Southwest. You're getting back to prior peak volumes, but the Southwest is basically 22% of that prior peak at this point, where we're seeing obviously loan limits being a real challenge in some of those markets. As you think about the gradual easing of credits in FHA and VA loans coming down slightly, relative to where it has been, do you see more potential there in terms of just a greater share of closings coming from there? How are you thinking about that in terms of future investment?","David Auld","We think the Phoenix Southwest, which has really driven the Southwest region, is going to continue to outperform. We're incredibly well positioned there, made some very strategic acquisitions on the land lot side a couple of years ago. The operating team out there was kind of reset in conjunction with those, and right now we've got an all-star team running that division with incredibly well-positioned lots. So, our expectation is you're going to see continued growth in the Southwest. And they will get back to their peak at some point.","Dan Oppenheim","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to management for any further closing comment.","David Auld","Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in January to share our first quarter results. And a special thank you to the D.R. Horton team in a tough fourth quarter because of weather. You did an outstanding job of delivering the 2017 and even a better job of positioning for 2018. You're the best in the industry, and we thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you, Donna, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Before we get started, today's call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R.

Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's Annual Report on Form 10-K and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website in investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q by early next week.","Consistent with the first quarter, our consolidated financials present our homebuilding, Forestar land development, financial services, and other operations on a combined basis. The segment information following the consolidated financials in our press release includes detailed financial information for all of our reporting segments.","And as a reminder, after this call we will post updated supplementary data to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. The supplementary information includes data on our homebuilding return on inventory, home sales gross margin, changes in active selling communities, product mix, and our mortgage operations.","Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I am pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","The D.R. Horton team delivered a solid second quarter and the spring selling season is off to a strong start, with our sales increasing 13% from the prior year. In the second quarter, our consolidated pre-tax increased 26% to $445 million on a 17% increase in revenues to $3.8 billion. Our pre-tax profit margin improved 80 basis points to 11.7%. These results reflect the strength of our operational teams, our diverse product offerings, and the leverage of both our national and local scale across our broad geographic footprint.","Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both revenue and pre-tax profits while increasing our annual operating cash flows and returns. For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory was 17.6%, an improvement of 160 basis points from 16% a year ago. With 29,400 homes in inventory at the end of March and 258,000 lots owned and controlled, we are well positioned for the remainder of 2018 and future years.","Mike?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the second quarter increased 53% to $351 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $229 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Our effective tax rates for the quarter and year to date reflect the rate reduction from the Tax Act of 2017, an excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, and the February Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which retroactively reinstated the federal tax credit for energy-efficient homes. The current year's six-month period also includes a one-time non-cash tax charge of $108.7 million to remeasure the company's net deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act.","Our consolidated pre-tax income for the quarter increased 26% to $445 million versus $354 million a year ago, and homebuilding pre-tax income increased 29% to $416 million compared to $322 million. Our current quarter results include $30.1 million of pre-tax inventory and land option charges to cost of sales, of which $24.5 million relates to the settlement of an outstanding dispute associated with a land transaction.","Our backlog conversion rate for the second quarter was 100%, at the high end of our guidance range. As a result, our second quarter home sales revenues increased 16% to $3.7 billion on 12,281 homes closed, up from $3.2 billion on 10,685 homes closed in the prior-year quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $299,000, up 1% from the prior-year quarter.","This quarter, entry level homes marketed under our Express Homes brand accounted for 38% of homes closed and 30% of home sales revenue. Our homes for higher-end, move-up, and luxury buyers priced greater than $500,000 were 6% of homes closed and 15% of home sales revenue. Our active adult Freedom Homes brand is now being offered in 25 markets across 14 states and accounted for 2% of homes closed and 1.5% of home sales revenue in the second quarter.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","The value of our net sales orders in the second quarter increased 13% from the prior-year quarter to $4.7 billion, and homes sold increased 13% to 15,828 homes. Our average number of active selling communities decreased 1% from the prior-year quarter. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the second quarter was $299,600. And the 19% cancellation rate during the quarter was consistent with the second quarter of last year.","The value of our backlog increased 9% from a year ago to $4.8 billion, with an average sales price per home of $305,100 and homes in backlog increased 8% to 15,841 homes.","Jessica?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the second quarter was 20.8%, consistent with the first quarter and an improvement of 100 basis points from the prior-year quarter. 60 basis points of the improvement from the prior-year quarter was due to lower interest, litigation, and warranty costs, and 40 basis points was due to controlling construction cost increases while also reducing incentives or raising prices in communities where we are achieving our targeted absorption.","Based on current market conditions and our results for the first half of the year, we now expect our gross margin will be in the range of 20.5% to 21% for the full fiscal year, with quarterly fluctuations that may be outside of the range due to product and geographic mix as well as the relative impact of warranty, litigation, and interest costs.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","In the second quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 8.8%, an improvement of 50 basis points from the prior-year quarter. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our expected growth.","Jessica?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Financial services pre-tax income in the second quarter was $31.4 million, with a pre-tax profit margin of 33% compared to $32.2 million of pre-tax income and a 37% pre-tax profit margin in the prior-year quarter. Financial services profit margin declined this quarter primarily from lower pricing on loan origination sales due to competitive pressures in the mortgage market. 97% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 57% of D.R. Horton home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 43% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 722 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time home buyers represented 45% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, consistent with the prior-year quarter.","Mike?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We ended the second quarter with 29,400 homes in inventory. 14,200 of our total homes were unsold with 10,400 homes in various stages of construction and 3,800 homes completed. Compared to a year ago, we have 8% more homes in inventory, which positions us well for the remainder of the spring selling season in fiscal 2018.","David?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Our homebuilding investment in lots, land, and development during the second quarter totaled $862 million, of which $504 million was for finished lots and land acquisition and $358 million was for land development. Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for new communities remained consistent at a minimum 20% annual pre-tax return on inventory and a return of our initial cash investment within 24 months. We expect our homebuilding operations to invest approximately $4 billion in lots, land, and development in 2018.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","At March 31, our homebuilding land and lot portfolio consisted of 258,000 lots, of which 124,000 lots or 48% were owned and 134,000 lots or 52% were controlled through option contracts. 103,000 of our total homebuilding lots were finished, of which 35,000 lots were owned and 68,000 lots were optioned. 8,700 of our optioned lots at March 31 were owned or controlled by Forestar. We have increased our option lot position 23% from a year ago, and we believe we can increase the option portion of our total planned and lot pipeline to 60% over the next few years, while keeping our number of owned lots near the current level.","We plan to continue expanding our relationships with land developers across the country, as well as growing our majority-owned Forestar land development operations. Our 258,000 homebuilding lot portfolio is a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market and sufficient to support our expected growth.","Mike?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","As most of you know, Forestar Group became a majority-owned subsidiary of D.R. Horton in October 2017. Forestar is a publicly-traded land development company with operations in 18 markets and 10 states. D.R. Horton's alignment with Forestar advances our strategy of expanding relationships with land developers across the country to increase our access to option land and lot positions and enhance operational efficiency and returns. The interactions between D.R. Horton and Forestar continue to be extremely productive, and we're excited about the value this relationship will create over the long term for both D.R. Horton and Forestar shareholders.","Forestar's operating results for the three-month period ended March 31, and from the date of acquisition are fully consolidated in our financial statements, with the 25% interest D.R. Horton does not own reported as noncontrolling interest. The segment information tables provided in our press release present Forestar's financials on its historical cost basis, while the impact of purchase accounting and interest segment profit eliminations are presented separately.","During the quarter, Forestar sold a portion of its assets for $232 million. This strategic asset sale included projects owned both directly and indirectly through joint ventures and consisted of approximately 750 developed and under development lots, 4,000 undeveloped lots, 730 unentitled acres, a multi-family development site, and an interest in one multi-family property.","This sale provided capital for future growth while also streamlining Forestar's operations. Both D.R. Horton and Forestar continue to identify land development opportunities to expand Forestar's platform. Since the acquisition closed in October, Forestar has been evaluating 38 opportunities primarily sourced by D.R. Horton and Forestar had closed on 21 of those opportunities as of March 31.","All of the projects are located in high-demand markets that D.R. Horton currently serves. These 38 communities are expected to yield approximately 15,000 finished lots, the majority of which may be sold to D.R. Horton in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies.","Jessica?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Looking forward, we continue to expect Forestar to invest approximately $400 million in land acquisition and development this year, and to obtain a bank credit facility by the end of this fiscal year to help fund its working capital needs. In fiscal 2018 we also expect Forestar to deliver approximately 1200 lots and generate $90 million in revenue. In fiscal 2019 we expect Forestar to deliver approximately 4,000 lots, generate $300 million to $350 million in revenue, and access the public markets for additional growth capital as conditions permit. In fiscal 2020 we expect Forestar to deliver approximately 10,000 lots and generate $700 million to $800 million in revenue.","Over the next three years we anticipate Forestar's stabilized pre-tax operating margins will be in the range of 10% to 12%, and Forestar is targeting a net debt to capital ratio of 40%. The expectations I just outlined are for Forestar's standalone results.","Due to the impact of inter-segment profit eliminations we do not expect Forestar to have a material impact on D.R. Horton's fiscal 2018 earnings.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","At March 31, our homebuilding liquidity included $529 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage ratio improved 380 basis points from a year ago to 24.2%. The balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion, and we have $500 million of senior note maturities in the next 12 months.","During the first six months of fiscal 2018, our homebuilding segment generated $90.7 million of operating cash flows and our consolidated cash used in operations was $98.8 billion. Excluding Forestar, we generated $59.5 million of cash from operations for the current year six month period. During the quarter we paid cash dividends of $47.1 million and we repurchased 500,000 shares of our common stock for $22.5 million. Our remaining stock repurchase authorization at March 31, 2018 was $152.1 million. At March 31 our stockholders equity was $8.2 billion and book value per share was $21.72, up 13% from a year ago.","David?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet's strength, liquidity, earnings growth and cash flow generation are increasing our flexibility, and we plan to utilize our strong position to enhance the long-term value of the company. Our top cash flow priorities are to consolidate market share by investing in our homebuilding business and strategic acquisitions, reduce or maintain debt levels and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.","After increasing our guidance for pre-tax profit margin in our press release this morning, excluding Forestar, we now expect to generate at least $800 million of cash from operations in 2018 growing to over $1.25 billion annually in 2020.","Jessica?","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Looking forward, and as outlined in our press release this morning, we are updating our expectations for 2018 based on current market conditions and our results for the first half of the year. We now expect to generate a consolidated pre-tax margin of 12.1% to 12.3%. We expect consolidated revenues of between $15.9 billion and $16.3 billion, and to close between 51,500 and 52,500 homes.","We anticipate our home sales gross margin for fiscal 2018 will be in the range of 20.5% to 21% with the potential for quarterly fluctuations outside of this range. We estimate our annual homebuilding SG&A expense will be around 8.7%. We expect our financial services operating margin for the year to be around 30%. We are now forecasting a fiscal 2018 income tax rate of approximately 25%, excluding the one-time deferred tax asset charge we took in the first quarter, and we expect our outstanding share count to increase by less than 1% in fiscal 2018.","And as David just mentioned, we now expect to generate at least $800 million of positive cash flow from operations in fiscal 2018, excluding Forestar.","For the third quarter of 2018 we expect our number of homes closed will approximate a beginning backlog conversion rate in the range of 87% to 89%. We anticipate our third quarter home sales gross margin will be in the range of 20.5% to 21%, and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the third quarter to be in the range of 8.2% to 8.3% of homebuilding revenues. We expect our income tax rate in both the third and fourth quarters to be between 25% and 26%. Over the longer term and as we generate increased cash flows, we expect to pay down debt and decrease our leverage, increase our dividend, and repurchase shares to offset dilution with the target to keep our outstanding share count flat by 2020.","David?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","To conclude and reiterate, our growth in sales, closings, profits, returns and cash flow is a result of the strength of our long-tenured people and well-established operating platforms across the country. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to continue to expand our industry-leading market share. We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while increasing our annual operating cash flows and improving returns in our business and to our shareholders. We are well-positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our D.R. Horton, Emerald, Express, and Freedom brands, attractive finished lot and land positions, and most importantly our outstanding team across the country.","We thank the entire D.R. Horton team for their continued focus and hard work. We look forward to growing and improving our operations during our 40th anniversary year, while preparing for great opportunities in the years to come.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. Our first question is coming from John Lovallo of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. First question is Forestar's stock has held up really well, particularly relative to the group. And frankly, most of the investors that we speak with are aware and really very much on board with the asset-light thesis and the strategy to issue equity to not only fund the business, but dilute your stake down. I guess the question is why not do this sooner than later.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","John, thank you for the question. I think what we're focused on at Forestar first and foremost is building a great operational platform. When we bought the company in October, just about a little over six months ago, they had not really been focused on driving a community development business in the way we need it built. And so first things first is realigning the team and the people that are in place there, building the interactions between D.R. Horton and Forestar, and building a strong operating platform. We think that, building for the long term, will help any capital raises when we go to the markets next year.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And, John, fortunately, they started with a lot of cash. And so they had $400 million of cash at the date of the transaction, so from the standpoint of need for capital to fund that growth, it wasn't an immediate need. They were also able to generate cash by selling some of their legacy portfolio as well. And so we believe that focusing on operations, putting them in place to support us for the long term, which is really what will drive long-term value, is most important. And certainly then, capital raises, both equity and debt down the line from Forestar, will be an important part of their strategy, but it was not necessary here in this first year.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That makes sense, okay. And then clearly, there's a lot of concern in the market about interest rates and about construction costs. Your orders and margins should help ease some of those concerns there. But are you guys seeing in the field any caution from potential buyers on rates? And maybe if you could, just update us on what your stick-and-brick costs are running year over year, please.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We're actually seeing more buyers come in and better qualified buyers today. As I indicated in the prepared remarks, our FICO score this quarter was 722, which is the highest it's been in several years, and that's with Express continuing to become a bigger piece of our business. So we're really not seeing rates have any noticeable impact on demand. And for us, it's all about jobs and affordability. So as long as those two things are good, we don't expect an impact on demand even if rates do continue to rise gradually as we move throughout the year, which I think is our expectation today.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","The question about costs, John, our stick-and-brick cost per square foot was up low single digits. Our lot cost per square foot was up mid-single digit, and then clearly our revenue per square foot was enough to offset that, so the steady and improving year-over-year margin.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","So really more of the same in terms of revenues outpacing stick-and-brick costs. Our guys have done a phenomenal job controlling cost increases in a rising cost environment, and we've been able to offset it with price.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And, John, it's David. I would say the optimism that's out there in the market today, the slight increase in rates that we've seen are really fueling demand. And if rates just continue to move slowly, I see a long, sustained housing market.","John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Very encouraging, guys. Thanks for the time.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Just following on Forestar a little bit, Mike, maybe you could give us an update on the buildout for Forestar, what you all are doing, so eventually this becomes the standalone operation other than Horton sourcing everything. And when would you expect to start to see that occur, where they are sourcing more than what Horton is bringing to the table?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Where they are sourcing more than what Horton's bringing to the table, that will be probably at some point down the road. One of the things we talked about last summer when we were working on this and explaining our strategy was that we have hundreds of people across the country today that are out. Their whole focus is to identify new land and community opportunities, And Forestar still has I think 35 to 40 people on the team. And while there have been some new folks added, and I think we will continue to see a team built out over the next 12 to 18 to 24 months, it's going to be a bit of time before they're able to source as many deals as we're able to source and provide opportunities for them to evaluate.","So I don't see that in the near term. In the medium to long term, certainly that is a key goal for them to be able to be sustainable and independent of us in terms of their own lot supply and pipeline.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","This is David. We had the Forestar guys up yesterday, day before, just going over operational plans. And I think their primary focus, their internal goals, are to create independence from Horton. And they are looking at deals today that will be sourced directly by them, but they've got to have people.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","The thing that makes us different is people, and they got to do that.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I think in the past 90 days they've closed on two deals that were independently sourced. One had been in their process for quite a while. One was a more recent opportunity that presented itself they were able to take advantage of. So they are out, they are actively working it. It's just in this business it's a very large funnel where you start with the lot and you work it down over a period of time to get there. So the larger your starting number is, the more likely you're going to be able to close some of that.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And an important part of putting them in position to be able to do that down the line is expanding their platform across the Horton footprint, leveraging the Horton structure today to give them a presence in more markets than they're in today, and then that will then put them in position to source more land independently down the line. But fortunately, we've got the opportunity for them to show tremendous growth just to grow their operations by leveraging Horton in the short term.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, and one follow-up on that. Would that mean would rollups play a significant part in that? And then my other question just revolves around cash flow. As you look out, when would you start seeing your cash flow get better because of Forestar's activities? I didn't really hear any commentary about actively looking on the M&A side. Is that going to play into it also?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","So on the rollup opportunities within Forestar, that is something that certainly we'll be evaluating as they're looking to build the team. And with that \u2013 like on the builder side, we'll be very opportunistic. We continue to look at various M&A opportunities on the builder side, opportunistically where it makes sense to add people to the team, potentially new products and new markets.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And our D.R. Horton cash flow guidance already includes what we expect as a result of Forestar and moving to 60% options here over the next few years and growing that cash flow number to over $1.25 billion annually by 2020.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alan Ratner of Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","So a question on price point. Obviously, you guys have been an early mover at the entry level. We heard another builder yesterday who's more of a move-up builder just actually mention the fact that they're seeing less competition now as other builders have kind of moved into your space on the entry level side. And I remember last quarter; I think it was, you actually highlighted at some point maybe an opportunity might present itself to get more active at move-ups. So was curious if you could just talk a little bit about the dynamics you're seeing across your portfolio? Do you still feel like entry level is a space that has a lot of runway to go based on the new entrants into that arena? And are you starting to see more opportunities unfold in move-up given I guess some builders leaving that space?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Well, we haven't really seen anybody leave that space. But I can tell you the entry level demographics and really the delay in what used to be the 25s buying houses to 35s, that group of people is, there's more demand than is currently being serviced. So we're focused on returns. The entry level is driving the best returns. I think as time moves, we will see that shift up the price curve. But right now today, it's awfully good in that $250,000 to $300,000 range.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Got it, great. Okay, good to hear. And then second question, if I look at your order growth, it was remarkably consistent across the regions, but just curious if you could talk a little bit about which markets you're seeing maybe the strongest pricing power relative to cost inflation and where you're seeing the best opportunity to drive growth going forward?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Texas, Florida continue be very, very strong markets. Arizona has come on incredibly strong for us over the last couple of years. There's a lot of stability in California at the price points we're selling. Northwest continues to be very, very strong and we're getting a little better in the Northeast. So we like to see that consistency. That's something we strive for, and really pretty proud of what our people are doing out there.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And then you see our supplemental data here in a little while, Alan. After the call, you'll see that really, our absorptions were up strongly across the board in all of our regions.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Any markets that jump out on the other side where maybe pricing's seeing a bit of a wall or absorption growth is a little more challenging?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I got to tell you, we're not seeing that right now, even what has been our weaker markets have stabilized, and we're seeing, if not significant absorption gains, we're seeing margin moving up a little bit. So the market is very good right now. There're a lot of people out there that don't own a house that want to figure out how to get in one, and they feel good enough to take the risk, to sign a mortgage and close. So job growth is strong. Consumer optimism is way up. Consumer confidence is way up; a lot of good things happening in the country right now.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Great. Good to hear. Good luck, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Carl Reichardt of BTIG. Please go ahead.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about...","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning, Carl.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","Good morning. I wanted to ask about flight count, which I think was flat or a little bit down. When do you expect that you might see a \u2013 sort of a reacceleration in the growth in number of communities year on year, especially given that the lot count is kind of building now behind the store count?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Carl, we do still expect to see growth over time in our community count. We've seen periods where we're slightly up. This quarter we were down 1% year-over-year. Over the medium to longer term, we expect to see modest growth there. Predicting exactly when that inflection point hits by quarter is a little bit difficult for us, but we've been seeing continued improving absorptions as we continue to improve our execution, and how we're meeting the markets across our markets. And that's been able to drive steady double-digit growth now for several years with very modest community count growth. But we do expect that to inflect, but predicting exactly when, it's a little bit hard.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","Okay. Thanks, Bill. And then wanted to ask about co-broke costs, I know for a long time, you've looked at buyers brokers as a really important set of partners for you, and you've worked with them closely over a long period of time. How are you thinking about those relationships on sort of a longer-term basis? Are those kinds of costs that you have to payout something that you could work to lower over time? I'm just kind of interested in how you think about that sort of strategically and tactically? Thanks.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Strategically, we think of them as partners, and we're going to continue to work with that community at a level that really is unique in the industry. Now, over time, will their economics change? Will they have to become more efficient and more competitive? Yes, but at least in my mind, they're going to be \u2013 the resale market is so much bigger than the new home market, and whether it's online, whether it's some other type, that inter-reaction with people at point of sale I think is still going to be a part of how you get a transaction closed. So we love realtors. We're going to continue to support realtors. And to me, they're as big a part of the cost of the house, as a necessary part of the house as concrete and lumber, because they drive the industry.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and nice results.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you, Mike.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question, I wanted to go back to the shift to lot optioning and obviously, you've had a lot of success there. And with the most recent \u2013 this most recent quarter at 52%, you continue to make a very consistent, solid move towards that 60%. If you extrapolate 2% a quarter and not that one quarter is indicative of a trend, it could suggest that maybe you're going to get to that 60% not in a couple of years, but perhaps on a shorter timeframe. I was curious if that's a possibility to get to a 60% type of mark over the next 12 to 18 months instead of the next two to three years, and what might impact \u2013 and what impact that might have from a return perspective, return on equity, return on capital.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Michael, that has been a consistent driver of our improving returns on our investments. And as we look from where we were six months ago, we've picked up 2% in that mix. And so we're going to continue to push that business, so that we're buying more lots on an option basis, and engaging with developers, and looking for ways to work with them on an optioning basis.","I don't know that we won't get there in 18 months, but it might also take us 30 months to get there. It's a little bit of a snapshot point in time as the quarter ends that we're measuring that, and land and lots are purchased and contracted on a dynamic basis throughout the year. So we're consistently looking to move that metric up and consistently looking to improve our returns. It's a big part of our regional presidents', division presidents' compensation plan is to be focused on returns. So they are the ones that make this happen, and they do it deal by deal and market by market.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Our goal is not only consistency, but sustainability. And we've talked in the past about achieving something, if you can't grow it and maintain it, really is kind of a false achievement. So everything we're doing is set up to execute quarter to quarter a little better and sustain it off down the road into the future. Quarter to quarter, 52%, 53%, 54%, that's really not in our minds or anything that we spent a lot of time thinking about.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. I appreciate that. I understand. Second question, I just wanted to focus a little bit on the margin side, and kind of a two-part here. You were able to raise your gross margin guidance for the year, and I was just thinking about over the next year or two, is this 20.5% to 21% a range that you see as sustainable or do you see a little bit of possible upside to that as you continue to lever some of the fixed costs or get some more efficiencies? Conversely on the SG&A, just any thoughts around the fact that you reiterated the full year SG&A guidance ratio despite raising the revenues, typically, you'd see a little bit of leverage \u2013 incremental leverage if you were to raise revenues all else equal. And how do you think about SG&A over the next two or three years?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Michael, I'll kind of start at the bottom line and then we'll go ahead and go back to the pieces. We're first and foremost focused on improving our returns, and there's a lot of levers that allow us to achieve that. Certainly, as we've already touched on managing our inventory investments on our options is part of that. But we're very focused on improving our P&L metrics there as well to drive continued and improving returns. We're certainly seeing a good, healthy housing market, which is allowing us to see good stability and some lift in our margins, which has driven the adjustments in our guide on margin as well. And then with our volume, we're getting good leverage on SG&A as well. And we would expect to, we continue to do that, to work to improve that line item as well, all with the driver of improving our returns.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","As we've been working to improve returns, velocity of capital absorption pace within a given community is critical to achieving the returns. And so we're very pleased that executing on that strategy, maintaining the disciplined absorption and starts plans that we have in place community by community, we're able to see improving margins in today's environment.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I guess just being a little more specific though on SG&A, was there any type of reason why you weren't able to get a little bit more leverage off of a higher revenue base, all else equal? I mean the question is more evolved around are we kind of reaching a point where SG&A is at a natural level or is there incremental leverage there?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yes, we're certainly pleased with where we are year to date on our SG&A. Our annual guidance from a revenue standpoint, we have increased the bottom end of our revenue range. Our top end of the revenue range is still in place. And so from an annual standpoint, we felt like our annual guidance was still realistic and reasonable relative to that annual revenue guide. But certainly, we're focused on achieving that and hopefully beating it. But at this point in time, we feel like the annual guidance was still at a reasonable level.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Soham Bhonsle on for Jack this morning. So just getting back to rates and the impact on your buyers, the concern is obviously around sensitivity to rates, given your entry-level mix is higher there. But can you maybe speak to some of the tools that you guys have under your belt to offset some of that pressure for that buyer going forward? We've heard of point buydowns in some cases and longer rate locks.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We're not seeing those kind of products with any kind of widespread use right now. As Jessica mentioned before, we're seeing an increasing pool of better qualified buyers, even with our larger exposure to the entry level in Express. Our mortgage company FICO score is the highest it's been in years this last quarter on current originations. And while interest rates are going up, I do think they're going up for the reasons we hoped is that it would strengthen the economy and we're seeing people with more jobs and better incomes, which are two of the primary drivers for household formations and home purchase decisions.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And what we would typically see first as buyers become more challenged if rates do continue to rise to a level that impacts affordability to any large extent is just a shift down in size of the home they're going to buy. So we have multiple floor plans in our communities. And right now, our average square footage in an Express community may be 2,000 square feet, but we've got a 1,500 or 1,600 square foot plan available that we're just not selling as many of. And as rates rise and affordability becomes more of a challenge, people still need to buy homes. They may just buy a little less home rather than the larger home. We're not seeing that today, as Mike indicated, but that would typically be the first shift, and we can flex very quickly to do that.","Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Right, that's helpful. And then switching to Forestar, as I look at the SG&A expense line, it's down 40% sequentially. So was that you guys just right-sizing the business this quarter? And when do you expect to get to that normalized 10% to 12% pre-tax margin by?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","The first quarter for them, the prior quarter included a lot of their transaction costs, so they had a lot of unusual costs associated with the transaction, both deal costs associated with it as well as change-of-control type payments to employees. So this quarter is closer to a normalized SG&A rate for them. We would expect over time for their SG&A to need to grow, obviously, as they build out their platform. And then as they get to a normalized pace where they're delivering really the new profile of deals, the faster turning deals that they'll be delivering to D.R. Horton in 2019 and really by 2020, then that pre-tax operating margin of 10% to 12% would be our expectation at the current time.","Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay, so you expect it by next year at some point.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I think they'll be in that ballpark. They're still working through legacy assets, some of which are higher margin but lower turn. Newer assets will be a faster turn. And so I'd say by late 2019 and into 2020, you should start to see their profile get closer to that stabilized level that we described.","Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great, thank you.","Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thanks, Soham.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Zener of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning, Ken.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I'd like you to comment on units under construction to improve investors' understanding of your business. With closings at 100% of backlog, I think that's less insightful than closings 44% of prior quarter's units under construction. So my one question has three parts. Please explain why you carry a spec unit for each unit in backlog, how you locally manage your construction cycles without a top-down infrastructure. And then, how does this help your asset velocity and lower your land risk, which is at 2.5-years supply? Thank you. That's it.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","The first part of the question, why do we carry specs and what ratio is appropriate, we've managed the spec levels community by community, looking at construction cycle times, looking at sales demand in that submarket, and what the planned absorption is for that community. And we will start a number of homes that are unsold to meet the expected delivery demand that we're going to see. And our operating process is start the home and sell into that production cycle. But that's at a community-by-community level, and we will adjust those starts and that inventory level up or down depending upon market reaction and how our sales efforts are going.","I'm not exactly sure what the second part of your question was about managing the construction cycle, essentially top-down because we certainly know that is a very local submarket by submarket with the teams in place that know their market the best, know their trades the best, what the trades are capable of doing, and how to maximize the efficiency with those trades to get the best labor pricing.","On a national basis, what we're able to do on the pricing side is work with a lot of our national trade partners on leveraging our scale and purchasing power to keep our input costs as low as possible.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And then, you mentioned the asset velocity. And really what our local operators are doing when they're managing this community by community, when they open a community, they have a planned business plan and that is designed to strike the best balance between pace and price margin to generate the best return. And so they are executing to that plan and clearly asset turn, asset velocity, monthly absorption is an important part of that. And then, that's what they guide their business to. If they just start a little hot, and they sell a little bit more, they're more likely to moderate their pace to hit their absorption pace and push price and margin. If they're starting a little slow, they will push the absorption to make sure they stick to their absorption plan and make sure they do that to optimize their returns. So it's really governed by optimizing that balance to generate the best returns community by community.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And driving a return off of the land or lot investment does de-risk that land or lot investment, because we're going to move through that capital in the timeframe that we expected to at the outset of the project. Thereby, we pull that capital back into the company and we're able to re-deploy into current market.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And so the spec strategy is a key part of that in order to turn the land inventory and to keep that consistent pace going, having that inventory of specs in place to anticipate what we want to sell. What our absorption plans are for each month in that community is a vital part of it.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And having an adequate supply of specs in every committee makes this a viable alternative to the existing home sales that are out there, which as David mentioned before is a much larger market than the new home sales.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jay McCanless of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one I have, by my count, Horton is the fourth builder this week to raise their full year gross margin targets. Can you talk about what's changed versus the last conference call, and maybe what you guys in the industry are seeing that gives you more confidence on that line item?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Jay, I would say three more months through the spring is really \u2013 we're seeing that the environment is good. We're seeing that we're hitting our absorption pace. We're seeing that we continue to have the ability to offset our cost with price community by community has given us that confidence level, and so we're pleased to be able to do that. And what we see today is continued stability, continued healthy market that we think the latter half of the year should support that higher guidance.","Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's great. And then, I also wanted to touch on you guys with Freedom, you were one of the first movers on this empty-nester trend that seems to be gaining steam. Are you guys tracking anything in the field for your other product lines in terms of how many more empty-nesters or 55-plus buyers are coming in maybe versus this time last year or a couple of years ago?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Not really. I wouldn't say we're tracking. As we establish our Freedom flags in the markets, we're seeing better and better success. The Express communities have absorbed a lot of that 55 years, I call them blue-collar retiree, because it's just a lower-cost lifestyle. I mean that's a \u2013 that's a \u2013 from a demographic standpoint, it's a huge trend, and it also dovetails into the migration from high tax states to low tax states. So we believe it's not a long-term trend that we're going to see a lot of demand for the foreseeable future.","Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great, what are the long-term targets? Or how many Freedom flags you want out there?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We're in 78 markets, some markets significantly bigger than others, but our goal is to get them rolled out, kind of like our Express program to a level in each market that the market will absorb. So it's going to be a big part of our growth over the next 5 to 7 years.","Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Stephen Kim - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah. Thanks very much, guys. And again, congratulations on the good results.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you, Stephen.","Stephen Kim - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah. My first question actually relates to production efficiencies. Obviously you guys with the rollout of Express way before the competition, really got a jump on that, and it's been a huge part of the success of the company over the last few years. I was curious about what you thought about the opportunity to maybe take the next step in terms of productivity with the use of or the partnering with companies that do panelization or factory construction for the sake of simplicity, I'll call them E-builders. And so my question is basically two parts. One, what percent of the homes that you build today are using some extensive use of panelization, and is this an area that you're really focused on?","And two, do you think the productivity gains that you might get will continue to be through low-tech strategies? Or do you think the integration of things like robotics or BIM [Building Information Modeling] modeling, logistics software et cetera, along with factory production holds real promise?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","So first question, we do use panelization in various markets, and its market-by-market where those capabilities exist in the market, and can provide a timely and cost-effective solution for our local building operations. We are very happy using panelization, and we look to expand that and work with a trust plant in a given market to expand to see if they are capable of moving to the next step in panelization. So we do that. I don't have a percentage for you of what the breakdown is across the country, but it is something that we do monitor, measure, and continually challenge our existing assumptions about what the most efficient way is to deliver a home to a customer.","In terms of the higher tech, I would say broadly, yes, Stephen, I think there will be production efficiencies to be gained in our industry through this. Do I know which one it is yet? No I don't. But we are evaluating those and we are watching those, and we're very interested in paying attention to what's happening there. I think there's some really interesting things happening, and we're excited to play a part in that.","Stephen Kim - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah, that makes sense. I just want to follow-up on that if I could, Michael. You mentioned that it depends \u2013 your use depends a little bit on if the local market can support your use of that. And I was curious if you -- that seems to suggest there may be some sort of a bottleneck in certain markets. And I was curious if that supply issue or bottleneck had to do with an availability of capital? And if that's so, if you would be interested in partnering with some of these kind of initiatives to sort of get them jump-started to get to the kind of scale where they could actually support somebody of your size?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Again, it is going to vary very much market by markets. Where there are markets, where there are very efficient labor sources that are able to stick frame a home and construct a home in the traditional fashion. It's a difficult barrier to overcome, the cost efficiencies, it takes to bring panelization in place. Other markets that are higher labor cost markets, we've seen more rapid adoption of panelization.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I will say, Stephen, affordability in housing is just going to become more and more difficult to maintain, and even at our Express level, there are still a significant amount of the population that's priced out of homeownership. So we have got to get better, and I think technology and different ways of thinking about constructing houses is going to be how that takes place. Because I don't see labor going down, and I don't see materials going down, and land, certainly, is not going to go down, so how you build a house, to me, everybody at some point in their life ought to be able to own a house. And that's just not the case today in the United States, and it's certainly not the case in the world. So that's something we think about a lot.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Over time, this industry and this company will put that puzzle together of marrying the technology, marrying the new techniques with the unique attributes of how you build out a community. Every piece of real estate is different, every local market is different, but marrying those things market by market will happen and will happen for this industry and for this company.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","It was a very important thing to me when I was able to buy my first house. And I can tell you, I think that helped me become the success \u2013 whatever success I've achieved I think that was a part of it, so everybody ought to get to experience that.","Stephen Kim - Evercore Group LLC","That's great. I really appreciate it, and I wish I had bought the same house you did. I'm going to find out which house that is.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Don't be confused, and I lost money on my house, with a 13.5% interest rate and my payment was ridiculously high for a guy starting out, so.","Stephen Kim - Evercore Group LLC","All right. Well, thanks very much, guys. Appreciate it.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you, Steve. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. So I just wanted to ask about your updated thoughts on share repurchases. Obviously, the cash flow outlook is very strong, obviously, rates and the guidance for this year. And, obviously, Forestar is on track to be more self-sufficient next year. You maintained your intention to just buy back to the extent to offset dilution. Any updated thoughts on going beyond that?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Over the longer term, Nishu, yes, so we would expect that we would do that. But for the short run, we are getting established with being a consistent repurchase for our shares each quarter. As you know, we have not historically done that on a consistent basis, so we are in the early stages of beginning a long-term share repurchase program. And so right now we're starting at a level that we're comfortable with within our cash flow.","Obviously, our cash flow is used for a number of purposes this year. We had a major acquisition early in the year. We continue to pay a dividend at a healthy rate as well. And so we're beginning the share repurchase at a modest level, but we would expect it would increase over time. First step is to offset dilution here by 2020. And then, as our share \u2013 as our cash flow grows, as our business grows, we would expect that to grow \u2013 to continue to grow over time as well.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Again, to us, it's about consistent and sustainable over a long period of time. The flash buys, in my experience, don't do much for shareholders long term.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And what do you need to see specifically to feel that \u2013 to conclude, basically, that you've been successful in creating a consistent cash-flow-generating machine? I mean, you're going to be over $800 million this year. And at this stage of the cycle when the market is going well, that's a very strong number. And I think you've maintained the $1.25 billion target for 2019, or even mentioned it. I would love to know if your real thoughts on that are different.","So coming out of $1.20 billion, you will have been three years averaging about $1 billion a year. At that stage, do you say, yeah, we've been successful in our goals and maybe we can consider a sustainable program? What exactly are you going to use to judge that kind of metric or number wise?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Well, it's going to be on balance with all aspects of our business. What we see overall in our business, what we see in our opportunities to continue to invest in growing our business, what we see on the M&A front, as well is then what we just see in terms of our outlook on the market. So what I would say is we do believe that we have been very successful at building a cash-flow-generating machine.","We've generated positive cash flow for three straight years. This will be the fourth year, and it gave us the confidence to begin the share repurchase program. And so now we will just build on that quarter by quarter, year by year. And as we continue to make progress quarter by quarter, then I would expect the share repurchase to increase alongside it.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got you. Got you. And...","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We're going to stay opportunistic, too. I mean, the investment we made in Forestar we think is going to be significantly better for our shareholders than increasing our stock buyback by $500 million this year. So it's \u2013 we're out there looking at the market, and making what we believe are the best long-term decisions for our shareholders.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Got it. And on Forestar, the 10,000-lot delivery goal, I think that was the third year out, so \u2013 for fiscal 2020. As you've been developing the pipeline, any kind of updated thinking on what percentage of those might be delivered to D.R. Horton? And what percentage might be external? How D.R. Horton linked will \u2013 do you expect Forestar to be at that stage, especially now that you have some clarity with 38 deals having been vetted so far?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","The first couple of years here, 2018, 2019, 2020, it's going to be very \u2013 more heavily weighted towards Horton than it will be over the longer term. Over the longer term, as David mentioned earlier, we met with the Forestar team this week and they would expect to deliver to other builders over the longer term 20% to 30% of their deliveries to other builders. It's going to take them a bit of time to develop their sourcing capabilities, but they do have existing relationships with other builders today, and are delivering lots to other builders today. But their sourcing capabilities are going to be largely driven by Horton here in the short run. But 20% to 30% would be a good range for the long term for other builders.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you, Donna. We appreciate everyone's time on the call and look forward to speaking with you again in July to share our third quarter results. And to the D.R. Horton team, another spectacular quarter, it's \u2013 it's \u2013 makes us proud to sit up here and be able to represent you.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Please go ahead.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Before we get started, today's call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R.

After the conclusion of the call, we will post updated supplementary historical data to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News & Events for your reference. The supplementary information includes historical data on our homebuilding return on inventory, gross margins, changes in active selling communities, product mix and our mortgage operations.","Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","The spring selling season at D.R. Horton is in full swing and our team delivered a set \u2013 a strong second quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased to $301 million on $2.8 billion of revenue, and our pre-tax profit margin improved 130 basis points to 10.9%. Our homes sold increased 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by improving absorptions. These results continue to reflect the consistent solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to continue to expand our industry-leading market share.","We plan to maintain broad product diversity with our three brands over the long-term. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pre-tax profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing returns. During the six months ended March, we generated $27 million of cash from operations, on track to meet our target of $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flows for the year.","Our return on inventory defined as homebuilding pre-tax income divided by average inventory, improved to 13.8% for the 12 months, up from 10.7% a year ago. With a sales backlog of 13,695 homes at the end of March and a well-stocked supply of land, lots, and homes, we are well-positioned for the remainder of 2016. Mike?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Net income for the second quarter increased 32% to $195 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to $148 million, or $0.40 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 31% to $301 million in the second quarter, compared to $230 million in the year-ago quarter. And homebuilding pre-tax income increased 36% to $283 million, compared to $209 million in the prior year quarter.","Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 16% to $2.7 billion on 9,262 homes closed, up from $2.3 billion on 8,243 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $290,000, up 3% compared to the prior year and flat sequentially from our first quarter.","This quarter, entry-level homes marketed under our Express Homes brand accounted for 23% of homes closed and 16% of home sales revenue. Our homes for higher-end, move-up and luxury buyers priced greater than $500,000 accounted for 7% of our homes closed and 17% of our home sales revenue. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The value of our net sales orders in the second quarter increased 13% from the year-ago quarter to $3.6 billion, and home sold increased 10% to 12,292 homes on a relatively flat active selling community count.","Our average sales price on net sales orders in the second quarter was $290,900. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 19%, consistent with the year-ago quarter. The value of our backlog increased 14% from a year ago to $4.1 billion, with an average sales price per home of $296,700 and homes in backlog increased 12% to 13,695 homes.","Mike?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the second quarter was 19.9%, consistent with the first quarter and up 20 basis points from the second quarter of last year. The consistency in our gross margin reflects a stability of most of our markets today. We are raising prices or reducing incentives when possible in communities where we are achieving our targeted absorptions. And we're also working to control cost increases.","Our general gross margin expectations remain unchanged. In the current housing market, we continue to expect our average home sales gross margin to generally be around 20%, with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix, and the relative impact of warranty and interest costs. As a reminder, our reported gross margins include all of our interest costs.","David?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","In the second quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense was $258 million, compared to $242 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of homebuilding revenue, SG&A improved 80 basis points to 9.6%, compared to 10.4% in the prior year quarter, as our revenue increase improved our leverage of fixed overhead cost.","We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our current and expected growth.","Jessica?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Financial Services pre-tax income in the second quarter was $17.4 million, compared to $21.5 million in the year-ago quarter. 94% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 53% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 48% of the mortgage company's volume compared to 45% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company this quarter had an average FICO score of 717 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%.","First-time homebuyers represented 45% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, compared to 43% in the second quarter last year. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","At the end of March, we had 24,600 homes in inventory, of which 1,600 were models. 11,700 of our total homes were spec homes, with 8,400 in various stages of construction and 3,300 completed. Our construction in progress and finished homes inventory increased by $361 million during the quarter due to seasonal construction activity for the spring selling season.","Our second-quarter investments in lots, land and development totaled $500 million, of which $271 million was to replenish finished lots and land, and $229 million was for land development. We expect our investments in land and development to increase in the third and fourth quarters compared to the second quarter this year. David?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","At March 31, 2016, our land and lot portfolio consisted of 189,000 lots, of which 112,000 are owned and 77,000 are controlled through option contracts. 69,000 of our total lots are finished, of which 31,000 are owned and 38,000 are optioned. Our 189,000 total lots owned and controlled provide us a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market, with a sufficient lot supply to support solid growth in sales and closings in future periods.","Although our housing inventories will fluctuate as we manage each of our communities to optimize returns, we expect our land and lot inventories to remain relatively stable in 2016. We also expect to generate positive cash flows from operations for the second consecutive year through increased profitability and disciplined inventory management. During the six months ended March, we generated $27 million of operating cash, an improvement of $196 million, compared to the same period last year.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","During the second quarter, we recorded $2.8 million in land option charges for write-offs of earnest money deposits and due diligence costs for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded a $3.2 million inventory impairment charge in our East region related to a long-held, inactive land parcel that we sold during the quarter. We will continue to evaluate our inventories for potential impairment which may result in future charges, but the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate.","Our inactive land held for development of $194 million at the end of the quarter represents 10,100 lots, down 22% from a year ago. We continue to work through each of our remaining inactive land parcels to improve cash flows and returns, and we expect that our land held for development will continue to decline.","Mike?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","At March 31, our homebuilding liquidity included $1.2 billion unrestricted homebuilding cash and $884 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our gross homebuilding leverage ratio improved 580 basis points from a year ago to 33.6%.","The balance of our public notes outstanding at March 31 was $3.2 million. On April 15, we repaid $373 million of senior notes at their maturity and we have no debt maturities in the next 12 months. At March 31, our shareholders' equity was $6.2 billion and book value per share was $16.85, up 14% from a year ago.","Jessica?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","We are updating our expectations for our fiscal 2016 profitability based on current housing market conditions and our financial performance to date this year. As we noted in our press release this morning, we're increasing our annual guidance for consolidated pre-tax profit margin by 20 basis points to a range of 10.7% to 11.2% for fiscal 2016. We are also updating our annual guidance for homebuilding SG&A to a range of 9% to 9.2% of homebuilding revenues from the previous range of 9.2% to 9.4%.","Also as outlined in our press release this morning, we are reaffirming our previously issued guidance for fiscal 2016 as follows: Consolidated revenues of between $12 billion and $12.5 billion, homes closed between 39,500 and 41,500 homes, our home sales gross margin for the full year of 2016 in the high 19% to 20%, and annual Financial Services pre-tax profit margin of 30% to 33%, and income tax rate for the full year of between 35% and 36%, and annual diluted share count of approximately 375 million shares and $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flow from operations for fiscal 2016.","Specifically, for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect our number of homes closed will approximate a beginning backlog conversion rate in a range of 76% to 80%. We anticipate our third quarter home sales gross margin will be in a high 19% to 20% consistent with the first half of the year, and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the third quarter to be in a range of 8.9% to 9.1% of homebuilding revenues. David?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","In closing, our second quarter growth in sales, closings and profits and the improvement in our pre-tax profit margin are the result of the strength of our people and our operating platform. We remain excited and are looking forward to the opportunities ahead.","We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while continuing to generate positive cash flows and improve returns. We are well-positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our D.R. Horton, Emerald and Express brands; attractive finished lot and land position; and most importantly, our tremendous team across the country.","We would like to thank our entire D.R. Horton team for their continued hard work, and we look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operation. Let's keep the momentum going week-by-week, flag-by-flag throughout this year.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now hold questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today is coming from Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Przybylski - Evercore ISI","Thank you. This is actually Paul Przybylski on for Stephen. I'm impressed with the first half cash flow generation given that's typically a period of heavy spend. What's the sustainability of that going out? I know you're looking for the $300 million to $500 million for the year. But should we expect first half cash generation in out-years?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. That's hard to say in future years, Paul. For this year, we are on track based on our current plans for fiscal 2016 to generate $300 million to $500 million for the full year. We would not be surprised that in Q3, we used cash because we are building out our backlog, building out our homes and construction. And as we stated, we do expect our land and lot investments to be higher in Q3 and Q4 than it was this quarter, but we are on track of $300 million to $500 million. And then our expectations for future year is our business model is designed to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations while growing at a double-digit pace and exactly what level that might be in each year will determine as we get better visibility into the year.","Paul Przybylski - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then for follow-up, I've heard rumblings that you're looking at expanding not so much to Express name, but the Express business model to higher price points, basically, everything is included. Do you have any color on that?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're learning a lot with the Express rollout that efficiency and value is a big time driver in sales, and yes, I mean as we create operational efficiencies in Express to translate into the D.R. Horton. We are moving that way. Now, we will always be a locally controlled business. I mean, we're decentralized. Our operators in the field will respond to the market. And if it is a value-based market, they're going to have to drive more efficient homes. If it is a custom-based price point, then we're going to continue to modify our plans and introduce plans at the local level.","Paul Przybylski - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I wonder not to get too specific in particular markets, but it's useful to the Express Home where I think you guys have opened up five or six new Express communities. Can you talk about the kind of trends you're seeing in Denver as the existing home sales tighten up there, either due to lack of supply? I mean, you guys seem to be growing whereas others are not seeing that type of acceleration. Could you kind of give us a little market dynamic on how that product and that market is working?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","I think we opened up Express in Denver over the past year. The team up there has done a great job getting that online. And it shows that there is a real need for affordable housing in that market, and we're delivering a value product to the market. And it's just being absorbed, and people are very happy with it. We're very happy we can do it and looking forward to try to do more of it.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Ken, it's not consistent with what we've seen in other markets, a lot of pent-up demand when we opened. Absorptions, they've come in higher than we expected. So, it's a powerful tool in what we're accomplishing.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","We're in 51 markets...","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","To the extent...","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Sorry, Ken. We're in 51 markets and 17 states today, so we're continuing to see that expansion as we move throughout the year.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right. And then, I guess, relative to the idea of pace, the idea of pace and price, I'm not a big fan of that notion. But, I mean, are you constraining your pace? Or you're really accepting as many sales as will lock in the door? Can you describe that dynamic broadly speaking? Thank you.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Ken, we've been trying and successfully setting absorption targets on communities based upon what we think is a sustainable demand in a submarket. And we are building and selling to their pace.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Hey guys, good morning. Congrats on another strong quarter.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","David, I guess on the price point conversation, obviously you guys have done a great job with Express and I think that at least in the investment community, there is this perception that entry-level is accelerating nicely whereas the \u2013 maybe the higher-end luxury segment is seeing some softness. And you guys have been expanding Emerald as well. I don't think it's as much of a topic of conversation. But I was wondering if you can give some updated color on the luxury and how that compares to the obviously, the strength you've been seeing in Express? And how you think about allocating dollars going forward between the segments?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, from a \u2013 The allocation to dollars, we \u2013 it's a market-by-market program. The markets where the upper end is is continuing to stay strong. We will be putting more money on it, but what's really driving the growth right now and the improvement in returns is the lower end, either Express or the lower Horton pricing.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","And would that be true on the margin side as well because obviously, I think you probably go into it thinking that Express is going to generate a lower margin, but it seems like the pricing power has been stronger there. So, what does the spread look like between the Emerald and the Express brands right now?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right now it's in a pretty tight range. Both are very near our company average. Obviously, with the pent-up demand in Express and really not enough supply out there, we've seen better margins than we originally underwrote the deals to. So, right now it's in a pretty tight range.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Great. Thanks a lot. And if I could sneak in one more. Just on the land supply, a pretty big spike in option lots this quarter if I heard that number correctly. And I think you're looking at over 40% to your control lots are option right now. Just curious what you're seeing in the land market that's allowing you to pursue that strategy? Obviously, it ties into your focus on cash generation, but is that a function or there's more AD&C capital available to the developers? Or something else that you've been focusing on to drive that number higher?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","I think, we've been focusing heavily on developer relationships and working with them where we can. There's also a little bit of a timing functionality to that. And that \u2013 it can be very high in the middle of the quarter, come down a little bit as you're buying land or lots through the quarter. And at this quarter end, we had a little bit more than we might have been prior quarter ends. But it has been a focus for us. We're pleased with the results we're getting and being able to control more of our future lot supply with options and with developers. And we're going to continue to focus on it. You're right, it is a key part of our cash generation strategy. And we're very excited about the results we've seen.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","But, no, we're not really seeing the A&D environment with the banks improved much. This is really the result of taking the very best of the best developers and trying to improve our relationships with them.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Got it. Thanks a lot and good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Curious about the strategy moving forward of growing community counts and then also looking at your growth relative to the market in total. Last year, you grew faster than the market really rolling out Express. But if you look at where demand is and where trends are in the market. Just curious about how you think about investing in growing communities and accelerating growth, how are you feeling about that?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're in 51 markets right now with Express. So, we have, I think, runway there. We are relatively new with the Express brand in another 15, 20 markets that we think we can certainly gain market share in those markets. We're pretty much tracking job growth, and where the economy is supporting housing, that's where we're looking to expand our investment.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","In terms of the pace of the overall growth, are you satisfied with what you're seeing? Is there a desire to invest more to grow faster, or is this kind of what you're targeting and what you would like to sustain?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","We planned a solid, consistent double-digit growth both top line, bottom line. We'll continue to create separation from other builders in the industry. And today, we're very happy with that strategy.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","And we believe our current lot position is sufficient to support that double-digit growth pace.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. This quarter, you had a terrific SG&A performance. So, just market improvement, just on trend and over last year. Your gross margins have also been very consistent here, only taking up your pre-tax range by about 20 basis points. So, just wanted to make sure I understood that. Does that mean that there were some temporary factors that may have depressed SG&A? Why would you expect seemingly the terrific performance to reverse, or is it something on the gross margins side for the rest of the year?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Nishu, we didn't see anything unusual this quarter. We did deliver a strong backlog conversion. We delivered a little bit above our guidance range on our closings this quarter, and that helped leverage our SG&A a bit further, but we were very pleased with the leverage we saw on SG&A and we're tracking to a better pace, a better ratio for the year than we had originally guided to. We were guiding to some improvement in SG&A. Now, it's simply showing some better improvement on that.","And certainly, as we get further into the year and depending on what our deliveries are later in the year, there is potential we could leverage it a bit better than what we have guided to here. If we were to be at the high end of our volume range, then perhaps we have a chance of beating the low end of our leverage range, our SG&A leverage range. But right now, we're comfortable with the range we've guided to. Nothing unusual, no declining or degradation in our SG&A performance is expected.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And kind of following-up on Alan's question from earlier. You folks as well as many of the other builders have been scaling back the land purchases; Alan discussed obviously the increased use of options. I was just wondering with the step back that many of the builders including yourselves have taken, have you seen pricing these \u2013 the options would argue that that's a little bit easier to get terms like option takedowns, but what are you seeing in terms of the availability and pricing of deals as the stepping back of the public eased, the land price pressures that have been discussed so much in the last couple of years?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Nishu, we're looking to continue our land investment. In fact, we'll be increasing our investment this year over what we did last year, just to replenish lots and then probably a little more to bring it up a little bit. We did see an increase in our option lot position in the controlled pipeline. Some of that will be land we will purchase that's represented as option lots. That's land that's controlled under contracts that we will purchase as land and do the development ourselves.","Other contracts within that portfolio would be \u2013 where we will be acquiring finished lots or super pads if you will, in some cases, from third-party developers. But we feel that there are still very good opportunities out there for land acquisition, for well-capitalized builders and for well-capitalized developers to work through. It's hard to quantitatively look and say what's happening with land pricing globally. I would tell you it seems like we're getting anecdotally a second look at a few more deals and things seem to come back around, which is just good for us. We like that.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much, guys. Let me add my congratulations on the strong quarter.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Steve.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And just a remark that your SG&A, if you actually do do a little better than your range, that's like, I think if I'm not mistaken that's an all-time record for the company. So that's pretty encouraging.","I guess my first question relates to M&A and the opportunity for it. Obviously, there's been, and there still is, a pretty big disparity in valuations between the large and small builders and you all are pretty much leading the pack. I guess my question is, do you see this kind of disparity mirrored in the private market? And particularly where some of the smaller cap publics are trading at book value or below, I mean are you seeing that kind of valuation mirrored in the private marketing expectations? And can you talk about whether or not you think this generally is the right time where you'd be amenable to acquiring assets in that kind of way M&A, given the fact that your strategic focus is on reducing your land investment relative to your revenues right now? Thanks.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","We are \u2013 you're correct, Stephen, we do have a strategic focus to improve our ratio of revenue to our land investment today; always looking to do that. That makes us a better steward to the capital that we're entrusted with. We do look at M&A as an opportunity to acquire lots, acquire assets and acquire people and operating platforms and teams. And we do look at several opportunities. They can be very good if buyer and seller expectations are aligned and something can work that's accretive to both.","will always be looking at M&A opportunities to grow the business. But there's a lot of expectation gaps sometimes within what some people think what their platform should fetch and what the buyers are willing to actually to transact for. So there's not been as many transactions I think that some people expected to occur.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Stephen, this is David. I'll also add, we're going to look at lot. Anybody out there we're going to take a look at and try to see if they fit culturally, strategically within our company. But it's got to be a very good company for it to make sense to us. We like where we are, we like what we're accomplishing. And we really don't want to jump out there and do anything that's going to break that focus.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Yeah. Good luck finding another company as strong as you guys are though.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","They're there.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","They're there. There are some small operators or even midsized operators that are doing a great job. I mean, if you look back at the four acquisitions we've made, we have learned to become better with every one of those.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. That's fair comment.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","We take what they're doing good and integrate it into our company.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. I guess my second question relates to the role of master planned communities and some of the opportunities that those larger parcels could potentially provide for you. I was wondering if you could give us some handle on what percent of your business you think is coming from master planned communities today, and where you think that could go to?","And as a follow-on to that, would you generally think that in some of these larger parcels, you have the ability to maybe take on a little bit of multifamily construction or even like commercial opportunities longer term?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","The master planned, I'd say, is probably 10%, 15% of our business, and that's just a guess, really. It's not something we've broken down. And, yes, I think as we get bigger, or continue to get bigger, that percentage is going to grow. It's just a lot more efficient to deliver more houses at one location than it is in multiple locations.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","And then, Steve, as you know we always investigate new business lines, if they could complement our business. And so, we have built for rent on land we own on a limited basis when it makes business sense. And we do currently own a few large projects with parcels that are zoned multi-family that we're evaluating or in the process of building apartments on. But we wouldn't expect that to have any financial impact on our 2016 results.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Fair enough. Thanks very much, guys. Good job.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today comes from Bob Wetenhall from RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, you guys are crushing a nice job.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bob.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Thanks, Bob.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Bob.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's a technical term. Talk to me about ASP appreciation during the balance of the year. How do you think that plays out? What kind of growth rates should we be expecting? And I'm really think about this in the context of not including mix. If you took like-for-like and you blend it together, what do you see going on in the next couple of quarters?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","We would expect to continue to see a few, if you're looking like-for-like, some ability to move price up. We've continued to see our revenues per square foot outpaced our second brick per square foot now once we got back in track a couple of quarters ago. So, very positive on that front and definitely feel the ability to push price.","In terms of our overall ASP, we did see on our sales front that really kind of flatten out sequentially, which isn't surprising because of the heavier mix that continues to come from Express.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. But you're still getting the operating leverage off that which offsets the weaker mix. But if you had to stay, like, on a like-for-like basis, would you expect low-single digit or mid-single digit?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Yes, low-single digits.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. That's helpful. And then just kind of thinking about like Texas and California, some of your major markets where you are a leader. Would you say that the trends that you saw this quarter were in line with your expectations a couple of months ago? Or would you say that in your core most important markets that demand is stronger and better than you had anticipated? Just trying to understand a little bit better if you're gauging strength of demand in your most important markets, is it coming out ahead of your expectations? Thanks and good luck.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Bob. Kind of a mix like Texas, at least in my mind. Houston is probably underperformed my expectations over the last couple of quarters, but it's been offset by an overperform in Austin, Dallas, and Fort Worth and San Antonio. I mean, the balance of the state is doing incredibly well and...","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Overall we expected a good spring and we're seeing a good spring. Overall, I think it's in-line with our expectations for a good solid, consistent moderately growing market with variations from market to market.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Our absorption to picked up the most in the South East and South Central regions, which is what you've heard us say really kind of Texas across the Florida and up into the Carolina is a big piece to our business that we expect to be very robust. And we've seen a very good level of demand in those markets and a good return on our inventory investments.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Bob, we do have very high expectations at all time. And we are pleased with where the results of the spring have come out and really across the board and all of our markets.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great execution, guys. You're killing it. Good luck next quarter.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and I'll add my congrats on the quarter as well. First question, just on the sales pace, continued expansion there, we have it roughly up 8%, just want to make sure in terms of the drivers there, seems like primarily that's due to the continued expansion of Express as part of your business. I just want to make sure that, that's still is the case in effect and would you expect \u2013 it seems like there's still more room to go. Was that something that you would expect to continue to benefit your results even into fiscal 2017.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I mean, I would say fully rolled out in Texas, Carolinas on the Express model, still got room to grow in all of the other markets. So, I think we got benefit from that brand and that initiative for this year, next year and the year after that, but we're fully integrated, fully rolled out.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just is it fair to say that that's really the, let's say, biggest driver of the improvement in your overall sales pace as reported this quarter?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Actually, it is a major contributor. The other brands are doing well also, but there's just a whole lot less competition at that entry level.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","And therefore, more pent-up demand, and it's easier to drive absorption.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Right. Now, certainly. I guess second question just on the improved SG&A guidance that you rolled out this quarter that helps your pre-tax by 20 bps. Now, you've expanded that guidance. Given that you still kind of have similar expectations on the units and it seems like the ASPs, it would suggest that you're not necessarily expecting better \u2013 that the improved leverage has been coming off of improved volumes per se, and it seems like Express and your overall, again top line seems to be coming in as expected.","So, are there other things in the SG&A line item that's helping here in terms of kind of concrete items around perhaps advertising or other types of SG&A controllables that are coming in better than expected, or is this just the overall model. In effect, just the overall efficiency just being that much better even with the same type of closings that you expected three months ago?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Mike, it's really just a result of our overall focus on SG&A. It's not any one thing. It's always been a hallmark of our business. It's something we're very focused on. We set a 9.6% SG&A in fiscal 2015 which was the best SG&A we've had other than two years in the company's history when we had a 9% handle as well. And we've now guided to 9.0% to 9.2%. And I'll just say, it is a focus and something that all of our guys in the field are looking at. It's how can we run the business more efficiently and leverage our overhead better than we have in the past.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Michael, this is David. We get up every day and try to figure out how to make it a little bit easier to build a house, a little bit easier to sell a house, and a little bit easier to get the house closed. And we work on that every single day, because that is a sustainable, competitive advantage. And that is \u2013 that's what we try to be.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No. That's great. And obviously it's great to see as the recovery continues. One last quick question if I could. Community count now flattish for about four quarters. Is that something that you would expect to reaccelerate at some point maybe into the mid-single digit or high-single digit growth into next year? Or should we just continue to expect sales pace over the next couple of years to drive the bus?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Mike, for this year, we stated we expect our community count to be in kind of that low-single digit or relatively flat this year with the improvement in sales coming from improved absorptions. And certainly, the Express rollout is a driver of that. I think it will continue to be a driver next year. As Express matures, if you're looking over the next year or two, you would naturally expect to grow at the double-digit pace. You would see a stronger community count growth over the longer term. We don't really have the visibility fully for 2017 yet to make any specific comments on that, though.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Right now, Michael, we're replacing communities every quarter every month. And when you create a community that's driving an absorption level of two or three or a new community that's on an Express model that's driving six or eight. Flat community count. There's a lot of efficiencies and absorption improvement. So, yes, but over time, we will be expanding our community count that lead to market.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Very helpful. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Please proceed with your question.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Good morning, Jack.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Hey, first question for Bill, you're generating a ton of cash. It sounds like that trend is going to continue in the next year and years beyond. Your leverage levels are getting to the lower end of, I think, probably optimal. Your land strategy has changed a bit. And it sounds like you're going to kind of keep it about the same point even though the mix is going to change from an absolute level. I guess the question is, what do you do with the cash? I know in the past, there have been share repurchase. There's been debt repurchase. What do we think about longer-term goals with the cash beyond sort of second half spend, that sort of thing around capital management?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Certainly, this year, Jack, we're generating $300 million to $500 million, and we're to paying off over $500 million of debt this year. So, for fiscal 2016, essentially, debt retirement and continuing to invest in the business. We do continue to look at M&A opportunities, we've done several deals over the last several years, and to the extent that we see good deals that are a good fit for us as we described earlier. That will be a priority as well.","And then beyond that, we want to stay opportunistic. And so, we're not going to tie ourselves down to anything specific beyond this year, but right now, we're focused on debt retirement, being opportunistic investing in the business, and then we'll assess further as we get visibility into 2017.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then my follow-up question, through our travels, I think one of the things that we've seen is the Express-type product is appealing to a buyer group maybe beyond the entry or first-time buyer. Really, we're surprised that the trade down empty-nester, everybody think of the active adult is maybe at mid to upper-end product, but we're seeing a lot in the lower price points as well.","Are you seeing that a meaningful way? Has it changed the trajectory or the direction of the rollout of the Express product, or maybe even location? What can you share with us about that dynamic?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't say that it's changed the direction. We have seen that take place especially on Florida, it surprised me as well, or when we launched Express in Florida, 40%, 45% were actually the people buying their last home, not their first home. And that's something we're taking note of, and making sure that we're in a position to accommodate those buyers.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Susan Maklari from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","My first question is just going back to your third quarter guidance in terms of the conversion rate, I believe you said 76% to 80%. That just feels a little light relative to where we were modeling our expectations. Would you say that you saw any pull-forward in demand in the second quarter, perhaps maybe due to the overall better weather that most of the country saw?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","You know, Sue, not necessarily that we're attributing it to better weather. But our operators did convert their backlog at a higher rate than we anticipated and then what we've told you for Q2. When we look at our business plan for Q3, which we're expecting to deliver on, it's right in the heart of that 76% to 80% range that we've guided to for Q3.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The timing of the deliveries through the year is a function of really the roll up of all of our communities and the timing of when communities come online and when housing starts gets started. And right now, the way it's rolling up division-by-division points to that range, but still for the year points to the same range we gave at the start of the year.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","And historically, we typically do see a tick down in our conversion rate from Q2 to Q3. That's a normal seasonal trend for us.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then looking at your spec levels, it seems like those are continuing to sort of trend down over time. Can you just talk a little bit about what's contributing to that and what should we make of that?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","I think we can contribute that there's a very strong demand in the marketplace right now. And that we are starting specs and getting them out there and getting them sold early in the construction process. And its \u2013 you've got to start more houses. And then, so you get those started and you get those sold. In addition, we're starting some houses to-be-built jobs as well. So our overall mix of build versus spec is staying the same, we're just seeing very strong demand in the marketplace. More efficient with turning of our homes is one of the key drivers of our cash flow generation. Doing more revenue, more closings with the same number of homes under construction at any point in time, a key part of our focus.","Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Will Randow from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning and congrats on the quarter.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Just going back to Susan's question. When you look at your current percentage of closings that are spec, could you talk about that? And how you feel going into, kind of, the peak construction period in regards to potential labor inflation and or delays?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","And so, in terms of our specs that we closed in the quarter, it was in our normal range, which is every quarter, 70% to 80% of what we're closing is a spec. And so, when you look at our reported gross margin, you're essentially seeing our spec gross margin. In terms of labor...?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","We're not seeing a tremendous amount of labor inflation. In fact, we've been able to stay ahead of the cost increases we've seen on stick and brick, which any cost increase that have come through have been more labor oriented versus the materials and the commodities today. But we haven't seen a tremendous amount of pressure. And in terms of shortages affecting delays, our cycle times have remained very consistent, and we've not had, as evidenced by our backlog conversion rate last quarter, we have not had a real labor constraint widespread that's affected closings.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Again, as you drive higher absorption in a community-by-community basis, you take a lot of pressure off the trade base, because a lot of their time is just going from community to community. And if we can get them into the community and keep them there, they can make more money, a lot less pressure on pricing.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And just as a follow-up, you mentioned your stick and brick costs are fairly stable. Is there any way you can parse down on the categories in terms of the movements, for example, lumber and how you think about that going through the year?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","In terms of overall, our revenue per square foot year-over-year was up about 4% and our stick and brick was up about 2.5%. Sequentially, it was closer to both being up about 1%. The majority of the cost inflation, as Mike mentioned, we continue to see is on the labor side not the material side. And so lumber specifically, I wouldn't say we've seen anything unusual in lumber prices. They tend to follow a seasonal trend, and we haven't seen anything unusual this year.","Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you, and congrats again.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thank you for taking the call, guys. First question, last quarter, I believe you mentioned not heavily reinvesting in Houston at this point, but kind of taking more of a replenishing strategy. Was that the case in the second quarter? And did anything happen in the quarter where you might have \u2013 might change that strategy going forward?","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","No, that would still be the case in the second quarter. It may change in the future as we are positioned to take advantage of opportunistic buys. And as stress gets put on a market, sometimes that creates an opportunity for us.","John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of the cash flow guide, $300 million to $500 million, it's a fairly wide range. Can you just remind us what kind of drive the upper end of the range versus the lower end?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It really comes down to our overall revenue volume, our closings volume. It would be \u2013 is the main driver. We expect that predominance of that cash flow to come in our fourth quarter when we have our largest closings quarter. And essentially then, the wide range is attributable to a little bit unpredictability on the timing of when land purchases will close. And so, as we get a little closer to the end of the year, we might be able to tighten that a bit. But, there is some unpredictability in the timing of when the land deals will close.","John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. Great. If I could sneak one housekeeping in here. The flat community count that you guys talked about, was that year-over-year or is that sequentially?","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Yeah. We mentioned that our year-over-year community count was essentially flat, and it was actually down slightly. And really when we look at that going forward, we would expect no more than a low single-digit movement. Either way, it could be up or down in a low single-digit percentage here over the next couple of quarters.","John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael G.

Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Wanted to go back to some of the comments and obviously, a lot of questions and remarks about the Express side, but just from a \u2013 made a comment about just seeing a lot less competition there. And clearly, you've had a period of \u2013 number of quarters of success, competitors have taken notice. Feels like the market in general there's a more positive tone on the entry-level and some acknowledgement that it seems like that demand is pushing outward. And so, I'm just curious to hear your take on \u2013 we've kind of heard that some other builders are starting to explore similar things, maybe not quite the same. But as you're looking at new land deals, are you running up against more competition than you would have seen kind of 6, 9, 12 months ago? And how do you think they're positioned? Or what's the \u2013 what do you think that they're doing differently?","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","We tend to focus a lot on what we're doing, and we do see some competition on the land front. It's constant out there, and it's market-by-market and it varies. What other things they do with their entry level, entrants, I've heard of others coming to market. There's some of it out there, but broadly we're not seeing widespread, heavy competition today with us flag-by-flag.","Certainly, in our pockets but there's more competition. But generally, we're not seeing it. How others tend to approach that market? That will be up to them. We're focused on providing a great value for the home buyer, and so our customer can be in their house. They can be in there at a good price they can afford and a place for their family.","But as entry level grows, we do expect more competition to come. And we're certainly prepared to deal with that is as it comes.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask regarding leverage. At this point in the cycle, is your plan to retire near-term debt maturities as was indicated in the press release to reduce leverage? Or do you plan to eventually replace those maturities with similar-sized debt offerings?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We always look at the debt markets, and we'll remain opportunistic there. There are certainly \u2013 it's a favorable market right now. But where we sit today with our cash position with our expectations for cash flows, we right now do not expect to be in the debt market in the short term. We have already paid off the $373 million that came due on April 15. We paid that out of cash. And we believe our cash position, our liquidity available on the revolver and our cash flows are sufficient for the remainder of the year as we sit here today.","Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","And just regarding other income, can you comment on what drove the spike in the second quarter?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We did have \u2013 we sold an investment that we had in debt securities. It's been \u2013 You can look back in our 10-Qs, there's been a disclosure around that investment. We had some debt securities that we had acquired a while back that gave us access to some lands that we have now acquired the land and are actively developing it. And we were able to restructure those debt securities and resell them in the market. So, we had a gain on that sale of $4.5 million, which was an improvement in our other income line this quarter.","Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And just lastly, the capital markets uncertainty and spread widening that we've seen this year, you may have alluded to it on the land side, the second look you referred to, but have you noticed any impact on either the land market or sales trends due to the volatility? Thanks a lot.","Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","It's hard to attribute it to any one factor. Just the competitive environment, deal-by-deal is different. We are seeing a few more second looks, so that's been very positive for us.","Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks.","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Jade.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","Good morning, everyone. First question, I know Houston is a smaller market for you, guys, but if you could update us on what's happening on the ground there? And what you think you're going to see in terms of delays for either labor or materials to get homes finished.","Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations","Jay, it's business as usual. We're \u2013 we feel for the people and what they're going through in Houston right now with the horrendous flooding. But our operations are fine, and we don't expect any noticeable impact on our business in Houston. Clearly, the market has just softened due to the lower oil prices, but we continue to see very consistent, steady demand at price points below $300,000.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","We like the Houston market, big believers in that long term. And if it becomes \u2013 if we see an opportunity to buy something at a very advantageous price, we're going to be all over it.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","Got it. The second question I had, there was a small order decline in the East geography this quarter. Could you talk about what's going on in that market?","Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The East for us is the Carolinas and North, so it's really more Northeast for us. And, yeah, we were down, I believe, 2% in sales units. Our community count in that region was actually down. So, our absorptions were actually up mid-single digits there. So really just reflects probably fewer investments over the last few years, manifesting itself with your communities.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","We're kind of going through a reset up in the Northeast. We like where we're headed. But it's not going to be a stellar performance this year.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kevin.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Don Tomnitz, President and CEO of D. R. Horton.","Thank you, Mr. Tomnitz. You may begin.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you, Kevin. Thank you and good morning. Joining me this morning are David Auld, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Bill Wheat, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Murray, Senior Vice President of Business Development; and Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Communications.","Before we get started, Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","","Some comments made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different.","All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","This brings demand for new homes remain relatively stable, compared to last year across the most of our markets. and the D.R Horton team leveraged our platform as the largest and most geographically diverse homebuilders to generate a 25% year-over-year increase in our third quarter net sales orders.","Our increased community count, and inventories of lands, lots and homes put us in a strong competitive position. and our teams in the field have secured our business plan superbly, this quarter by focusing on achieving their targeted sales absorptions in each community every week.","D.R Horton has been the leader in the U.S homebuilding industry for 12 consecutive years. Our market share position today is the largest in our history, with 40% more homes closed than any other builder in the most recently reported 12-month period.","To diversify and strengthen our market share, both nationally and at the local level. we\u2019re actively extending product offerings across all price points throughout D.R. Horton, Express Homes and Emerald Homes brands. The rollouts of our entry-level Express brand and our move-up on luxury Emerald brand are going well. And we will discuss our progress on both later in the call.","Our homebuilding and financial services operations generated another solid quarter of profitable with $22.65 \u2013 with $226.5 million, excuse me, say that one more time, with $226.5 million of operating income and a 10.6% operating margin excluding impairment charges.","With our 11,365 homes in backlog and the year-over-year improvement, we have seen in our sales during the first part of July, we expect strong home closings, revenues and profits in our fourth fiscal quarter ending September. All our efforts are part of our comprehensive return focus strategy, which we will explain in more detail throughout the call.","Our primary strategic goal is to leverage our strong competitive position to generate growth, and revenues, and profits at a double-digit pace, while improving our cash flows and increasing our returns on invested capital. Some of the operating actions we are taking to execute our return focus strategy resulted in some volatility on our financial metrics this quarter. However, we believe our consistent focus on increasing our returns and cash flows were still growing our revenues and profits will greatly benefit our company, and most importantly, our shareholders over the next two years. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Net income for the third quarter was $113.1 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $146 million, or $0.42 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $171.8 million in the third quarter, compared to $205.1 million in the year-ago quarter. And homebuilding pretax income was $158.6 million, compared to $185.4 million in the prior year quarter.","The decrease in our pretax income this quarter was caused by $54.7 million of inventory impairment charges, primarily in our Chicago market where we are taking actions to reduce inventories to enable us to redeploy the capital to generate better returns. We will discuss these actions later in the call.","Our third quarter, home sales revenues increased 28% to $2.1 billion on 7,676 homes closed, up from $1.6 billion on 6,464 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $272,300, up 8% compared to the prior year, largely driven by increases in average selling prices in our Southeast and West regions. David?","David V. Auld","","The value of our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 32% from the year-ago quarter to $2.4 billion. Homes sold increased 25% to 8,551 homes on 11% increase in active selling communities. Our average sales price increased 5% to $281,300, the cancellation for the third \u2013 cancellation rate for the third quarter was 24%, consistent with the year-ago quarter.","The value of our backlog increased 26% from a year ago to $3.3 billion, with an average sales price of $286,200, and homes in backlog increased 15% to 11,365 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the third quarter was 74%, excluding closings from Crown Communities, subsequent to the acquisition date.","We expect our fourth quarter backlog conversion rate to be around 75%, consistent with our long-term average for the fourth quarter. A key part of our return focus strategy is to consistently achieve our targeted sales absorptions in each community. Community absorption targets vary depending on location, product type, lot supply and market conditions at a local level. Our operators proactively adjust product offerings, sales prices and incentives to meet the market effectively compete from new home demand, with a goal of improving inventory turn and optimizing return on our investments.","The best way to maximize returns and profits over the life of our communities is to sell and close at a consistent and plan phase. As the spring unfolded, we adjusted an increase to level of incentives in many communities, which helped generate our strong sales result. Overall, incentive levels were extremely low levels in fiscal 2013 and early 2014, but are now returning to normal levels in many markets with significant variations across our communities. Mike?","Michael Murray","","In early May, we acquired the home building operations of Crown Communities for approximately $210 million in cash; Crown operates in Georgia, South Carolina and Eastern Alabama. we acquired approximately 640 homes in inventory, 2,350 lots and control of an additional 3,400 lots through option contracts. We also acquired a sales order backlog of 431 homes valued at $113.6 million.","All of the assets acquired were recorded at their estimated fair values and $53.6 million of goodwill was recorded as a result of the purchase. Our home sales gross profit this quarter was reduced by $9 million of purchase accounting related to the acquisition and we expect additional purchase accounting impact of $9 million on home sales gross profit over the next three quarters.","Our third quarter results include 290 net sales and 254 closings from the Crown operations. And Crown increased our average active selling communities by 4% for the quarter. The Crown team operates an efficient business with very strong returns and we are pleased to have them on the D.R. Horton team. Jessica.","Jessica Hansen","We continue to experience strong growth and profitability in the heart of our business our D.R. Horton branded communities which accounted for the substantial majority of our sales and closing this quarter. We are also pleased with the progress and performance of the rollouts of our Express Homes and Emerald Homes brands as we expand our product offerings to diversify and strengthen our market position both nationally and at a local level. This year we introduced our Express Homes brand which is targeted as the true entry-level buyer who is focused first and foremost on affordability. A segment we believe is currently underserved. In October we acquired Regent Homes an entry level builder on the Carolinas as we began to refocus on that segment of the market.","Today and going forward we include Regent in our reported metrics for Express. We are now offering Express in 22 markets and eight states with a significant majority of our sales and closings to date coming from Texas the Carolinas. Even though we are still in an early stages of the roll out Express accounted for 7% of our homes sold, 4% of our home\u2019s closed and 2% of homes sales revenue in the third quarter.","The Average closing price for an Express Homes this quarter was $156,000. Customer response to our affordable Express product offerings has been extremely positive. In 2012 under the D.R. Horton brand we began adding more communities and floor plans targeted toward move out buyers. Last year we introduced Emerald Homes as our brand for the higher end move up and luxury communities, 6% of homes closed this quarter were greater than $500,000 under both the Horton an Emerald brands accounting for 16% of our home sales revenue up from 3% in homes closed and 9% revenues in the same quarter of last year.","We are now offering Emerald in 32 markets across the 11 states. Homes market in under our Emerald homes brand accounted for 2% of our homes sold and closed and 4% of our home sales revenue in the third quarter. The average closing price for an Emerald home this quarter was $655,000 consistent with our return focused strategy our expectation for all three of our brands is at 20% minimum annual return on inventory defined as pre-tax income divided by average inventory. And our underwriting criteria for all land and lot purchases reflects this ROI expectation.","In general we expect our Emerald communities to generate higher than average gross margin at slower than average absorptions. Our Express communities to generate faster than average absorption at lower than average gross margin and our Horton communities to continue to operate around our average margin and absorption. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","At the significant improvement in our gross margins over the last several quarters, we expected further improvement in our margins to be challenging and we expected revenue growth to become the strongest driver of our profit growth. Our expectation will realize this quarter as home price appreciation is moderating, some costs were still rising and incentives are increasing back to normal levels.","At the same time we are focused on improving our returns on our inventory investments in each community at balancing our home prices incentives sales pace and profit margins. Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 20.7 % down 70 basis point from the year ago quarter, 60 basis points of the margin decrease was caused by higher relative costs for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenue.","Due to a large amount of costs reimbursements received in the prior year quarter. 40 basis points of decrease related to purchase accounting impact from the acquisitions of Crown Communities and Regent Homes. These decreases were partially offset by 20 basis points from year-over-year increases in sales prices and by 10 basis point due to lower amortized interest and property taxes costs as a percentage of home sales revenue compared to the prior year quarter.","Sequentially, our home sales gross margin decreased 180 basis points from the second quarter, 90 basis points of the sequential margin decrease was due to the combined effect of higher levels of incentives and cost increases. As we mentioned earlier we adjusted and increased the level of incentives in many communities throughout the spring in an effort to improve sales absorptions and maximize returns and profits.","In general incentives were at extremely low levels in fiscal 2013 and early 2014 and are now returning to more levels. An additional 60 basis points of the sequential margin decrease was due to higher relative costs for warranty and construction defect claims, and the remaining 30 basis points related to the purchase accounting impact from the Crown acquisition.","Generally in a stable housing environment we expect our average gross margins to be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations due to product and geographic mix and the relative impact of warranty and construction defects and interest costs. Mike?","Mike Murray","Another important aspect of our return focused strategy is actively managing inactive or underperforming assets to improve returns and cash flows. And redeploying the cash in the more productive assets as market conditions have improved we are activating development of many of our mothballed assets and we\u2019ll begin selling and closing homes in these new communities over the next year.","As a result our balance of land held for development declined over $100 million to $396 million at June 30 which corresponds to a 22% decrease in the number of lots to 17,000 lots from year ago our operators continue to develop their plans for each remaining held land parcel and we expect that land held for development will significantly decline over the upcoming year.","Our third quarter results included $54.7 million of inventory impairment charges $48.8 million of the charges occurred in our mid west region primarily related to large land positions and actively selling communities in Chicago acquired between 2004 and 2007 that had been previously impaired in contrast to most of our markets the Chicago housing markets remains very weak with sales absorptions and returns in these communities performing a lower expectations relative to the size of our investments.","In response during the quarter we reduced prices and identified land parcels we intend to sell in these communities in an effort to increase sales pace reduced inventories and improved cash flows and returns.","Based on current market conditions we believe that we do not have another concentration of underperforming communities in an individual market that would result in impairment charges of the same magnitude as we incurred in Chicago this quarter. However as we execute our return focus strategy and take actions to optimize cash returns by modifying our product, pricing, incentives or plans to sell land in individual active communities and land held for development we could incur additional impairment charges in the future. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Home building SG&A expense for the quarter was $221.9 million compared to $167.5 million in the prior year quarter as a percentage of home building revenues our SG&A was 10.8% this quarter compared to 10.2% in the prior year quarter. Fiscal year to date SG&A as a percentage of home sales revenues was 10.9% flat with last year. We are actively investing an SG&A infrastructure to support our current and expected growth.","Additionally the third quarter SG&A percentage included a 20 basis point impact due to the increased valuation and compensation accruals, which increased because of our higher stock prices this quarter. And to correct myself our SG&A expense for the quarter was 10.6%.","We expect SG&A as a percentage of home sales revenues to decrease sequentially on fourth quarter on higher expected revenues. Beyond fiscal 2014 our ongoing annual target for SG&A as a percentage of home building revenues is 10%.","Jessica Hansen","Financial services pretax income for the quarter with $13.2 million compared to $19.7 million in the year-ago quarter. This quarter continued to reflect a more normal competitive pricing environment, where as the year-ago quarter benefitted from unusually favorable market condition which produced higher than normal gains on sale of mortgages. 88% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by homebuilding operation.","FHA and VA loans accounted for 43% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume down from 47% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company during the quarter had an average FICO score of 719 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. David?","David V. Auld","At the end of June, we had 20,500 homes and inventory, of which 1,500 were models, 10,000 were speculative homes with 31,100 of the specs being completed. Our construction and progress and finished homes inventory increased by $518 million during the quarter. And now it represents 46% of our inventory balance. The highest percentage continues.","This component of our inventory is the fastest turning portion of the inventory investment. At June 30, our lot portfolio consisted of a 125,000 owned lots with an additional 54,000 lots controlled through option contracts. 66,000 of our lots are finished with half owned and optioned. Our land held for development totaled 17,000 lots down 22% from March. As we continue to proactively work through the older inactive land to redeploy the capital and improve inventory turns, cash flow and the overall return on investment.","With a 179,000 total lots owned and controlled we are in a strong position to compete in a current housing market, with a sufficient lot supply to support strong growth in those sales and closings in the coming years.","In the third quarter, our investment and lots, land and development totaled $665 million, of which $456 million was to replenish finished lots and land and $209 million were spent on land development. Our investment and lots, land and development for the first nine months of the year excluding the Crown and Regent acquisitions totaled $1.7 billion down from $2.1 billion last year. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","At June 30, our unrestricted home building cash, totaled $538.5 million and we had available capacity on a revolving credit facility of $657 million with no cash borrowings outstanding. Our home building leverage ratio net of cash was 34.4% and our gross home building leverage was 38.7%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at June 30 was $3.1 billion. $137.9 million of our senior notes mature in September and we have sufficient cash and revolver capacity to repay these notes.","During the quarter the holders are 2% convertible senior notes converted their notes into 38.6 million shares of common stock, which added $500 million to paid-in capital this quarter. At June 30, our shareholders equity balance was $5 billion and book value per share was $13.63. Based on our solid balance sheet, liquidity and current and expected levels of profitability, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 67% from the most recent dividend paid to $6.25 per share. The dividend is payable on August 18, to shareholders of record on August 8. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","In closing, we are pleased that we maintained our position as the largest builder in United States by volume for the 12 consecutive year. We are growing our volume at a faster rate than the overall industry and continue to capture additional market share. Based on the recent local leaders issue of Builder Magazine ranking homebuilders market share in the top 50 new home markets in the United States. D.R. Horton is the number one builder in four of the top 10 markets, is a top five builder in eight of the top 10 markets, has a double-digit percentage share in 10 markets, and is a top five builder in half of the top 15 new home markets.","We also have a leading market share position in many markets outside of the top 50. Our leading market share position nationally and in many of our local markets provided the platform for us to produce very strong increases in a value of our sales, closings, and backlog of 32%, 28%, and 26% respectively. We generated another solid quarter of profitability with consolidated pre-tax income of $171.8 million and $2.1 billion of revenues. We have also made good progress this year towards our long-term goal producing positive cash flow from operations was still growing the business.","In the first nine months of fiscal 2014, our cash used in operating activities declined by $560 million as compared to the prior year period. We expect additional substantial progress on our cash flow performance over the next year. We remain intently focused on growing our revenues at a double-digit pace with strong profits while improving our cash flows and increasing our returns on invested capital. We are very well positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our three brands, and attractive finished lot and land position, and most importantly, our tremendous operational team across the country.","D.R. and I would like to personally thank our employees for your continued hard work and accomplishments. We want to specifically thank our sales people for focusing on achieving their budgeted net sales in each week in each subdivision. A key element in improving our ROI and free cash flow. Keep it up and let\u2019s finish our fiscal year out strong. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host any question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from David Goldberg from UBS. Please proceed with your question","David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody.","Donald J. Tomnitz","","Good morning, David.","Bill W. Wheat","Good morning, David.","David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","My first question was about the level of incentives you guys are offering and what I\u2019m trying to figure out is are you finding that other builders are kind of coming out and matching you on these incentives. And if so is there an endgame, when you said look it doesn't make sense anymore, we might sell more homes for a short period of time, but eventually it\u2019s just kind of a zero sum game or do you find that the competition is a little more reluctant to come after you guys given that you probably have a better cost structure and can still make money maybe at little bit lower price?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We really have not noticed the other builders coming after us as you mentioned. And I think that's reflected in their sales increases that most of them have reported so far compared to our sales increase. So as a result I don't believe that it\u2019s adversely affecting the market for other builders. We\u2019re focused on our key strategy of hitting our minimum absorption for community for a week, so that we can generate a higher return on our inventory and generate free cash flow for our investors.","David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","And then just as a follow-up on the warranty \u2013 the change in warranty, nothing specific happening there, there wasn't anything underlying that, no change in terms of increased claims or anything like that just kind of normal fluctuations or is there anymore to read into that?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Just normal fluctuations, nothing specific in the quarter that occurred, no specific charges. The comparison to the prior-year period we had received some more infrequent cash reimbursements in the prior-year quarter. This quarter we received no such reimbursements. So it's just simply a normal fluctuations.","David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen S. Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hey, guys. Great job in the quarter. Wanted to get some clarity I guess. You made the comment I think you used the phrase stable demand earlier on in your prepared remarks and obviously the new home sales numbers came out and look like it was a pretty squishy number. Know that that\u2019s not the most reliable metric of all, but I wanted to see if you could clarify that. Particularly in the context of your commentary about discounting being up, and Bill\u2019s comment that I think you said generally you look for about a 20% gross margin which is obviously lower than \u2013 significantly lower than what you kind of been doing if you make the adjustments for the one-time event. So was curious if you could just sort of talk about what you mean by seeing stable demand in the context of you discounting in the comment on gross margins? Thanks.","Bill W. Wheat","Well, in terms of our comment on stable demand we saw a significant increase in demand in 2013. And we saw a significant price appreciation in 2013. And so the levels of demand a year ago had increased dramatically. We all know that has moderated some since then and as we assess this spring, we would say on an overall basis the demand is relatively stable with where it was last year. Obviously there are significant variations across our markets. Some markets were still seeing increasing demand, others are flatter. Generally in most markets we are seeing less price appreciation here this quarter.","So really from our perspective settling into a more normal pattern perhaps modest growth, modest price appreciation, but not as dramatic as a year ago. Same thing for our incentives. A year ago our incentive levels were very low, extremely low. Now that is simply moving back to a more normal level and so reflectively than we would expect our margins to return to a more normal level, which is really around that 20% level. The margins when they get a point, two points, two and a half points higher than that 20% level are really the exception rather than the rule over the long-term.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And as we said for years, Steve, we said the normal margins in this industry are somewhere between 18% and 22% and our goal is to hit a 20% gross margin, 10% SG&A, and 10% pretax operating margin. So that\u2019s our focus and it continues to be our focus.","Bill W. Wheat","And our number one focus is generating a 20% return on investment community by community and that is \u2013 that requires us balancing our pace, our pricing, our incentives, and our margin I guess volumes to maximize really the return. And so yes, we\u2019ll give some incentive to achieve 25% sales increase will take that train.","Donald J. Tomnitz","We are in a strong position if you take a look at out total lot inventory of 175,000 lots and I\u2019ve said after quarter after quarter after quarter our people have done a great job of buying land on lots at a very early time in the recovery. And what we are doing is taking those lots, putting homes on them and producing very good margins based upon our low costs in land on lots. Now important to realize this is community by community, every community has a different target depending on its own situation, there is certain market were our lot suppliers are more constrained, but we cannot replace the lots we have whether it\u2019s very limited housing inventory. And so in those markets, our target absorptions are lower and we will push prices more there. Because that is the path to higher return in those communities, other communities there is not such good strengths and the best path is to drive volume at a consistent pace.","Stephen S. Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital","That\u2019s very helpful, thanks very much. Regarding the volume, we obviously are hearing about your plans across the price spectrum to grow pretty significantly and it looks very intriguing. One of the things that we gotten as pushback from folks is the Commonwealth, it sounds like an incredibly bold market strategy. In environment that frankly doesn't sound so bullish. My interpretation is that your strategy is not actually characterized, cannot be categorized as a bull market share. I was wondering if you could respond in your own words that the proliferation of your communities plant openings and Emerald, Express and D.R. Horton and in the context of somebody saying that\u2019s sounds like a bull market strategy.","Bill W. Wheat","I think it\u2019s a very conservative strategy and if you look at our creation and our expansion of our express model. That\u2019s creating a lot of the bullish scenario associated with our sales and we are in a limited number of markets now both our Express really in 22 markets in each stated and obviously we have 79 markets in 27 states and wish to expand the Express.","With an ASP of $156,000 this quarter on Express, we feel very bullish about the opportunity to continue to expand Express and I think that will contribute to our higher than industry level sales on a go forward basis, simply because we have chosen apart of the market that we believe truly as underserved. And as I said last quarter a portion of the market that we feel comfortable is going to grow with the higher rate than the other parts of the market and that\u2019s why we chose to leverage up ourselves and expand into Express, and as well we clearly believe there is demand in that segment of the market that there is no supply board. And so we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s an aggressive strategy, that just simply addressing a need in the market.","Donald J. Tomnitz","","We also Steve, are leveraging of existing profitable platforms, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re jumping into new markets that we don\u2019t have operating platforms in today. To me it\u2019s a very conservative later take demand is a market today.","David V. Auld","We are not trying to do Greenfield as a market, so we don\u2019t know anything about, we no a lot about the markets. We\u2019re just opening our new brand, which we feel like the market is being underserved.","Stephen S. Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Makes a lot of sense. Thanks a lot guys.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I had a question, first off on the timing and pattern of the incentives if there is any way to give a little more detail there. In terms of, you mentioned that obviously, you want to get to a certain pace and incentives were particularly low. and now you\u2019ve taken it back to normal, but I\u2019m curious if that occurred maybe towards the beginning of the second quarter, or the late in the end of \u2013 late at the end of your fiscal first quarter, or is it something that has the spring selling season been in maybe in fully materialized to your more hopeful expectations in the May, June timeframe, you\u2019ve kind of cranked it up then?","Donald J. Tomnitz","(Indiscernible) please.","Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","And I\u2019m sorry, and also if the incentives were more prevalent in some markets versus others.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Actually, occurred in March, and we had our division presence meeting in April, and that\u2019s at which point in time, we focus with our division presence on hitting their full form of absorption level on a community-by-community basis, because we fell like that if they give that and they would achieve the ROIs, return on inventories that they have projected and the return on inventories that we won it.","And again, the incentive levels will vary by community-to-community as Bill said earlier, where they are a shortage of lots, or we can\u2019t replace those lots with the cost basis we have in them and we\u2019re going to maximize our gross margins and our absorptions are going to go at a slower pace. But as David said, where we have larger inventory of loss, and we can easily price those lots, and that\u2019s going to be the business model where we\u2019re focusing on higher absorptions and lower gross margins.","I want to emphasize though, if you look at our three product lines, Express where we\u2019re going to have lower margins and higher absorptions, Emerald, where we\u2019re going to have lower absorptions and higher margins, and both of those are going to blend right in to D.R. Horton margins. And once again, I don\u2019t want anybody to get confused, our overall company goal is 20,10,10, 20% gross margin, 10% 10% SG&A and 10% of the PTI lines, with a 20% net ROI community-by-community.","Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","So in terms of that 20% goal Don, I mean, last quarter, I believe you said it\u2019s a company that you talked going forward, gross margins in a range of the prior four quarters, which is in a kind of a 21% to 22% range, was more sustainable. it seems like you are more kind of revising that more based towards, saying that you said on a much longer basis that is just again this 20, 10, 10, is that fair?","Donald J. Tomnitz","As I\u2019ve mentioned to Steve, and I\u2019ll say it again and again, as said ever since we have been doing these conference calls, the normal gross margins on this industry, a range between 18% to 22%, we believe a normalized gross margin for ourselves, or somewhere right at the 20% level. and we were very fortunate and early stages of the recovery where we have a lot of pricing power, there was a lot of increase in medium prices of homes across the country, because I had, the market had overreacted in a lot of markets, and prices that decline more than they probably should have, but normal margins for us are 20%, 10% and as Bill said, a 20% level line.","Bill W. Wheat","I mean, Don, speaking to the longer-term \u2013 longer-term expectations, which that is clearly specific to the guidance we gave last quarter that was targeted more towards the next few quarters. And I\u2019d like the low end of that range, would have been around 21.4%. So our margins did come in below the low end of the range that we gave.","Specifically, the causes for that would have been the purchase accounting impact and the fluctuation that we had in the warranty and construction defect claims, outside of those, would have been within the range. and then going forward, over the long-term, we expect to fluctuate around the 20%, but again, focusing on returns. But if you look at a very important metric and we\u2019ll do this all day long. We can get a 25% to 28% increase in sales, quarter-over-quarter and only have to give up 90 basis points on incentives. That\u2019s a win-win for us in our shareholders.","Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","I appreciate that and thanks for the additional color, Bill. I guess one last one, the SG&A; I think you said that 20 bips was due to some of the stock comp related expense. but even without that, SG&A was on a percentage basis roughly similar to year ago on a 28% revenue growth. So but we expected maybe a little bit of leverage there on a percentage basis on a year-over-year basis. Any thoughts around that, and are there any items that we\u2019re not taking to account?","Bill W. Wheat","I think we\u2019re going to continue to see further leverage in the SG&A. Sales are still pacing at a pretty good level ahead of \u2013 with revenues and ahead of revenues, and we\u2019re still building some of the infrastructure to support that growth that we\u2019re seeing in the brand launches and the platforms across the country as we do that.","So I think we\u2019re going to see better leverage on our SG&A into the fourth quarter. And then coming closer to \u2013 back to our historical target of 10% in the next year with the leverage we\u2019ll attain on the SG&A. We believe that\u2019s a good problem that we have, and that is our SG&A is growing to support our extraordinary growth in sales and our backlog.","Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And the better leverage for 4Q would be on a year-over-year basis as well or just sequentially?","Bill W. Wheat","Certainly sequentially.","Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Dan Oppenheim from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Dan M. Oppenheim \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Good job in terms of responding to the market. I think historically, you guys have always done well in terms of balancing the pace and price there. Wondering as you talked about the 90 basis points in terms of the second quarter margins, presumably some of the \u2013 what you\u2019re doing with the incentives were to generate sales that will be closing \u2013 sorry, the second calendar quarter of its third fiscal. But if we think about the fourth fiscal quarter here, some of those would like to be coming two or three, that\u2019s more of a hit to margins in the coming quarter from this impact.","Bill W. Wheat","We\u2019re not necessaries for giving specific guidance from next quarter, or the next quarter. in terms of margins, we are going to continue to balance the incentive to what we see in the marketplace and we still close a significant percentage of homes in the same quarter in which we sell them. So there is some reflection of the current market in our closings each quarter, but our overall guidance has really built the longer-term. We\u2019re going to fluctuate around 20%, some quarters we may be higher than that, some quarters we may not.","Dan M. Oppenheim \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thanks. So our next question today is coming from Mike Roxland form Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Michael A. Roxland \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much. Is there anyway to quantify how much incentives have increased versus earlier in the year 2013?","Jessica Hansen","Mike, we really look at it in terms of the impact on our gross margin. and so the biggest impact we\u2019ve seen from incentives so far in 2014 would be this quarter, with the 90 basis points, there are also some cost increases associated with those 90 basis points, but for the most part, that is incentives. So we\u2019ll continue to see how that falls out, that we really just to try to talk about it in terms of how it impacts our gross margin.","Michael A. Roxland \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. and then just when you look at the entire housing complex, what would say is the biggest limiting factor preventing more robust housing recoveries, credit is an employment, is the labor availability constraining the ability of builders to construct homes?","Donald J. Tomnitz","It\u2019s the biggest impediment of the housing industry continues to be job growth. and I still say that we continue to create a lot of temporary jobs and part-time jobs, and my comment is, is that part-time workers are now looking for a house, or looking for a full-time job. so I think combined the major thing that we can do to help the housing industry and all industries is to create permanent jobs and better paying jobs. and secondly to have a consumer confidence level where people can wake up in the morning, feel good about what\u2019s going on in the economy and then the rights, so those two factors continue to drive our business more than anything else, but jobs, jobs, jobs is what grows our industry.","Michael A. Roxland \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. our next question is coming from Stephen East from ISI Group. please proceed with your question.","Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Thanks. good morning, guys. you talked about the gross margin expectations et cetera moving back to 20 \u2013 and I assume the global warming, maturity of that is going to be in your core D.R. Horton product. but if you look at express, where you are today with its volumes, where would you expect that the sort of run through over the next two or three years, and how much of that would be driving this move back down to a 20% gross margin?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, we\u2019re underwriting as Jessica said earlier in the conference call, we\u2019re underwriting our express, as well as our D.R. Horton are at 20% gross margin, I\u2019d say 20% return, which then basically employs that are turning in our inventory couple times a year, but our gross margin as we said would be less than the 20% level. Yes.","Jessica Hansen","And Steven, so what you\u2019re actually seeing so far, I would say is better than expected margins on express, and they are trending relatively close to that 20% range, just high of that that made change as we go forward, because as we said multiple times throughout the call, we are focused first and foremost on that 20% ROI. And if we\u2019re turning to inventory quick enough, as Don said, we can work for a little bit less gross margins. but in terms of our gross margin, a guidance, which really, isn\u2019t guidance, but in terms of it being around that 20% that\u2019s just a combination of our day-to-day business and isn\u2019t really an expectation of Express, becoming a bigger piece of our business. It will become a bigger piece of our business, but we think we can run all three brands combined and put out somewhere around a 20% gross margin over the long-term.","Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay.","Donald J. Tomnitz","You asked about how big it could be. we haven\u2019t put necessarily specific targets on how big it could be. We\u2019re still on the very early stages. we do expect substantial growth in Express and Emerald, that we expected to grow as well, but we haven\u2019t necessarily put a specific target as far as percentage of the business, and really different times in the cycle, different economic conditions, the percentages of the business may fluctuate about. but clearly, right now, we expect substantial growth from where we are today.","Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay.","Bill W. Wheat","As Jessica said right now, our Express is running about 20% gross margin, even though it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re underwriting it for less, but we think that will probably decline some over the years.","Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Sure, got you. and then different subject, if you just look at the order progression through the quarter, we got noised the June absorptions much lower than the prior two months is better as one \u2013 what your progression looks like, did you see that in just any color on July.","Jessica Hansen","And really just on July what we said on that call, that we\u2019re continuing to see year-over-year improvement in our July sales. And so I\u2019d say we\u2019re pleased just like we were in Q2 thus far we\u2019re not finished with July, but we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019ve seen.","Bill W. Wheat","And really we saw strong steady sales pace really throughout all three months of the quarter, typically when you get into June you start to see a little bit of seasonal slowdown, but we didn\u2019t see very much. So, overall now we will still see good, consistent demand all three months.","Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you our question today is coming from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo Securities. Please, proceed with your question.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks. My question, I recognize this is all done at community level, but if you look at the company wide average how was \u2013 how are the absorptions now, relative to the budgets, and employment is getting added there, you think there is further need to tweak some things to get things going or do you have the pace where you want it.","David V. Auld","Adam its David, what I\u2019ve experienced out in the field for 25 years is that nothing drives margins higher than consistent absorption. And we are right now operating pretty much on our budget on a community by community basis without anything unusual from a concession standpoint than what would be at historical norm. And part of look we believe as we drive consistent absorption in these communities we will be able to maximize margin, not continue to or see a deterioration of margin. And right now we are getting consistent absorptions throughout our communities.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And then totally different topic, the Crown acquisition \u2013 Atlanta seem like a market in the past a lot of big builders had shied away from \u2013 I think the new general criticism of it had been the segmentation of it. So, could you talk about what you saw on that opportunity and really what you liked about it?","David V. Auld","We liked about that opportunity was a geographic footprint within the Atlanta market itself that, we weren\u2019t serving well that grounded in very good job of serving with the very efficient platform, great team of people, very happy to have those on as part of our organization. And Atlanta is a very large housing market in the country. It will, it is on the rebound and permits growing there. Job growth has been good in Atlanta. And we are seeing very good demand in a broad range of the submarkets around Atlanta.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And frankly their operating metrics as well as the just our style of operation reminded us so much of our formative days. And D.R. Horton the company and we are operating with very little capital and having do rolling option contracts and turning our inventory more quickly. And so we think that we\u2019ll able to take what they are doing now and transition that over into some of our other operations were perhaps, we\u2019re not as entrepreneurially oriented as we use to be or they are. So, great learning experience for us and they protested where well on our Division President meeting that we have in April. And already began the transfer ideas from them to us and from us to them.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you and our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleaveland Research Company. Please, precede your few questions.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","Thanks. Two things first of all I\u2019m curios if you could give us some sense of breadth and depth of where that is and the trend that we should expect moving forward obviously you stepped up effectively this quarter. But I\u2019m trying to figure it are you at a level now that you feel is effective enough or do you see a need to continue to increase the amount of that breadth of the incentive efforts.","Bill W. Wheat","Well if you take a look at our net sales orders having increased 32% in value and our backlog having increased 26% in value. We believe, we\u2019re at a really sweet spot. And we don\u2019t see the real need to increase it significant over where it is today. And a matter of fact we might be able to decrease at some because obviously, we have industry leading sales increases, closing increases and backlog increases. So, we are far head of our competition at this stage.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And at the same time, its very difficult to make general comments about it. We can talk overall \u2013 overall we are very pleased with where we are and we are hitting our expectations, but it\u2019s really managed community-by-community. So there will be communities where we can led off on incentives and raised prices and improved margin, that will be others \u2013 where we will have to increase. But, in general the overall results of what we done collectively across all our communities. We are pleased with the pace that we\u2019re at, and overall wouldn\u2019t expect to have to increase it from here.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","Great, and then just within that \u2013 I know you commented that a component of those incentives were invested for the completions in this current quarter that would have showed up in these financials. I just trying to get sense of how much the incentive investment would have shown in the gross margin in this current quarter versus how much is yet to show in the closings that will come in the coming quarter?","Jessica Hansen","Sure, Eric. That 33% of the homes we sold this quarter were actually close to this quarter as well. So, I kind of said that backwards. That sold and closed in the same quarter was 33%, of our closing.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","And then the second question interested in the strategic thinking at this point in a cycle with land purchases and how you are thinking about \u2013 the desire the demand to add more land to inventory I know that you continue to be active there. But how are you thinking about that in terms of the magnitude and if the type of land that you are acquiring and that\u2019s changing at all.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, as we said on the conference call, the vast majority of our spend was associated with just replacing lots, that we have rolled through roll off over the course of the past two quarters to three quarters, and rest of those actually on land development spend which was on developing loss that we had already purchased the land on. So, we believe again, we have a total of 178,000 \u2013 175,000 total lots and that\u2019s about a 4 point \u2013 eight or nine year supply based upon on our trailing 12 month sales. So, we feel like that, we are in a very, very strong position that we are not out there in marketplace today, paying higher price for land, that we\u2019ve got a great land inventory as we said quarter-after-quarter, with that very, very low cost basis in it. So, we are being very conservative on that land purchasing right now.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Good morning, all.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Good morning.","Kenneth Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","So, pretty exciting quarter here. You guys result obviously on a company basis reflect your initiatives whether it's Express or the numerous acquisitions. Yet I wonder if you have an adjective an early one, Don, for 15 given. I think income lack of income is a big and that\u2019s missing this time but if you're looking at 20% gross margin I heard it a lot longer-term. Can you talk about how you're responding and if Bill I know you are doing it community by community, but I think that \u2013 markets like Sacramento and Phoenix were new sales are down rising existing inventory those are once distressed markets could you talk about what's happening there from your perspective and contrast that with the new home sales number today that had the South obviously Texas is a big number in there, where you're having down sales there which obviously you are having job growth and income growth. So you do you really view that market more as supply constraint and could you contrasted with the distressed market please. Thank you.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, first of all I\u2019m going to state\u2026","Kenneth Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","That was first question\u2026","David V. Auld","","And I\u2019m going to answer the way I\u2019ve been answering here for the last quarter or actually the last four or five quarters. I do not want to get into specific markets and talk about the strength or weaknesses in the individual market, and yes I read the same things about Sacramento and Phoenix and those different markets and we are experiencing pretty much what everybody else is experiencing in those markets. So they are both difficult markets.","Donald J. Tomnitz","But clearly in Texas, when you look at our south central region in the sales we\u2019re reporting clearly we are not down in Texas, clearly we are up substantially in our sales in Texas. So we would be \u2013 that would be gaining market share for us in Texas.","Jessica Hansen","","We haven\u2019t had time to actually look at the new home sales numbers and they came out the minute our call started. That being said, Ken I mean we are battled a lot of times when we see it, because it doesn\u2019t necessarily look the same as what we are seeing in our internal results for those period.","Kenneth Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Okay, that\u2019s fair and I do understand it\u2019s just there is obviously several different markets occurring. How about this then? Given what you\u2019ve talked about and I appreciate the sequential breakdown in gross margin. With price flattening cost going up generically it\u2019s all pace. Can you talk about the spread this quarter and last quarter relative to units closed from backlog versus spec units with you guys drive a lot of volume through? Thank you.","Donald J. Tomnitz","","Spec versus build jobs as we\u2019ve said in the last couple of quarters. We\u2019re getting closer to our normal spread we\u2019re a little bit lower margins on specs and than build jobs, but the gap is still higher then it has been over the long-term. So really no concerning trends there.","Jessica Hansen","","And same thing as usual for us Ken, that about 80% of the homes we closed this quarter were spec. So, when you see our reported gross margin that is essentially our spec gross margin.","Donald J. Tomnitz","","I don\u2019t want anyone to get confused, we\u2019re trying to explain to you what the historical gross margins have been in the industry 18% to 22%. And we\u2019re not saying our margins are going to 20% whatever, we\u2019re just basically trying to set a reasonable expectation out there right now. Because we believe that pricing has moderated over the last probably nine months to 12 months. Costs are definitely increasing as our subcontractors and our vendors continue to try to raise their prices given where they had to take their prices so low during the downturn. So, we\u2019re finding increasing prices with moderating increases in sales prices and we believe that the norm as Bill said earlier, we are going to gravitate back to a more normal level, certainly 2013 was not a normal level in terms of gross margins, and land supply, and cost and everything else. So, we believe it\u2019s going to gravitate back to a more traditional level, which is 20% gross margins.","Bill W. Wheat","The level will not gravitate back, that will increase is our return on inventory. Return on investment will increase and that is if you want to measure the progress of our strategy and how we execute our business, watch our increasing returns on investment quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter over the next couple of years because our plan is for that to increase steadily. And we believe that returns are much more important to our overall performance and helping the company then one element on the P&L then gross margin is returns.","Kenneth Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.","James McCanless \u2013 Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","","Good morning, everyone. First question I have with this focus on a 20% community level of return is that means that the 10,000 specs, this quarter is probably the top for the cycle?","Donald J. Tomnitz","","We are not called anything on cycle. But clearly we drive, as Jessica, said 80% of our closing come from spec. So clearly we prepare for a volume level and our spec are an indicator of what our expectations are. But we don\u2019t believe we are at a peak of cycle at all. We are just out there competing in the market and responding market by market.","David V. Auld","As a matter of fact we strongly believe the market will gradually grow and perhaps in a year or two grow even faster simply because the part of the market that's underserved and largely it's underserved because of the ASP is the entry-level buyer, and also the mortgage underwriting standards are still high relative to where they have been in the past. I expect mortgage underwriting standards to moderate hopefully not back to the level they were back end in 2004, 2005 and 2006 that we believe that the underwriting standards will be moderated some and by virtue of us being able to offer Express homes, 156,000 current ASP and if we get any relief on the mortgage underwriting, we think the home building business is ready to take off especially as it applies to the entry-level buyer.","James McCanless \u2013 Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","That kind of \u2013 into my second question, because I think this is to disconnect all those we are trying to get to because from the outside looking and right now you guys are cutting back on you land spending, you are increasingly pushing out your absorption to try to push them up even on land that may not be in the best markets right now, but then you are coming back and saying that you think that there is growth ahead for the homebuilding industry. I mean is that plus this change in language from the last conference call to this conference call where you are talking much more about return on the inventory rather than stable gross margins that you discussed last quarter. There is a disconnect there that I think we are all trying to figure out what changed from the last conference call to now?","Bill W. Wheat","","Hey, Jay. On your land \u2013 comment about land we are not decreasing our land investment, we are maintaining what we believe is that adequate substantial land investment around 179,000 lots owned and controlled, 125,000 lots owned. So we are replacing, we bought early in the cycle, we believe that that level will support double-digit growth on the top line, which is still our expectation. We\u2019ve always been focused on return, we\u2019ve always been focused on balancing our volume and our pricing to optimize our returns. As we move through the spring and we\u2019ve adjusted incentives the gross margin line has adjusted, but at the same time we believe that\u2019s more than balanced by our increase in volume. And so we are not pulling back, there is really been no shift from that perspective which essentially delivering stronger returns on the investments we\u2019ve made.","Michael Murray","And I said earlier in the conference call and I said this for three of four quarters on a row, we\u2019ve made really, really good land buys early in the market, we\u2019ve about 4.7 year supply of random lots today and we\u2019ve got about a 2.4 year supply of finished lots today all based up on a trailing 12-month sales space of about 27,000 units. So we think that it\u2019s incredibly strong statement to say that we don\u2019t have to be forcing ourselves on the land side like some of our competitors are and having to go out and buy a land today. We got adequate lands at great cost basis. As far the return side of the business, we have looked at our business upside down and sidewise and there is one thing that we\u2019ve concluded.","We concluded the good gross margin as a good thing, but if you are only generating one net sale for subdivision with a 25% gross margin, that\u2019s not nearly as well as generating a 16% gross margin with return of sales for month in the subdivision. So our focus is on how do we improve our return on inventory because that\u2019s the bottom line, that\u2019s the best way we can increase our share holder value is that by consistently receiving a solid return on inventory, not necessarily having an arbitrary gross margin levels that has a very low return on it.","James McCanless \u2013 Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the explanation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to \u2013 I wanted to kind of dig into the incentive question here a little bit as well. When your folks were thinking about this back in March, looking ahead to this quarter, I wanted to get understanding of what you were seeing on the ground that led to change in your thinking at this point, because obviously demand has been slow for about a year ago. If you think about incentives, they can lower price. and I think you made it up very well, and clearly, very successful with the amount of order growth you\u2019ve got.","If affordability is stretched, then the incentives of reducing price can obviously spur some sales. if you have skittish buyers, then offering incentives can probably bring them in, just diverting traffic from competitors more from the resale market. so what were you seeing in the ground thinking about in that those terms that led you to the correct conclusion that if we increase our incentives a little bit, we will be able to generate such a significant increase in sales like you did?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Let\u2019s go back to one thing that really drove our incentives, and a lot of those have to deal with David Auld, coming up here and spending some time, analyzing where we were and what we were doing. But he is known for years that we needed to hit the absorption level that we have projected when we funded a land deal and we have been reluctant and sometimes reticent to drive those absorptions at that level they were projected to be, because we\u2019re trying to hold to a specific gross margin.","And we\u2019ve included that having a specific gross margin in the subdivision and not being to able to turn our inventory as frequently as we need to is not exactly the most optimum return on our money. so what really drove our incentives, not necessarily the market, not necessarily what we saw in the market, what drove our incentives was we are committed to hitting our absorptions and we believe by hitting our absorptions that we can deliver a higher return on inventory and a better return for investors. so that\u2019s what drove our incentives.","Jessica Hansen","And so Nishu, whatever that takes on a community-by-community basis, it will let to it is what it is, because we\u2019re going to do what we need to do to hit that targeted ROI.","Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No, I understand all that. and your folks of the Express did pretty well. What I was trying to ask is to, like something even from buyer perspective, if it\u2019s a \u2013 if it\u2019s more of a unique luxury community than affordability is probably not the constraint. so an incentive doesn\u2019t work, but if it\u2019s an entry-level community, where there are four competitor communities, or they are distressed properties perhaps to look at our single family homes for rent and incentive makes it more affordable maybe, it gives the person more confidence. So I was trying to understand what you saw in the ground from a buyer behavior perspective, clearly made the right call, because your volumes increased so much. so I was trying to understand from a little bit of a different angle?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I\u2019m not so sure that I agree with your comments that it doesn\u2019t \u2013 the incentives don\u2019t drive the high ends, as much as at both the low end, because I can say as we were selling Emerald homes, or even our normal D. R. Horton, someone coming in and looking at the $289,000 average sales price home, or a $655,000 average sales price Emerald home. They are looking for the best deal, and so as a result, incentives do drive that into the market as well as driving incentives us on the low end of the market.","Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. The 20% return on inventory that you\u2019ve been mentioning in the return on capital, I was wondering if you could \u2013 it sounds like you are describing the internal metric and the external metric. So I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more detail on that, the return on inventory, the 20% is that like the divisional metric that\u2019s \u2013 are you asking the divisional managers to focus on what\u2019s in that and then that kind of corporate level metric, how are you defining that?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, it is at our division level it\u2019s on an annual basis, is the pretax income that division generates, divided by the average inventory balance. And just to give you where we are currently today, we are sitting at around 13.5%, that is our run rate on our internal ROI and so that target is to get that our guys get our divisions up to 20% or better. On a company wide level, return on invested capital, obviously that\u2019s a very well calculation obviously to the extend that we do a better job internally with our guys at ROI, our return on invested capital will be better for the company, which you can just as easily simply look at return on inventory for us, look at pretax income divided by our average inventory for the company as well and it would be pretty similar.","Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Yes, I was wondering if you could talk about what kind of earnings growth do you think the double-digit revenue growth that you mentioned will translate in?","Bill W. Wheat","Well, we would hope to grow our profits faster than our revenue pace. And as we generate returns, faster returns, faster cash flows that we could redeploy into the business faster than we\u2019ve been able to in the past, then we would expect that earnings growth to be able to continue to grow faster.","Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay. So just a follow-up on that is the main driver of that earning growth is going to be lower SG&A then because the gross margin relative to where it\u2019s been is declining?","Bill W. Wheat","I\u2019m sorry you cutout just a little bit there.","Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Sorry, just to follow-up is the main driver of getting to that faster than the double-digit revenue growth in earning is the main driver are going to be lower SG&A since the gross margin is a headwind going forward?","Bill W. Wheat","There would certainly be some leverage there as well, but as you turn your inventory faster and redeploy, redeploy it faster than there is simply more capital available on an ongoing basis to generate growth and profits over the long-term. This is a long-term measurement that you could be looking at.","Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay, are you willing to comment on what you would expect for operating and free cash flow in the fourth quarter?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, we don\u2019t make specific quarter comments on that, but it can be volatility on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but what we would comment on as we expect our operating cash flow metric to continue to improve here, and out returns to continue to improve. And our goal is to get to a point where we are both growing the company, growing revenues at double-digit pace while improving our returns in and getting to a positive cash flow position.","Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","And just to follow-up, do you think the fourth quarter operating and free cash flow are likely to be positive. In other words more cash flow generated from home sales then to replenish inventory","Bill W. Wheat","Again, we\u2019re not going to comment on one quarter of cash flows, but it's certainly possible, but it's that we\u2019re not going to comment on one quarter cash flows measures. Specifically our goal is in fiscal year 2015, free cash flow and have free cash flow at an increasing amount and every fiscal year there after as our long-term goal.","Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","And just a clarification on the 20% gross margin is that inclusive of the purchase accounting charges for the next three quarters or that\u2019s before that.","Bill W. Wheat","","Yes, inclusive.","Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you, our next question is comes from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hey, good morning. Good ASP performance you are hitting tough comps in the back half of the year. What's your thoughts on pricing, how should we think of ASP performance going forward.","Bill W. Wheat","Stable to slightly improvement in general. Again we\u2019re in a \u2013 what we believe is a relative stable environment is going to depend on geographic mix and product mix obviously but we're not seeing dramatic price decreases and also we would expect relatively stable environment","","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Would you quantify that as mid single-digit, high single-digit or low single-digit?","Jessica Hansen","That\u2019s a hard one Bob just because we have three different product types now in terms of our brands and we don\u2019t know what the market\u2019s going to deliver, so we\u2019re going to stay we\u2019re just similar to slightly up.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Cool. Understood. 13.5% on the way to 20% what it your mind just for trajectory for that to happen what has to fall into place to close the gap? Thanks","Donald J. Tomnitz","We need to continue to hit our unit absorptions on a week by week basis and each subdivision and that's the best way \u2013 currently as ramp 13% to 14% our goal is 20% and that will probably take two or three year time period for us to achieve that but it's hitting those of absorption net per week per subdivision on a consistent basis as David said.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Hi, guys I apologize for the late question going over a quick clarification I just want to be sure that they were clear that the order count the 25% growth in the order count reported. Does that include the 431 homes acquired from Crown in the quarter?","","Donald J. Tomnitz","","No not. Their opening backlog is not included in the 25% order growth.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Any of those sales from Crown included in the 25% I guess\u2026","Donald J. Tomnitz","The sales we made post the acquisition to the end of the quarter 296 sales I believe we\u2019re included in that 25% order growth.","","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","","Okay, but otherwise it\u2019s clean. Okay, and what was the community count X the Crown acquisition or, the active community count.","Jessica Hansen","","We were up 7% on year-over-year basis without Crown.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Krapfel from Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","James Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar Inc.","","Hi, thanks for taking my question. How much were cost per square foot up in the quarter.","Jessica Hansen","Our cost per square foot were up year-over-year I have that somewhere. Sorry 8.3%.","James Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar Inc.","Okay, and then what\u2019s your forward outlook on labor do you expect some moderation and labor inflation there and then also in terms of land. To look out maybe two years based on where you underwritten plan holding all else how much would you expect there to be gross margin decrement just from that the higher price land going to cost itself. Thanks.","Jessica Hansen","","Right now we are seeing more of an impact I\u2019d say on the labor side and our land still continues to be a benefit because we were early movers and in terms of our stick and brick costs we are seeing some pressure on the material side. But more so on the labor side its specifically in those local markets where we\u2019ve seen pretty good growth in volumes.","Donald J. Tomnitz","We think we moderate our labor costs as clearly were 40% larger and the second builder and we believe those kinds of volumes are going to help control our costs much better that our competition.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joel Locker from, FBN Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Joel T. Locker \u2013 FBN Securities, Inc.","Hi guys. Just a commenting on the community count if you include Crown just at the quarter end what was your community count up year-over-year third quarter last year and then sequentially also.","Jessica Hansen","Sure, Joel. We were up about 11% including Crown and sequentially we were flat.","Joel T. Locker \u2013 FBN Securities, Inc.","You are flat? And that was, that was the quarter and community count not the average community count?","Jessica Hansen","We will talk about in terms of our average and just to give a good representation and let me correct myself with Crown sequentially we are up 4%.","Joel T.

Tomnitz","Thank you.","Alex Barr\u00f3n \u2013 Housing Research Center","Wanted to ask you I guess if you could kind of spec little bit more, you are rationale for doing acquisitions at this point in time and how view them I guess in the future do you think the industry needs more consolidation that be more rationale?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, frankly the way we have \u2013 Mike speaks specifically as to the acquisitions but generally speaking we are looking for builders who fit well within our business model who have a very efficient operations and also some people who \u2013 we can learn something from and just because we are the largest builder doesn\u2019t \u2013 obviously we don\u2019t have all the answers and lot of these entrepreneurial builders that Mike Murray is been working with truly have some unique ideas or certainly some ideas to remind us of the way we used to be.","So as a result, I think that we are looking at been supplementing our existing markets on a number of situations and continuing to grow our market share in each of these markets as we continue to grow our market share in each one of our markets like we are in Atlanta, we get better cost and both on the labor side as well as on the material side and most importantly on the land side going forward.","Bill W. Wheat","Sorry, Alex, we have a, we look builder by builder at different opportunities and look for different geographies different customer segments and were different capabilities to add to our existing platform, looking all the time for a good cultural fit. There is no set recipe or formula for what works and the motivation of the sellers also a big factor in whether we\u2019ll we have the successful transaction or not. But it\u2019s not something were driven or compel to do.

In addition to Jessica, I am pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding third quarter. Our pre-tax income increased to $334 million on $3 billion of revenues, and our pre-tax margin improved 330 basis points to 11.3%. Our sales absorptions continue to improved during the quarter, as our homes sold increased by 22% from a year-ago on only a slight increase in active selling communities. This reflects strong performance in our core D.R. Horton communities and growth of our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands, which are enable us to expand our product offerings and our industry leading market share.","Our continued strategic focus is to leverage our operating platform to produce double-digit growth in both revenue and pretax profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing our returns.","During the third quarter, we generated $357 million positive cash flow from operations. With a sales backlog of 12,761 homes at the end of June. Solid sales trends in July and a well-stocked supply of land, plots and homes, we are well positioned to finish our year strong and have an even stronger 2016. Mike?","Mike Murray","Net income for the third quarter increased 96% to $221 million or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to $113 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 94% to $334 million in the third quarter, compared to $172 million in the year-ago quarter. And home building pre-tax income increased 90% to $302 million compared to $159 million in the prior year quarter.","Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 37% to $2.9 billion on 9,856 homes closed, up from $2.1 billion on 7,676 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $290,000, up 7% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in our average sales price per square foot and to a lesser extent of larger average home size. Bill?","Bill Wheat","The value of our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 25% from the year-ago quarter just $3 billion. And homes sold increased 22% to 10,398 homes on 1% increase in active selling communities. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter increased 3% to $289,400.","The calculation rate for the third quarter was 22% compared to 24% in the year-ago quarter. The value of our backlog increased 15% from a year-ago to $3.7 billion with an average sales price per home of $293,400 and homes in backlog increased 12% to 12,761 homes.","Our backlog conversion rate for the third quarter was 81%. We expect our fourth quarter backlog conversion rate to be in the range of 81% to 84%, up from 76% in the fourth quarter of last year. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","We are experiencing strong growth in revenues and profitability in our D.R. Horton branded communities, which accounted for the substantial majority of our sales and closings this quarter. We also continued to be pleased with the progress and performance of our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands. Emerald Homes our brand for higher-end move-up and luxury communities is now available in 46 markets across 18 states. In the third quarter, homes price greater than $500,000 accounted for 16% of our home sales revenue and 7% of our homes closed.","Our Express homes brand, which is targeted at the true entry-level buyer, focused primarily on affordability, is currently being offered in 44 markets and 14 states with the significant majority of our Express sales and closings to-date coming from Texas, Florida, and the Carolina. This quarter Express accounted for 19% of our homes sold, 16% of homes closed and 10% of home sales revenue. The average closing price in an Express Home in the third quarter was $188,000.","We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our operating markets with all three of our brands and we plan to maintain consistent broad diversity in our product offerings over the long-term. Bill?","Bill Wheat","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 19.9%, up 20 basis points from the second quarter. The consistency in our gross margin in the first three quarters of the year reflects the stability of most of our markets today and the normalization of housing market conditions we have seen over the last year. We are raising price or reducing incentives when possible in communities where we are achieving our target absorptions and we are working to control cost increases. These factors have enabled our gross margins to stabilize within our normal historical range.","Our general gross margin expectations remain unchanged from what we have shared the past several quarters. In the current housing environment, we continue to expect our average home sales gross margin to generally be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix and the relative impact of warranty and interest costs. As a reminder our reported gross margins include all of our interest costs.","For the upcoming fourth quarter, we expect our home sales gross margin will be consistent with our margins for the first three quarters of the year in the high 19s to 20%. Mike?","Mike Murray","Homebuilding SG&A expense for the quarter was $258 million, compared to $222 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of home building revenues our SG&A improved 160 basis points to 9% compared to 10.6% in the prior year quarter as our significant revenue increased this quarter improved our leverage of fixed overhead cost. Based on our projected backlog conversion we expect our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 8.7% to 8.9% which would be a year-over-year improvement of 100 to 120 basis points, we are very pleased that our homebuilding SG&A in fiscal 2015, will be below our longstanding targeted 10% and we believe we will further improve our SG&A leverage in fiscal 2016. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Financial services pre-tax income in the third quarter increased 140% to $31.7 million, from $13.2 million in the year-ago quarter. 88% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operation. FHA and VA loans accounted for 49% of the mortgage company's volume compared to 43% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company in this quarter had an average FICO score of 716 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. Mike?","Mike Murray","At the end of June, we had 21,200 homes in inventory, of which 1,600 were models, 9,400 were spec homes in all stages of construction and 3,600 of these specs were completed. Our construction in progress and finished homes inventory decreased by $100 million during the quarter, while our number of homes in inventory remains relatively stable. Our completed specs declined by 12% during the quarter.","Our third quarter investments in lots, land and development totaled $575 million, of which $311 million was to replenish finished lots and land while $264 million was for land development. Our residential land and lot inventory increased by $82.5 million during the quarter. David?","David Auld","At June 30, 2015 our lot portfolio consisted of 120,000 owned lots with an additional 54,000 lots controlled through option contracts. 65,000 of our lots were finished, of which 32,000 are owned and 33,000 are options. Our 174,000 were total loan lots owned and controlled provide us a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market, with a sufficient lot supply to supports strong growth in sales and closings in future periods.","Although our housing inventories will fluctuate if we manage each of our communities to optimized returns, we expect our land and lot inventories to remain relatively stable during the remainder of 2015 and in 2016, which will allow continued positive cash flow from operations.","In the third quarter, we generated $357 million of positive cash flow. For the nine month period ended June, we generated $189 million an improvement of $762 million from the same period in the prior year. Bill?","Bill Wheat","During the third quarter we recorded $3.7 million in land options charges for write-offs of earnest money deposits and due diligence costs for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded $11.7 million of inventory impairment charges, of which $7.4 million were in our West region primarily related to a long-held inactive land parcels that we intend to sell to improve our returns by redeploying the capital into more productive assets. Our inactive land held for development of $235 million at the end of the quarter represents 12,800 lots, down 25% from a year-ago.","We continue to formulate our operating plans to work through each of our remaining inactive land parcels, to improve cash flows and returns and we expect that our land held for development will continue to decline. We also will continue to evaluate our inactive land parcels for potential impairment which may result in additional impairment charges in future periods, but the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate as they have in the past. Mike?","Mike Murray","During the quarter, we acquired the homebuilding operations at Pacific Ridge Homes for $70.9 million of cash, of which $2 million was paid subsequent to quarter end. Pacific Ridge operates in Seattle, Washington. We acquired approximately 90 homes in inventory, 350 lots as well as control of approximately 400 additional lots through option contracts. We also acquired a sales order backlog of 42 homes valued at $18.7 million. Bill?","Bill Wheat","At June 30, our homebuilding liquidity included $767 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $881 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility. We had no cash borrowings and $94.3 million of letters of credit outstanding on the revolver. Our gross homebuilding leverage ratio was 37.5% and our homebuilding leverage ratio net of cash was 31.6%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at June 30 was $3.3 billion. We have no debt maturities for the remainder of fiscal 2015 and we have a total of $543 million of senior note maturities in the next 12 months.","At June 30, our shareholders equity balance was $5.6 billion and book value per share was $15.35, up 13% from a year-ago. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect our number of homes closed to approximate the beginning backlog conversion rate in the range of 81% to 84% and then average sales price in the range of $285,000 to $290,000. We anticipate our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter will be consistent with the first three quarters of the year in the high 19s to 20% subject to potential fluctuations from product mix, warranty and interest costs. We expect our fourth quarter homebuilding SG&A to be in the range of 8.7% to 8.9% of homebuilding revenues.","We estimate that our fourth quarter financial services operating margins will be in the range of 35% to 40%. We expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter to be between 35% and 36% and our fourth quarter diluted share count to be approximately 371 million shares.","Our projected revenues and profitability for the full year of fiscal 2015 are inline with the expectations we\u2019ve been communicating since the beginning of our fiscal year. Our expectations are based on today\u2019s housing market conditions. Our current preliminary expectations for fiscal 2016 also our consolidated revenues to grow by approximately 10% to 15% and for our consolidated pre-tax margin to be in the range of 10.5% to 11%.","We also expect to generate positive cash flow from operations of approximately $300 million to $500 million for the full fiscal year which we expect these primarily towards debt maturity. We anticipate our tax rate for fiscal 2016 will be between 35% and 36% and then our diluted share count next year will increase by approximately 1%. David?","David Auld","In closing our third quarter growth in sales, closings and profits is a result of the strength of our operating platform and we are excited about the opportunities ahead. With the expectations Jessica shared for the fourth quarter \u2013 we believe our closings for the full year of 2015 will increase by approximately 27% representing an increase of 8,000 homes.","And land right in the middle of the range outlined in the start of the year of around 36,500 homes. We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits at a double-digit pace for generating positive cash flows and increasing our returns.","We are well positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our D.R. Horton, Emerald and Express brands. Attractive finished lot and land positions and most importantly our tremendous team across country.","We made considerable progress this year toward our goal of producing sustainable positive cash flow from operations. While still growing the business, we generated $189 million of cash in the first nine months of the year, an improvement of $762 million from the same period of 2014. We expect continued positive cash flow in 2016.","We\u2019d like to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work. In my opinion, the best of the industry. Now go forth and finish the year strong. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will host any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Zener","Good morning, everybody.","Mike Murray","Good morning.","David Auld","Good morning, Ken.","Jessica Hansen","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zener","David, you talked about FY16. You didn't have to go there, no one even asked you. Can you walk us through the process of why you wanted to do that now? Your revenue top line of 10% to 15%, what type of community count does that involve or absorption or just talk about how you kind of get there and the confidence around your EBIT given a very strong fourth quarter SG&A guidance? Kind of a broad question, but take what you want.","David Auld","Well, right, Ken. No, I guess I\u2019m excited because I think we just delivered a great quarter. But I think the positioning we did or have done over the last 12, 18 months, has set us up for a good run. And we just see general solid markets across the country nothings exploding but everything seems to be getting a little better on the month to month, quarter to quarter basis. And a waiver position and what we\u2019re focused on right now and what we\u2019ve accomplished leveraging the SG&A and just controlling cost I think it sets us up to containing what we\u2019ve been doing.","Jessica Hansen","On the community count front Ken, the 10% to 15% consolidated revenue growth that\u2019s really mainly driven by volume coupled with a little bit of price and in terms of community count we would expected to be low maybe top out mid-single digit growth. So the majority of that revenue growth is coming from further improvement in our absorptions. And we\u2019re not guiding to the 20% to 30% of next year like we did this year. So we don\u2019t have to expand our absorptions quite as dramatically as we did in fiscal 2015, but still very confident that we can drive further absorption improvement as we move throughout 2016.","Ken Zener","Very helpful. Now, because you had such strong pricing momentum year-over-year, you have been right about six. It sounds like you do not expect your successful mix shift towards Express to result in price degradation, realizing there is different mix, pricing mix there, between your different products. You said positive price, correct?","David Auld","I think it kind of flat to moderate price improvement, yes, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen thus for. We came into the year expecting relatively flat pricing due and part due to the expectations of mix shift to Express and while Express that certainly grown shortly as a percentage of our business that impact has been offset by price appreciation and to the extent we continue to see current market conditions as we move into 2016, hopefully that will continue.","Ken Zener","Thank you, very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Kim","Yes, thanks very much, guys. Very encouraging to see your land spend being very disciplined. It is something that I certainly applaud what you are doing there and I think it is going to be very interesting. So I guess my first question would be, with respect to, if you can continue to generate this kind of cash, you have already said this year, you're looking to do, applying it to the paydown, what should we expect going forward in 2016? I know that in the past there has been some talk about your wanting to run at a much lower level of leverage than you have in the past but I also know there's been a little bit of conversation about that, shall we say, at the corporate office. So I was wondering where your thoughts are right now in terms of where that is going to be in 2016?","David Auld","A very opportunistic, excuse me. We\u2019re going to spend $2 billion plus just replacing what we deliver as we consistently generate and prove at a sustainable. It\u2019s going to give us a lot of opportunity, I guess we\u2019ll sure that when we get there.","Jessica Hansen","And just to clarify Stephen the comments towards debt reduction were specific to fiscal 2016. We have $543 million in maturities in the next 12 months. So that would be what we expect in fiscal 2016 and then when we\u2019re looking further out we\u2019ll have more commentary to share later. But as David said opportunistic.","Stephen Kim","Got it, okay, that\u2019s helpful. That will continue to watch that. My next question I guess relates to Express. You know obviously, good success over there. We have observed that your average price within Express has been rising, pretty meaningful I think it was up 19% this quarter and it\u2019s been kind of accelerating there. I was curious if you get sort of share little bit about what is going on there I imagine some of that maybe just geographic mix shift. But perhaps or something additional going on there where you \u2013 in terms of the kind of buyer that you are seeing come out for your profit \u2013 just if could share some thoughts there?","Mike Murray","Steve, this is Mike. Most of what we\u2019re seeing with the Express price changes is mix shift as we\u2019ve introduce it to more markets that have the higher bar for the industry level buyer. We\u2019re seeing the result of those come through in the closing.","Stephen Kim","Okay.","David Auld","Pretty much the same thing.","Mike Murray","Level of buyer, buying the Express product.","Stephen Kim","Got it. And in terms of where the markets are that you\u2019re going to. What should we be thinking about that?","Mike Murray","Most of it \u2013 where you\u2019re seeing the impact in this quarter\u2019s ASP has been closing from \u2013 the state of Florida. Great success in Florida introducing Express over the past year and we\u2019re starting to see a greater proportion of the Express closings coming from Florida with the higher sales prices.","Jessica Hansen","We\u2019re still about 80% of what we\u2019re doing in Express is Texas, Florida and the Carolina and the sizes in that order for those states in terms of percentage contribution. And we\u2019re opening that in a lot of other places, but the vast majority of Express sales and closing to-date are in those three states.","Stephen Kim","All right, thanks very much guys.","David Auld","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen East","Thank you. Good morning, guys. When you in your prepared remarks, I think everybody believes your volume growth is coming from express myself included, but it sounded like more of this was coming from your core Horton brand. Is that a fair representation of what's going on and could you talk about maybe the trends within the three products and where the gross margins breakout in the three products?","Bill Wheat","Yes, Steve, this is Bill. We\u2019re seeing growth really across all of our brands a solid growth, solid demand across all of our brands and actually with the roll out of Express being introduced into more and more markets. It is growing as a percentage of our overall business, as we introduced the product in more markets, but just when we look at all three brands, we\u2019re seeing solid, solid growth across all three.","In terms of relative gross margins as we\u2019ve kind of sale all along our expectations and what we\u2019ve seen is the Express comes in a little bit below our average margin for the company, but we\u2019ve been encouraged by the margins that we\u2019ve been able to generate in Express and then our expectations for our Emerald, our higher end product is that it will generate a bit higher gross margin than the average, but our return expectations are the same across all brands.","Stephen East","Okay. And then geographically you talk some about Florida in the rollout, is that what really drove that market that was the Express rollout and could you talk some about Texas, what you are seeing any impact with energy in Houston that type of thing.","David Auld","The Florida market in general is just getting better really across all three brands. The rollout which impacted for pricing mix on this Express was \u2013 initially launched we launched in Central Florida middle part of the state much more price competitive then, we\u2019re introducing the product later which is kind of Southeast, Southwest. So you are just seeing a lift from those two various which I think it is a part of the overall increase in pricing in Express. But now state of Florida we feel very good about that.","Stephen East","And then you mentioned Texas, we are seeing solid demand across Texas, Texas is so extremely strong for us and we saw, essentially our South Central region is largely Texas, and so we are very pleased with the performance across the state of Texas.","Stephen East","Okay, North Houston dynamics going on right now with oil.","Mike Murray","Certainly we continue to watch Houston on a year-over-year basis, Houston sales were basically flat, saw higher average prices this year than last year in Houston, but clearly the Dallas market continues to be extremely strong, San Antonio seems to be picking up for us a bit, and Houston continues to be solid for us as well.","Stephen East","All right.","Mike Murray","We definitely watching Houston, but we\u2019re just still be at the level it is, it\u2019s still encouraging.","Stephen East","Okay, thanks.","David Auld","We grew very fast in Houston for about three or four years, so kind of a flat year-over-year this year, it is actually?","Stephen East","It take the replenishing community count in that market, is that a problem, with land pricing moving up?","David Auld","We were very well positioned in Houston 2012, 2013, and the community counts in Houston again are very well positioned.","Bill Wheat","We are still opening communities, we\u2019ve been preparing the open for the last year, year and a half.","Stephen East","Okay.","David Auld","The prices mixed actions and so.","Stephen East","Got you. All right, thanks.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Nishu Sood","Thanks, first question I wanted to ask, you mentioned solid sales trends continuing into July, there has been some concern obviously with rates rising whether some threats to consumer confidence, so I was wondering if you could just take down into that a little bit and you now how things look to from the end of the Spring selling season into the Summer and just your thoughts if any of those specific concerns if you have any perspective on whether or not that \u2013 those have affected your trends or not?","David Auld","Well, if we get up everyday, thinking about sales, so yes, if we\u2019re up 30% we\u2019re concerned, we are not up 50, we\u2019re up 20 we are concerned, we are not up 30. That\u2019s just the nature of our journey. But we travel in the markets down, moving this right now driving sales divisions. And the general field across pretty much every market is it\u2019s a little better today than it was last year. And there is a confidence in our operators, there is a confidence in our sales, in our model homes, traffic is steady. So it\u2019s been a slow recovery, but consistent and it just seems to continuing, so we feel good about that.","Nishu Sood","Got it. So would be fair to say then it sounds like the momentum that we\u2019ve seen so far this year as persisted into the summer.","David Auld","Correct.","Nishu Sood","Got it, great. Okay. And I wanted to also ask about the cash flow very impressive cash flow performance this quarter. I think you guided to $300 million to $500 million if I got the number correctly for next year and fourth quarter, your next quarter is typically pretty big cash flow quarter as well. Your guidance implied that share count will ride so no share buybacks in your debt paydown. My question was with cash flow so strong, your with your net debt to cap fairly low against the kind of typical to start building norm of 40% to 45%.","Have you given any thought to allocating some to share a purchases because we\u2019re based on what you implying you can have a strong book value growth, you get a paydown quite a bit of debt I mean you are going to continue to delever and you are going to be pretty far below that historic norm. So what your thoughts on share buyback saying a little more balanced about reallocating that cash.","Mike Murray","Yes, Nishu. We\u2019re pleased to be in a positive cash flow position. We\u2019ve been focused on achieving this. And we\u2019re feel like we\u2019re in a position now to continue to generate sustainable positive cash flow. And we\u2019re going to take a balanced approach to it. We will always look first to our business to invest in the business and be opportunistic there to the extent that we can generate returns there and that will include acquisitions as we continue to steadily be in that market. With over $500 million of debt maturities it coming to next year that is a higher priority for us in fiscal 2016.","But then certainly as we get into 2016 and we look beyond that other opportunities will be out there and available for us certainly we\u2019ve continue to be a consistent dividend payer, there is potential with that good increase as our earnings in cash flow continue. And then share repurchases would be one of those items that we would look at in the balance as we are opportunistic and if we see that is a good return and that\u2019s an appropriate use for our cash, it will certainly be considered long side the other things.","Nishu Sood","Got it. So the 1% increase in share count that you are talking about, that\u2019s a general range, but there could be some flexibility around that.","Mike Murray","I think there always been flexibility, as we stand right now with no Express intent of repurchasing shares in 2016, we would expect our share count to rise by about 1%.","Nishu Sood","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Robert Wetenhall from RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Wetenhall","Hey, good morning and a nice job on the quarter. Just wanted to ask on your preliminary 2016 guidance, you are coming in higher than we thought and higher than your pre-tax income margin for 2015. So I\u2019m just try to understand is the way we should think about the 10.5% to 11% range you gave derive from better gross margin performance or is that a SG&A leverage.","Mike Murray","Rob, what we\u2019re seeing we showed in the third quarter its an improved SG&A leverage. Margins were essentially flat throughout this year firmed up nice and stable and we\u2019re seeing some improvement with our absorptions driving up in our communities. We\u2019re seeing improvements in our SG&A leverage falling right to the operating margin improvements we\u2019re seeing. And we fully expect to continue that in the fiscal 2016.","David Auld","Bob, it is David. I continue the general consensus is flat, as we hit these absorption targets and as a market stays steady. I do think there may be a little upside in margin, but we\u2019re going to guide to flat and attempt to do what we say we\u2019re going to do.","Robert Wetenhall","Okay, cool. Those are ambitious targets I hope you get there. I wanted to ask about your average order price is up almost 3% this quarter. And just taking through you know you have easy comp in the fourth quarter, but can you talk just about how you are thinking about the trajectory of pricing given mix. There is some commentary about bigger four plans being a positive to more sales as the entry level product. And I just kind of want to get a hand to one how you think this involves into 2016. Thanks very much and good luck.","Jessica Hansen","So Bob, in terms of further price appreciation we\u2019ll see ASPs one of the hardest things for us to determine we don\u2019t necessarily look at Q4 is an easy comp though we had a very, very strong up last Q4 I think in the high 30s is in reserves. And so to us that\u2019s not an easy comp. But we\u2019re going to continue going out and everyday hitting our targets on a community by community basis and continuing to drive sales improvement and it\u2019s a markets there we\u2019ll get the price. But the markets really going to determine that and from where we sit today with the impact of mix from Express. We would continue to expect our ASP to be flat to slightly up in fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015.","290,000 ASP on deliveries and just shy of that on sales is pretty much in all time record for us. And with the continued mix impact from Express, I don\u2019t think we expect to necessarily move that needle a whole lot further.","Robert Wetenhall","It makes a lot of sense. Good luck, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Bosshard","Thanks. Two questions, in regards to I guess leverage within the business that community count plan and leveraging SG&A. Just interested if strategically you\u2019re thinking differently or having a different level of success in both of these areas. That is one of the factors that\u2019s helping your profitability improve?","David Auld","I think we\u2019ve always \u2013 stressed leverage on the SG&A line and getting as much as we can out of our fixed overhead and so what we\u2019re seeing now is low to single-digit growth in our community counts driving greater absorptions from those communities. And generally we\u2019re probably replacing communities that are closing out with slightly larger communities they\u2019re opening up, allowing us greater opportunities for increased absorptions and better leverage at the community level.","For us this business all happens at the community level. The pace we drive at a given community helps drive improvements in margin efficiencies in the construction processes as well as better leverage of the overhead associated with that community.","Mike Murray","And when we look at SG&A leverage to the extend that we drive a good part of our volume growth from increased absorptions. In existing communities that drives even more SG&A leverage than driving growth from community count increases. So our focus there on improving absorptions is definitely a big driver for our SG&A leverage and as we look at it \u2013 going forward we believe we got more opportunities to improve it.","Eric Bosshard","And if I could one follow-up on gross margin after couple years of progress kind of step down it sounds like stable to \u2013 slightly favorable may be gross margin outlook. Just talk a little bit about the moving pieces you\u2019re seeing within gross margin now and as we project forward over the next 12 or 18 months?","Jessica Hansen","On a year-over-year basis Eric, we continue to face headwinds. Particularly on laboring materials and to a lesser extent lands but sequentially those trends have been getting better. Which is what you\u2019ve seen in the stability in our gross margin and sequentially as we\u2019ve moved throughout this year. So our gap is between our revenue increased per square foot and our cost increased per square foot this quarter. With the best we\u2019ve seen in quite some time, our revenues per square foot were up 4.1% year-over-year, while our stick and brick cost we\u2019re still slightly higher than that, but at 5.3%. So that 120 bps different is one of the narrower we had over the last year, year and a half. And to a lesser extend \u2013 as expected we\u2019re starting to see on a year-over-year basis slightly higher land cost on a per square footage basis as well. But I think we feel really good about \u2013 moving into 2016, especially with the trends we\u2019ve seen sequentially. And hopefully we can see it benefit next year. You know it\u2019s only July, so we\u2019re not going to go out on a whole lot of wins yet, as far as gross margins concerned in 2016. But we feel very good about remaining stable and if we can move it up or we\u2019re going to move it up.","Eric Bosshard","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Dahl","Hi, thank you. Couple of follow-up questions. First on the discussion around Houston, I wanted to ask if you could give a little more of a breakdown on what you are seeing across price points obviously some other builders have talked about some weakness at the higher end or mid-to-high end. And so what are you seeing across the different brands. Is this really still just being driven by express and then also if the overall orders flat, what is the community count like in Houston year-over-year.","David Auld","Our community count is roughly a similar to what it would have been a year-ago. Yes, I think in general we\u2019ve heard commentary from other builders as well. We don\u2019t have a huge presence at the high end. We have a few communities at the higher end in Houston. And so I\u2019m not sure where a good proxy necessarily there. But we have clearly continued to see very strong reception at the entry level and first time move up level, so in our for express and Horton brands and that\u2019s really where the core of our business is in Houston.","Michael Dahl","And along that\u2026","David Auld","We are hopeful to get relatively well.","Mike Murray","We\u2019re very happy with Houston.","Michael Dahl","Okay. So on a \u2013 I guess on a positive note then it\u2019s a pretty strong trends in the Southwest. And then so wondering how much that\u2019s being driven by Phoenix or Vegas and what's the absorption trends in those markets specifically.","David Auld","I hope we\u2019re seeing out there a pretty much Arizona Phoenix is picking up a little bit, seeing some good sales trend there, but coming up a pretty small base. So it shows us a large percentage, but the prior year numbers where fairly small. Las Vegas is actually in our West region. So it\u2019s not impacting our Southwest numbers at all.","Michael Dahl","Got it, okay, thanks.","David Auld","We just like Phoenix for us has been a very good market in the past on a leading in the company. And I have every belief that it will be again. We\u2019re seeing life in Phoenix and glad to see it.","Michael Dahl","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Rehaut","Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone and nice quarter. First question, I had was just going back to the SG&A for a moment. Obviously great improvement there, and better than expected. It looks like the full year will be around 9.6 instead of 9.9 to 10.2 your previous guidance. Just tying to get a sense of perhaps what are the drivers of that leverage or was there any type of cost take outs that, that you are able to exact as you kind of moved into back half of the year. And again, just confirming in terms of 2016, the pre-tax margin improvement all effectively at this point you expect to be driven by SG&A as well?","David Auld","SG&A will definitely be a big part of the driver of the improvement in our operating margin next year, probably the primary driver, at least as we sit here today in July. SG&A there is a lot of factors that go in there, and there is a lot of focus that we spend in the company on it. We talk a little bit earlier with our improved absorptions in our existing communities that\u2019s clearly a driver of SG&A leverages we\u2019re not having to add the incremental cost with additional community counts. But also I would attribute to some of our focus on being more efficient with our inventory investments in our housing investments trying to improve our turns there. That clearly drives more SG&A leverage. That you will see our specs counts are little bit lower then where they have been here recently, and that cuts out some SG&A cost as well.","And I would say there is a just a general focus on the company that as we grow, while we continue \u2013 have to continue to add overhead to support that growth in our expected growth. There is a discipline that I think is in place across organization to make sure that we keep our overhead in line with where our businesses and that we don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves there. I just \u2013 there is probably a bit of caution with adding of additional overhead, that I think we are now seeing some very good leverage from as we grow right.","Michael Rehaut","I mean just looking little bit past next year, when you think about you are at 9.6 this year, if most of the improvement is going to be driven by SG&A next year. Because I believe correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but David I think you pointed to an outlook our expectation for gross margins to be flattish, that would put you at a SG&A closer to 9% and that\u2019s essentially the best type of level you did. In company history hit it low 9s in 2004 and 2005 and so. As you think around that 9% mark, is that something that you can actually improve from and what I\u2019m really getting at here is \u2013 there is structural difference and how you\u2019re running the business that can allow for SG&A to get into the 8s as you progress into mid-cycle or just any thoughts around that?","David Auld","Mike, at this point in July, we are not going to guiding to a 9% SG&A in fiscal 2016 as of yet, but clearly, if we expect to improve from where we are this year. We would expect to get below 9.5 and into the low 9s next year and we have achieved 9.0 before in the past. So it\u2019s not all the realm of possibility. We are focused on just continuing to incrementally improve, incrementally leverage it. And we do believe that if we are able to continue to drive growth for multiple years beyond 2016 that we can continue to drive incremental SG&A leverage beyond that and could that result in us getting below 9 at some point in the future beyond 2016 that certainly possible. But I think that is a little bit of a longer potential.","Jessica Hansen","And our 10.5% to 11% that we guided to for 2016 was a consolidated margin. So we could potentially have some upside on our financial services business as well. We see as we move throughout the year and we\u2019ll have more color to share.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. So just lastly then if I\u2019m understanding it right, a little bit of the improvement you\u2019re expecting from gross margin expansion, or is it going to be closer to more stable-ish?","David Auld","We\u2019ve operated this year in the high 19s, 19.7 and 19.9 about first three quarters. We consistently say we expect our margin to be around 20. So if we come in around 20 that next year, that would be a slight improvement in our gross margin from this year.","Michael Rehaut","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Susan Maklari from UBS. Please proceed with your question","Susan Maklari","Good morning.","David Auld","Good morning, Susan.","Mike Murray","Good morning.","Susan Maklari","In terms of your specs, you noted that they were down about 12% during this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about that even it such a big part of your strategy and if there is any change there that we should be aware of?","David Auld","We saw our competed specs go down by 12% during the quarter, which is a pretty seasonal movement for us through the spring selling season, as we\u2019re selling those homes that we build and had inventory available for our customers. But specs as you said are always have been a big part of our business. We\u2019re very comfortable building speculative homes, and we think it opens up a new buyer to us that we wouldn\u2019t have before just building homes for the customers.","Mike Murray","No real change in our strategy there. We\u2019re tying to operate as efficiently as we can and so our expect percentage is a little lower than perhaps you\u2019ve seen in the times in the past, but really there is no change in strategy at all.","Susan Maklari","Okay, perfect. And then can you just give us an update on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the mortgage market. It sounds like things are kind of continuing to maybe incrementally improve there, but what do you think?","Jessica Hansen","Probably exactly what you just said, Sue. To us, the mortgage environment is okay. Assuming a buyer has decent credit and has a little bit of money to put down which isn\u2019t unreasonable for somebody buying a house. Buyers can get credit today. So we\u2019re seeing plenty of traffic come in and that can qualify. Our cancellation rate has settled out into the low 20s and that still the main reason people do cancel. They can\u2019t qualify for the mortgage. But that low 20s rate is not unusually high or something we\u2019re uncomfortable with. And we haven\u2019t seen much in the way of change, but I do think you continue to just see very gradual incremental loosening. That probably at least all signs point right now that will continue. I don\u2019t think we expect any broad movements in the market to really open the flood gates again. But just continued improvement in components then more buyers coming out and feeling better about their ability to qualify. And whether the standards have actually changed or not. I think we would point to as more of a positive over the past year. Then the actual mortgage standards themselves.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko from SAG. Please proceed with your question.","Jack Micenko","Hi, good morning. Your FHA, VA mix picked up pretty significantly year-to-year, is that price cut driven or is that more or some of the expansion you seeing on the VA side, just curious what's driving that.","Jessica Hansen","Yes, Jack. It\u2019s not a pickup on the VA side or VA was pretty much flat. So I think what you are seeing is an impact from the pricing getting more favorable on FHA coupled with a higher share of express. And coming through our closings which is a higher FHA percentage than our reporting in Emerald buyers.","Jack Micenko","Okay. And then just looking back I guess the last couple of months, as the 97 GSE return had any impact on demand any of you.","Jessica Hansen","No.","Jack Micenko","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Jade Rahmani","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to first, if you could provide a comment on the land market where you are seeing overall and where there is a still good opportunities to invest.","Mike Murray","I would say yes, we\u2019re still seeing good opportunities overall. I mean even replacing we\u2019ve \u2013 just replacing what we use we\u2019re going to spend $2 billion plus this year. We\u2019re discipline, we\u2019re basically underwriting it to two-year cash back program generating a certain level return 20 % and if we can get it in that box and its buy for us. I can tell you we\u2019re seeing deals we\u2019re getting it done.","Bill Wheat","No shortage of deals out there available.","Jade Rahmani","Okay. And then just regarding the SG&A outlook in terms of employee retention and yes, sustaining the growth rate in topline, what do you see as the risk of having to sort of reaccelerate the amount of dollars been SG&A spent.","David Auld","The SG&A savings are being driven by revenue increases and efficiencies gained in the operation. This is not a cut employee program. In fact, some of our highest paid people are in some of our lowest SG&A divisions. And it\u2019s because of the revenue driven and the efficiencies they operate with. So it really comes down to driving sales or flag per month. If you look at our 8,000 additional closings this year on a relatively flat community count that 290,000 per ASP, per average sales price and that\u2019s driving a tremendous amount of revenue out of the same store sales. So this is not a \u2013 this model is protecting employees, not put them in risk.","Jade Rahmani","Thanks. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Will Randow from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Will Randow","Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my question.","Mike Murray","Thank you.","David Auld","Hey, Bill.","Will Randow","I\u2019m just kind of thinking about in the past you\u2019ve talked about return on inventory on your, your loss supply is down, I\u2019ll call it close to \u2013 a little under four-year supply. Looking forward to the fourth quarter and looks like inventory growth is slowing down especially with land held for development coming of the balance sheet. Where the opportunities to improve \u2013 I guess, returns on asset as well as how do you think about leverage in that context for ROE?","Bill Wheat","Yes, Will. This is Bill. Yes, return just clearly the focus on our end our strategy, its balancing our inventory investments and trying to get the right balance of volume and absorptions compared to pricing and margins profitability to drive the best return in each one of our inventory investments and we\u2019ve been saying for a while. We feel like our land supply was that a sufficient level or our owned land supply was sufficient. And so we\u2019re maintaining that at around the same level. We own about 120,000 lots today. And we\u2019ve been essentially in the range of 120 to 125 or so for two years. That\u2019s still a sufficient level for our current volume and we expected that it will support continued strong double-digit growth for the remainder 2015 and in the 2016. And with our growth and improvement profitability with a more stable land supply that\u2019s improving our returns and we expect to continue to drives some more from that.","Jessica Hansen","If you look at our homebuilding ROI on a trailing 12 months. It\u2019s actually up 100 basis points as compared to fiscal 2014 and we would expect to continue to make further progress on that in Q4 in fiscal 2016.","Will Randow","And I guess as a follow-up is a land bank in market there it\u2019s used to run 50\/50 I\u2019ll call it control versus owned in order to improve ROI. And also on the leverage front, do you think about you should be running closer to group medium leverage to hit kind of the group or total of the better ROE?","Mike Murray","With regard to your first question on the optioning of land and lots, we are working continually to increase our controlled lot position and trying to get back more to the 50\/50 balance. That is exactly where we have been in the past and that's where we\u2019re striving to get to today. That helps us greatly with the return on our invested inventory. With regard to the ROE, as Bill mentioned before our initial use of the cash that we\u2019re looking for in 2016 are handling - the $540 million of debt maturities that we have next year. As well as continual opportunistic investments in the business, whether that\u2019s land and lots deal by deal or whether that\u2019s continued acquisitions as we look to consolidate mortgage and open up the new products and new customers to us. With that great opportunities \u2013 in front of us with the cash flow and we\u2019re always monitoring \u2013 the leverage ratio and looking at what we feel is appropriate for where we are in the given cycle and the opportunity that are there.","Will Randow","Thanks guys and congrats on the quarter.","David Auld","Thank you.","Jessica Hansen","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. A bit of a bigger picture question I guess. And that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve seen multi-family as a bigger percentage of total start for a while now. I\u2019m curious whether you see that as secular or cyclical. How was that all might be impacting you in some of your markets, even if \u2013 indirectly presumably. And whether in forms that all in any of your medium to longer-term decision making?","David Auld","You know on multi-family something that we look where the demand is in each market and we build some multi-family and it\u2019s not a big percentage of our business at all and so we really look at that market by market, I don\u2019t see that being a major driver of our business going forward. But in certain market it\u2019s only a bigger percentage of business.","Mark Weintraub","And \u2013 I guess that - when you think about growth for the single-family business. Are you \u2013 of the view that we\u2019re going to catch back up to prior compositions multi-family and single-family. Which would presumably you have it extra engine of growth from that change in mix or you to view we\u2019re probably going to stay at these higher levels of multi-family for a while, at a national level recognizing that you have your own individual markets, obviously have a single-family?","Jessica Hansen","Mark, I\u2019m sure we really have a view. I mean our focus is primarily on single-family and we\u2019re not too worried \u2013 where that split is going to fall out going forward. Our goal everyday is to go out and increase our market share and each of the market we currently operate in. And so we\u2019re going to gain as much of the single-family market as we can.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alex Barron from Housing Research Center. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Barron","Hey, good morning, guys. Good job on the quarter. I wanted to ask about the outlook for 2016 and towards community count. Are you guys seeing one of the brands growing more than the other or they all is your outlook pretty much the same across the board, in other words are you seeing more demand or more investment going into the express versus the other brands or not.","David Auld","No, not, not really pushing money towards a brand, we\u2019re allocating money based up on the returns coming out of the markets and then coming out of the underwriting individual projects. As we continue to open the express brand end markets then it\u2019s growing of a slower platform. So its going to show percentage higher growth. Our goal is grow every brand, every market, every year.","Alex Barron","Okay. And I don\u2019t know if I missed it or you didn\u2019t mention it. But you gave us the percentage of home sold for Express. But I don\u2019t think you gave it for emerald, you just said closings and revenues.","Jessica Hansen","Sorry. Alex, we\u2019re looking for that. That\u2019s going to be included in our supplementary data that we will post to the website right after that call.","Alex Barron","Okay. That just for this quarter or you are going to go back a few quarters also?","Jessica Hansen","No. Our supplementary data that\u2019s out on our investor relations site has on trailing eight quarters from its all of the data it may only have one or two shy of that for the brands just because of the brands are newer than that. But a pretty much has our entire history from a brands perspective.","Alex Barron","Okay, great, thank you.","David Auld","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James and Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Buck Horne","Hey, thanks guys. I appreciate for the opportunity here. Most of my questions are answered, but I want to go back to just a clarification on Pacific Ridge, the acquisition there. Did any of the reported order totals this quarter include Pacific Ridge backlog and would you expect any sort of purchase accounting drag from the acquisition this quarter?","Mike Murray","It was a relatively small acquisition to the size of overall closings I would not expected a big purchase accounting drag from Pacific Ridge at all. It contributed, we have 40 closings, 41 closings in the quarter for Pacific Ridge, largely that will come out of the opening backlog and then 25 net new sales within the quarter from Pacific Ridge.","Jessica Hansen","And but we did not add on their backlog to our reported sales for the quarter. So our sales number for the quarter was pure Horton with our other brands inclusive of the 25 sales that Mike just mentioned.","Buck Horne","That\u2019s perfect. Okay, and my last question, just going back to the express home division and just, I think one things we are trying to wrestle with, what\u2019s the credit profile of that buyer today in terms, whether it\u2019s the FICO score or the average down payment they are able to put down on the home. New home sales under the $200,000 price points are still kind of looking a National number still the weakest of all the category. But yes you guys are taking any credible amount of share and I\u2019m just kind of wondering, to what extend you can share either the secret sauce or how deep do you think that buyer pool really is?","Jessica Hansen","Sure, in terms of the mortgages, I can give you some idea of, what that looks like for those buyers that are utilizing our mortgage company. And in a FICO score is really quite strong as well and it\u2019s close to 700 on average for our Express buyers, the loan to value isn\u2019t that for off from our company average, it\u2019s slightly higher which was to be expected with our higher percentage of FHA loans being used. The debt to income is right inline with the average for our overall company and then obviously the loan amount is a little bit lower, just because of the lower average sales price. So I think we still really, really good about the depth in the market for that buyer and continue to prove it with the strength in the sales we\u2019re seeing across all the places that we\u2019ve open that","Buck Horne","Thank you, very much","Mike Murray","Thank you.","Jessica Hansen","Thanks, Buck","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.","David Auld","Thank you, Kevin. We just want everybody to know, we appreciate your time on the call today. I want to tell our employees that they are in fact the best in the industry, I appreciate what you do everyday. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.

It is now pleasure to introduce your host, Donald Tomnitz, President and CEO for D.R. Horton. Thank you, Mr. Tomnitz. You may begin.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you and good morning. Joining me this morning are Bill Wheat, Executive Vice President and CFO; Stacey Dwyer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer; and Mike Murray, Senior Vice President. As usual, before we get started, Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Some comments made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities and Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there's no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the day of this conference call, and D.R.

Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","The spring selling season is in full swing, especially for D.R. Horton. Demand for homes has strengthened and the relative available housing supply has shrunk which has created a favorable pricing environment. Our first-time buyer demand remains very strong, and we continue to see improving demand for our move up buyers. We are well positioned to meet the increasing demand across our broad geographic footprint, with our inventory of homes available for sale and with the land and lot position we have accumulated over the past 3 to 4 years.","Our team of operators across the country delivered an outstanding second quarter. They generated significant sales and revenue growth along with substantial improvements in profit margins and returns, which resulted in our pretax income more than tripling last year's levels. Overall, the first half of fiscal year 2013 was nothing short of phenomenal, and we expect the second half to be even better. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","In the second quarter, our consolidated pretax income increased 236% to $142.1 million from $42.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Our pretax income, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, was 9.9%, an increase of 550 basis points from 4.4% in the prior year quarter, reflecting significant improvement in both our homebuilding and financial services operations. Compared to the year-ago quarter, homebuilding pretax income increased to $127.4 million from $34.6 million, and financial services pretax income increased to $14.7 million from $7.7 million.","Net income for the second quarter increased 173% to $111 million or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $40.6 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Our net income for the quarter included a noncash tax benefit of $18.7 million from a reduction of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset. Mike?","Mike Murray","Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 47% to $1.4 billion on 5,643 homes closed, up from $930.6 million on 4,240 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $242,500, up 10% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by pricing power and, to a lesser extent, by a larger average home size. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","The value of our net sales orders increased 52% from last year due to increased volume and home prices. Our net sales orders increased 34% to 7,879 homes, on a 15% increase in active selling communities. Our average sales price on net sales orders of $253,400 increased 14% compared to the year-ago quarter. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 19%, compared with the 22% in the year-ago quarter.","The value of our backlog increased 76% from a year ago to $2.4 billion, with an average sales price per home of $249,800. Homes in backlog increased 54% from the prior year to  9,553 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the quarter was 77%, compared to 94% in the prior year quarter. We expect this rate to continue to revert closer to historical seasonal norms. For the third quarter, we expect our conversion rate to be in the low 70% range. We have continued to see a solid sales pace . Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the second quarter was 20.4%, up 280 basis points from the year-ago period. 210 basis points of the margin increase was due to improving market conditions, resulting in reduced incentives and higher average selling prices, in excess of cost increases. 40 basis points of the margin was due to lower amortized interest and property taxes, and 30 basis points was due to lower estimated costs for warranty and construction defect claims, add the percentage of home sales revenue. Sequentially, our gross margin on home sales revenue improved 160 basis points, of which 30 basis points was due to improving market conditions. The additional 130 basis points of the increase was due to lower relative cost for warranty and construction defect claims, as a percentage of home sales revenue, with approximately 40 basis points of the 130, due to a higher level of cash reimbursements of previously incurred litigation cost received during this quarter, as compared to our Q1. We expect to see continued improvement in our home sales gross margin from improving market conditions for the rest of the year. For the third quarter, we expect a home sales gross margin of approximately 20%. Mike?","Mike Murray","Homebuilding SG&A expense for the quarter was $155.1 million compared to $127.5 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A improved to 240 basis points to 11.2% from 13.6%. We are leveraging our fixed cost structure, while at the same time, building our sales and production capabilities, where necessary, to meet our increasing demand. We expect our SG&A, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, to be below 11% for the remainder of the fiscal year. The improvements in our gross profit and SG&A percentages, and the decrease in our direct interest expense, expanded our homebuilding pretax margin to an industry-leading 9.2% in the current quarter, an increase of 550 basis points from 3.7% in the year-ago quarter. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Financial services pretax income for the quarter was $14.7 million compared to $7.7 million in the year-ago quarter. 86% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter, related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. Our mortgage company handled the financing for 58% of our homebuyers this quarter, with virtually all loans meeting eligibility requirements for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. FHA and VA loans accounted for 49% of our mortgage company's volume this quarter, down from 57% in the year-ago quarter. Our mortgage company's new borrowers, during the quarter, had an average FICO score of 723 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 90%. First-time homebuyers represented 47% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter, compared to 49% in the year-ago quarter. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","At March 31, after considering the impact of our improving profits, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize more of our deferred tax assets from state net operating loss carryforwards before they expire than we previously anticipated. As a result, we reduced our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by $18.7 million in the quarter, which reduced our income tax expense this quarter. Mike?","Mike Murray","Since December, our construction in progress and finished homes inventory increased by approximately $207 million. We had 15,800 homes in inventory at the end of March, up 1,600 homes from last quarter and up 4,700 homes from a year ago. As of March 31, 1,200 of our homes were models, 7,600 were speculative homes and 2,300 of the specs were completed. We expect to continue to increase our homes in inventory to meet demand, and we expect our average community count for the remainder of the fiscal year to remain 10% to 15% higher than last year. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","In our second fiscal quarter, our investments in lots, land and development cost totaled $460 million, as we continue to find new communities and build our lost supply to meet increasing demand. Of the $460 million, $217 million was used to purchase finished lots, $110 million was to purchase land and $133 million was for land development cost. We expect our development spending will increase over the next few quarters. At March 31, 2013, we control approximately 175,000 lots, of which 120,000 are owned and 55,000 are optioned. 30,000 of our owned lots and 28,000 of our optioned lots are finished. The 58,000 total finished lots we control at quarter end are up 23% from a year ago. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Our total available liquidity, at March 31, was $1.7 billion, which included homebuilding unrestricted cash of $1.1 billion and available capacity on our revolving credit facility of $559 million. The balance of our public notes outstanding, at March 31, was $3 billion, and we had no cash borrowings on our revolver. $172 million of our notes mature in May 2013, and we have a total of $317 million of senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At March 31, our homebuilding leverage ratio, net of cash, was 33.7%, and our gross homebuilding leverage was 44.7%. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","In closing, this quarter was D.R. Horton's most profitable second quarter since 2006 with $142 million of pretax income. All of our operating metrics improved dramatically on a year-over-year basis this quarter. The value of our sales, closings and backlog, increased by 52%, 47% and 76%, respectively. Our pretax income increased 236%. Our pretax income margin increased 550 basis points to 9.9%. Our gross margin on home sales revenues increased 280 basis points. Our SG&A, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, improved 240 basis points. And we are continuing to experience pricing power in many of our markets, as evidenced by a 14% increase in average sales price.","D.R. and I would like to personally thank all of our D.R. Horton teammates. We have accomplished all of this with only a 29% increase in employees year-over-year. Our team is consistently the most efficient in terms of closings per employee. And I'm really pleased to share with you that this quarter, we sold more homes, closed more homes, generated more revenue, earned more PTI and had a higher PTI margin than any other builder. We are in a great position, as a company. We will, clearly, in 2013, be the homes closed, revenue, PTI and PTI percentage leading builder for the year. As used to say, stop for a moment and we should smell the roses for our major accomplishments. We'll get right back to work so we can continue to outperform our competition. D.R. and I thank you for the great work.","This concludes our prepared remarks, and I will host any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Dan Oppenheimer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You're talking about the land investment there, saying that could more in terms of development. There is so much, in terms of the purchases, during the fourth calendar quarter of last year's in tax related sales, I think, that sort of benefit you in the purchasing side. How much do you think of that in terms of just adding more land versus just developing what you currently have?","Donald J. Tomnitz","What we're focused on, clearly, Dan, developing what we have. Obviously, our goal is to bring what we've purchased, especially in the last calendar year, into production. So as we say, built so close homes and make money on those units. We are continuing to add land deals and anticipating, obviously, developing those in markets where the option lots are becoming shorter and shorter in supply. Clearly, based upon the number of option lots that we added to our portfolio, we were able to still find option lots, never finished, and finding, also, developed lots on our on-option basis. But there are markets where we're going to have to supplement the third party developers, as well as the finished option lots, with land that we have to bill for ourselves. And, of course, we've been very adept at that over the years. Given the sales pace we're seeing, the demand we're seeing, the pricing dynamics we're seeing, we would expect to still be investing strongly in finished lots, land and development in the coming quarters, as we have been so far this year.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And in terms of just the margins. I think, you talked about, then doing -- pushing pricing with the average selling price up. How are you sort of -- we've heard lots of different thoughts from -- the course of effects of this week here in terms of the earnings releases from different builders. In terms of the thoughts on pushing a price versus continuing to increase absorption at this point. How are you balancing the 2 right now?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, clearly, you can see that we increased our sales and our closings this quarter dramatically. All the while, we're dramatically improving our margins. We think we're in a wonderful position. There is a shortage of finished homes on the marketplace. So not only with our good inventory of specs that we consistently have maintained in this company, we will continue to push price as well as volume. Clearly we've said before, our goal is, improve the bottom line better than we improve the top line. But nevertheless, we are in a position where we can do both.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Stephen East from ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","To follow on what Dan was talking about on the land side, maybe a little bit more, what are you all seeing in the pricing of land? And are there any markets that it's just very difficult to make land pencil, and then, if you look at your communities that you're opening right now and that you've got open, how many -- what percentage of that is previously mothballed? Or that either you're already in or will be opening?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Actually, I was on the phone with one of our regional presidents this morning, David Auld, and we were talking about how we are very fortunate that we were early mover in terms of finding land positions 1 year ago, and 2 years ago, because our basis in that land, to answer your question directly, is very attractive, relative to where pricing is in land today. Specifically, land prices have escalated in most markets rather dramatically over the last 6 to 12 months. We're very conservative in terms of our approach because we don't need to buy that much new land to support what we see over the next 2 years as our net sales and our net closings. But clearly, land prices have gone up. As far as mothballed assets go, in terms of deliveries on mothballed assets, that still a very small amount of our overall deliveries. But we are, certainly, with the improved pricing environment, improved demand, we are bringing -- starting to bring more mothballed communities into our production. So we will see some impact from that, and that's certainly a very good source of capital for us as we will not have to purchase the land. We'll just have put to the development costs in. You will see that on our balance sheet. Our land held for development balance declined this quarter, down to 602 million as compared to 630 million last quarter. And we would expect to bring even more projects out of mothball over the coming quarters as things continue to improve.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, if we go back to -- you talked about the majority of your pricing was true pricing power, not mix shift. Could you give us a little more color on that? And just what you've are seeing on the cost side? So we can understand what type the magnitude you have on pricing power versus cost inflation?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Certainly, there's cost inflation out there. One of the things that we've been able to do clearly is raise prices faster than what our cost have been going up. To control our cost, both on a national, regional and then also on a division-by-division basis At this point, we are still clearly the largest builder in the clubhouse. And by virtue of that, we have more purchasing power than most of our competitors. And it's been a focus of this company for years to focus on our sticks and brick, which is what we're doing. In terms of specifics on the pricing power versus mix shift, our average selling price per square foot, year-over-year, for this quarter, increased 7.6%. The average square footage of the homes that we closed this quarter increased 3.7% from last year. So that's a mix between pricing and size of the home. In terms of our cost increases, those were up on a per square foot basis, 3.8%, year-over-year. So we still have a very good gap between our selling price increases versus our cost increases.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Michael Roxland from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on a comment you made on the last call regarding California. I know you had some reservations about investing there due to the economy and, really, the fact that there's not been a widespread housing recovery in that state, as compared to some of the other states, how you're involved in -- are you still witnessing those same types of issues that you witnessed in this past quarter? What occurred since then? Because it certainly stands in contrast with some of your peers have been indicating.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, obviously, we're more conservative last quarter in California. But the record speaks for itself this quarter. And California, for us, is doing very well now. We've made some major investments in land and lots over the course of this quarter. And we're well positioned to capitalize on what is turning out to be a better-than-expected California housing recovery.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And do you happen to have a sense of like what's driving the recovery in California? Can you talk to us of some of the specific markets that you're -- within the broader State of California, that are doing well for you?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I'm going to refrain from speaking about any specific markets, again, I promised myself that a couple of years ago. But I would say to you, I think, what is driving -- in the Bay Area, clearly, technology is still driving that market, as well as, what I've understood is there are a lot more money managers in the Bay Area, over the course of the past 2 years, actually, employees managing the money of the technology industry in Northern California. And in Southern California, I think, it's just purely people buying homes because they're more affordable than they have been in a long, long period of time. So there are people who are able to sell their homes for the first time, in a long time. And then they're able to either trade up, and downsize, and capitalize on the potential having more appreciation in a new home versus the existing home that they are currently living in.","Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then just quickly, Don. I know you mentioned briefly in your comments that trends that you've seen thus far in April have persisted. So it sounds like there's really been no change in momentum, so the sales pace has been relatively consistent thus far, in the fiscal third quarter.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The first question I had was on the gross margins. You mentioned that price continues to outpace cost, and the break out of that was very helpful, so thank you for that. At the same time, you're looking at gross margins flat, sequentially, going into the third quarter. And certainly, I understand part of that and perhaps it's with timing of the warranty cost that helped you sequentially this quarter. But at the same time, would it be fair to say, as long as these trends continue that -- and I don't know if 4Q is too premature to talk about. But as we look into next year, that the 20%, at least, for the rest of this year's sustainable, and as long as a trends hold, we could expect some further expansion into fiscal '14?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes, it all comes into what's your in your crystal ball, Mike. If trends continue, if we continue to see double-digit pricing increases, we would expect that margins would continue to increase. But when we're looking at a land deal, we don't factor in future price appreciation into our assumptions in order to justify a land deal. We take a similar approach in our overall expectations in the business. Certainly, if things continue at the pace, we'll see some further improvement. But based on what we see right now.  what's in our backlog? We're comfortable with our guidance for next quarter.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Also, Don, you made an interesting comment at the beginning of the year -- at the beginning of the call, rather, about first-time buyer demand remaining very strong, but move up demand improving. And maybe not to read too much into the exact word, word-by-word, but most of the builders have kind of talked about, over the past year, really, the move up buyer being the strong element, so far, and more waiting for the first-time buyer to come back or demonstrate the same type of strength that the move up has. Then it almost seems like your comments were in reverse, that the first time was more the bed rock remaining very strong and the move up improving. So am I reading that right or interpreting that right? And is the first time better for you guys than maybe you feel some of your peers are? And are you just there for -- but on the move up side, more aggressively addressing that market given the strength there as well?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes, to answer your question. As you know, we have focused on the first-time buyer, for years, at  this company, and we still believe that's the largest component of the home market. And we are priced very competitively in the marketplace and can compete, and we're able to offer buyers who are moving out of apartments and more attractively-priced home, due to our low cost and our volume. So it's natural for us, given our size, to be able to offer a more competitively priced first-time home buyer opportunity for those people moving out of their apartments. And as mentioned to you probably 1.5 years ago, we began a significant focus on the move up buyer, and we are penetrating that market very well. And we expect that part of our business to continue to grow as it has.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great, I appreciate it. One last quick one, if I could. The financial services profit ticked down about $3 million, sequentially, despite homebuilding revenue up and land financial services revenue flat, anything going on there? And how should we think about that in terms of the profitability going forward?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Our financial services segment has slightly different training than the home builder, because a lot of their revenue is recognized when they sell the loans. So at the end of the fourth quarter, our calendar fourth quarter, they have very large mortgage loans held for sale balance, which then they sell during our first quarter and recognize that gain on sale. But that -- their mortgage loans held for sale at the end of the December quarter are lower, and so the amount of gain that they recognized, this quarter, is a little bit lower. It's just a timing difference.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So that could -- drift up a little bit throughout the rest of the year?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Yes, if there's mortgage loans held for sale. It could drift up if market conditions and the margins hold.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about the mix in gross margins? Your ability to build and sell spec homes is, obviously, it helped you absorb a lot of fixed SG&A costs through the bottom. But I think there's still a misconception among investors that spec homes have to be at a lower margin than the homes in backlog. We think it actually can be an area that's giving you upside on gross margins, these  homes that you built in January are locked in backlog at a certain price but, actually, go up as the market goes up? So could you talk about the spread in spec, first backlog, how much that impacted your second quarter results? And if your 20% number is just focused on your backlog margin expectations, as opposed to what might flow through on spec homes?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I'll let Bill handle the second part of that question.","Bill W. Wheat","Frankly, where we are today, we see a shortage of finished new homes in the marketplace. So by virtue of having that specs that we have out there, we have tremendous pricing power on our specs. We have a number of people who are listing their homes. And as one of our people in the legal who runs our environmental for us, he listed a home and had 4 offers in 3 days. So people are listing their homes and selling them a lot more quickly than what they've anticipated. And to the extent that we have spec inventory that we have out there, which has been tradition in this company, then, in essence, we have had significant pricing power in our specs. Our specs used to be slightly less in terms of margin than our build jobs, and that has semi-reversed itself.  Recently we have seen some trends where some spec margins have been higher than pre-sales. We don't expect that would be the long-term trend. But in an environment where we're seeing rising pricing, that certainly can happen. And obviously, with our spec inventory, then that's certainly a benefit to our margins right now.  As a matter of fact, currently, with our sales demand, we're having our spec level is slightly lower than what we preferred to have it because we, as we release it, we're selling more rapidly than we anticipate.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Could you maybe give us a little of context then to -- not necessarily the peak in '05, but what it was doing in '03, '04, what is common a for a spec to be in line with your backlog homes? Or was your backlog tied to some optionality, always a bit higher? If you could give us a context, that would be appreciated.","Bill W. Wheat","Ken, we don't have the specific data on that, from that period. But I would suspect back in a period when there were significant pricing increase, we're probably some seeing a similar trend to what we're seeing right now.","Donald J. Tomnitz","As a matter of fact, back then, we were hoping that people would cane [ph] and we could resell the home for more. We're not in that concurrent situation, but currently, we have adequate number of specs out there to meet the demand. We're trying to increase our specs because we anticipate increasing demand. And to the extent as I said, that we have a home ready for a buyer, who sells her home more quickly than anticipated, it's great position. And please don't forget, realtors are a large percentage of our sales. And realtors like one thing. They love to collect their commission more quickly. So when you have a spec home, they can typically collect their commission within 30 to 45 days, as opposed to if they sell a build job, they're having to wait 3 to 4 months to collect their commission.","Bill W. Wheat","And as we have long said, the key to being successful with specs is to manage them very carefully. And obviously, it's been part of our business model for a long time. So even though we're in a period right now, where we're seeing rising prices, we're still going  stay disciplined and we're going to manage our specs effectively.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Don, I have a big picture question and you've kind of alluded to that some of the answers a little bit, but I want to ask you more concisely, despite the likelihood, I think, that we're probably in the early innings of a multiyear recovery, it looks like, now, you and some of your peers are already starting to generate what you, I think, you would consider normalized margins. And so, to me, there's somewhat of a disconnect there. And so I was wondering what you thought about what that means for the next few years? In terms of already achieving what might be a normal margin well ahead of kind of mid-cycle or normal production levels?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We're not going to argue with having achieve it earlier than we anticipated because it's a beautiful thing, after the last 5 years in our industry. And I thought about what your question is, and not to be negative, but to be realistic, our margin increases have been dramatic, to the extent that we're able to improve our margins as much in the future as what we certainly have done in this past quarter. You'd have to probably question this to whether we could improve them that much on a go-forward basis, quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter. Clearly, as we continue to do the volume that we're doing, I'm so proud of our people because we, clearly, will be the leader in the clubhouse, both on units as well as revenue this year. We are definitely experiencing more purchasing power than our peers. And that's really our goal. Our goal was always been to keep our SG&A as low as possible in this company, but also to be very proactive and controlling our stick and brick costs. And our volume helps us do that dramatically.","Bill W. Wheat","And if you look back over history, through cycles, even though we talk about a normalized margin of want to be a 20% gross, 10% SG&A, 10% on the bottom line. What we have seen, during the up part of the cycle in the past, when pricing has been going up, as we have seen margins above that level. Over the long-term average, it kind of averages out to the 20, but we've certainly seen periods where it's been above the 20. And we're hopeful, if trends continue, that we'll see some of that.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, Bill, interesting point you talk about that above 20, man, looks like, without having perfectly checking that model, looks like those years were really just the exceptions for 2004, '05 and '06. And so, what I'm kind of wondering is, if we think that, that's going to repeat itself, in terms of the margin potential? Or is the goal to be big and the goal to be -- scale your markets and the goal to take market share, going to kind of erase a little bit of that margin potentially or cap it?","Bill W. Wheat","The goal is always to strike the best balance. Scale and volume helps drive some efficiencies, and helps drive some bottom line profitability and margins and returns. But we'll always want to balance that, so I don't think one supersedes the other.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I would say after being in the industry for 33 years, and I'll celebrate my 30th anniversary at Horton in August, 20% and 10% and 10% is pretty much a -- it's a good return. And to the extent that our gross margins are higher than that and our SG&A is lower, I think, to a certain extent, that's largely an anomaly in this business. And you're going to have years where you're going have to do that, and you better pack away the earnings and stick them away for the days when you're going to be back to 16% to 17% margins. So clearly, I think, where we see the business year-after-year-after-year, if we can maintain a 20% gross margin, a 10% SG&A and 10% at the pretax line, that's a beautiful scenario. You take it when it's better, but you don't get too caught up in it.","Stacey H. Dwyer","And we do think this is a period of when it's better, because there is a shortage of supply compared to the current level of the demand on housing. And we alluded earlier, we are seeing land prices increase because there's a shortage of finished lots available to construct the houses. So we've got that inventory. So we think we can take advantage of the current environment and increase our margins, on going forward.","Donald J. Tomnitz","We don't have to go out and buy land at today's prices. To hit any sort of growth targets, we will still reinvest. But we're in a very good position on land. We already own houses that we can build and put in inventory to deliver strong growth and strong margins.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Susan from UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I want to go back and I have a land question, but I want to ask you on a slightly different way. In the sense that as you buy more land that needs to be developed, how does that inhibit your ability to adjust your community count growth? And given that -- maybe not for this year so much but, in terms of thinking about maybe up to 2014 and going forward, how you balance the need to have lots that can be delivered more quickly to be more flexible to community count relative to needing to develop land?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I think, as the market recovers, there'll be a -- another party that enters into the fray, and that will be the third party developer. And so, as a result, in the past, we've always had a good group of third party developers who've had helped us provide lots for our lot inventory. Obviously, with the banks, over the last 5 years, and they're beginning to slightly increase their lending, but we are seeing third party developers qualifying for development loans. So as a result, our existing land development will be augmented by third party developers. And that would continue to increase as the market continues to improve, because as the housing market continues to improve, there's no doubt in my mind that the banks will begin lending once again.","Bill W. Wheat","There is certainly a longer lead time to opening a community when you buy land and have to develop it yourself, versus buying finished lots. But it's a very local decision. And each one of our operators in the local markets understands where their positions are, where their communities need to be replaced and where their accounts make sense to add. And they account for that lead time in planning to buy land and bring it into production at open communities. So it is definitely a difference in timing. But as Don said before, we expect there will be other opportunities, that may not exist work today, for some finished lot developers to be in place to help support our growth as well.","Stacey H. Dwyer","That's one of the reasons we give you our finished lot count and not just our total lot count. Because with 58,000 finished lots we should be able to have ascend time to adjust to demand levels that we're seeing, and react without running out of lots.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I assure you one thing we won't do, we will not run out of lots.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sure. In terms of the third party coming back in, are there any specific markets where you're seeing that maybe take hold more than in other areas?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Susan, I'm just -- I made myself a promise, I'm just not going to get market specific because I -- over the past years, I think, it's benefited our competitors more than it has our analysts. So as a result, you want to follow up with that question with Stacey or with Jessica later, they'll try to help you with that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","On the land spend, what percentage of the option exercises on deals that you tied up in the past?","Bill W. Wheat","Well, any deal where we bought finished lots, it would have been tied up under an option contract. We don't have the aging of when the contracts were signed, though, in terms of the buys or anything like that. But clearly, it's still a substantial portion of our spend was on finished lots.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And the -- are you see if developers increasingly look to build participation into the option deals with their structuring?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I've seen that decrease, firstly, reviewing every land deal in the company, along with Bill and Stacey, we'll tell you that 2 years ago, and even a year ago, we saw a more proper participation from developers than we are today. And I don't know why that is, but we're not seeing very much of it today. And every time we have a chance, we push back on that because we deserve the upside. And so -- but not as much today as what it was 1, 1.5 years ago.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Great. Just wanted to ask on SG&A. Simple question is, how do you look at the growth on SG&A on a year-over-year basis? This quarter's growth was less than half of the revenue growth and do you expect that kind of relationship to continue?","Bill W. Wheat","That's pretty good. Our long-term target on SG&A is 10%. And we're certainly rapidly moving in that direction. And we would expect, if things continue, we will get there. Maybe not quite this year, but we will get there. And as we grow, we certainly have to add infrastructure. We have to add people and as we add new communities, we add expenses. But there have been periods where we've been below 10%, when we've seen a lot of pricing increases. And so we could see a period below 10%, but again, 10% is a long term average. We're still striving to get there.","Stacey H. Dwyer","We're starting to see a very good SG&A leverage toward the back half of last year, so continuing to see the same level of year-over-year improvement of that same ratio, you mentioned, between incremental revenue and SG&A is -- would probably be a little bit aggressive. But we do feel that we are working our way back down toward the 10%, and as we said, we expect to be under 11% for the balance of the year.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And please don't recall, we are the most efficient on the industry. We still close and sell more homes per employee than anyone else. And I'm astounded when I looked at the number for the quarter, when we year-over-year increased our employee count by 29%, but yet our sales closings and backlog values increased 52%, 47% and 76%, respectively. We leveraged our overhead extraordinarily well.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Joel Locker from FBN Securities.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to, I guess, get behind -- you mentioned brokers before, and wanted to see what the participation rate from outside brokers were in the second quarter closing. What that was a year ago, maybe?","Stacey H. Dwyer","We typically run somewhere between about 60% and 70% participation from brokers.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","And has that changed at all or...","Stacey H. Dwyer","Not significantly.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Not significantly. And just on community count, did you guys mention what it was up sequentially into up year-over-year?","Bill W. Wheat","Year-over-year was -- on active selling communities, was up 15%. I don't believe we gave the sequential number. That was ...","Donald J. Tomnitz","5%.","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, up 5% sequentially.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","5%. And just a follow-up on that. How much -- how many communities do you plan to open in the last 2 quarters of 2013? And what are slated to open in 2014, if you have some kind of ballpark figure.","Donald J. Tomnitz","We're planning on opening every community that meets our current underwriting guidelines, which is a combination of gross margin and return on capital. And I don't mean to not answer your question, but we are aggressively pursuing land and lot positions and most -- yes, every one of our markets. And to the extent that our conservative underwriting guidelines are met, we're on the deal. We do expect our selling communities to continue to be up 10% to 15% year-over-year for the remainder of this fiscal year. Past that, it's hard to have perfect visibility on timing of openings and closings.  But just to clarify, we are approaching this upcycle in a totally different manner than we have in my 30 years with this company. And that is, we are adhering very closely to our return of initial investment on any land deal, that we'd get our capital back, our original investment back within 24 months. So some slight exceptions, but our goal is to maintain that hard and fast rule. And we're not having a hard time finding deals to meet those criteria today.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Right. And then the Southwest, that was down 9% year-over-year on orders. Was that a function of just community count declining?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes, the Southwest, I think, we've mentioned the last quarter's call, with the  vast improvement in the Phoenix market last year, our lot supply's a little lower than we would like. So we're working to build that back up. So our sales are reflecting that. But we're also seeing very strong pricing in that region as we rebuild our inventory.","Stacey H. Dwyer","And that's really, Chris, in terms of markets, that's Arizona and New Mexico for us.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko from SI G.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Stacey, going back to the mortgage question. I know you talked about timing and those closings rolling at the revenue recognition and the mortgage. Can you talk about sequential trends and the gain on sales margins in mortgage, and where you think those margins maybe go in the next quarters or so?","Stacey H. Dwyer","We've been in a very robust gain on sale environment. The demand side for the mortgage is where originating has increased. A large portion of our loans have been sold to one buyer for a long period of time. We're now seeing more buyers come in to the market and that is helping with the pricing. We don't know exactly where the margins will go. But it would -- might be a little aggressive to assume that they continue to stay exactly where they are, because this is above any historical margins we've ever ran, in terms of gain on sale.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","But you didn't see a big decline, quarter-to-quarter?","Stacey H. Dwyer","No.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Okay. Right now, if you were investing in mortgages, I can't imagine a better time with the FICO scores, the underwriting guidelines and with low interest rates where they are today, very few prepayment -- early prepayment. So if you're an investor in mortgages, it's a great time to be in the business.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","But not enough banks are doing it. Don, you had talked about -- continued to say and reiterate that you're not changing standards on land purchase side. We've heard some competitors talk about maybe moving in some inflation into their underwriter underwriting. I guess, the mix of almost half your win -- activity in this quarter was finished. Is that a sustainable percentage? And, I mean, going back to the '03, '04 timeframe, I mean, is that a consistent mix, finished versus raw, into sort of more building demand scenarios?","Mike Murray","I think that, that is a more normalized balance for us, about half developed, half -- we internally develop half. We might buy finish from someone else. And over the past few years, it had swung more to us buying finished lots as they were available through the stress and other situations. As we're getting back to a more normalized times, where we're developing more of our own lots. But it's not swinging the pendulum past what we believe to be a historical balance.","Bill W. Wheat","I think that's reflective of our geographic mix. We have a very strong presence in Texas, where there are third party developers, where there are finished lot opportunities really tied up throughout the south. there's a lot more opportunities there. So we typically have seen substantial amount of finished lot purchases in those markets.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I'll tell you, and with our volume in each one of our markets, we're assisting third party developers in terms of them taking their loans from banks because simply of the fact that, one, we have a strong balance sheet. And secondly, we are strong performer. We start the number of specs in each one of our communities. So there are a lot of third party developers who are seeking loans, that look at Horton as a great catalyst to them securing their loan from a bank.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Congratulations on a good quarter. I wanted to...","Donald J. Tomnitz","Congratulations on a good call, timing wise.","I wanted to ask you a question about M&A. In the 1990s cycle, you all were really among the most successful M&A story in the industry. And recently, we've seen a little bit of activity from some of your peers on the M&A side getting into some markets here or there. And, I guess, I was just curious whether or not you felt that it was reasonable to think that D.R. Horton would be able to have M&A be a meaningful part of your growth opportunities over the next, say, 2 to 3 years?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, clearly, and I'll speak for him because he's sitting to my left, but Mike Murray is moved up to 38. He was our Controller and he was promoted to Senior Vice President. And he's in charge of our acquisitions for us. And clearly, if you recall, what was it? 4 months ago, 5 months ago, we've closed on Breland, which was a builder in Mobile and Gulf Port, Mississippi area, as well as Huntsville, Alabama. So he's working deals. We're working deals. And it's our goal to be a participant in the M&A game just as we were in the past upcycle.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's really helpful. Maybe just as a followup to that, can you give us a sense for what may be different about the way you're pursuing those deals, either in terms of the kinds of constraints you'll put, from your end or in terms of what embedded expectations are on the part of the folks on the other side of the table, relative to what you saw in the last cycle? You've indicated a lot of changes in the operations of your business. You just said you're doing things very differently in many ways in this upcycle operationally. Are there other differences on the M&A side as you look at things that are also relevant?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Before Mike gets into the facts, or all the other relationships, let me just say that our acquisition gain, one of the things, that's our preeminent plan, has always been that we are looking for people who will fit within our company and make sure that they blend well with us. And if you look at the people that we inherited from the Breland acquisition, there wasn't much \"Hortonization\" that was necessary, they fit within our organization very well and are performing very well. So that's our first plan. Our second plan is, is to make sure that they fill a hole where we currently need some help. And so I'll let Mike go in with the rest of it.","Mike Murray","And looking at our footprint, perhaps, today, versus where it was last when we went to the last round of M&A that concluded in, really in '02. Our footprint is much more robust today, and so  there's less geographies that we'd be looking to fill in. Doesn't mean there's not places that we're existing today that might be attractive opportunity for us. Situation sometimes is seller motivated. They may have survived the last cycle very well, but they're looking for a way to take some of their capital out of play and a different lifestyle. Perhaps from where they are today. But as Don said, it's the people part, that's got to be first thing. And we are going to be focused on what we believe to be top to our people and, really, good long-term fits for us. I mean, we can grow a lot in laying positions in our markets. But to add some key talent, in key teams and, selectively, in new markets, there's opportunities.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Alex Barron from Housing Research Center.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","I, as you know, have been following you guys for a long time, and I am kind of surprised by your conservatism in your guidance because it seems to me that everything's going on all cylinders. And so I'm just trying to understand if that's all that is behind your SG&A, your backlog conversion and your gross margin guidance?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Are you saying that gross margin guidance is light and our SG&A decreases are light?","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","Well, seems to me that the -- I mean, based on what you have on backlog going for you, and I know that you're not going to grow the SG&A, I mean, you've always watched it, it would seem to me  you're going to get below, way below 11%, in the back half. But anyway...","Donald J. Tomnitz","Let me clearly say it. We didn't say how far below.","We talk clearly, Alex, about the fact that we still see gross margin expansion opportunities in the quarters ahead, especially in the next 3 quarters. And as, obviously, we get more of our closings in the second half of the year than the first half of the year, we see some declines in our SG&A as a percentage of revenue, moving forward. And that clearly, I think, our SG&A percentage in the second half of the year, will clearly be under 11%, and may approach 10% for the third and fourth quarter. But on an average for the year, based upon where we are today, it's not going to be -- it's probably going to be closer to 11%n than it's going to be closer to 10%. But it could be somewhere in between there, clearly.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Yes. And on backlog conversion, the 70% compared to what we had historically done in our third quarter, it's probably about 10% higher. We have seen our spec percentage come down a little bit as our percentage of inventory. So that's one of the things we're weighing. But quite honestly, we haven't been the perfect predictors of what our backlog conversion will be.","Bill W. Wheat","We've known that it would start reverting back to historical norms, but the predicting how quickly and how much, has been a little difficult. But we have seen a slower backlog conversion this year than last year. We expect that to continue to revert, that's within the guidance. Could we do better than 70%? Sure. But historically would say that we could do a little worse than that, too.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And please remember what I said in my prepared remarks, the second half of the year will be substantially better than the first half of the year for us, absolutely.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","Right. So I guess, that kind of wants -- that makes me to ask why. I know you gave historical averages, the 20% gross margin and the 10% SG&A. But why would SG&A stay at 10%? Why couldn't it go below that in the future years, since you guys are obviously getting a lot of scale advantages and, as you pointed out, you don't need to hire that many incremental people to manage the growth in the units?","Donald J. Tomnitz","With all due respect, Alex, we're not focused on where our SG&A is going to be so much in the year, in '14 and '15 is where we are, and the next 2 quarters. So we're just focusing right now on delivering what we can very effectively deliver in the third and fourth quarters. And obviously, you know this organization, you know Don Horton very well. If we get to 10%, Horton will want 9%. And we'll be working on trying to get to 9%. But let's get to 10% first, before we have to make -- before you try to get us committed to where we're going to be in '14 and '15, sorry.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","And if I could just ask on your land strategy. I go out and visit  lot of communities around the country and it seems to me like you guys are the only ones kind of moving out to -- a lot of the first-time -- where the first-time buyers are. Your peers seem to be hesitating, are you finding that the opportunities and returns and the cost of land are more attractive than fighting for the A locations?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, actually, as we come through, as I said earlier in the conference call, Bill, Stacey and I see every deal that comes through the company. And one of us approves it, and I hear and see every deal. I would say to you that we are clearly still seeing a number of great opportunities in A locations. And most of the deals we're approving right now are A locations, based upon our gross margin hurdles as well as our return of initial capital. So I don't believe we're seeing -- I know one thing. We're not doing any C deals. So clearly, we're augmenting our A deals, which the majority of our deals are As, with some B deals, but we've got a high level of A deals coming to the corporation right now.","Bill W. Wheat","There's strong buyer demand in a sub market at margins that meet our hurdles, that's an A deal for us.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Megan McGrath from MKM Partners.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to ask a little bit about pricing and affordability. We've -- you got pricing going up a couple percentage points, but at least according to data this morning, we've got real incomes down about 5%. So obviously, all of that mortgage rates' here, how much wiggle room do you think that you still have on the pricing, especially with your first-time buyer? What are you hearing from your sales folks in terms of how much they can push it in terms of affordability here?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, as we look across the country, frankly, we're selling, more and more, larger plans, as our sales price indicates and our square footage indicates. And frankly, in a number of our markets, we're in the leading the smallest 2 plans, simply because of the fact that we have much better margins than the third largest small plan, and going up the scale so -- I don't see any issues with that currently and I know that, that's an issue because, obviously, with the increased taxes that everyone's having to pay this year, there is less disposable income. But we still have people who largely come in into our models, especially in the first-time homebuyer market. With the affordability rates where they are today, even though they may not be as great as they once were, but they're still very good. they're still trying to buy all house they possibly can.  That's something we always have to watch, always watch the affordability. But today, it's still very good. And then especially with where mortgage standards are today, for those buyers that are able to qualify for a mortgage, they have very, very good credit quality. So they're typically able -- probably to afford a little bit more house than buyers several years ago, when credit standards were a little different.","Bill W. Wheat","When we're dropping our 1 or 2 smallest plans on a number of our communities, there's good demand out there. So to the extent that we're dropping those, to the extent we have come back and add those because of less disposable income or qualifying problems, we can easily do that.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, just to follow up on your comment around financing. We actually heard, in a couple of instances, that now that prices are going up, that appraisers are falling behind a little bit and having a hard time catching up. Has that been any pushback for you in the quarter, in terms of appraisers catching up with your price increases?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Actually, we work very closely, to the extent that we can, with our appraisers. And we try to help them by having a focal person in each division, deliver the appraisal packet. And to the extent that they can use any of our help, we're trying to help them. But clearly, I think, the appraisers are doing a good job in most of our markets. There are a handful of markets where we go like that the appraisers are not giving the value that we should be getting for our homes, but we're working through that.","Operator","Our final question today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A quick one here. Can you quantify any external commissions that were on the gross margin line? And, I guess, also, are there any markets where you're actively trying to slow absorption, given the laying constraints out there? And how do you balance the equation between price and pace right now?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I'll take the second half of that. We're not trying to slow our sales in any particular market by lack of lot supply. If we are doing anything, and our sales are slowing in a particular area it's because we're very proactive on our price increases. And we're trying to take price increases wherever we can and as actively as we can, but not any restriction on our sales, relative to land and lot supply.","Bill W. Wheat","And commissions over the long term are typically around 3% of revenue for us, and this quarter was in line with that long term range.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. great. One, just last one, in the call here. But -- can you talk a little bit about the margin differential between internally developed communities versus communities you buy from third parties? What's the margin differential between those, typically? And on the finished lots you do buy today, what's the implied margin relative to your current 20%?","Donald J. Tomnitz","It's really a risk assessment. And basically, if we are buying lots, all cash, from a third-party developer, more if we have bought the land and are developing the lots, we have a higher gross margin underwriting hurdle than our standard, on a rolling option basis. That could be anywhere from 200 to 300 to 400 basis points differential. Because we believe that, as we cap the cash something now, or in terms of finished lots, or if we develop the subdivision ourselves, we should be paying ourselves a risk-adjusted return. And if we're not, then we're making a mistake. So that's where we focus. And sometimes it's 500 basis points, but I'd say, it's typically somewhere between 300 and 400 basis points, if we have to cash something out.","Operator","We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you. And thank our employees for a wonderful quarter. We've come through a tough 5 years in this -- in the company. We've rebuilt the company from the ground up. Our employees have done a phenomenal job out there, helping us get to where we are . Without a doubt, we're clearly the leader in the industry, and where we are today and where we are positioned, over the course of the next 2 years, we should clearly be the leader in the industry, both on units, revenues, profit, gross margins, SG&A. We absolutely had a phenomenal quarter, but there's more great things to come with this company. And I appreciate it, and D.R. and I thank each and every one of our employees.

Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States, Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Donald Tomnitz, President and CEO. Thank you, you may begin.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you, and good morning. Joining me this morning are Bill Wheat, Executive Vice President and CFO; Stacey Dwyer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer; and Mike Murray, Vice President and Controller. Before we get started, Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Some comments made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different.","All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","D.R. Horton posted its highest quarterly pretax income since the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the highest in the industry, earning $72 million this quarter and $144 million year-to-date. Our pretax operating profit margin for the third quarter was 6.3%, the highest since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. For the 10th consecutive year, we are the largest builder in the United States based on homes closed.","Our net sales orders improved 25% from our third quarter last year and 3% sequentially from the March quarter. Our average sales price increased during the quarter, driving a 32% increase in the value of net sales orders compared to the year-ago quarter. We've seen solid positive year-over-year sales comparisons continue into July.","Our sales this quarter resulted in a 31% increase in our backlog units and a 40% increase in backlog value compared to the prior year, which puts us in a strong position for increased revenue and profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.","In response to our sales growth, we're putting our liquidity to work by increasing our investments in homes under construction, finished lots, land and lot development. These investments are fueling our profitable growth even though macroeconomic conditions remain soft and overall housing demand is at historically low levels.","We are finding opportunities to take market share in existing markets while evaluating attractive new submarkets. Our entry-level business remains strong while we continue to expand our product offerings for move-up buyers. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","In the third quarter, our homebuilding operations generated pretax income of $58.3 million compared to $22.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Our financial services operations generated pretax income of $13.9 million compared to $6.7 million in the year-ago quarter.","Our net income for the quarter increased to $787.8 million or $2.22 per diluted share, which included a noncash tax benefit of $716.7 million from a reduction of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset. We will discuss the valuation allowance reduction in more detail later in our prepared remarks.","Our diluted share count this quarter included 38.3 million shares related to our convertible senior notes. When these shares are dilutive, they are added to the diluted EPS denominator, and the associated interest expense and amortized issuance costs are added back to net income to calculate diluted EPS. For these shares and the related costs to be included in our diluted EPS in the fourth quarter, we estimate that our net income would need to be approximately $85 million. Mike?","Mike Murray","Our third quarter home sales revenue increased 14% to $1.1 billion on 4,957 homes closed, up from $974.5 million on 4,555 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 5% compared to the prior year and up 2.5% sequentially to $225,000. In the fourth quarter, we expect that our backlog conversion rate will be in the high 70s to 85% range. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Net sales however for the third quarter were up 25% from last year to 6,079 homes, a 5% decrease in active selling communities. Our average sales price on net sales orders of $232,300 was up 6% compared to the prior year quarter and up 4% sequentially.","Our cancellation rate for the third quarter was 23%, which is very close to our predownturn cancellation rate range of 17% to 21%. Our sales backlog at June 30, 2012, increased 31% from the prior year to 7,311 homes. The value of the backlog increased 40% to $1.7 billion from $1.2 billion a year ago.","With 7,311 homes in backlog and continued year-over-year improvement in sales through the first part of July, we expect stronger closings and pretax profits in the fourth quarter both sequentially and compared to the prior year. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the third quarter was 18%, up 150 basis points from the year-ago period. 130 basis points of the increase was due to decreased incentives and discounts and increased average selling prices, and 50 basis points of the increase was due to lower amortized interest and property taxes. These increases were partially offset by a 30 basis point decrease due to higher estimated cost for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenue. Our expectation for fourth quarter home sales gross margin is around 18%, consistent with the third quarter. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Homebuilding SG&A expense for the quarter, which includes corporate overhead, was $136 million or 12.2% of homebuilding revenues compared to $114 million or 11.7% of homebuilding revenues in the prior-year quarter. The SG&A category that increased the most as a percentage of revenue was incentive compensation, reflecting our significantly higher revenues, profitability and share price versus a year ago.","For the 9 months ended June 30, 2012, homebuilding SG&A expense was $383 million or 13% of homebuilding revenues compared to $356 million or 14.4% of homebuilding revenues in the prior-year period.","In our fourth quarter, absolute SG&A expense will increase due to variable components. However, we expect our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenue will improve both sequentially and year-over-year as we close more homes and leverage our fixed cost structure. Mike?","Mike Murray","Homebuilding interest expense was down 39% from the year-ago quarter to $6.2 million. Our third quarter homebuilding interest incurred improved slightly to $31.1 million from $31.4 million a year ago even after issuing an additional $350 million of senior notes in May. Our capitalized interest balance at June 30 totaled $81.2 million.","Financial services pretax income for the quarter was $13.9 million. 84% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. Our mortgage company handled the financing for 60% of our homebuyers this quarter, with virtually all loans meeting eligibility requirements for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae.","FHA and VA loans accounted for 55% of our mortgage company's volume this quarter, down from 62% in the year-ago quarter. Our mortgage company's new borrowers during the quarter had an average FICO score of 708 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 91%. First time homebuyers represented 54% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","We reduced our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by $716.7 million this quarter. This reduction was based on our evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, in which we determined that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient income in future periods to realize the substantial majority of our deferred tax assets.","The positive evidence included our 5 consecutive quarters of pretax income, the strong profitability and sales both the current quarter and the fiscal year-to-date period and an increased backlog, which positions us for increased income in our fourth quarter. In addition, with our solid balance sheet, reduced debt and interest cost, ample liquidity and growing inventory, we expect to be able to sustain and increase our pretax income in future years.","Even if our future pretax income remains flat with current year levels, we estimate that we will utilize all of our federal net operating losses in less than 5 years.","The negative evidence included the losses we incurred during the housing downturn, the current weakness in the economy, historic low levels of activity in the housing market, the restrictive mortgage lending environment and our lower-than-normal gross margins.","One of the most significant pieces of negative evidence that existed in prior periods, a 3-year cumulative loss position, is not as significant now as we are in a 3-year cumulative income position at June 30.","We concluded that the positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence, and we reduced the DTA valuation allowance by $716.7 million. Our remaining valuation allowance of $78.4 million relates to 2 factors. First, certain state net operating loss carryforwards may not be realized due to shorter carryforward periods in those states. Second, a portion of the valuation allowance reduction has been allocated to our expected fourth quarter income. We expect to reduce this portion of the valuation allowance next quarter, resulting in minimal income tax on our fourth quarter income statement.","Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect to report income tax expense at a tax rate of 38% to 38.5%. Until we have utilized our NOLs, the majority of the tax expense recorded will not require cash, but will reduce the carrying value of our DTA. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Since March, our total inventory increased by approximately $228 million excluding noncash items, reflecting a $133 million increase in homes and inventory and a $95 million increase in our investments in residential land and lots. Our homes and inventory at the end of June totaled 12,200 homes, up 1,100 homes for March. As of June 30, 1,100 of our homes were models, 5,600 were speculative homes and 2,100 of the specs were completed. During the quarter, we sold our spring inventory and grew our backlog, improving our spec percentage to 46% from 50% at March 31. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Our third fiscal quarter investments in land, lots and development costs totaled $389 million, that reflects our ability to find new communities, replenish our finished lots supply. During the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we spent $938 million on land, lots and development costs, which is up from $582 million in the same period of the prior year.","We continue to purchase our option finished lots in many markets and are also selectively investing in land acquisition and development opportunities to ensure we have adequate lot supplies in desirable markets.","At June 30, 2012, we control approximately 131,000 lots, of which 90,000 are owned and 41,000 are optioned. Our owned lots include 23,000 finished lots and 24,000 lots to be developed within the next 12 to 18 months. Our optioned lots consist of 25,000 finished lots and 16 lots that we expect to purchase and develop within the next 12 to 18 months, bringing our minimum pipeline of finished lots over the next 2 years to 88,000, which is up 13% from the second quarter and 24% from a year ago. Mike?","Mike Murray","We used $95 million of cash in operations in the June quarter, primarily due to increases in homes and inventory and residential land and lots, offset by pretax income and an increase in accounts payable. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of homebuilding unrestricted cash and marketable securities. The balance of our public notes outstanding at June 30 was $1.9 billion. Our next maturity is approximately $1.72 billion in May of 2013.","At June 30, our homebuilding leverage ratio, net of cash and marketable securities, improved 160 basis points to 18.3% compared to 19.9% a year ago. Gross homebuilding leverage at June 30 improved 470 basis points to 35.8%. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you. Fiscal year '12 has been a pivotal year for our company, in which we reestablished our industry-leading profit levels and began to take advantage of the flexibility provided by our strong balance sheet. We transitioned from defense to offense, raising new capital, investing our cash in the business, improving our operating margin and growing our profits. We believe these are the initial stages of long-term growth for D.R. Horton.","D.R. and I would like to personally thank our employees for their hard work and accomplishments. You've kept us in the #1 builder slot for the past 10 years. We are better positioned than we've ever been in my 29 years with D.R. Horton. We're excited by the opportunities we see in fiscal 2013 and beyond. And as I always say as I travel around and meet all of our sales people, kick tail.","This concludes our prepared remarks and I'll host any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering, I think your last comment there about sort of the directions to the employees there in terms of kicking tails is interesting. In terms of that, I guess how does that relate to thoughts on the backlog conversion? And how much of that is a function in terms of specs versus the constructions? Is there much that you can do in terms of working on that one for fiscal '13, if you can provide a little more color on that.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Sure, Dan. One of the things that we look at on our backlog conversion is really just going back predownturn. And our expectations will trend back to the backlog conversion rates that we've traditionally seen. And those rates would typically be between about 55% and 65% in quarters 1 through 3, and then quarter 4 could be up into the 70%, possibly into the low 70% range. We've been in an accelerated backlog conversion rate because our spec levels have been higher. As we went through the downturn, we had a higher level of completed specs than we currently have, and so those were available for a very quick sale and quick close in the same quarter. We would expect that to begin to slow down a little bit as we focused on reducing our completed specs. And the other thing we're seeing is more build to order. Sales come in and those typically stay in backlog a little bit longer because we actually work through the permitting process, people selecting their options before we begin the construction on the home. And so our expectation is for Q4 that the backlog will still remain in the high 70s to the 85% range, but going into next year, we are going to actually see that continue to trend down a little bit.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. I guess the second question is. Relating to that you talked about bringing down some specs, more build-to-order and a lot of other builders talking about more pricing power as you think about the pure specs and more build-to-order and potentially pricing depending on your focus there versus the orders. How are you thinking about margins as you're looking forward in a potential for some -- further improvement over the course of the year?","Donald J. Tomnitz","First of all, I would say too that we are not going to be decreasing our spec level from our historical levels. Typically, we're running somewhere between 50% to 60% specs, depending on which quarter of the year it is, and we anticipate that we will increase our specs in the first calendar quarter of fiscal year '12 in anticipation of the selling season, which historically starts in the second quarter. Clearly, we moved a lot of older specs this quarter, which was a remarkable accomplishment. It was even more a remarkable accomplishment that we increased our gross margin while we moved those older specs. But on a historical basis, our build-to-order business has been a higher margin business for us, so as we transition into fiscal year '13, I anticipate that we will have some upside in our margins just simply because of the mix change in build-to-order versus spec and also combined with the fact that we've gotten rid of a lot of older specs that -- and cleansed our spec backlog.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, I want to go to the comments you made right at the beginning of the call, Don, in terms of increasing investment, trying to take share, looking at potential new submarkets. And I think you also said expanding the move-up buyer segment. Looking now at those statements as a whole, is that something that we should take to expect in acceleration in community count growth in 2013?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Absolutely. We continue even though we're closing more homes than anyone else in the industry and we were able to add to our lot supply as we indicated in the most recent quarter. We clearly are going to be buying land and developing lots where it makes economic sense for us. Fortunately, in a lot of our markets, we're still able to execute option contracts.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of the comments you just made around spec and going back earlier to comments around move-up, it seems like historically, you guys have -- a healthy part of the business for you, and I think one of the core competencies for you as a company is your comfort level with spec as a part of the business. Is this shift towards more build-to-order something that's just more temporary? And maybe you could put into perspective how spec is going to be as a percent of the business in 2013 versus 2012 and maybe historically.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Clearly, our build-to-order business is being driven by our customers. There are a number of people who are coming in who are either retirees or they're buying their third home. And clearly, their desire is of having their home their way, that's what we're accommodating. On a go forward basis though, as I said earlier, we are going to continue to maintain and as you said, we are comfortable, we have always been a spec builder and we are comfortable with our specs. We will continue to maintain, depending upon which quarter of the year it is, a spec ratio somewhere of 50% to 60%.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so, how would that compare against 2012 then?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well in 2012, the percentages really haven't changed frankly even during the downturn because there are period of time last year in 2012, certainly in 2011, where we were running 61%, 62% specs. So it just all depends upon what we see in the marketplace. And one of the things that has brought us to where we are today is we were willing, during the downturn, to put our specs out there and have homes available especially we saw that pretax credit, and those are one of the things that led us to having such a successful '11 or '10 was having the homes on the market to take advantage of the tax credit when our competition really did not.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Goldberg with UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question has to do with the financial services business and specifically the capture rate. And what I'm trying to get an idea about is, folks who don't use your mortgage product. Do you have any visibility on why they do or don't use the mortgage product? And how that group, maybe just some color on -- from a statistics or metrics standpoint, what the credit quality of that group looks like? Why they choose to go outside to a different mortgage vendor and how the process actually works?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, a number of our buyers come in preapproved by some other mortgage company, and that's one of the major drivers of someone not using our mortgage company. We also have an association with the SAA, where basically, they are also offering their mortgage company to our buyers. And many of their -- all of their buyers are military or ex-military buyers, and they offer an incentive for their buyers to use their mortgage company. Our mortgage company has always been in the business of absolutely competing with the competition. They don't really have any upside, they don't really have any downside. They're just out there on a daily basis having to earn our business. So to the extent that someone must use an outside mortgage company, that's fine with us.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just to make sure I understand, is it fair to conclude that you don't think the folks that are going to outside mortgage providers have a better credit profile than folks who are going to your internal mortgage provider?","Stacey H. Dwyer","We don't necessarily have a clear visibility into that, David, but I would be surprised at this point. I mean, mortgage standards are pretty consistent across all of mortgage products right now especially ones that are backed by the governmental industries and that tends to be the majority of the market. One other factor that impacts our capture rate is we don't have our mortgage company in every homebuilding market where we operate. So there's certain segments of our business that we just won't capture.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And certainly I don't think, if you're inferring that perhaps the people who use our mortgage company have lesser credit qualification, that's not the case. And if you look at the solid results of our mortgage company in a great view, millions of dollars they've had to reserve against billions of dollars of mortgages they have issued over the year. The quality of our buyer going to our mortgage company is extraordinarily high.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I wasn't trying to infer anything, I just want to understand.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Just double checking.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, exactly. I wouldn't make any inferences. Certainly not. My follow-up question. I wanted to delve a little bit more into this whole concept of looking into new markets. And I'm wondering if we can kind of go over the analysis besides performance and think about new markets, what are the kind of puts and takes on the decision-making process? What makes a market attractive? What makes it less attractive kind of just give us more of a view on how you're thinking about it.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well largely, it's -- that's dependent on our regional presence because obviously, they spend a lot more time in those specific markets than D.R. and I do. Although D.R. and I clearly bless every one of the new markets that we enter, but clearly, what we're looking for is an opportunity to go -- when we go into a new market is to make a major -- take a major position in that market. Typically, the market is underserved by a production builder or not served by a production builder at all, where we can go in and actually provide the homebuyers in that market with a more competitive house and a better built house with a better margin. So one of the things that we focused on at Horton over the last couple of years is moving into what I call ancillary markets or tertiary markets and I have another name for them, which I won't use for in the conference call, but they're smaller markets. And I think with our low overhead, we can go in and take lot position, so they're smaller than many other builders and to be able to offer the buyers in that market an extremely competitive value. And I think you're seeing that in a number of markets where we have gone into in the Carolinas and in Florida where we don't find competition for many other builders, certainly not production builders","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if you could comment on your community count change. I know you won't give the actual community count number, but it was down 5%. Obviously, that's a high-class problem because you've been selling a lot of houses and I understand that. At the same time, I was wondering if you had an internal goal or a target to significantly ramp up your communities as you head into next year. And if so, how you gauge that or how we should be looking at that in terms -- is it in terms of just the gross number of communities that you expect to open? Or is there a sort of a net year-over-year number that we can think about?","Donald J. Tomnitz","The way we look at new community count is each one of our division presidents and each one of their markets are charged with how do they become the #1 builder in their market, all the while focusing on our #1 goal which is profitability. So as I tell each one of our division presidents and the role they're taking, is how do we tie up and contract for any and all lot positions in that market that makes sense for us to build that product and if it's a profitable transaction for us. So we're trying to expand our subdivisions in each one of our markets as aggressively as the business will support.","Bill W. Wheat","Clearly, with our increase in investments in land and our increases in our option lot positions. We are targeting increases in our overall community count. You are correct that with our increased sales this year, we have probably rolled out of more communities than we might have anticipated at the start of the year, so the net count has not increased quite as much as we had maybe originally planned, but with the increased investments, we expect to be growing our community count sequentially as we move in to 2015.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Some of those community counts are relative, Steve. Basically, some markets are a lot easier to sign up contracts on finished lots or option lots or even land deals, which take less risk and less capital than other markets like California in particular. That market seems to me from a land perspective is overheated right now, and it takes big dollars and there's a higher risk, given the state of California's economy. We're trying to choose land and lot positions in low-risk areas to provide us the best return.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then secondly, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the appraisal situation in the industry. I think when I spoke with you last time, you had indicated that, that was an ongoing annoyance, but it was still something that was weighing, it seemed, fairly heavily on your assessment of the overall market conditions. I was curious if you could give us a sense for whether that's still your view that the appraisal process is a meaningful impediment or if you've seen some amelioration in that regard.","Stacey H. Dwyer","We wouldn't call that a meaningful impediment. We do still continue to see challenges with the valuations on appraisals, more specifically with the VA loans than with other loan products. And there are a handful of markets that seem to have more ongoing challenges than some other markets. But generally, it's just an ongoing annoyance, but not a huge impediment.","Donald J. Tomnitz","In fact, I think as you begin to see and who knows whether the calcs are right or not, but as people begin to report some increase in average sales prices or median prices in various markets, that's going to solve the appraisal issue substantially for all builders.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I think you mentioned a 5-year recovery on your DTA. Was that one of your assumptions?","Donald J. Tomnitz","If our income remains flat with fiscal 2012 levels, we expect to be able to recover our federal NOL carryforwards. That's a portion of our DTA. Our federal NOL carryforwards will capture that in less than 5 years.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just for housekeeping, what portion of the $716 million is that?","Bill W. Wheat","It's between $200 million and $300 million.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, so it's a pretty small piece.","Bill W. Wheat","It would be the second largest piece in the DTA.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Well yes. So given the fact that you have relatively low net leverage today, you're optioning your land finished and\/or otherwise. When do you think you're going to be able to get back to a more -- and it sounds like you're more confident obviously. When do you think you're going to get back to a more effective rate of leverage, given that you're tying up these lands through options. And if you're not going to be targeting a 40%, let's say, net debt to cap, what are you going to be doing with the capital?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I can tell you right now we're really comfortable with our net debt to cap, Ken. And our focus is on how we continue to grow the business without increasing our leverage significantly.","Bill W. Wheat","We have a lot of flexibility obviously right now. If the market's there and the demand is there, we have the ability to invest a lot with our balance sheet, both in our liquidity right now and the ability to add additional debt in the future. But right now, we're increasing our investment significantly, and our leverage is still holding in there at a pretty low level. Of course going forward, we also plan on making a lot of money, and to the extent that we generate a lot of profits in the future, that adds to our equity, which helps keep our leverage in balance as well.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess the second question I have, when you talked about sequentially your gross margins went up a bit, but could you give us a bit kind of the sequential -- I mean, if you were getting rid of your finished spec depletion, what was that kind of drag sequentially, given that, I think broadly, we're seeing incentives decline sequentially, which has helped builders' gross margins move up? And you guided at 18% gross margin in 4Q. Is that -- why wouldn't we see a little more lift sequentially? And how much of the land is new -- the spread?","Bill W. Wheat","Sure. On the sequential increase, it was about 40 bps from Q2 to Q3. The entire amount of that increase is due to pure core margin improvements attributable to fewer discounts, some increases in average selling prices that we've been able to implement in some of our markets. And so it's just a very simple improvement in core margin. Specs are always a portion of that, but as Don mentioned earlier, we have reduced our -- some of our aged completed specs, and we're starting to see improved margins on our specs this quarter relative to some prior periods in the past.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And a lot of that has frankly to do with the low new home inventory basically. Across the nation, we're down to 4.7 months supply of new homes. We have pricing power in a number of our markets, not as significant as what we had back in '04 and '05, but I'm not sure we need to get back to that point. But nevertheless, we are having pricing power in most of our markets which is improving our gross margins.","Bill W. Wheat","And obviously, we sound -- we certainly sound more confident in our guidance on margins today because our trend has been positive here for a couple of quarters, and the driver of the improved margin is truly based on our core operations. So that's what's driving our guidance to be able to hold the margins that we have today. But clearly, our goals are to continue to improve margins over and above the 18% we reported this quarter.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Our company goal has always been 20% gross margins. We're working toward that, but we're not going to be tell you we're going to be there next quarter, but we're working on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Will Randow with Citigroup.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had a question on your SG&A level. When we talked in the past, you talked that -- you mentioned you want to run it around 10% as your goal as a percentage of housing sales. However you're running in low teens because you cut it quite a bit. Is there a potential to get below 10% in the next couple of years if we continue to see this recovery?","Bill W. Wheat","That would be a stretch. We would expect we'll be in the -- we'll be in the 12s this year, which is going to be a good improvement versus last year. As we continue to add volume, we clearly have more room to leverage our SG&A infrastructure on the fixed cost side, and so we would expect to continue driving that down. But our company goal remains at around 10%. We have had some short periods in the past when we've been below 10%, but those have typically been periods and we've seen significant selling price increases that have driven that. But to the extent we're able to drive it towards 10%, that will be in line with our targets.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then on kind of the first-time homebuyers statement as well as the lending environment. Given your lower average ASP, you might be targeting call it the slightly less affluent buyer, for lack of a better term. So really, how do you open up that segment of the market? And do you plan to get heavier into the first-time homebuyer?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Yes. Right now, we are very concentrated with the first-time homebuyer. We've typically been running between about 50% and 55% of our business to the first-time homebuyer. In terms of opening it up, that's been actually the most consistent part of the homebuyer population, and one of the things that we're looking to do is not necessarily to decrease the number of homes and the number of first-time homebuying customers that we have, but rather to increase incrementally the product that we have available and the number of people who are buying more of a move-up product. So our goal is actually for that percentage to work its way back down closer to the 35% to 40% historical range as we see the higher end of the market recovering.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was just curious because obviously some of the harder-hit markets on the lower income side of things than most, but appreciate the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","In one of the answers to a previous question, you mentioned getting some pricing power in some of your markets and if I recall from last quarter, I feel like the tone was a little bit different. So I was wondering if I was interpreting that correctly if you think that sequentially the markets changed and you've gained some power for the last quarter's earnings?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, we do, clearly.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And secondly, I just wanted to clarify some of the comments made in the opening statements about the SG&A. You mentioned that the fourth quarter should be higher on an absolute basis. I was wondering if that was sequentially higher or year-over-year higher. And I was also wondering if you could just clarify that if most of the year-over-year increase this year, was that solely incentive-based comp that you mentioned?","Bill W. Wheat","We will see an increase both sequentially and year-over-year, as we'll have a higher activity level, more homes closing, more revenue and that results in more sales commission and more activities around the home construction. But we'll also see a bigger piece of that increase being incentive compensation, both to increase revenues, profitability as well as share price adjusting some accruals.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","To be clear, the main driver of the year-over-year increase this year, would you -- is incentive-based comp or were there any other factors that you should call out?","Bill W. Wheat","That was by far the largest portion of it, and it's simply a matter of the significant profitability we have year-to-date this year and last year at this point. We were not profitable on a year-to-date basis. So that's a huge swing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Pollard with Goldman Sachs.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Typical seasonality in your orders and deliveries, you guys have the September year end so things can be a little bit funky for you. I'm ultimately trying to understand your net absorption rate in the quarter were about 2.2 per month. How much should we see that go down q-on-q as we move into your fourth quarter and then again into your first quarter for '13 based on typical seasonality?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Yes, Josh, we can pull that up, and I can get back with you and kind of see what we've done historically. You're absolutely right though our seasonal trend is that the March quarter and the June quarter are usually pretty similar within a few basis points, then we'd see our sales trend down into the September quarter, down a little bit more into December and then start back up in the spring selling season into the March quarter. And I'll follow-up with you in terms of kind of historically what percentage we see.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. In replacement of that question, can I ask what your year-on-year growth through July is? You talked about it being still robust, but I'd love to get a little bit more clarity and understand whether or not you guys expect your year-on-year order growth to begin to slow in the back half of the year.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Well, in terms of the year-on-year order growth, we haven't actually seen the end of July yet, so we'd prefer not to comment. But while we would expect the absolute orders to go down, we'll see what happens with the year-over-year order growth. Because even with a decline in orders, it could still hang in there very strongly.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then if could ask one additional one. The orders in the north were up only 2%. Can you just dig into each of the states in that market and just give us a view of what's going on? It seems like the housing market is improving a lot, but this north and northeast seems to not be doing as well.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well clearly, our position in the north is small, and frankly, if you take a look at the markets in our north region, they're small and they continue to be weak. And so as a result, it's an insignificant number really, but those markets have been hit a lot harder, and they are slow to recover. And largely if you take a look at some of them have high unemployment still and their state economies are weak.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask also about the mortgage environment. You indicated about 84% of the mortgage the originations were from D.R. Horton homebuyers. What percent historically have you originated from non-D.R. Horton homebuyers?","Stacey H. Dwyer","There has been a pretty good range on that, Jade, and a lot of it has to do with the amount of refinance that's going on in any individual quarter. We've probably ranged between maybe 5% to 20% would be outside business. One of the things that we do like to focus on though is increasing that non-captive business even beyond the refi business because that helps us leverage the overhead structure in those markets. So that is one of the focus points for the mortgage company is to continue to look at the outside business.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow up on that. The gain on sale margins are pretty elevated right now given the refi boom we're seeing, as well as the HARP 2.0 program. Are you seeing -- presumably, you're seeing a benefit from that. Can you just comment on the sustainability of the margins you showed this quarter?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes. Clearly, the improved gain on sale as part of the increase in margins this quarter in financial services with a 40% operating margin. That's at the high end of our historical range and clearly higher than where we have been more recently. I would say a more typical operating margin over the long term would be more in the 30% range -- 30% to 35% perhaps so 40% was a bit higher than usual.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Wanted to ask about your debt offering. You folks have been reluctant to add expenses, interest expenses in the past, so I was a little bit surprised to see the debt deal, especially considering the amount of cash you guys have on hand. You got obviously plenty of cash, solid cash position. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. Does your -- overcome -- reluctance to add this interest expense, so that looks that you're going to, kind of, be stepping on the accelerator in terms of growth. Do you expect that to put to work sooner rather than later, is that -- what was behind the thinking of that deal?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think it was clearly an opportunistic approach to the debt market at the time. Certainly, the coupon was extraordinarily low. Are we going to step on the accelerator? We are moderating the accelerator. One of our focuses still at this company is to underwrite land and lot deals, specifically the ones we have to cash out and our underwriting guidelines are pretty specific. We desire right now to get our capital back within 24 months. We do have some deals we are proving that are greater than 24 months, but we're very focused on not overextending our land and lot position to an excessive number of years to get our capital back. So we are -- just to be clear, we are optimistic about the housing market today, but we're also realizing that the U.S. economy is still weak, and so I wouldn't say we're stepping on any accelerator. We're just adjusting to each market and trying to take profitable market share from our competitors.","Bill W. Wheat","And then you are right that we had been reluctant to add interest expense to the company. And I think this reflects that we have more confidence in our ability to generate profits and cover that incremental interest expense than we may have had in the last couple of years.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. Great. And second question on your orders. Your year-over-year order performance relative to the group has lagged the past say 4 quarters or so by about 10 or 15 percentage points. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. Would we expect to see some closing of that gap going forward?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, as one of my favorite division presidents, Todd Horton always says, no good deed shall go unpunished. Clearly, we outperformed everyone during the downturn and so obviously, we have a much higher comp as we go through each quarter relative to our peers who performed much more poorly than we during the downturn. So as a result, we are continuing to focus on growing the company, but again, we're focusing on growing the company in a profitable manner.","Bill W. Wheat","We began growing our sales sooner, which got us to profitability sooner. Now we have much more substantial profits and we plan on growing on that. And we expect substantial sales increases in the future. We're focused on our sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Barron with Housing Research Center.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","I wanted to understand I guess now obviously, the recovery seems more evident. How you guys are thinking about your land opportunities? I know you were one of the first to be up there buying finished lots 3 years ago, and it seems like you guys were picking up even a lot of what I would consider pretty small positions. So I'm kind of trying to figure out are you still focused on that even though prices are going up? And are you just paying more or are you finding undeveloped or partially developed land deals within those better markets? Or are you moving further out to find finished lot deals maybe in the so-called B and C markets?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Clearly our balance sheet is extraordinarily strong, so we're in a position to capitalize on any opportunities that we see on the land and lot side. Clearly, land prices in certain markets have moved up more dramatically than we think they should have. As a result, we're being more conservative in those particular markets. But we are putting our balance sheet to work on good deals in good markets with good returns. And the great thing about this company is we pretty much have maintained our original footprint during this downturn. And as opposed, like a number of our competitors having to focus on just a handful of markets to generate their growth, we've got a huge footprint and so we can selectively invest in each one of those markets or selective markets such that we don't have to take the risk that our other competitors do. And we can focus on growth and risk in the markets that we think are the best for us at that particular time without pushing the window too hard in any one market. We clearly are focused on one thing. We're not going to take the hook at this early stage in the housing recovery with the weak macroeconomic scenario that we see. And bet the balance sheet of this company that we've cleaned up so nicely and it's the strongest it's ever been just because of the fact that there are a lot of people out there thinking that land prices are -- need to be a lot higher than what they deserve to be.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","And are you able to also push back on labor and materials or are you finding that the labor is -- it is what it is and you're having to pay up more for that?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, first of all, we have a lot of partners who we've been doing business with for a number of years. We just completed our every 2-year Purchasing Managers meeting in Las Vegas with our vendors and our manufacturers. And so as a result, we set the expectations for them where our volume is going. Clearly, we're a big portion of a lot of their business, and as a result, we continue to work together to keep our prices and our cost moderated. And we expect them to cover their overhead with D.R. Horton business and make their profit off of our competitors.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen East with ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Don, if I hear you as you talk, it sounds like you're focusing more on volume as we move through, call it the next 4, 5 quarters versus pricing. How would you characterize how you prefer to grow between now and the end of '13?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Clearly, we've been the #1 builder unit-wise for 10 consecutive years. And all the while, I think clearly out earning most of our competitors, a few handful have done slightly better than we, but not significantly. And our goal on a go-forward basis is to continue to be the largest builder in the U.S., but most importantly to continue to focus on profitability. As Horton has said many times, it's easy to make money in this business. It's harder to keep it. And as a result, what we're trying to focus on and we are focused very hard on is profitability. But we're going to win profitability with volume, but what clearly our division presidents know one thing. They're not to take a backseat to any builder in any market because we have the best cost and the best pricing and best balance sheet of anybody in the industry. So you can add all that up and divide it up and see what I really said.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's going to be a chore on that one. Okay. And then just 2 other sort of distinct questions. One, your split between fixed and variable on your G&A expense. And then you've talked a lot about some areas, land is just too expensive and that type of thing. If you look region by region, where are you primarily trying to put your money to work?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I don't mean to be rude, Steve, but I just stopped giving the Bobby toll market grade by markets because frankly, we have some preeminent positions in a lot of our markets and I just don't want to be telling our competition where we're doing better.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that. Can you do it in a more generalized area, not Dallas or Houston, but southwest versus east or something like that?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Steven, if you look at our land position in the regions that are improving most in terms of the lots that I have under control, the 2 standouts for us still continue to be the southeast and the south central region. Those are where we're finding more opportunities. And those have been consistently where we found more opportunities.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then on the SG&A?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes. In terms of the variable portion of our SG&A, when we are looking at revenue increasing sequentially, typically, our variable SG&A will equate to between 3% and 5% of the increase in revenues. So if revenues increased by $100 million, then we would expect the SG&A to -- the variable portion to increase between $3 million and $5 million. This quarter, the sequential increase from Q2 to Q3 was 5% of our sequential revenue increase.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to maybe get better clarity around the question I had before in terms of spec, but particularly as it relates to your comments around gross margins. You said that you expect gross margins, I believe, to improve in 2013 and in part due to more build-to-order versus spec. But I thought DT, you said that you expect spec next year to be roughly similar to this year. Was I mishearing or misunderstanding those comments?","Donald J. Tomnitz","No, you're not. And frankly, our spec level, as I said earlier, has run pretty consistently year after year after year, and we run somewhere between 50% and 60%. We may get into the 62% or 63% level at the right time of the year, and we dropped down to the mid-40s at other times of the year when we get closer to our third and fourth quarters. So as a result, our game plan has always been in this company, we know how to build specs, we know how to make money off specs, and we believe it's really a keystone of our business. So as a result on a go forward basis, notwithstanding the fact that we have more and more build jobs, we are also continuing to offer the same level of specs at the specific quarters in the year where it makes sense. We increase and decrease dependent upon the quarter of the year.","Stacey H. Dwyer","I think the other thing that maybe a little bit confusing is when we were talking about the ability to turn the backlog more quickly and some of the drag on the margin we were talking about completed specs. Completed specs have come down year-over-year from about 2,500, I believe, last year to about 2,100 this year. And as a percentage of our inventory, that's even a greater drop because our overall inventory has been growing. So that's another factor that we look at just in addition to our overall spec percentage.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So then the completed specs is really one of the factors to drive gross margin improvement next year? Would another factor also be, you had mentioned over time, you're trying to migrate back from a 54% first-time buyer exposure more to typically 35% to 40%. And given comments around expanding the move-up product offering, would that also -- to the extent that you have a higher exposure in move-up next year, would that also benefit the gross margins?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well clearly the bigger percentage of our backlog that's move-up should have a higher margin than the spec margin. And we should be rewarded for that simply because of the fact that we're building a home for a particular person as opposed to having -- building a production home which takes slightly longer. So we should get a higher return on a build job.","Bill W. Wheat","Right now, we are seeing margin improvement in every component of our business. And we think we have a good trend going. We're going to work on continuing to improve that in every component of our business.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So maybe just to tie it all together, in terms of gross margins for next year, what would be the biggest drivers of expansion if you were to think across, let's say, 3 categories of less incentives of better pricing, mix shift towards move-up and less completed specs. So can you give us a sense of maybe the order of the drivers there?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well clearly, I think that the more build jobs we have, that's going to drive our margins, the best of those 3 categories. The completed specs basically what we're talking about is that we have fewer aged completed specs, specs that have been completed for a period of 6 months or less. So to the extent that, that makes up a smaller percent of our backlog, that would be really the #2 driver. We have focused for years on making sure our specs have been completed for a period of greater than 6 months are moved and sold as quickly as possible.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Locker with FBN Securities.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just on your ASP, do you still expect that to -- I mean, it's been trending -- the closing has been trending higher than the backlog. Do you think that will continue?","Bill W. Wheat","The trend has been up. We hope it continues, but that's a week-to-week, month-to-month thing, but clearly, the trend has been up pretty consistently the last several quarters.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And I'd say 2 factors are driving that. One is how many build jobs we have, build-to-order houses we have, move-up homes we have and also frankly our pricing power. And right now, the pricing power is small, but is there, so I think that's one of the things clearly contributing to our increase on our ASP.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Right. And you mentioned your compensation expense in third quarter being higher than a year ago. Can you quantify that on what it was in the third quarter 2012 and third quarter 2011?","Bill W. Wheat","We'd have to get back to you on the specific numbers on that. But that is the -- on the year-over-year change, that is the largest component of the year-over-year increase and directly related to the profitability of the company and the change in share price.","Stacey H. Dwyer","And just to be clear, that sales commissions, it's bonuses for the superintendents, it's division level comp, it's region comp and its corporate comp, all of those have some component that's either tied to volume, revenue or profitability and stock price.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Rybak with Ivory Capital.","Michael Rybak","First question. Can you comment on the order growth progression for the quarter?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Mike, we typically don't comment about the intra-quarter trends, but the results that we posted where June was a little bit higher than our March quarter. Typically, March and June are pretty close together, but usually only in about 1\/3 of the situation is June higher than March, so we would view this as a very positive sales trend.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And we're continuing that into July as we said.","Michael Rybak","Okay, okay. And Don, I think a couple of quarters ago, I think on the Q1 call, you mentioned that your personal goal is 5 years out coming close to 50,000 units. I mean, is that still kind of a realistic goal? And is there -- what sort of environment would we need to see for you to reach that before the 5-year mark?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think when we went back and did the math, that's probably -- that's assuming about 20% to 25% growth each year for 4 or 5 years. And to answer your question directly, I would be disappointed in 5 years if we weren't closing over 50,000 units.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Widner with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Michael R. Widner - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You had mentioned -- not really paying too much attention to what your peers do and mostly focusing on running the business for yourselves, which you've done very well. But I did want to ask you about what you're seeing out there particularly amongst some of the private builders. And really I guess the question is that there's been a widespread perception that those guys have been paralyzed and to some degree that they're -- a lot of them are gone forever and not coming back. And as you indicated, you guys took a lot of market share over the past couple of years as you were in a better position and reacted more quickly. With that said, the last couple of quarters have been exceptionally strong for the public builders, and there's a lot of market share stealing going on by other folks. I'm wondering if you're seeing any response in the private guys in terms of land competition for new deals or new communities opening up or anything along those lines? And how you'd expect that to play out going forward especially given that you've been around this business a few years and you've probably seen a cycle or 2 in your day.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I have seen a couple of cycles in my day, yes. And to your point about peers, we do focus on our competitors out there because frankly, that's a daily focus of ours. I would say to you on the -- as D.R. and I travel around the markets, one of the things that we don't see a lot of is activity in the small and medium-size builders, and that's directly a function of the unwillingness of the banks to lend to them. I think as the market continues to improve, obviously, the banks will begin to lend to them. But clearly, most of that lending will be done for the vertical construction and not the land and lots. So as long as the banks continue not to lend to the small and medium-sized builder on land and lots or independent developers to sell to individual builders -- small and medium-sized builders, I think that production homebuilders, in particular D.R. Horton will be in a preeminent position. And a lot of the developers over the last 4 or 5 years who did concentrate on developing lots and selling them to the small and medium-sized builders have learned a valuable lesson, and that is they need to deal with well-capitalized builders, so we're finding a number of the developers who focused on that portion of the market as they try to get back in the market and some of them are getting back in the market. They're definitely focused on dealer with well-capitalized production builders like Horton.","Michael R. Widner - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And so I guess how does this differ from some of the prior cycles. In that sense? I mean, obviously, this has been a much deeper cycle. But certainly, if we look back to the last one and coming out of this S&L crisis, most of the private guys did come back, and it's very mixed I think by geography as we look around and talk to small builders. But I mean, there's definitely been a tick-up in activity at least in some of the local areas that we look at and just wondering on your sense if this is varied by area, is this varied by the local relationships that the guys have with local backs and sitting on the local PTA and all that sort of stuff. I mean how did it play out last time? How did it play out back in the 80s? And again, any parallels or differences you're seeing today?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think the key today is that the banks are -- obviously, they've gone through a very difficult time period themselves. And as I read, they're still not willing to lend to very many people, including well-capitalized and strong balance sheet companies like D.R. Horton. So clearly, they're not in the game to lend to the small and medium-sized builders. I think where the builders, small and medium-sized builders clearly have an advantage is in the less capital intensive markets. Clearly, Texas is a less capital intensive market. Places like Louisiana, even New Mexico and Arizona. But you get into places like California and Florida and particularly in the northeast, the average lot price is extraordinarily high, and so as a result, it cost -- it's a high risk and a high loan amount for a builder to get a loan from a bank and that takes a lot of equity on many occasions for those small and medium-sized builders on those capital intensive markets to even be in the market.","Stacey H. Dwyer","And to answer your question from a slightly different angle, I think if you look back to the early 80s, even the public builders were dependent on a significant level of bank debt. So we were still talking to the same sources of capital for growth during that time period. Now when you look at the balance sheets, we're using capital markets to pay for it. So it's a different source of lending for us that comes with fewer covenants and a defined timeframe that can't be taken back.","Michael R. Widner - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So just -- I mean, one last point on that. I mean, the early 90s did have some parallels and that we were coming out the S&L crisis. I mean, certainly particularly with regard to mortgage lending or anything residential, it's pretty horrific experience for most banks and there were certainly -- I mean, there's a lot more bank failures actually last time around than this time around. So again just drawing the parallel back to -- on your experience from the last cycle, I mean, does it feel different, worse this time for the banks? Or do you think you have the same amount of kind of running room to again take advantage of their being paralyzed or again any historical comparison I guess would just be helpful.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Just from a personal standpoint, I think the banks today are in a preeminent position. They have the U.S. taxpayers backing, so as a result, they're stronger than they've ever been, and that's different from the last time because in the 80s and the 90s, clearly, the bank failure rate and the savings and loan rate was extraordinarily high so there were very few players in the market to even lend. But today, all of our banks are, I think, extraordinarily well-capitalized. I think what they're waiting for is clearly, some indication that when they make a loan that they're not going to be underwater on the loan 3 months later or 6 months later, because asset values have depreciated. So I think from their perspective and being an ex-commercial banker, I think it's tough to make a loan today just simply from the perspective that your loan-to-value ratio could change overnight. So I think there needs to be -- as it relates to the housing industry, I think there needs to be some small, but rather consistent increasing in valuations on houses and land and lots such that the banks feel comfortable that they're not going to be taking a write-down after they made the loan 3 months later.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Mr. Tomnitz for closing comments.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you. Thank you for joining us on our Q3 conference call. Obviously, we're very proud of what our company has accomplished and most importantly, we're proud of what our people have accomplished. It seems like that people key in on our conference calls to try to determine the level of confidence that we have in the homebuilding industry going forward. And clearly, you should have concluded from this conference call that we feel very good about the U.S. housing market. We feel very strong about our position in the U.S. housing market and that's all on the face of a rather weak macroeconomic environment. We're confident about our future, we're confident about our abilities to continue to capture market share. We're confident about continuing to be able to expand our market share and our profits and our profit margins. So thank you.

Horton team started the year off strong. Our consolidated pretax income for the quarter increased 39% to $523 million on a 14% increase in revenue to $4 billion. Our pretax profit margin improved 230 basis points to 13%, and our net sales orders increased 19%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31st was 18.7% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 18.2%.","These results reflect strength of our operational teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint, and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. We continue to see a good demand and a limited supply of homes at affordable prices across our markets, while economic fundamentals and financing availability remain strong -- solid, excuse me.","Our strategic focus is to continue consolidated market share, while growing our revenues and profits, generating strong annual cash flows and returns, and maintaining a flexible financial position with a conservative balance sheet that includes an ample supply of homes, lots and lands for growth. We are well-positioned for the remainder of 2020 and future years. Mike?","Mike Murray","Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 53% to $1.16 per share, compared to $0.76 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 50% to $431 million, compared to $287 million. Our first quarter results included tax benefit of $32.9 million related to federal energy efficient homes tax credits that were retroactively reinstated. Our consolidated pretax income increased 39% to $523 million in the first quarter and our homebuilding pretax income increased 30% to $462 million.","Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 13% to $3.9 billion on 12,959 homes closed, up from $3.4 billion on 11,500 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 1% from last year to $298,100 and the average size of our homes closed was down 2%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill?","Bill Wheat","Net sales orders in the first quarter increased 19% to 13,126 homes and the value of those orders was $3.9 billion, up 22% from $3.2 billion in the prior year. Our significant sales price increase over the prior year quarter reflects the moderation in demand that occurred in late calendar 2018. Our average number of active selling communities increased 6% from the prior year and was flat sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was $300,900, up 3% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 20% compared to 24% in the same quarter last year. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 21%, flat sequentially from the September quarter, up 100 basis points compared to the prior year quarter and in line with our expectations. Based on today\u2019s market conditions, we currently expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be consistent with the first quarter, subject to possible fluctuations due to product and geographic mix, as well as the relative impacts of warranty, litigation and purchase accounting. Bill?","Bill Wheat","In the first quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 9.2%, down 30 basis points from 9.5% in the prior year quarter. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our growth. Mike?","Mike Murray","We ended the first quarter with 30,200 homes in inventory. 18,400 of our total homes were unsold of which 5,600 were completed. Our first quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.3 billion, of which $890 million was for purchases of land and finished lots, while $410 million was for land development. Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for new communities remained consistent at a minimum 20% annual pre tax return on inventory and return of our initial cash within 24 months. David?","David Auld","At December 31st, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 320,000 lots of which 39% were owned and 61% were controlled through purchase contracts. 33% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 56% of our controlled lots are will be finished when we purchase them. We continue working to increase our lot position being developed by third parties by supporting the growth of Forestar\u2019s national lot manufacturing platform and expanding our relationship with lot developers across the country. Our current lot portfolio includes an ample supply of lots for homes at affordable price points and continues to provide a strong competitive advantage. Mike?","Mike Murray","Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary is a publicly-traded residential lot manufacturer, operating in 51 markets across 20 states. At December 31st, Forestar\u2019s lot position consisted of 44,500 lots of which 32,200 are owned and 12,300 our controlled through purchase contracts. 80% of Forestar\u2019s owned lots are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under the master supply agreement.","During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, Forestar delivered 2,422 lots and is on track to deliver 10,000 lots in fiscal 2020 and generate $800 million to 850 million of revenue. Forestar expects to deliver 12,000 lots and generate $900 million to $1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2021. These expectations are for Forestar\u2019s standalone results.","Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and is committed to maintaining a long-term net debt to capital ratio of 40% or lower. At December 31st, Forestar\u2019s net debt to capital ratio was 9.7%. Forestar has approximately $720 million of liquidity to fund its continued growth, which includes $370 million of unrestricted cash and $350 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. Forestar hosted their quarterly earnings call last Thursday and have an updated presentation on their Investors site and investor.forestar.com that describes Forestar\u2019s unique lot manufacturing model, and a significant growth and value creation opportunity. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Financial services pretax income in the first quarter increased 29% to $30.5 million and the pretax profit margin was 29.6%, up from 27.7% in the prior year. 97% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 65% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 49% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 720 and an average loan to value ratio of 89%. First time homebuyers represented 50% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, reflecting our continued focus on offering homes at affordable price points for entry level buyers.

DHI Communities has four projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at the end of the quarter. DHI Communities\u2019 total assets were $210 million at December 31st. Bill?","Bill Wheat","Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet strength and operating results are providing increased flexibility, and we are utilizing our strong position to enhance the long-term value of the Company. During the first three months of fiscal 2020, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $178.4 million, compared to $396.8 million in the prior year period. At December 31st, we had $2.6 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.4 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage improved 370 basis points to 19.5%. The balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion. And we have $500 million of senior notes maturing on February 15th, which we plan to repay, utilizing cash on hand and our revolving credit facility, as necessary. At December 31st, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $10.2 billion and book value per share was $27.92, up 14% from a year ago.","During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $64.6 million. We also repurchased 3 million shares of common stock for $163.1 million, resulting in $732.6 million remaining on our stock repurchase authorization at December 31, 2019. Our outstanding share count was down 2%, year-over-year. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Looking forward to the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect to generate consolidated revenues in a range of $4.25 billion to $4.4 billion and to close approximately 13,800 to 14,300 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 21% and homebuilding SG&A in the second quarter to be around 9% of homebuilding revenues.","Based on today\u2019s market conditions and our first quarter results, we now expect to generate consolidated revenues for the full year of $18.5 billion to $19.1 billion and to close between 60,000 and 61,500 homes. We expect our income tax rate in the second, third and fourth quarters to be between 23% and 24%. We still expect to generate cash flow from homebuilding operations in excess of $1 billion for the full fiscal year of 2020, and we expect our outstanding share count to be down approximately 2% at the end of the year, compared to the end of fiscal 2019. David?","David Auld","In closing, our results reflect the strength of our well-established operating platform across the country. We are focused on consolidating market share while growing our revenues and profits and generating strong annual cash flows and returns while maintaining a flexible financial position. Our return on equity of 18.2% and our homebuilding return on inventory of 18.7%, demonstrate our consistent focus and efforts. We\u2019re well-positioned to continue this performance with our conservative balance sheet, broad geographic footprint, affordable product offering across multiple brands, attractive finished lot and land position and most importantly, our outstanding experienced teams across the country.","Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Your line is now live.","Carl Reichardt","I wanted to ask something you guys often have talked about is the idea of getting your cash back out of your investments in land within two years. And with some of your peers moving to some of the products and markets that you serve, I\u2019m just curious as to your perspective, David, on the land market in general for affordable homes and your ability to continue to run the model where you\u2019re getting cash out in two years.","David Auld","Well, the cash out in two years is something we stayed with through this -- from the downturn on. And I can tell you that that model has worked very well for us. And I don\u2019t see that changing. And as to the overall market for buying land, again, it comes back to the people we have embedded in these markets and relationships they have with the land\u2019s owners. And we feel very good about our opportunity to replace what we\u2019re building through, and through this market have seen that happen over and over and over again, so.","Carl Reichardt","And then, on similar lines with looking like starts are going to pick up with orders strong for lots of folks, I\u2019m curious as to your perspective on the labor market, subs in particular, and what you\u2019re seeing and thinking about in terms of the potential for increases in cost there this year, as these orders get built out?","David Auld","I think, there\u2019s always going to be that pressure on the cost side. Definitely, labor is getting tighter and continues to -- I think going to restrict a lot of people\u2019s ability to deliver houses. Again, it goes back to the kind of operating profile we adopted and continue, and that is consistent starts throughout the community, expanding the labor base, the efficiency, not necessarily just bodies. And we feel very good about what we\u2019ve accomplished. We have a very loyal trade base. I think I said on the last call, our traders don\u2019t have to go chase their paychecks. So, all of that combines to put us in a great position. Is it going to be a problem? I think less so for us than other people.","Operator","Our next question is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now live.","John Lovallo","First one on the order ASP over -- a little bit over 300,000 in the quarter, that was up pretty nicely a year-over-year. And I know you mentioned that there\u2019s some normalization off of a challenging period last year. But just curious, if we kind of break down that number, is that kind of regional and product mix driven, or are you taking pricing on a like-for-like basis?","Jessica Hansen","Part of it is regionally driven. If you look at our orders this year, the South Central was down 2% in terms of just the mix, the overall mix, and that\u2019s actually our lowest ASP region. So, we continue to expect just modest sale price increases as we move throughout the year, and to cover our costs increases, but on the like-for-like basis nothing significant in the way of price.","John Lovallo","And then, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the Forestar investment. If the plan is to kind of continue to dilute your stake through issuing equity out of Forestar, or are you now considering -- or any plan to potentially sell down your actual ownership position?","Mike Murray","Yes. We\u2019re still on track with our plan there John to ultimately deconsolidate Forestar. We were pleased when they were able to issue their first primary equity offering in September, which diluted our position down from the original 75%; here in December, we\u2019re sitting at 65%. We would expect additional equity issuances from Forestar over time that could continue to dilute our position. And then, as we\u2019ve also said all along, there\u2019s a potential that we could sell some of our shares. And at the point in time that we are ready to do that, we will have a plan in place that will complement the primary equity issuance. And those two things together would result in further dilution in our ownership position.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman and Associates. Your line is now live.","Alan Ratner","So, first one, I think last quarter you guys commented just when you thought about the full-year, your best guess at that point would be that gross margins would be kind of similar in that 21% range. And you obviously hit that this quarter and 2Q guide is similar as well. So, just first off, is there any change in your thinking in terms of the progression in margins through the year, obviously very strong sales environment? So, how should we think about as the year progresses, what happens to margin?","David Auld","I think, we\u2019re going to see consistent margins into the second quarter. And then frankly, as usual this time of the year, the spring selling season will really dictate where margins go in Q3 and Q4. Early returns in the spring selling season have been very positive. So, we\u2019re confident in giving our guidance of consistent margins in the Q2, but we\u2019re going to have to wait and see what happens in the next several weeks.","Alan Ratner","Second question, if I look at your homes in inventory, that\u2019s been -- at least on a year-over-year basis has been trending lower for the last several quarters. I think this quarter you\u2019re down about 10% year-over-year. And obviously, last year was elevated a bit because of the sales -- the tougher sales environment. But, are you seeing a greater component of sales coming from to be built, or have you changed your thinking -- your thought process at all in terms of the optimal number of specs per community that would be translated into that type of decline we\u2019re seeing, or are you trying to amp that higher as the spring gets underway?","David Auld","A couple of things going on with that number, Alan. One, the comparison to prior year, we\u2019re actually down 5%. We\u2019ve changed the way we report homes and inventory to exclude the model homes. So, last year, we were -- where we were last year, like 31,800; and so, this year, we are at 30,200. So, we\u2019re down slightly from last year. And last year may have been a bit elevated with softer sales and operating environment we saw in the fourth calendar quarter of \u201818. Another thing we\u2019ve talked about is getting better at turning our housing inventory to drive a higher return with those investment dollars. And then, we\u2019re also seeing the ability to push starts in as we\u2019re seeing demand come on. We\u2019re not noticing any kind of a difference in the mix between to be built versus our spec starts, continuing probably an 80-20 consistent approach for that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.","Stephen Kim","First question I had for you is on the land spend. The land spend was fairly high relative to our expectations this quarter. I\u2019m talking specifically on the acquisition number of 890. [Ph] And as a percentage of rev, that was probably the highest we\u2019ve seen in six years. And, given your discipline and given your outlook on the business and your intention to basically get a return on that spend within 24 months, it seems that there\u2019s a fair amount of optimism that\u2019s implied by that strong land spend. So, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that, maybe break that down for us, at least qualitatively, in terms of was that kind of a strong land spend fairly equally distributed across the country where there are certain opportunities that emerged in a particular region or a particular product type that garnered a lion share of that? If you could just talk about the relatively strong land spend in greater detail?","Mike Murray","Sure, Stephen. As you know, you start your land spend, there is some lumpiness kind of from quarter-to-quarter. And so, one quarter, just based on the timing of when deals close and when they get ready to go and based on our business plans, there can be a bit of lumpiness there. One thing I would point out is that over half of our land acquisition spend is for finished lots. And so, we continue to dedicate a lot of our spend to finished lots which turn very quickly. And so I would really just attribute -- I wouldn\u2019t say there is necessarily any changes in our plans, but I would attribute a bit of this to a bit of a lumpiness, point out that finished lots are a heavy part of the spend. But, then we do -- we are optimistic. We do see growth, certainty in fiscal \u201820. And right now, we still see very good underlying fundamentals for the business. And so, we are still actively replenishing our land and lot supply.","Jessica Hansen","And we have to replenish it at a faster rate as we continue to grow our sales and closings pace. You have seen our owned lot count remained relatively flat for quite some time. So, it\u2019s really just a function of having to replenish at a faster rate.","Stephen Kim","Great. Yes. That\u2019s helpful. Second question relates to the broader macro environment or rather the broader environment with respect to housing policy. We\u2019ve seen some interesting moves here as of late. We have seen the average DTIs, the high DTIs and high LTV lending be curtailed or reined back the FHFA. And yes, we\u2019ve also heard that CFPD weigh in here and suggest they\u2019re going to move to an APOR spread versus the DTI. I was curious as to whether or not you have looked into this. Some of what we\u2019ve heard is that the move to the APOR spread would actually be stimulative to entry-level housing, on top of the dropping rates. That would seem to be extremely favorable for your business. And I was curious if you had looked at that at all. And if you have any view on whether or not these broader factors may be positive for your business the way it would appear to us?","Jessica Hansen","Sure. High level, I think we\u2019d agree with what you\u2019re saying. That being said, it\u2019s super early and out there and it\u2019s not something that we spend a lot of time on. I\u2019m sure our mortgage company would have a much more detailed response for you. But anything that continues to improve mortgage standards and makes it easier for people to get into a house clearly would be a benefit for our business. That being said, as David mentioned in his opening, financing availability is still good. I mean people that should be buying houses are who are buying houses today. And we\u2019re not necessarily in favor of people with significantly high DTIs or really low credit scores being in a house because we\u2019re very cognizant of what happened last cycle, and we don\u2019t want any repeat of that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.","Truman Patterson","So, your guidance is for mid to high single digit closing growth. You\u2019ve bumped up the high end a little bit. But, is there anything structurally limiting you from going above the high end of that guidance, particularly on the land side and thinking availability of lots, your ability to get lots developed? And that also includes municipality constraints, delaying community openings that might create any kind of gap-outs?","Mike Murray","Truman, we\u2019re really excited about the way this year started off the first quarter and through the first several weeks of January, and we have increased our guidance as a result of that. Structurally, it\u2019s a question of the lots that are out in front of us. We feel good about the community positioning we have, getting some communities opened. But right now, we\u2019re not going to increase our guidance, based on where we are today in the spring selling season. But, we will certainly look to deliver all the homes we can. That\u2019s the best returns we can do in fiscal \u201820.","Truman Patterson","Okay. So, put another way, there\u2019s nothing structurally limiting you on the land side from going above that if the market is a bit healthier than what you expect as of today?","Mike Murray","There is a finite number of homes we can build over the next 8.5, 9 months and deliver by September 30th. But, we\u2019re comfortable with our guidance range today, and we\u2019re just going to have to see what the spring is going to give us and where we end up in our inventory positioning in March and in April and May.","Jessica Hansen","Our guidance already incorporates a higher housing inventory turnover than what we did last year. So, it reflects an improvement in terms of building, selling and closing more houses this year than last year, which is what we continue to be focused on is there\u2019s efficiencies in the business. But that is what limits further upside to our current guidance.","Truman Patterson","Okay. And then, sticking on the land side. Your option lots jumped nicely this quarter, as you all continue rotating towards more option land, how should we think about where that growth comes from? Is it primarily through Forestar? Is it more than even balance between Forestar and your third-party developers? And then, any way you can put out a target over the next couple of years, what you think you can get that option land bank as a percentage of total up to?","David Auld","We\u2019re not going to set a hard target. Internally, we talk about goals, but that\u2019s an internal conversation. And it\u2019s kind of a balanced program. I think, the Forestar platform is again built out. We\u2019re very happy with the progress we\u2019re making there. But, we are also equally focused on our third-party developers. And they are a part of the D.R. Horton family. And that pipeline continues to get better and bigger. And so, it\u2019s a collection of the two. Primarily, it\u2019s just focus. We\u2019re treating capital as if it\u2019s a precious commodity. And we\u2019re going to try to treat it better than anybody else in the industry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Your line is now live.","Matthew Bouley","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, I wanted to ask on the SG&A side, since your guidance implies sort of flat percentage year-over-year, although you are growing the top line and kind of managing that inventory positioning. Is there any reason why we wouldn\u2019t see a bit more leverage? And how should we think about that beyond the next quarter? Thank you.","Bill Wheat","To the extent we\u2019re delivering on our closings guidance and showing mid to high single digit growth in revenue, we do expect to see leverage on our SG&A and improvement year-over-year. We\u2019re very pleased with the 30 basis points we saw in the first quarter. Based on what we see today and the volume we see in Q2, we do expect SG&A to be relatively flat with last year in Q2. But overall, we do expect some leverage for the year.","Matthew Bouley","Okay. I appreciate that. And then, as you just mentioned, I believe to the prior question, your guidance for the Q2 closings does imply kind of a continued uptick on that conversion of your inventory positioning. But, you did also mention earlier that labor is kind of not surprisingly getting tighter. So, can you speak a bit about that balance? And what exactly are you guys doing on the ground that supports that improving efficiency? Thank you.","David Auld","It gets back to -- to me, it gets back to relationships with trade base. And for the last, I don\u2019t know, ever since the downturn, we\u2019ve had a steady and consistent level of production going in our communities. And so, our trade base has gotten better at building the houses. And when they\u2019re not out there chasing work, then they can build more houses. What I look at is the same labor. We build more square footage with the same labor hours. So, it\u2019s a process. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve worked on all the way through this cycle. I think early on, we felt like labor was going to be the constraint on housing. And we have done I think a great job of managing the trade base and making sure that those guys were making money. And we were still delivering houses at a reasonable cost.","Mike Murray","Matt, the other thing we look at here and we watch sort of from a high level perspective is what our build times are doing in our process when we start a house, can we get it completed and then closed. And we\u2019re not seeing those times elongate, which would be real, more acute indicators of labor shortages in various markets. So, the longstanding deep relationships we have with a lot of the labor suppliers, combined with a more efficient plan set, if you will, in our communities and focus on the first time homebuyer and affordability, has driven our ability to continue to turn houses a little bit better, and we\u2019re going to see a lot of improvement in that metric this year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Your line is now live.","Michael Rehaut","First question I had was on your outlook for the year for community count and sales pace. I believe last quarter you talked about, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but you\u2019d expect community count -- average community count for the year to be up year-over-year, low single digits. I was wondering if that\u2019s still the expectation. I believe it\u2019s been flat sequentially more or less for last few quarters, but I guess the expectation would be to drift upward a little bit. And then, also on the sales pace, you had a nice improvement year-over-year. And I was just curious, if that was more driven by market conditions or certain product or geographic mix shifts, and how you think about the next quarter or two?","Jessica Hansen","Sure. So, when we think about community count, Mike, it\u2019s the hardest one for us to predict, quite honestly, which is why we never give formal guidance on it. I think, our base case would be that we would anticipate it to tick up at some point, as we move throughout the year. But when that inflection point actually happens, it\u2019s hard to call exactly. In terms of the sales pace, as we mentioned in the script, that does reflect the moderation in demand we saw in late calendar 2018. So, we did have -- although we generally don\u2019t talk about comps, we did have a relatively easy comp, when you look at that. And what our guidance reflects for the year from a closings perspective would infer that our sales year-over-year increase is going to moderate from Q1 and it will fluctuate Q2, Q3, Q4 in a range that supports that closings growth guidance that we\u2019ve alluded to.","Michael Rehaut","I guess, secondly, bigger picture, kind of maybe piggybacking off an earlier question of owned versus option. Maybe said a different way, your lot option percentage has obviously while huge amounts of progress, impressive progress over the last few years, now, it\u2019s kind of been in that low-60s type of range, 60 to 61, 62, maybe over the last 3, 4 quarters. That increase over the last few years has been a big, big driver of your improved return profile. Just trying to get a sense of over the next 2 or 3 years, certainly, you\u2019re not going to do the same type of degree of change on the lot option profile, as you have before, maybe you\u2019ll drift up a little bit. I do recall you guys talking about a 70% number perhaps, but maybe now that\u2019s not as concrete. But, how should we think about, over the next two or three years, the next big lever of improvement in returns? Would it be more from a share repurchasing standpoint or are other levers that perhaps we\u2019re not thinking about?","Mike Murray","We expect it to be just continued incremental improvement on all for us. We do expect to continue to -- and our goal is to continue to push an option percentage upward. We\u2019re not going to set necessarily an upward target. But, we do expect to incrementally improve that as Forestar grows, build out its platform even further, that\u2019s going to continue to be part of that growth story as well as expanding relationships with our developers. We\u2019ve already alluded to on this call we\u2019re expecting to turn our housing inventory faster this year. And so, that\u2019s going to be an incremental level in terms of returns this year. And then, as our operations are more efficient and generate more cash that gives us more flexibility on the capital allocation side. And so, over the last several years, we have instituted an increasing level of share repurchases and dividend payoffs to shareholders, which has enhanced our ROE. And so, as we continue to incrementally improve each year, I think each one of those levers is going to allow us to continue to incrementally improve both operational returns and returns to shareholders.","Operator","Your next question today is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is now live.","Jack Micenko","I wanted to revisit the pace question a little bit more. The 1Q here, this is I think the -- probably the high watermark since the crisis on sales pace. And I\u2019m curious the guide would suggest that pace will continue to improve through the year, maybe at a slower clip. But, the improvement, looking past year-over-year with the easy comps, but the improvement over the last four or five quarters, is that all product segmentation, or are you seeing lift across all your product types? I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s any regional differential that can drive maybe incremental pace, improvement through the latter half of this year, maybe in the next year?","Mike Murray","I think, we\u2019re seeing generally increased absorptions at our more affordable price points, whether that\u2019s the entire community or certain plans within more the traditional Horton branded communities. We are not heavily exposed to the luxury end of the market. So, we\u2019re not experiencing if there is any lift there or not lift going on there. We can speak to that very well. But, across all of our geographies, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about the traffic, pretty good about the demand, in the most recent quarter and in the quarters leading up to it.","Jack Micenko","And then, maybe the January trend the last couple of weeks, would it be consistent what we saw in the fiscal first or does that build sort of continue in the most recent couple weeks?","Mike Murray","I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve seen normal seasonality week-to-week as we progressed in January. It seems like historically people talked about Super Bowl Sunday being the kickoff to the spring selling season. And we\u2019ve noticed the past few years that seems to be starting a little bit earlier. And maybe it\u2019s because the Cowboys did make the playoffs, people are buying houses sooner. So, we\u2019re excited for Chiefs. And I think\u2026","David Auld","And the 49ers","Mike Murray","And yes -- speak on opportunity.","David Auld","Yes.","Jack Micenko","Just one more for me. A couple of jobs that you\u2019ve got, looks like you\u2019re trying to build a team on the single family rental side. Could you just refresh us on the strategy there and the thoughts, owned versus build for others, and how you\u2019re thinking about the business today?","Mike Murray","Yes. We\u2019re currently think about the business, we\u2019re still early stages on it and we\u2019re trying to get in and really understand the operations of the business and see where we add the most value to that process. Today, it\u2019s probably more dipping our toe in the water on the owned side, but we are certainly looking at it hard, and have not shut the door on any possibility today.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.","Ken Zener","So, you beat your closing guidance. I assume that was on higher intra-quarter order closings. Can you confirm that? And what was the percent for intra-quarter order closing in this 1Q versus last year?","Jessica Hansen","You are correct that beat that. This quarter, it was 40% that we sold and closed in the same quarter, which is slightly higher than we would typically do. I don\u2019t know that I -- I do have last year. Last year, it was 37%.","Ken Zener","Okay. And then, related to that, is there any shift in terms of -- I mean, that\u2019s what I would expect to see efficiency showing up. So, could you talk about if there is anything that you are thinking about in regards to that increase in that percent and talk about the margin spread that you -- or the trend that you guys have been seeing between the backlog closings and specifically the intra-quarter closing units?","Jessica Hansen","On the first part, Ken, I would say, it\u2019s pretty much in line with what we would expect, especially with the number of completed specs that we have. That allows us the opportunity to sell and close more homes within the quarter. So, I would expect that trend to continue. Last year, in the second quarter, we actually sold and closed 45% homes in the same quarter, sold and closed. If you look at the margin differential, that stayed relatively consistent and that there is a slight differential and a slightly lower margin on specs than there is build jobs. That being said, really the only big differential is on our completed specs that have been completed and unsold for a period of multiple months. So, the earlier we sell it as a spec, the tighter that differential is. And as a reminder, about 80% of what we closed in a quarter started as spec. So, when you see that 21% home sales margin we reported this quarter, that\u2019s by and large is a spec gross margin.","Ken Zener","Why is that spec margin a bit lower first backlog if there is a price appreciation? I mean, what is that -- I mean, what is that\u2019s moving? Is that you have to discount it, that seems inconsistent with order strength?","Jessica Hansen","No. it\u2019s that we\u2019re underwriting to a return. And as we turn our spec housing more quickly than build jobs, we are able to work for a slightly lower gross margin and get an equivalent return. In the build job, you are actually going to lose the price appreciation, if you walk in before you start construction. And so, we like selling more in real time and capturing that margin as we move along the way.","Mike Murray","Ken, a lot of our build job sales are actually sales of homes that we had planned to start anyway. They were in the production planning process to start. They just had not stated yet, but they were released to sale on the sales floor. Our average time in backlog for a customer that\u2019s in a build job is not terribly long because our homes -- generally, we are building through affordable price point, homes build fairly efficiently. And so, the customer is not sitting for a long period of time going through a large design selection process, lengthy permitting process till we get to start. A lot of these homes will be starting very soon after they sign the contract. So, it\u2019s a very tight margin differential between just a traditional spec sale to the marketplace.","Ken Zener","I appreciate that. And if I could, one last question. Did you guys pull most of your permits in California to get ahead of the solar mandate? Thank you.","David Auld","No. I don\u2019t think so. We\u2019re responding to market out there. And certainly, the solar mandate is going to increase cost. But, pulling a permit and building a house when there is not a market forward is going to create a whole lot less return than pay any additional cost. So, it\u2019s kind of business as usual for us out there. And the solar mandate was -- we\u2019ve known about that for several years that we\u2019ve had the ability to prepare, and that\u2019s in our underwriting and we knew those costs were coming and as more and more homes are being built with solar, our base case expectation is that those costs will come down.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now live.","Buck Horne","Quick question. Could you just put color on percentage of communities that you were able to raise price on, on a same plan basis?","Mike Murray","Buck, we don\u2019t have that information in terms of tracking across our neighborhoods. We\u2019ve really have empowered our local operators to be looking to meet the market to drive returns, and that is certainly a function of pace and margin. And they\u2019re looking to maximize that at every community, every week, every day frankly as to looking at what that pace is. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re managing centrally. So, we don\u2019t really have the ability to give you that color today.","Jessica Hansen","When we talk about a lot, our revenues per square foot, that\u2019s a metric people -- we\u2019ve consistently reported and we have given that yet today. Year-over-year, our revenue per square foot was up about 3%, and our stick and brick costs were down about 0.5%. Sequentially, our revenues per square foot, and our stick and brick costs per square foot were essentially flat.","Buck Horne","And switching over to just the multifamily investments. Just curious if you could provide any potential quarterly timing of expected sales or closings, or how do you think of potential gains on sale from the multifamily division, either this year, next year? How do you plan on growing that investment going forward?","Mike Murray","Sure. In terms of timing, we expect to close a total of two projects in fiscal 2020. We closed our first one here in Q1. We did say that one of our communities is substantially complete, and so the process of stabilizing the rental situation and marketing it. So, we would expect to close that one later in fiscal 2020, don\u2019t have a specific quarter guide for you on that. And then, we do expect the investment level in the DHI Communities to grow this year. We expect it to grow approximately 100% from the point at the start of the year over the course of this year, as their pipeline is growing, and their number of projects will begin to grow more directly over the course of fiscal 2020, which will ultimately result in some future years, delivering more than two a year. The lead time, the pipeline on those deals is 2 to 3 years long. So, we\u2019re still a couple of years out from a significant increase of volume of project sales in DHI Communities. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Your line is now live.","Jade Rahmani","Thank you. With respect to single-family rental and multifamily, do you have any interest as the company, and any interest in creating a permanent capital vehicle to hold those assets? In my experience, in the REIT sector, the highest valuation is ascribed to continual recurring earnings rather than gain on sale type earnings where it\u2019s unpredictable to the market? Just curious as to your thoughts on that?","Bill Wheat","Yes. I understand that Jade. And it\u2019s something -- we\u2019re aware of that as well. And that\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re studying as we as we get further into this business. Our goals early on have been to ensure that we have a strong, efficient operating platform for beginning with multifamily. And as we look at the single family rental space, we\u2019re looking to do the same thing there. And as we get that established, we then look to growing the platform and setting the capital base for it. And so, as we look at the medium and longer term plans for setting the capital base for both of those businesses, that\u2019s certainly something that we will be considering for the longer term.","Jade Rahmani","Thanks very much. Turning to financial leverage, was wondering if the total debt to capital at slightly below 20% is in line with your long-term target, or do you think there\u2019s potentially improvement in that ratio in years to come?","Bill Wheat","Where we are today, we don\u2019t expect to increase our leverage. We expect to -- as we are generating cash and adding to our equity base that our leverage would not increase from here, and we could see further decreases. Our stated maximum leverage is 35% or below. But obviously, we got a lot of headroom on that today, but that does give us room that in certain scenarios we would leave ourselves some room to invest further and increase leverage, but we don\u2019t see that in the short run.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rohit Seth from SunTrust. Your line is now live.","Rohit Seth","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us an update on what\u2019s happening with the Freedom brand? Any color on that buyer segment?","David Auld","We continue to work on that product offering presentation and lifestyle. It\u2019s something we\u2019re happy with. I think, it will be a larger and larger portion of our deliveries in the future. It\u2019s a growing demographic. And we think we can provide a product and lifestyle that people are going to move into.","Rohit Seth","Would you say -- are you expecting a ramp in that business in your annual guidance or is that annual guidance more driven by kind of that entry level bar? ","David Auld","It\u2019s still the entry level bar driving the market. The Freedom brand for us is part of our long term meet the needs of as many buyers out there as we can. And I think as the market moves, it will become a more and more important part of what we\u2019re doing.","Rohit Seth","Understood. And then, second question on your gross margin guidance, 21%.Can you maybe break out the cost buckets there, what\u2019s your labor cost inflation expectation, material cost and then like cost.","Jessica Hansen","Really just more of the same, so modest increases. I\u2019d say labor has stayed in the low single digit percentage range. Now that we\u2019ve kind of cycled through the lumber headwinds that we had, materials, we essentially would expect to be net neutral. We always have some categories where costs are going up. But, our purchasing teams do a fantastic job of finding other categories to lower our costs and offset whatever increases we\u2019re not able to push back on. And then, land really has been kind of a low to mid single digit percentage increase, at least on a per square foot basis. And that really is not expected to change either. I mean, land costs aren\u2019t coming down. As home prices, land costs typically follow. So, really just more of the same in \u201820 as what we experienced in \u201819, if you take out late calendar \u201818 incentive environment and the lumber costs that we cycled through.","Rohit Seth","And what is the expectation for tariff -- the tariff impact or no impact, or what you have in there? ","Jessica Hansen","We\u2019ve got price protection on most everything. If there is a modest impact from any of the tariffs, we\u2019ve identified ways to offset that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research. Your line is now live.","Mark Weintraub","You mentioned the very positive early returns on spring selling season. Was that largely just a reference to strong orders in January, or was it other things that color that comment?","Mike Murray","The primary thing is the order trends. I mean, that\u2019s the first read we\u2019re getting on what\u2019s coming through. And they\u2019re coming in at a great pace that we\u2019ve expected and we\u2019re seeing good seasonal build, week-to-week with that. And anecdotally, we\u2019re not hearing about any pushback or pressure on pricing from the customer side of the marketplace today.","Mark Weintraub","Kind of following up on that. Obviously, as Jessica just mentioned, you have a fairly benign cost environment now. As things heat up, labor does go higher, materials go higher, et cetera, do you have a sense as to what type of pricing power you might have in the current environment? And really, I recognize it\u2019s always a question of taste versus price. But, I guess, at some point in time, when you try and push price, it could have a bigger impact than at other times. And certainly, we saw that in the last year or two. Do you think that we\u2019ve created a bit more cushion in the environment, so that there would be more leeway on price, if costs start to go up, or do you think we haven\u2019t exited that environment?","Mike Murray","Feel really good about the market conditions we\u2019re seeing today and the buyers that are coming in and their urgency to buy. So, I would say we have some cushion to work with in that. But again, we\u2019re not just looking at a margin number, it is a return numbers, as you alluded to before, the pace versus price. And so, driving the communities at the planned absorptions, we found drive the highest returns. And then, the activity that begets that coming out of buyers seeing activity, seeing momentum, drives generally some pricing power and some margin expansion, executing at the community level. And that\u2019s really where our focus is. And as it\u2019s rolling up, we\u2019ve seen pretty consistent margins the last couple quarters and we\u2019re looking at that into next quarter. We\u2019re optimistic about spring, and that\u2019s going to tell us where margins ultimately go for this year.","Mark Weintraub","And one last one. Where are your thoughts on offsite manufacturing as a way to potentially mitigate or improve the labor side of things in time?","Mike Murray","So, we have -- a lot of our homes are put together with trusses, roof trusses that are manufactured offsite. Others, we\u2019re doing wall penalization in certain markets. And it\u2019s something we continually evaluate to look at the most efficient from both a time and a cost perspective as to how to deliver the home at the best value to the buyer. So, we\u2019re always evaluating it. We haven\u2019t seen a sea change in the economics of that today. Most of our homes are probably stick framed with trusses would be probably the broad generalization to say. But, there are some markets where we build roofs onsite.","Mark Weintraub","Great. Thank you.","Mike Murray","Vary across the country.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jay McCanless from Wedbush. Your line is now live.","Jay McCanless","Just two questions. On incentives, what are you guys doing with incentives now? And more importantly, what are you seeing from your competition?","Bill Wheat","Pretty stable environment there. Certainly on a year-over-year basis, our incentives are down significantly, but over the last couple of quarters, been pretty stable. It\u2019s a normal environment where there\u2019s usually some level of incentives related to closing costs. And then, community-by-community, there could be some specific incentives but nothing out of the ordinary certainly in our business. And really, we\u2019re seeing pretty rational environment across other builders as well not hearing anything out of the ordinary.","David Auld","I\u2019d say, the market is good. People are, as Bill said, performing rationally. It -- good time to be a homebuilder.","Jay McCanless","My second question. Just talking about what your average lot per community is right now and are you expecting that the trend up just to get the higher year-over-year unit closures you talked about the guidance?","Jessica Hansen","It slightly trended up here over the last couple of years, Jay, as our absorptions have improved, that does allow our underwriting to hit our standards and use slightly larger communities. So, I would say that is incorporated in what we\u2019re expecting for fiscal \u201820, but that\u2019s really just been more of the same of what we\u2019ve experienced each of the last few years. Multiple product types and larger communities allows us to drive more absorption. So, I don\u2019t have our current average lot size or a lot count. Rough, I would say probably 150, 200 lots. But obviously, we\u2019ve got significant variation in that. We\u2019ve got communities that are 30 lots, we\u2019ve got a communities are a 1,000 lots.","Mike Murray","Some more options, some more owned. There\u2019s a big mix there.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Alex Barron from Housing Research Center. Your line is now live.","Alex Barron","I guess, I just wanted to circle back a little bit to the guidance. Over the last two quarters, orders have been double digit and a little bit off of that was maybe easier comp. But, I guess, I\u2019m just curious, you guys just being conservative this early in the spring selling season basically, giving the single digit order growth guidance or delivery guidance?","Jessica Hansen","So, Alex, not to be repetitive, but really, it is a function of where we sit today, the number of houses we have, the number of houses we had going into the year. We did have a much easier comp this quarter compared to late calendar last year, when the market was completely different than what it is. And to remind everyone, we heavily incentivized into December and really ended the spring to continue those sales increases that we saw. I think, we were the only builder in calendar 4Q of \u201818 that had an up quarter. Our sales were up about 3%, and that really was just a function of how heavily we incentivized in December to get there. So, October and November, you can read into were very tough months. And that led into a good comp this year, and 19% you though. I mean, it\u2019s a good market. As Mike\u2019s alluded to several times, we feel very good about the market today. But, we sit here today, we haven\u2019t seen the spring selling season. We\u2019ve got 5% fewer houses in the ground. So, if we\u2019re able to push and get a few more starts in, and the spring is stronger than expected, could there be a little upside, potentially, but we don\u2019t see a whole lot. And we did already raise the higher end of our guidance by about 500 homes.","Mike Murray","And on balance, we\u2019re looking at much stronger returns in fiscal 2020, because we\u2019re still seeing a good pace. Even at the guidance level, we\u2019re seeing a good pace, at better margins, better returns and a better turn of our inventory this year as well. So, we\u2019re very pleased with our positioning with the good market backdrop, and with our plan for the year.","Alex Barron","Got it. And then, you mentioned that the best returns come from maintaining the sales pace pretty strong. So, we [indiscernible] you are seeking to push prices so much to not upset that strong sales pace?","Jessica Hansen","It depends on the community, Alex. It really just depends. If we\u2019ve got another community replacing a community ready to go behind it, we\u2019re going to most likely push more pace than we are priced because that\u2019s the best thing that we can do is continue to turn our inventory, generate more revenue and profits in a shorter period of time. But, if it\u2019s an area of the country where we don\u2019t have a replacement community or for whatever reason that community is not replaceable, we are going to be more likely to push price. So, it\u2019s always a balance community-by-community.","Alex Barron","Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks and good luck this year.","Mike Murray","Thank you, Alex.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to David for any further or closing comments.","David Auld","Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speaking to you again in April. And to the D.R. Horton team, outstanding first quarter. Thank you for your focus and hard work, and we\u2019ve got a great year set up, let\u2019s go deliver it.","Operator","So, thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States, Fiscal Year End and Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Donald J. Tomnitz, President and CEO. Thank you. You may begin.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you, and good morning. Joining me this morning are Bill Wheat, Executive Vice President and CFO; Stacey Dwyer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer; and Mike Murray, now Senior Vice President and Controller. Before we get started, Stacey.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Some comments made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different.","All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","D.R. Horton's financial results in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 were our strongest performance since 2006, reflecting the improving conditions in our housing markets and, most importantly, the effective repositioning of our company over the last 5 years.","For the fourth quarter, pretax income was $99.2 million, the highest of the last 22 quarters. Our quarterly net sales orders improved 24% from last year, and our average sales price contributed to a 35% increase in the value of net sales orders. Our positive year-over-year sales comparisons continued through October and into the first part of November. Our backlog of sales orders increased 49% compared to last year, and our backlog value is up 61%, which puts us in a position for a strong first quarter of fiscal 2013.","Fiscal 2012 was D.R. Horton's most profitable year in the last 6 years with $242.9 million of pretax income. Essentially all of our operating metrics improved in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. Our sales, closings and backlog all increased by double-digit percentages.","Our gross margin on home sales revenues increased 160 basis points. Our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues improved 100 basis points.","In response to our sales growth, we have increased our investments in homes under construction, finished lots, land and land development to position ourselves for future growth. Our increased investments also include the acquisition of the homebuilding assets of Breland Homes during the quarter, the 38th largest homebuilder in the U.S. in 2011 according to Builder magazine.","These investments are fueling our increasing profits even though macroeconomic conditions and outlook remain soft and uncertain. We are finding opportunities to take market share in existing markets while evaluating attractive new submarkets. Our entry-level business remains strong while we're expanding our product offerings for move up buyers.","To fuel our expected growth, we entered into a revolving credit facility during the year and raised $700 million of additional capital through 2 senior note issues, both at very attractive interest rates. Even after these capital raises, our balance sheet remains extremely strong, with net homebuilding leverage of only 21% and gross leverage of 39%.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","In the fourth quarter, our homebuilding operations generated pretax income of $85.7 million compared to $27.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Our financial services operations generated pretax income of $13.5 million compared to $6.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Our net income for the quarter increased to $100.1 million, or $0.30 per diluted share.","Our diluted share count this quarter included 38.3 million shares related to our convertible senior notes. When these shares are dilutive, they're added to the diluted EPS denominator, and the associated interest expense and amortized issuance costs are added back to net income to calculate diluted EPS. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we estimate that these shares and the related costs would be included in our diluted EPS only if quarterly pretax income is approximately $140 million or higher, which after applying a 38% income tax rate, would be approximately $87 million of net income.","For fiscal 2012, we generated pretax income of $242.9 million compared to $12.1 million in fiscal 2011. Our net income for the year increased to $956.3 million, which included a tax benefit of $713.4 million, primarily from the reduction in the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets that we recorded in the June quarter.","Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 20% to $1.3 billion on 5,575 homes closed, up from $1.1 billion on 4,987 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $231,100, up 7% compared to the prior year and up 3% sequentially. We expect that our backlog conversion rate will continue to revert closer to historical seasonal norms. For the first quarter, we expect our conversion rate to be in the mid-60% range.","Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Net sales orders for the fourth quarter increased 24% from last year to 5,276 homes. Our active selling communities were flat from the year-ago quarter. However, we expect our community count to increase 5% to 10% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.","Our average sales price on net sales orders of $237,800 increased 9% compared to the year-ago quarter and 2% sequentially. The cancellation rate for the fourth quarter was 27% compared to 29% on the year-ago quarter.","Our sales backlog at September 30, 2012, increased 49% from the prior year to 7,240 homes. The value of this backlog increased 61% to $1.7 billion from $1 billion a year ago. Our sales pace has continued to produce strong year-over-year order comparisons through October and into the first part of November.","Mike?","Mike Murray","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 18.1%, up 200 basis points from the year-ago period. 150 basis points of the increase was due to improving market conditions resulting in fewer incentives and discounts and higher average selling prices, while 30 basis points of the increase was due to lower amortized interest and property taxes. The remaining 20 basis points of the increase was due to lower estimated costs for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenues.","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue for the fiscal year was 17.7%, up 160 basis points from the prior year. 120 basis points of the increase was due to improving market conditions resulting in fewer incentives and discounts and higher average selling prices, while 50 basis points of the increase was due to lower amortized interest and property taxes. These increases were partially offset by a 10-basis-point decrease due to higher estimated cost for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenue.","Our expectation for our first quarter home sales gross margin is in the low 18% range, consistent with the fourth quarter. We expect further improvement in our margin in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012.","Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Homebuilding SG&A expense for the quarter was $146 million compared to $124 million in the prior-year quarter. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A improved 40 basis points to 11.2% from 11.6%.","For fiscal 2012, homebuilding SG&A expense was $529 million compared to $480 million in fiscal 2011. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A improved 100 basis points to 12.5% from 13.5% a year ago. We are leveraging our fixed cost structure, while at the same time rebuilding the sales and production side of the business to meet increasing demand for our homes and mortgages.","Our number of employees increased 16% from a year ago to approximately 3,500 at September 30. In the first quarter of 2013, we expect our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues will increase seasonally from the fourth quarter due to fewer closings. For fiscal 2013, we expect our SG&A percentage to improve compared to fiscal 2012 as we close more homes and continue to leverage our fixed cost structure. Mike?","Mike Murray","Financial services pretax income for the quarter was $13.5 million, a 110% improvement from $6.4 million in the year-ago quarter. 84% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. Our mortgage company handled the financing for 59% of our homebuyers this quarter, with virtually all loans meeting eligibility requirements for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae.","FHA and VA loans accounted for 51% of our mortgage company's volume this quarter, down from 60% in the year-ago quarter. Our mortgage company's new borrowers during the quarter had an average FICO score of 716 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 91%. First-time homebuyers represented 49% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Stacey?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Our income tax benefit for fiscal 2012 was $713.4 million. As we discussed on our last quarter conference call, we reduced our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by $716.7 million during third quarter based on our determination that it was more likely than not that we will generate sufficient income in future periods to realize the substantial majority of our deferred tax assets.","In the fourth quarter, our valuation allowance was reduced further for our fourth quarter income. Our net deferred tax asset on our balance sheet is $709.5 million at September 30, of which $188.9 million relates to our available carryforwards of net operating losses for tax purposes. The remaining deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $41.9 million at year end relates to certain state NOLs, which may not be realized due to shorter carryforward periods in those states.","Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect to report income tax expense at a tax rate of approximately 38%. Until we have utilized our NOL carryforwards, the majority of the tax expense recorded will not require cash but will reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax asset. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","Since June, our total inventory increased by approximately $304 million, reflecting a $110 million increase in homes in inventory and a $194 million increase in our land and lot inventory. Our homes in inventory at the end of September totaled 13,000 homes, up 800 from last quarter. As of September 30, 1,100 of our homes were models, 6,400 were speculative homes and 2,100 of the specs were completed. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","In our fourth fiscal quarter, our investments in land, lots and development costs totaled $491 million as we continue to buy new communities and replenish our finished lots supply to meet increasing demand. During the fiscal year, we spent $1.4 billion on land, lots and development cost, which is up from $790 million in the prior year.","We continue to purchase or option finished lots in many markets and are also investing in land acquisition and development opportunities to ensure we have adequate lot supplies in desirable markets. Our general underwriting guidelines on our new deals continue to be: a gross margin of 20% or higher and a 2-year return of initial cash.","At September 30, 2012, we controlled approximately 153,000 lots, of which 95,000 are owned and 58,000 are option. 25,000 of our owned lots and 35,000 of our option lots are finished. 60,000 total finished lots we control at year end are up 25% sequentially and 40% from a year ago. Mike?","Mike Murray","During the quarter, we purchased the homebuilding operating assets of Breland Homes for $105.9 million in cash. With the acquisition of Breland, we now operate in Huntsville, Alabama and the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, and we strengthened our position in the Mobile, Alabama market. At the date of acquisition, we acquired approximately 300 homes in inventory, 1,000 finished lots and entered into option contracts to control approximately 3,700 lots.","We also acquired a sales order backlog of 228 homes valued at $46.9 million. Subsequent to the acquisition date in August, our fourth quarter results include 118 net sales for $24.3 million and 114 closings for $22.4 million from the Breland operations. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat","To support our growth plans, we issued $350 million of 10-year 4.375% senior notes during the quarter. This increased our ending balance of homebuilding unrestricted cash and marketable securities to $1.3 billion. The balance of our public notes outstanding at September 30 was $2.3 billion. Our next debt maturity of approximately $172 million is in May 2013.","At September 30, our homebuilding leverage ratio, net of cash and marketable securities, was 21.4%, and our gross homebuilding leverage was 39.1%. During the quarter, we entered into a 5-year $125 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Subsequent to year end, we obtained additional commitments from banks and increased the size of the facility to $600 million. The facility's uncommitted accordion feature was also amended to allow an increase in the size of the facility to $1 billion. Don?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Our fiscal 2012 results reflect our consistent and dramatic efforts to reposition and strengthen our company through the recent downturn. Specifically, we just completed our most profitable quarter in the last 22 quarters and our most profitable fiscal year in 6 years. Our fiscal 2012 reflects increased sales, increased gross margins, increased closings, increased backlogs, increased ASPs, improved SG&A percentage. We are well positioned with our broad national footprint, which we kept largely intact throughout the downturn, our current inventory to capture demand, our land and lot position, our cash and marketable securities. We are focused on prudently and profitably increasing our industry-leading market share in 2013 and thereafter.","Finally, D.R. and I would like to personally thank our DHI teammates for their hard work and extraordinary industry accomplishments. We're excited by the opportunities we see in fiscal 2013 and beyond. Please keep up the good work.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we will host any questions you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Question. You're obviously [indiscernible] guidance. But [indiscernible] 5% to 10%. Historically, you've talked about your units under construction being roughly half of your forward 12 months delivery, which supply roughly 26,000 [indiscernible] kind of 35%. Would you say your past trends have changed as you look into fiscal 2013?","Bill W. Wheat","No, Ken. We wouldn't necessarily say that anything has changed. We're certainly trying to make sure we are in a strong position to support whatever growth the market will allow next year, and we're certainly focused on gaining market share in 2013. So we plan to do that through increasing our community count, and we're also going to make sure that our homes and inventory position is in a strong position to capture the growth.","Stacey H. Dwyer","One thing that we're very cognizant of, though, is if you take our 13,000 homes and multiply by 2, you come up with 26,000. From an inventory perspective, we think we're well positioned that we can deliver that. However, it's going to take the demand side of the equation as well. So we're ready for the demand, but we do need to see the demand to be able to meet those deliveries.","Bill W. Wheat","And then we'll continue to add homes and adjust our spec inventory and our lot inventory based on the demand we see.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And to help Stacey manage expectations, please recall that our 13,000 units also include 1,000 models. So we actually have 12,000 units that are for sale and closable.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. Okay, I got that. I guess another way to think about it, as the downturn progressed and you had more speculative units, which reflected first-time buyers, you said your spec count would kind of just mirror your first-time buyers. If they were 49%, do you expect that'll kind of change in 2013 related to your community mix and offerings?","Bill W. Wheat","Well, we'll see. It depends on demand. Right now, it's right in line with our first-time homebuyers. We're at 49% specs, and I believe we had 49% first-time homebuyers this quarter. We certainly have a strong first-time homebuyer business, and we plan on continuing to build on that. As the move-up part of the business and the build-to-order part of the business grows, that could result in a lower spec percentage. But we'll really just adjust with what we see in the market.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And please don't recall -- or please recall that our spec inventory has a tendency to increase specifically in December, January and February as we prepare for the selling season. So it's not unusual for our spec percentage to increase somewhere up in the mid-50% to 60% level.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The first question I had was around gross margins. You've had nice improvement this year, particularly on a year-over-year basis, and you also mentioned that you expect first quarter to be in the low 18% range, so maybe in and around where it's been the last couple quarters, maybe a few bps higher. Some of your peers have had pretty good sequential improvement in the September quarter versus the June quarter as they've seen continued benefits from pricing and reduced incentives. How are you -- how do you see that come through in your own numbers? I guess you've had kind of steady gross margin sequentially. Perhaps if you could kind of discuss your pricing over the last 2, 3 quarters, how it's gone, and also to the extent that some of that's perhaps potentially been offset by higher land costs or material labor cost?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, clearly, I would say to you that we are seeing pricing power as we move from market to market to market. Also, with the extraordinarily low 4.5-months' supply of new homes available for purchase today, we believe that purchasing power will continue to increase. We also had 160 basis points, as we indicated, improvement in our gross margins, of which 120 basis points was due to fewer incentives.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Yes. And Mike, I think another thing you're seeing in our margin in particular is we began refreshing our inventory and tying up finished lot contracts way back in 2009. And so the mix of our closings that have been coming from those newer communities last year was already right around 50%. That continues to improve this year, but our margin should already reflect some of that repositioning effort in a year-over-year comparison.","Donald J. Tomnitz","As we continue to pursue new land and lot deals and approve them, we are still finding those deals meeting our underwriting guidelines, which is 20% greater -- 20% or equal to, greater -- equal to gross margins and our return of cash within the 24 months. So we do not see a lack of low -- or high-margin lot deals out there. We're not replacing our current lot position with less than 20% gross margin deals.","Bill W. Wheat","And when we put it all together, we do expect margins to probably improve slightly here in the first quarter, the low 18% range. And we do expect further improvement as we move through fiscal 2013, based on what we can see right now.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. Great. I appreciate that. Second question on the community count. You mentioned that it was flat, and I'm not sure if that was sequentially or year-over-year. Maybe you could clarify that. But looking into '13, you expected community count to be up 5% to 10%. And just want to also clarify on that, if that's an average growth of community count for '13 versus '12, which potentially might imply -- I mean, maybe we can just establish whether or not that growth would be kind of similar throughout the year, or if community count would be rising throughout the year, that you would end the year, let's say 4Q '13 over 4Q '12, at about a 10%-plus type number?","Bill W. Wheat","Sure. The flat community count was a year-over-year comparison. On a sequential basis, our community count -- our selling communities were up 3% sequentially. As we look at the year for fiscal 2013, the 5% to 10% range is a general range that we would expect to characterize the full year of fiscal 2013. Our average selling -- our communities are growing right now, and we would expect right now for that to continue to grow. But part of that's going to be based on the demand we see during fiscal 2013. So we feel like the 5% to 10% is a fair range based on what we can see today. Is it possible that if demand continues to improve we continue to invest and open new communities that we could be a 10% or better this time next year? That's certainly possible.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Clearly, our goal is, is to continue to increase our market share and our footprint, and we are not seeing a lack of good deals out there in the marketplace. We're seeing plenty of good deals to continue to replace our lot positions as we roll off from existing land and lot deals.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Was wondering, you were talking about the -- seeing plenty of good land deals out there. With the acquisition of Breland -- in the past, that would have been something -- entering those markets would have been something you would have done with your satellite market strategy. How do you think about the opportunities in terms of small company acquisitions in that style versus just land deals out there in terms of profitably growing market share over the coming year?","Mike Murray","We look at every deal and every market individually, and we will still enter new markets on a satellite basis. And we will still look at given opportunities. The Breland acquisition was a bit unique in that we were able to align ourselves with a very strong developer in those markets and maintain an ongoing relationship, that we would start with a large relationship and would continue to be able to be a significant supplier of lots to us for the coming years. We tied up 3,700 lots in addition to what we bought on day one. That takes a little bit of time to accumulate on kind of a greenfield or a satellite market strategy. So we felt very good about the ability to get into those markets in a big way quickly with that kind of a smaller company acquisition. But it's not to say that every market we enter into would have to be through acquisition. We're also still look at greenfields very seriously every time we evaluate an acquisition.","Donald J. Tomnitz","But there are a number of satellite opportunities and city opportunities available to us, primarily because of our low SG&A structure. And that permits us the opportunity to go into markets which other builders find unattractive.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then second question, just wondering what your goals would be in terms of price when you talked about the entry level versus doing more -- in terms of move-up as that market improves. Given where we are in terms of affordability right now and the rising rents that have been coming through in the rental market, why not just continue to really focus on that first-time market which you know so well? Is there not enough opportunity there?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I think there's extraordinary opportunities in the first-time housing market, as we see with our 49% of our business is first-time homebuyer. The key is though, is we see people coming into our model homes, there are a number of move-up buyers, people who are either deciding they're going to retire or their homes are worth a little bit more or if they're willing to accept the price they can get for their existing home and they're willing to pay current prices to get into a new community, which I feel and they feel has higher appreciation potential on a new home than an existing home. So I feel like, generally speaking, we are very well focused on both markets, the first time and the move-up buyer, and we don't want to leave that move-up buyer to any of our competitors.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger with Wells Fargo.","Unknown Analyst","This is Joey on for Adam. My first question is if you could elaborate a little bit on your slowing backlog conversion. I know you gave some guidance for next quarter, next year, of mid-60s. But I was just wondering this quarter if there are any large things we should be aware [ph] of in terms of why it was slowing down?","Stacey H. Dwyer","This is really just a return to more normal operating metrics that we're seeing in gross margin and SG&A and also in our backlog conversion. We've seen an increase in the number of build-to-order homes in our backlog. And those, by definition, will just take a little longer for us to build and then deliver. Our spec percentage has worked down to where it's under 50% now. We were running with a higher spec percentage and, more specifically, a higher completed number of specs. We've worked that down, so we don't have the same immediate closing opportunities that we had before, which is really a more normal business model for us. So we still expect our conversion rate in this first quarter of 2013 to be elevated compared to historical norms. We typically see, in our first quarter, somewhere in the mid-50%. That'd be consistent in the second quarter. And then in the third quarter, we'd be getting into the 60% range. And in the fourth quarter, we might approach a 70% on historical levels. So the 76% we just realized compared to what we would typically run before the downturn is very normal. It's actually still high.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Please recall, though, as we've focused on that second-time homebuyer, they typically are buying a larger, more expensive home, and they're a little bit more discriminating than the first-time homebuyer. So as a result, it's taking a little bit longer to produce those, but it's still a very profitable segment of the industry that we continue to expand and we'll capitalize on.","Mike Murray","And also, a positive note on that is we have much better visibility with our backlog than we've had when we were converting 90-plus percent. So now when we look at our backlog and you're going to convert mid-60s, you still have more of that backlog that gives you visibility beyond just the next quarter.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And clearly, that gives us a much better opportunity in pricing power because when we are converting 90% of our backlog each and every quarter, a lot of that had to do with closing specs within 30 days, and we were struggling to meet sales goals and closing goals. So as a result, the fact that we have fewer or lower conversion, I think enhances our profitability on a go-forward basis.","Unknown Analyst","Great. My second question is if you could elaborate on your pricing power, what you talked about, seems like you're a little bit optimistic about it going forward. How do you see the pricing power versus raw material, labor cost inflation playing out over the next few quarters?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, clearly, we focus on the cost side of this business very, very closely, and we do that from a national purchasing basis with Brad Conlon, who leads our national purchasing region, as well as on a division by division and region by region. There are costs that are going up. As I've said for the last 20-some-odd years that I've been in this business, our goal is to control our increases and to make certain that we have pricing power as we move forward in market-by-market. As I look at the low inventory of finished homes, with just 4.5-month supply of new homes compared to where that number was, which I think it was double-digits at one point in time, 10-, 11-months' supply, clearly, the buyer who's coming into our subdivision has much more incentive and much more timing in order to make that purchase because there's not the excess inventory sitting out there in the marketplace. So the function of low inventory is going to increase our pricing power as we move forward.","Unknown Analyst","And just to clarify on that, your pricing power, is that relative to rising costs? Or is that just gross increasing prices...","Donald J. Tomnitz","It's a combination of both.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Locker with FBN Securities.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to see what your incentive compensation was in your SG&A this year versus a year ago?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Joel, I'm not sure we have that number right in front of us at this moment. It was one of the larger increases in the quarter.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes, certainly. With the profitability of the company increasing, our incentive comp is largely based on the profitability at our division, region and our company level.","Stacey H. Dwyer","And it's also based on what our stock price. And so our stock price has had a very strong performance throughout the quarter. I'd be happy to follow up with you with a little bit more specific information on that.","Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division","Sure. Just a follow-up on what your customer deposits were at the end of the fiscal year?","Donald J. Tomnitz","And just while they're looking that up, I will say that I believe that our management team at D.R., all the way to our regional presidents to our division presidents, are still the best buy in the industry. Got it?","Stacey H. Dwyer","Yes.","Mike Murray","$22.7 million. Customers made deposits on 7,240 units in backlog, average of just over $3,000 a unit.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Rob Hansen on for Nishu. I just wanted to see if you could kind of describe the thought process around the $700 million in capital raises this year and if this was more opportunistic? Or are you kind of targeting some type of cash level or a debt-to-cap ratio? Yes, so I just wanted to get some thoughts around that.","Bill W. Wheat","That's really all of the above. We certainly as we see improved sales demand, we certainly have expectations to grow our business and are planning to increase our investments in our business. So we want to make sure we're in good position with our cash balances to support that growth. Certainly, the capital markets have been very favorable this past year, and certain windows have been extremely favorable. So we felt good about our execution on our debt deals and the rates we've been able to achieve there. So the timing of some of the deals was certainly opportunistic from a capital markets standpoint. As we go forward, we are targeting to still keep a healthy cash balance. We have been keeping a cash balance in excess of $1 billion. However, now that we have implemented a revolving credit facility with $600 million capacity, we probably will bring our cash balances down a bit. So it would not surprise us if our cash balances were below $1 billion in some future quarters, because we have the flexibility of the $600 million of extra liquidity available to us through our revolver. But in terms of our overall leverage targets, we would still expect to keep our gross homebuilding leverage in the 40% to 45% range or lower. And then our net basis would -- net leverage would simply be that less whatever cash balance we choose to keep.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And please realize, as we continue to grow our finished lot supply, there are adequate finished lot supplies available in most of our markets today. There are few of our markets where that finished lot supply is being depleted, and we are having to begin to develop lots for ourselves again. And as we move into this recovery, we will be developing a bigger and bigger percentage of our lots simply because there won't be a finished lot supply available in the marketplace.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And have you already started buying more -- a little bit more of this undeveloped land? Or -- it seems like that's somewhat of a change.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Yes, we have, and it's on a market-by-market basis. Let me clearly say, currently, the vast majority of the deals that we are approving at the corporate office and our regions are submitting to us are for finished lots that someone else owns. And a lot of those are rolling option deals where we're buying the lots as we need them. Some of them, there's such good pricing on them, and we have to be a first mover that we've had to cash out those finished lots. But we're supplementing that with development of land deals where we're buying the land and taking it through the -- actually, we're taking it through the entitlements, buying the land and then developing the lots. But that's a small percentage of our business of finished lots, but it will continue to increase as we move forward.","Bill W. Wheat","As we buy land and we develop land, we are still focused on achieving a cash return -- initial return of our cash of 24 months or less.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just one other question is you guys have been kind of an industry leader on the SG&A side. So with the Breland acquisition, is there any room for further expense control coming out of Breland? And was there any impact this quarter?","Mike Murray","Breland was a very well-run, profitable builder. It wouldn't take them long to be Hortonized. They were actually -- already ran a very low SG&A rate. So I don't look for a lot of improvement in their SG&A rate, but it does leverage more of our central resources across their revenue base. We didn't have to leverage up anything at corporate for the region level to support those operations.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Barclays.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First question relates to your mortgage company statistics. Just want to, first of all, confirm, I think you said you had a 51% capture rate but -- if you could just correct me if I'm wrong there. But can you generally describe what you think the quality of the buyers, in terms of the credit quality of the buyers, is for the unit -- for the home buyers who are not going through your mortgage company? Would we generally be correct in presuming that these are probably higher-quality borrowers? Or would you think that, for whatever reason, that actually it's folks who are more credit challenged who would not be using your mortgage company?","Stacey H. Dwyer","First of all, the capture rate was 59%. And really, we don't have great visibility into the credit metrics for the people who don't go through our mortgage company. Part of our capture rate is driven by not having the mortgage company in every market where we operate. So there's a portion of just our national footprint we don't capture. And beyond that, really, what we usually hear is someone has an existing relationship with another lender or they've shopped our rates in the market. It's less about credit quality and more just about cost and opportunity.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","How about in terms of FHA exposure? For example, if someone was going to use an FHA loan, do you think that your capture rate for those kinds of loans would be higher than the 59%?","Stacey H. Dwyer","I don't know because we wouldn't know if they didn't use our mortgage company, if they used an FHA loan. Or I shouldn't say we wouldn't know that, but we don't track that. We just don't have that information.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's fine. That's fine. And then the second question I had related to your sub count again. I know that you've -- actually, I'm sorry, your SG&A. I know you got a couple of questions. But you're -- I'm intrigued by your commentary about the backlog turnover sort of getting back to a more normal kind of a level, and I think that, that reflects a pretty significant reduction from where you've been going. But if your backlog conversion ratio is getting back to normal, then that would imply perhaps that your community level efficiency might also begin to approach normalization. And yet your SG&A ratio for 2012 is in the mid-12% range. It's still significantly higher than what you've done in the past, which is more like 10%. So my question is if we're seeing backlog conversion ratios getting back to normal in 2013, how long do you think it'll be before we start to see SG&A as a percentage of your homebuilding revenues back to something closer to normal as well?","Bill W. Wheat","Well, it's certainly -- it's on the path to getting back to normal. We had 100 basis points improvement in our SG&A ratio this year, even while backlog conversion rates also declined this year. We would expect further leverage on our SG&A as we grow in the coming year. And whether that's -- we're back to 10%, the timing will depend on how much the top line grows and how much we're able to leverage. But we believe we will continue to make steady progress back to our industry-leading level of 10% SG&A.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Steve, this sort of goes back to one of my favorite comments by Todd Horton, \"No good deed shall go unpunished.\" We have one of the leading, if not the leading, SG&A rates in the industry. And you're wondering when it's going to get lower. Well, believe me, we're focused on getting that lower, but we pretty much have a core -- if you look at our SG&A for the year, as I recall, it ran $529 million, which is down from like $1.5 billion at the peak. So as a result, I think where we are today, we have a core group of people, core operators, and the business will continue to grow and increase. And that'll drive down our SG&A percentage.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask on your overall lot count and open communities. Do you happen to know how many lots or what percentage of the total is represented by communities that are currently open?","Donald J. Tomnitz","We don't have that at our fingertips here, Jade. We can do some checking and get back to you on that.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. On the deals you're doing, is the number of lots per community increasing?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I would say yes. But again, I'd go back to my earlier statement and that is, with our low SG&A, we can do much smaller deals than the typical builder. And we do, do. We'll do deals of 20-lot subdivisions all the way up to 200-lot subdivisions. So it's increasing largely because of the fact that a lot of the deals that we're seeing out of the banks and the developers are larger positions that they're just now bringing to market. And so we are focusing on clearly those larger deals because, as we say, it takes the same amount of time to do a 20-lot deal as it does a 200-lot deal. Again, our focus is largely on how do we get our initial cash investment back within 24 months.","Bill W. Wheat","And if you go back a little over a year ago, our cash return hurdle was 12 months. So we were doing very small communities, primarily only finished lots at the time. So as the market has turned, we are certainly willing to do a little bit larger communities as long as we can get our initial cash back.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then regarding mothballed communities, since your land held for development decreases, is it safe to assume you de-mothballed communities? And could you indicate how many you currently have mothballed?","Bill W. Wheat","We have pulled some mothballed communities into production. The land held for development dollars of $644 million is a decline from where it's been. That now represents about 41,000 lots. And I believe this time a year ago, it was around 44,000 or somewhere in that ballpark. So we pulled a few thousand lots out of mothball.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And as the market continues to recover ever so slightly, we will and are beginning to take obviously pieces of land out of our mothballed assets. There are assets though in there that could be in there for the next 3 to 5 years, but we will take them out as the market dictates, but they're economically feasible for us to do so.","Mike Murray","And it's not -- all of those assets are not all mothballed. Some of them may be future phases of deals that we're currently active in the front of. We just have -- we don't expect to get to those phases for -- generally over 12 to 18 months, is our classification window there.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can you give an indication of what the cash outlays per community would be to de-mothball a community?","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, that varies widely. Typically, it is land that requires development so we would be having to put in almost the full amount of development typically for each lot that we pull out. But the total cash outlays really will be over an extended period of time, and we'll evaluate them one deal, one parcel, one phase of lot development at a time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath with MKM Partners.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","We've heard some other builders talk recently about some shortages on the labor side. So I'd be -- interesting to hear as the biggest builder what you're seeing out there in terms of your subs and getting labor in the different markets?","Donald J. Tomnitz","There is some shortage out there of labor. Clearly, our subcontractors don't feel as, I guess good about the future of the economy, the macro side of the economy. So they cut back on a number of their crews during the downturn. And they're reluctant in some cases and slow in other cases to build their crews back up to where they were before. So as a result, we are dealing with labor shortages in certain markets. But the wonderful thing about D.R. Horton is we still start more homes than anybody else in the industry. We are attracting the labor pool, and our labor pool is growing to support us because a lot of our labor pool works exclusively for D.R. Horton, and they've been with us for a number of years. So they trust us to go ahead and begin to expand their businesses as our business begins to expand.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Great. And since you mentioned the subs outlook for the future, Don, you've been willing in the past to kind of talk about your outlook for the U.S. housing market. Could you tell us kind of what you're thinking over the next 12 months?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Clearly, what we see today, especially with our record backlog -- or I shouldn't say record backlog, our backlog being up 49% in terms of units and 61% in terms of dollars, we feel like we're well positioned for 2013. Unless we have some sort of macro situation with the U.S. economy, we feel comfortable that we'll have a much better 2013 than we did 2012. Again, I get back to the one overriding driving force in our industry, and that is job creation. And I still don't see a lot of jobs being created. And I also see the fact that there are potential layoffs in a number of industries, especially the defense industry, which could adversely affect our business. I also believe that a number of small businesses are not incentivized to grow their business as much. They're having difficulty growing their businesses and the taxes and the fees and so forth that are coming their way with healthcare and other types of things. And I also believe that clearly, there's not a focus on a nationwide basis to help those small businesses grow. I think a lot of it is focused more on large businesses and unions, and I think it's going to be difficult as we move forward to generate the number of jobs in this country that we need for us to have a strong housing market on a 2- to 3-, 5-year basis. I just think 2013, unless something adversely affects that I don't see on the horizon right now, we're going in with eyes wide open and great expectations.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Goldberg with UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The first question I want to ask, there's obviously -- there's been -- and Megan mentioned a lot of kind of conversations around labor and labor shortages, and I want to ask a question from a different perspective. What I want to try to get an idea, as the labor forces in your subcontractors look to kind of gear up their businesses, how well financed are they to kind of fund their own internal expansion? Where are they getting the money to get bigger? And is that something that concerns you guys as you look forward?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, clearly, lending has not -- commercial lending has not increased to the level that it should be, or certainly where it was. You bring up a good point. A lot of those subcontractors are dealing pretty much on a cash-by-cash basis, and not a lot of lending is available to them. One of the things I believe that helps our subcontractors is Horton has a sterling reputation of paying on time, and we help support those subcontractors grow their businesses. They need to be paid on a more frequent basis than what we typically pay our subcontractors, we'll work with those subcontractors until they get enough cash flow and they can could grow their businesses to support our operations. So again, we've got a great reputation with our subcontractors. We appreciate them very much, and we're trying to help them grow to support our business.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. My follow-up question was on the 2-year kind of cash on land purchases. That was obviously -- that was extended at one point because the opportunity and the confidence you have around the housing rebound, plus the opportunity set that you were facing suggested will you take on a little bit longer time frame in terms of cash-to-cash on land deals. The question is -- and I get that you're seeing a lot of deals right now, and there's a lot of good deal flow. What I'm trying to understand is what would get you to push that out again? When is it not going to be 24 months cash-to-cash, but maybe now it's going to have to get to 36 months or maybe something in between, 30 months? Just give me an idea kind of the cash flow and the dynamics from the land perspective would be great.","Donald J. Tomnitz","I'd say we'd have to have increasing demand and increasing margins for us to take that additional risk of going from 24 to 36 months because as I've said on the conference call, what we're focused on is prudently and profitably growing this company. We've been to the movie before, this was my fourth downturn and I think Horton's fourth downturn also. Clearly, the biggest risk in this business is land ownership for too long a period of time. And I've mentioned to you, I believe on other conference calls, we started at 12, we're at 24 months, and it's going to take increasing profitability and increasing demand for us to go to 36. I personally don't believe seeing us buy anything that has a greater return than 36 months of our initial cash. We can keep it for 36 months or less. I think we reduced the risk profile of this company dramatically to position ourselves for the next downturn because clearly, we're going through a small upturn. And hopefully, that upturn will grow. But we all know one thing for certain, there'll be another downturn on the horizon, and we want to be positioned better for the next downturn than we were for the past downturn.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is it creating limitation on the speed at which you can grow given that kind of -- given that overview?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Absolutely no, sir. We have plenty of deals to do with a 2-year return of initial cash and no adverse effect on our growth at all. All a matter of structuring the deal, managing our land development plans efficiently and making sure that we're always focused on returning our cash.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Barr\u00f3n of Housing Research Center.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","I wanted to ask you about your land strategy. I guess land prices have moved up in certain markets or many markets this year. And so I'm kind of wondering, are you guys moving out, further out where there's still cheaper lots? And are you also, in some instances, selling land that you think might be overvalued?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, we're not selling a lot of land right now. We are seeing increasing land prices, but they're muted. We're still, as we said, focused on, Alex, our 20% gross margin underwriting hurdle. I don't see increasing land prices adversely affecting our ability to do deals. There seem like to be plenty of deals out there for cities, our divisions and our regions to meet our growth expectations at this stage at an increasing gross margin level.","Stacey H. Dwyer","And I don't think we're intentionally moving further out. We may selectively do some communities that are a little further out, but our real focus is on staying in the A and the B locations. If we do choose to do something that's a little further out, it's probably going to be under an option contact where we've got a lot of flexibility and not through land ownership.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","Okay. And I also wanted to ask you about the kind of buyers that you saw this year. I know you guys have that DHI Home Buyers Club, so I'm wondering what percent of the buyers were people that came out of -- went through a foreclosure and were renting and now you guys turned them into owners again? And what percentage of the buyers might have been investors?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I don't believe we have a good feel on who's an investor today. I know that we, in certain divisions have found there are certain hedge funds coming into specific markets. Our regional presidents and division presidents have identified those. And we're not interested in selling to -- our business is selling to people who are going to live in the home. And one of our focuses in our communities is I think there are plenty of rental opportunities available in the country. In our subdivisions where we're building, selling and closing homes, we're looking for home buyers who are going to be homeowners and who are going to live in that community. They take better care of their home, so it's something that we monitor pretty closely, the best that we can.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC","And on the Home Buyers Club?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Home Buyers Club represented, I think, right at about 6% of our buyers this year.","Stacey H. Dwyer","Those would not have all gone through a foreclosure process, though. Just to be clear, the last I had asked about that, it was a very low single-digit percentage of our buyers that had actually gone through a foreclosure process and then were back in as buyers.","Donald J. Tomnitz","And most of our Home Buyer Club members, Alex, are people who are just not aware of how the financial system works. And ours is largely an educational process to help them understand how the system works because they're being penalized by the system for not understanding how the system works. And we explain to them how they can manage their credit better such that the system evaluates them properly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Jones with Moloney Securities.","Timothy Jones","I go back long enough to the 1970s, the mid-'70s, when the speculators were coming in. I remember one builder was getting individual speculators, buying up to 5 homes in 1 subdivision, and that builder threatened to fire any salesman that sold a spec home because he'll come back and bite you as competitors, as prices go up. You said yes, you're monitoring the large hedge funds, but how are you monitoring the relatively small speculator, they'll buy 3 to 5 homes in the subdivision, especially since only about half, a little more have been half of your loans are coming through your own facilities? This can obviously turn into a bad problem if that gets out of line. You said you're trying to monitor it. I can understand the large hedge funds but how do you keep the smaller guys out from doing it?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Tim, first of all, let me clarify that what I said about the hedge funds was -- is that we've been aware -- our regional presidents and division presidents have been made aware that certain hedge funds have come into certain of our subdivisions attempting to buy multiple homes. But we and I are incapable of managing any hedge fund. Those guys are a lot more pervasive and probably a lot smarter than we are. But I think to answer your question directly, multiple buyers in the same marketplace come up rather easily if it's the same corporation, if it's the same individual. So as a result, what we're focused on once again, and I don't know how we can do it other than being aware of who the person is, who's the buyer. And if it's multiple -- same name, same family, same LLC, whatever that we are focusing, selling to people who are homeowners and who are going to live in our communities, largely because of the fact that, you're right. At some point in time, we compete with them. We don't want to compete with them. And secondly, we want to make sure the people who are buying our homes are enhancing our community by taking care of their homes and their lawns, and a lot of those people who are investors rely upon, and my brother can speak to this very clearly in New Port Richey, Florida, where there are a number of people who are in his cul-de-sac who were renters of assets owned by investors and that investors didn't maintain the homes when they were not rented. And when they were rented, the renters had a tendency to not take care of their homes either. So it's something that we focus on. We're going to do the best job we can, but we can't eliminate all of them.","Bill W. Wheat","And Tim, as we look across all of our markets right now, we're really not seeing a lot of that activity right now, but that's certainly something that's on our radar that we're on the watch out for.","Timothy Jones","A second question. Talking to D.R. about 18 months ago, I had the impression that he wanted to pick up market share by increasing your trade up. I understood it to be units, not sales, to trade up buyers by about 10 percentage points. It looks like your first-time units have stayed roughly flat at 50%. Why haven't you been able to increase this percentage on a unit basis, not on a dollar basis?","Stacey H. Dwyer","I think part what you're seeing in our product mix is the first-time homebuyer is a self-reported box checked on a mortgage application. And while we have seen a consistent and actually declining from 2010, 2011 to the current level of 49%, percentage of first-time homebuyers, some of the first-time homebuyers have waited longer to buy houses. And so they're not buying your traditional first-time home. So even though they may still be a true first-time homebuyer when they check the box, the product that they're buying is at a higher price point. So you're seeing the mix shift show up in our average sales price kind of regardless of what's going on with the first-time homebuyer mix.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen East with ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","D.T., you had really strong orders in the Southeast and the West and fairly low order growth in the Southwest and South Central. Can you compare and contrast what's going on there? And how much of that is driven by lack of communities in the Southwest, et cetera?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, I'd say the Southeast in particular is the fact that they have entered into a number of additional deals that the Southwest has not. They've grown their community count at a faster pace than the Southwest. I would also say to you that the Southeast has many more multiple markets than what our Southwest market does in terms of satellites and cities, reporting to divisions and reporting to region. The other thing I would say to you in terms of the West is that -- hard to believe, hard for me to believe, but California is improving. And as D.R., who was just recently out there in the last 2 or 3 weeks, indicated that during the downturn, we were struggling to get one net sale per community per month in California. And currently we're getting a lot closer to one net sale per week per community. And as a result, the overall demand is just increasing in the West. And given the state of the California economy, I have no idea why that is the case. But definitely, our demand in California from our buyers is increasing.","Bill W. Wheat","And then Stephen, with respect to the South Central, that primarily is Texas for us. Obviously, Texas is our strongest area. It has also been the most stable area. It didn't go down nearly as much during the downturn. We've seen it be our most consistently profitable area. And to the extent that we're still able to grow that area and grow our market share in Texas, we think that still represents a strength for our company.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you all talked about whether you're buying A, B or C lots within a market. Where are you primarily allocating your total dollars by market, or sort of rank ordered?","Donald J. Tomnitz","I'm not going to get into really where that is. Like I said earlier, to the extent that I will get into it is, is that if you take a look at the eastern half and the southeastern half of the United States, that's where our community count has grown more dramatically than elsewhere. And I think that...","Stacey H. Dwyer","Yes. When we file our K, we'll have our lot position by region, and you'll be able to see which of the regions are showing the stronger owned lot increases and also the option lot increases.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Thinking about spec a little bit, so you've got, let's call it, I guess, 12,000 adjusted spec now. And obviously, you talked about ramping that up into fiscal 1 and 2 quarters next year, given the selling season. Can you talk about where that net '12 kind of might go to? And why not take it up even maybe even higher, just given sort of the demand characteristics right now and the supply situation?","Donald J. Tomnitz","Well, we're prudently increasing our specs based upon the time of the year and market-by-market where we're seeing the best demand. Increasing specs for this company is an easy thing, and Bill Wheat is shaking his head over there. But at this stage in the fiscal year, we're running pretty much the right percentage, we believe, of our specs, and we've got an effort under way in the company to start a number of specs over the course of the next 2 months. And we're underway with that, have been underway with that for the last 30 days. And I know when you come -- when we report our Q1 spec percentage, I wouldn't be surprised if that's not up closer to the low 50s to mid-50s percent.","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, this is -- Jack, this is ordinary course for us. I would expect that we will have more than 12,000 homes in inventory at December and then into the January, February, March period.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Unless sales increase so dramatically that they continue to deplete our specs as we start them. And that would be a great problem to have.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Is it, to some extent, somewhat of a margin protection plan at this point? Kind of wait to see what the demand looks like and kind of hold the line of margin?","Donald J. Tomnitz","No, it really isn't. Because when we go start a spec, our goal is 20%. Obviously, we're not at 20% yet, but it's not really a spec. It's not really a margin issue. It's just where we believe we have the right number of specs. And as you may recall, realtors sell a large, large percentage of our homes. So we try to make certain in each community that we have the right number of specs to satisfy our realtor clientele because -- and relocation because the combination of people being relocated, which is not as many as it once was. But clearly, our realtor business is still a big percentage of our business, and they have one attribute in common. They want to be able to collect their commission as quickly as possible. And so as a result, the spec inventory helps them accomplish that.","Bill W. Wheat","Yes, and it's just managing the pace and the flow of our spec inventory. Our actual total inventory actually went up from June to September, which you typically would not see that in our business. So we are starting to prepare. But today is November 12. The selling season will begin at the end of January, so we still have a little time to continue starting homes, and we will continue starting homes so we have a pace and a flow of homes heading into the spring.","Donald J. Tomnitz","The other thing, our build-to-order business has continued to increase. And so as a result, what we are focused on primarily, between specs and build-to-order, is to get our build-to-order houses in the ground so that we can get them closed and satisfy those buyers. And to that extent, the spec starts are going to have to take a backseat to our build-to-order business.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question. On the financial services side, I think the margin came in a fair amount quarter-to-quarter. Gain on sale margins still in the business, pretty high. Anything one-time or unusual there that brought the margin in?","Bill W. Wheat","Nothing unusual at all. Financial services, anytime they're achieving greater than a 30% operating margin, that's in a good range for us.","Operator","We have reached the allotted time for our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the floor back over to Mr. Tomnitz for any closing comments.","Donald J. Tomnitz","Thank you. Again, D.R. and I want to thank all of our DHI teammates for having muddled through some tough times in '07, '08 and '09. We had made money in '10 and made money in '11. But we congratulate you because in fiscal year '12, we made a profit in each quarter of the year and had a nice profit for the fiscal year. So we couldn't have done it without you. As Horton says, it's all about the people, and we sincerely appreciate all the people who have been with us through the downturn. Obviously, we've increased our hiring from -- we got down to a low of 2,700 teammates and we're up to 3,500. So it's -- a lot of good things are happening at D.R. Horton. We welcome the new teammates and we look forward to a very good 2013. And we hope that '14, '15 and '16 continue to improve for us.

In addition to Jessica, I am pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","The D.R. Horton team is producing strong results in 2017. In the third quarter, our consolidated pre-tax income increased 17% to $444 million on $3.8 billion of revenue. Our pre-tax profit margin was 11.8%, and the value of our homes sold increased 13%. For the nine months ended June, our consolidated pre-tax income increased 21% to $1.1 billion on an 18% increase in revenue to $9.9 billion.","Our pre-tax profit margin for the nine-month period improved 30 basis points to 11.2%. These results put us on strong \u2013 put us on track to deliver our guidance on all metrics for the full-year of 2017, and reflect the strength of our operational teams and diverse product offerings across our broad national footprint.","Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both revenue and pre-tax profits, while generating annual positive operating cash flows, and increasing our returns. For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory was 16.3%, an improvement of 200 basis points from 14.3% a year ago.","With 27,600 homes in inventory end of June and 252,000 lots owned and controlled, we are well-positioned for the fourth quarter and further growth in 2018.","Mike?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Net income for the third quarter increased 16% to $289 million or $0.76 per diluted share, compared to $250 million or $0.66 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income for the quarter increased 17% to $444 million versus $379 million a year ago. And homebuilding pre-tax income increased 19% to $415 million compared to $348 million.","Our backlog conversion rate for the third quarter was 85%. As a result, our third quarter home sales revenues increased 17% to $3.7 billion on 12,497 homes closed, up from $3.1 billion on 10,739 homes closed in the prior year quarter.","Our average closing price for the quarter was $293,100, up 1% compared to last year. This quarter, entry-level homes marketed under our Express Homes brand accounted for 33% of homes closed and 25% of home sales revenue. Our homes for higher-end, move-up and luxury buyers priced greater than $500,000 were 6% of homes closed, and 15% of home sales revenue. Our active adult Freedom Homes brand is now being offered in 15 markets across 12 states, and customer response to the affordable homes in communities offering a low maintenance lifestyle has been positive.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","The value of our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 13% from the prior year quarter to $3.9 billion and homes sold increased 11% to 13,040 homes. Our average number of active selling communities increased 1% from the prior year quarter, and 2% sequentially, from our second quarter. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $296,900, and the 21% cancellation rate during the quarter was consistent with the prior year.","The value of our backlog increased 6% from a year ago to $4.6 billion with an average sales price per home of $306,400. And homes in backlog increased 3% to 15,161 homes.","Jessica?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 19.8% consistent with our expectations in the first half of the year. Our gross margin decreased 50 basis points compared to the prior year quarter due to higher litigation costs. In the current housing market, we continue to expect our average home sales gross margin to be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix as well as the relative impact of warranty, litigation and interest costs.","Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","In the third quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues improved 50 basis points from the prior year quarter to 8.4% due to better leverage of our fixed overhead costs from increased revenues. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our growth.","Jessica?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Financial services pre-tax income in the third quarter was $29.3 million, compared to $30.2 million in the prior year quarter. 95% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. And our mortgage company handled the financing for 55% of D.R. Horton homebuyers.","FHA and VA loans accounted for 48% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 719, and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. First time homebuyers represented 46% in the closings handled by our mortgage company, consistent with the prior year quarter.","Mike?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We ended the third quarter with 27,600 homes in inventory, 12,800 of our total homes were unsold with 9,200 in various stages of construction and 3,600 completed. Compared to a year ago, we have 9% more homes in inventory, putting us in a strong position for the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2018.","Our investment in lots, land and development during the third quarter totaled $1.1 billion, of which, $740 million was for finished lots and land, and $360 million was for land development. During the nine months ended June, we invested $2.8 billion in lots, land and development, compared to $2 billion in the same period of last year. Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for new communities remain consistent at a minimum 20% annual pre-tax return on inventory and a return of our initial cash investment within 24 months. We plan to continue to invest in land and lots at a rate to support our expected growth.","David?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","This quarter, we achieved our previously-stated goal of a 50% owned, 50% optioned land and lot pipeline. At June 30, our land and lot portfolio consisted of 252,000 lots, of which, 125,000 are owned and 127,000 are controlled through option contracts. 83,000 of our total lots are finished, of which 33,000 are owned and 50,000 are optioned.","We have increased our optioned lot position 41% from a year ago, and we plan to continue expanding our relationship with land developers across our national footprint to further increase the option portion of our lands lots (09:31). Our 252,000 total lot portfolio is a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market, and sufficient lot supply to support our targeted growth.","Mike?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","On June 29th, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire 75% of the currently outstanding shares of Forestar Group, a publicly-traded residential real estate development company for $17.75 per share in cash or approximately $560 million of total cash consideration. The strategic relationship between D.R. Horton and Forestar will significantly grow Forestar into a large national residential land development company, selling lots to D.R. Horton and other homebuilders.","Forestar will remain a public company with access to the capital markets to support its future growth. The proposed merger accelerates our strategy of expanding D.R. Horton's relationships with land developers and ultimately increasing the option portion of our land and lot position to enhance operational efficiency and returns.","As a reminder, there is a slide deck with additional details about the transaction available on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.drhorton.com\/for. We remain confident in the growth plan for Forestar as outlined in that presentation.","Our interactions with the Forestar team have been very positive, and we are pleased with the progress we are making on the acquisition. The transaction is expected to close in our first fiscal quarter of 2018, subject to the approval of Forestar's shareholders and other customary closing conditions. We expect the preliminary S-4 to be filed by Forestar soon, and will have no other information to share until after the closing date.","We are excited about the value that this relationship will create for both D.R. Horton and Forestar's shareholders. Bill?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","At June 30th, our homebuilding liquidity included $461 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $900 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage ratio improved 520 basis points from a year ago to 24.8%.","In May, we repaid $350 million of senior notes at their maturity, and the balance of our public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion. We have $400 million of senior note maturities in the next 12 months. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.85 million shares of our common stock for $60.6 million, which partially offset dilution from equity awards.","At June 30th, our shareholders' equity was $7.4 billion and book value per share was $19.87, up 14% from a year ago. Subsequent to quarter end our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization to $200 million effective through July 2018, replacing the prior authorization.","Our balanced capital approach is centered on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our top cash flow priorities are to consolidate market share by investing in our homebuilding business and strategic acquisitions, payoff senior notes at maturity and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our balance sheet strength, liquidity, consistent earnings growth and cash flow generation are increasing our flexibility. And we plan to maintain our disciplined, opportunistic position to improve the long-term value of the company.","Jessica?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect our homes closed to approximate a beginning backlog conversion rate in the range of 88% to 90%. This will result in homes closed for the full year of fiscal 2017 in the range of 45,800 to 46,200 homes, and consolidated revenues of $13.9 billion to $14.1 billion, both of which are above the high-end of our initial guidance range.","We anticipate our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter will be around 20%, and we expect our fourth quarter homebuilding SG&A to be in the range of 8.3% to 8.4% of homebuilding revenues.","We estimate that our fourth quarter financial services operating margin will be in the range of 32% to 34%. We expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter to be approximately 35.2%, and our fourth quarter diluted share count to be around 380 million shares. We now expect our consolidated pre-tax operating margin for the full year of 2017 to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.5%, and we expect approximately $300 million of positive cash flow from operations for the year.","Our expectations are based on today's market conditions. Our preliminary expectations for fiscal 2018 are for consolidated revenues to increase 10% to 15%, and to achieve a consolidated pre-tax margin of approximately 11.5% for the full year of fiscal year 2018. We also expect to generate positive cash flow from operations for a fourth consecutive year in a range of $300 million to $500 million.","We anticipate our tax rate for fiscal 2018 will be approximately 35.5%, and that our diluted share count next year may increase up to 1%. Our preliminary guidance for fiscal 2018 is for our current operations and does not include any impact from Forestar. We do expect Forestar to be accretive, but not material to our earnings in fiscal year 2018, and we'll provide more information after we close on the transaction.","David?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","In closing, our third quarter and year-to-date growth in sales, closings and profits is a result of the strength of our people and operating platform. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and continue to expand our industry-leading market share. We have been the largest builder in the United States for 15 consecutive years.","According to Builder magazine's recent Local Leader issue, in 2016, we were the number one builder in four of the top five U.S. housing markets, and we believe, we will be the number one in all five of those markets in 2017.","Also, in 2016, we were a top five builder in 28 of the top 50 largest housing markets. We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while continuing to generate annual positive operating cash flows and improved returns.","We're well-positioned to do so, with our solid balance sheet, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offering across our D.R. Horton, Emerald, Express and Freedom brands, attractive finished lot and land position, and most importantly, our outstanding team across the country. We thank the entire D.R. Horton team for their focus and hard work. We look forward to finishing this year strong and to continue growing and improving our operations together in 2018.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, and good morning, guys. I'll start with the gross margin. Jessica, you mentioned that, third quarter you had 50 bps of legal, maybe, you could just give us an idea of what that is. But more importantly, fourth quarter around 20% implies, it may be down some. I guess, what are you all seeing as the drivers of that, when we're looking at price, cost. One of your competitors yesterday mentioned heightened incentives in a few markets, just maybe what's driving the thought process there of where you're going with your gross margin?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Sure. We'll have our detail on our gross margin, historically as we always do in our supplementary data, and what you'll see in that is in terms of the true just lot level prior to interest, property tax, warranty and lit, and those types of charges, our margin has been very, very steady. On a year-over-year basis, it was down about 20 basis points in that case, and that really is just driven by slightly higher land costs, which we have been talking about.","So in terms of our stick and brick costs, our revenues have been covering that. They did on a year-over-year basis, and sequentially they were essentially on top of our cost increase. So we continue to see a very consistent gross margin, and then we did refer to the higher litigation costs, and that is \u2013 we've had that for a couple of quarters now, and that's why we continue to reiterate our 19% to 21% gross margin guide, as kind of our broader range outside of around 20%, because we do have some variability to some of those charges, and every once in a while it fluctuates a little bit.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough. And then, Bill you talked on the capital structure, your cash flow expected et cetera. Where do you all want to take your debt? I mean, at 20%, I think, most builders would love to be at that level already. So you're generating close to $0.5 billion next year even before Forestar, so what's the focus there on debt, and where do you want to take it?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We certainly like our position, we're in a flexible opportunistic position as we look at each year and look at our business plans, which we'll be spending a lot of time on that with our operators over the next couple of months, preparing, putting the kind of final touches on being prepared for fiscal 2018. We will look at where we feel like our cash flow will be, we'll look at our opportunities to invest.","And then from there determine further actions with our cash, whether we take our debt down further or replace it, how much we do in terms of dividends and share repurchase, and then obviously further opportunities to invest in the business, including acquisitions...","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","...we do have the purchase price of Forestar, which we would expect to be paid in Q1 of fiscal 2018 of around $560 million, so certainly that's a use of cash that we'll be looking at closely. We don't have a target debt level, we like being flexible, we're certainly \u2013 if we feel like that's the best decision for utilizing our cash is to continue to reduce our debt, we certainly will.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Do you have a targeted land spend?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We're going to spend on land and development at a level, so that we maintain our lot portfolio at a similar level through the day, we do expect to continue to try to get more efficient with what we own, as we continue to grow our option position, but we would expect all things considered, if our revenues are expected to grow at 10% to 15%, we would expect our land spend to grow accordingly to just keep the lot pipeline sufficient for that growth.","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Fair enough. All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next is coming from Alan Ratner of Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice quarter. Congrats on the consistent results here.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","My first question is, kind of a follow-up on that last line, I was thinking on the land portfolio, so you guys had really nice pickup in your lot supply this quarter, both owned and optioned, and congrats on getting to the 50\/50 target.","I guess, just thinking about the owned piece, which is about 125,000 lots, I know, you're on current underwriting, the goal and the target is to effectively get your cash back within two years there. You're owning up 25% year-over-year on the lot count, up 12% on the owned piece. If we just assume, you turned through those owned lots in a two-year period; and I know that's somewhat oversimplified, because there's legacy lots in there, which might be sitting there for a while.","But it would imply a pretty sharp acceleration in the volume, even probably above that 10% to 15% rate in order to get to that type of cash generation. So just curious kind of how you see the volume trending, I know you guided to 10% to 15%, but with the lot count up seemingly more than that, is there anything else we should be paying attention to?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I think, Alan, we have done a great job, our team has done a phenomenal job increasing the optioned lot position in line with the strategy we have. But we don't see an acceleration beyond the 10% to 15%, we're looking for next year. Even though, that lot supply is coming up, and we've got a two-year cash back return hurdle, we talked about; we look upon that as capital invested in land and lots, plus the margin we achieve on selling those homes goes back towards the capital reduction and how we reclaim that initial capital commitment. So projects, we're buying certainly have durations longer than two years.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Got it.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","So it's not exactly going to see that kind of ramp in growth beyond our 10% to 15% expectation.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Okay. That's helpful.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We're investing to hit a 10% to 15% increase year-over-year-over-year. So it's \u2013 we have a plan, we're trying to be very discipline with that plan, maximizing returns as we continue to grow at this rate.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Got it. And that's a very helpful clarification. Thank you for that. Second question, just in terms of market conditions, today. If you go back a year ago, your fiscal fourth quarter, you did see a bit of a pullback in your order growth. And I remember you guys talking about just in the market back then, you saw some discounting from some of the calendar reporting companies that you guys were instead deciding to focus more on building up your inventory in anticipation of the spring, which obviously worked out very well.","So just now that you're roughly a month or so into your fiscal fourth quarter here, do you see a similar dynamic playing out, where other builders might be trying to capture some year-end sales here, and it might impact your order results in the fourth quarter, or does it feel like the market is a little bit firmer from a pricing standpoint?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Right now, it feels pretty firm. We monitor week-to-week, we're hitting targets week-to-week. Feel very good about the fourth quarter, the way it's setting up right now. We don't control what other builders do. We're not going to force sales just to have one quarter look better than the market's going to give us. But again, we're managing this in long-term. We're very interested in how we're setting up for 2018 right now, but feel very good about fourth quarter, both sales and deliveries.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And the inventory position we have on the ground and coming out of the ground right now. Feeling good about getting set up for the first and second quarters of 2018.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thanks, Alan.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you.","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning. Nice quarter.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you, Bob.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, just wanted to ask you, order growth was up 50% (25:17) in the Southwest. Deliveries are crushing in the Southwest to Southeast and the East. From your standpoint, is demand coming in ahead of your expectations? And where are you seeing the most demand? I mean, the pace is really torrid, it's higher than we were anticipating, how are you explaining it, and do you view this as sustainable?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Southwest, really has been driven by our Phoenix operation. I think, we've talked over the last couple of quarters, we've been repositioning at Phoenix, pushing down a price point, realigning management, that's paying off. They are taking market share at a torrid pace right now. And the reality is that, they're improving their margin as they're doing it, so we feel very, very good about the Southwest.","As far as the East and Florida, that's really just getting flags online, market's very good, been very good. Florida market's very difficult to get flags up, and get lots in front of you, and our operators out there have done a great job positioning...","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","...taking some of the pressure off, the market's been carrying for all these years, let's focus little more on margin there.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. So this seems like you're seeing demand across the board plus great execution. Could you speak for a minute, what are you doing on the SG&A side? You obviously are executing well against your volume-driven operating strategy and getting great SG&A leverage. How much is left, is there room for improvement, is there anything you can do to lever your overheads to drive net margin performance? Great quarter and good luck.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you, Bob.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. There's always a little more in SG&A, and really, our focus is just to continue to watch everything that we do. We certainly want to make sure we have an infrastructure to support growth, but just to watch everything that we spend, watch every ad that we make, every hire that we make to make sure that's absolutely needed.","And then, if we're doing that, while we're growing the business at 10% to 15%, we would expect to continue to squeeze out a little bit more out of SG&A, whether that's 10 basis points or 30 basis points, it may fluctuate a bit, but we would expect to continue to push it down a little bit further as we go in 2018.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We ask our operators to get better every day, make it a little easier to build houses in the field and sell houses in the sales offices. And if we keep doing...","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","It's working?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We're going to keep getting better.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Sounds good guys, good luck.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Carl Reichardt of BTIG. Please proceed with your question.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","Thanks. Good morning, folks. I wanted to ask about, as you look out at your community mix on the next couple of years, as you're looking at land now. Are you looking at changing the mix, maybe moving away from Emerald, where it seems like we're seeing a bit of saturation in a few markets that move up price points and shifting more towards Express and Freedom?","And you mentioned, I think that your \u2013 was it \u2013 over $500,000 through sales were 6%, I think in terms of delivery volume, but 15%. Is that Emerald plus stuff that's over $500,000? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether or not your mix over time is likely continue to shift towards those low-end price point?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","We're going to shift our mix to where the market is, but we do want to maintain broad product offerings, regardless of cycle. It's just in terms of what percentage goes to what brand, it's going to vary depending on where we're at in the cycle, but we do plan to maintain an Emerald presence, and ultimately grow that business as well.","And there'll be a time where the move-up buyer is back and very strong in that market, and we want to have that platform and that ability to deliver those higher end homes as well. The greater than $500,000 mark that we talk about, Carl, that is a mix. There is a lot of Emerald in that, but there is also some Horton products that falls into that price point as well. So in our supplementary data we give both a brand stratification and a price point stratification where you can see both of those mixes, and what that looks like for a trailing eight quarters.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right. Of course. Thanks, Jess. And then, as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about how the Freedom rollout looks as we look forward over the next couple of years or so? And I think, if I recall correctly, the ramp was, I think, a third of your markets. And I'm just kind of curious, maybe a little more detail on how that's been rolling out, how absorptions are tracking too? Thanks so much.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Bob, it's David. We're very excited and very happy with the Freedom rollout. Positioning that product, it takes a little bit longer than the typical Express or Horton project, because there are certain zoning requirements that make it a better deal that take a little longer.","The rollout, I think, we're 15 markets. We're starting to see it impact to a minimal extent right now on our closings, but I think over the next couple of years, it's going to be a very significant part of what we do. I think we've been guiding to a third to a quarter of our markets that rolled out. But...","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah. We'll probably be closer to a quarter, just because it is a little bit slower as David mentioned versus a third we'd originally talked about. But we're very happy with our progress and expect that 15 markets to continue to grow as we move throughout 2018.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Probably start accelerating at some point because we do have a lot in pipeline that we're trying to get to market. Very excited though. It's going to be a \u2013 well, never mind, I'm not going to say the word.","Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC","Thanks, folks.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I almost gave you a Trumpism.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question, just want to go back to the land and Forestar. And as said before, the increase in optioned lots has really been extremely impressive, essentially doubling it over the last six quarters or so.","So the question is, as you look at Forestar now, over the next year or two. Clearly you haven't had an issue getting option lots on your own. The own portion is still up there; obviously getting a little under 50% was a great achievement as well.","Going forward, do you anticipate that Forestar will be more \u2013 would you anticipate kind of essentially keeping your option lot supply on your own books going forward or would you say, effectively you're looking at all either owned and optioned kind of being funneled towards Forestar, and your overall lot position might stay at these levels, maybe even start to decline, and all incremental land deals, owned and optioned will be pushed towards Forestar?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Michael, this is Mike. We will continue to have direct relationships from D.R. Horton to our land development partners that we have across the country today and look to grow those relationships.","In addition, we will continue to maintain a level of land purchasing at D.R. Horton and development. We see Forestar as being very helpful in us and not having to increase our development activities as we continue to grow the business. As we continue to see double-digit growth year-over-year, that calls for more and more lots to be needed by the builders to start houses on.","We'd like to maintain our current development activities at a consistent level to where we are today, which is about half of our current level of development. But as we move forward and grow, grow more of our future home deliveries off of lots developed by others, whether they are third-party developers or whether they are projects that Forestar puts on the ground for the homebuilder.","So we Forestar as an important part of land and lot strategy going forward, but it's another supplement to the relationships we've built with land developers across the country and we'll continue to invest in those relationships moving forward.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. No, that's helpful, Mike. I guess, just secondly on the fiscal 2018 pre-tax margin guidance at 11.5%, that compares to fiscal 2017 of 11.3% to 11.5%, so it seems like, if I'm getting that right, and thinking about the components, you're more or less looking for a steady gross margin, and maybe flat to 20 bps of incremental leverage on the SG&A.","So just wanted to know if I'm thinking about that right, and if that's the case, it appears that, relative to a few years ago, you're more or less approaching kind of like a steady-state margin, all else equal from a \u2013 let's say a pricing and cost inflation dynamic standpoint; really going forward, the bus is going to be more driven by top line, I mean, absolutely trying to get a little bit more on SG&A, but is that fair in terms of how to think about it?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah, Mike. And in terms of the guidance to 11.5%, that is the right way to think about it. We continue to guide, and have seen very stable gross margins, and then continue to leverage SG&A a bit.","And at this early day here in July, talking about the full fiscal year 2018, we do feel like we can squeeze out a little bit, so guiding to 11.5%, a slight improvement is where we feel comfortable today. As we get closer, and as we get into 2018, if we feel like we've got more opportunity, we will certainly adjust our guidance there as well.","But within \u2013 certainly then, beyond the next quarter, and as we look to where we are as a business, we feel really good, and you're kind of in the middle of our normal operating margin range at about 20%, historically 19% to 21% is kind of in a range, and we've been at a very steady level, kind of in the middle of this range, really for the last couple of years.","And we feel like that's still where the business is today, and then as we grow our volume, certainly the biggest driver of our earnings growth is going to come from our top line growth, growing at 10% to 15%.","And to the extent that the market gives us a bit on the gross margin, we're certainly going to take it, and then we're certainly going to continue to try to drive a bit more operating margin from SG&A. But we're not projecting significant increases in operating margin, but certainly a continued consistent margin in order to improve it on the SG&A side.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then, quick clarification, the quarter markets for Freedom brands, that's expected to be by the end of this fiscal year, correct?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","2017.","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Sure.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Basically, towards the end of 2017.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Lovallo of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey guys, thanks for getting me in here. The first question would be, I guess, how would you characterize kind of order growth throughout the quarter, and maybe more broadly, how would you characterize the overall demand environment? And some of your competitors have said that demand remains very strong and quite possibly is accelerating. Would you agree with that kind of characterization?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","This time of year in the market, I don't know, the accelerating part. I will say, it's very consistent market. It's week-to-week, flag-to-flag, it's just kind of almost boring, it's so consistent. It's a great market for people that can operate efficiently and put good value in front of buyers, and we're seeing the benefit of that.","John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then in terms of the 10% to 15% top line growth, what kind of community count growth are you kind of contemplating in that?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","John, we did see for the first time this quarter, our community count tick up ever so slightly on a year-over-year basis, and I think, the second quarter in a row, it went up sequentially. So we've kind of hit that inflection point that we've been expecting to come, in the back half of the year.","We wouldn't expect it to grow significantly in 2018, but I think, a low, probably no higher than mid-single-digit range, maybe by the time, we get to the end of 2018. So continued improvement and absorption, supplemented by a little bit of community count growth next year.","John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Zener of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I'm going to kind of try and go at your 10% to 15% growth target for next year. This year was very much comprised of pace, and the way we look at pace; sequentially, things have been pretty seasonal and pretty predictable. If that were the case again, it seems as though your approach on these communities and pace would lead to perhaps the same level of unit volumes that you've seen, orders going into closings.","Is there something about your business that would \u2013 if demand were to pick up, and not be boring, could you or would you stop yourself from exceeding that 15% volumes? Is there something intuitively designed around your business that would stop you from getting that if the market wanted to go higher?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","No, I don't think that's \u2013 certainly not or we're going to have not sell houses when people want to buy them, that's not going to be the case. I will say, if we have an opportunity to stay on pace and increase margin, we're going to do that. So if in fact, we do see some kind of acceleration, we will take a little margin and we will take a little bit more pace.","The end goal for every flag is to maximize a return we make on that investment, and if that means tweak in margin, then we'll tweak margin; if that means tweak in pace, we'll tweak pace. It's good times for us.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So since it's so boring, and you guys went to the stable gross margin about two years ago, and it seems certainly guidance from other builders, there's been more than two now, have talked about kind of really sequential improvements looking into the back half of the year, which would be a change from the kind of compression trends that we had seen in recent years.","And I ask David, because you said, if the market gives us gross margins, we'll take it, I'm sure, it's kind of tongue-in-cheek, but it does appear that other builders are finding stability that you're seeing?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah. And that's not tongue-in-cheek, that is our operating platform and thought process. We set these communities to hit a certain absorption target, and we adjust margin to maximize the return at that target. And that's why we're so consistent on our deliveries. And first of all, we're able to build houses on a \u2013 without expanding our bill cycles. I mean, it does a lot of good things for us.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Would you say that you're more inclined to see gross margin expansion this year versus last year, kind of could you couch that considering we're seeing stability in others, and you were the first to see stability, so logically you might be...","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Clearly depends on what the market does. Right now, very consistent margins, very consistent absorptions, we've got a good balance as we \u2013 the other builders that were seeing this acceleration are correct, and yeah, I would say, we're going to see some margin expansion. I'm just telling you, right now, what we're seeing is a very solid, very consistent high-demand, low-inventory market that feels like it's going to continue.","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Ken, I do you think you hear other builders talk to seasonality in their gross margins as well, which I don't know, if that's playing into their commentary for the back-half of the year. But we don't have fixed costs in our gross margin. And so we don't experience that kind of seasonality in the back-half of the year.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah, less the fixed costs then...","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","What is the commission percentage generally that goes into your gross margin and out of SG&A? Thank you.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","It's around 2.7%, 2.8%, at times up to 3% in our margin.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys, it's Steve Kim. Apologies, if this question was asked. But curious about the gross margins for next year implied by the pre-tax GAAP number. We know that, that pre-tax GAAP number includes a lot of things in it, and one of the things you mentioned today, was that, you have this litigation expense that was going to run a little higher, and had been for a couple of quarters now. So I was curious as to what in the way of your outlook for next year, you're embedding in terms of the trajectory for, either warranty and litigation or anything else that might be a little sort of unusual, that typically gets backed out into 2018?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah. Steve, we do see some more variability in items like warranty and litigation that we do in other components of our margin, but our guidance for next year is still kind of right down the middle of our historic range at around 20%, and there certainly could be some quarterly variability, as we've seen from time-to-time in those other areas, but we're not anticipating anything unusual, either positive or negative in terms of those other items.","We do continue to see the benefit of a reduced debt with our interest charges and our margin continuing to be reduced, but at the same time, we do see cost pressures in the core business, especially on the lot side, right now, that we're absorbing a little bit as well. But again, we don't see significant volatility, and aren't embedding any significant volatility into our assumptions.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Got it.","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And the expectations we're putting out there kind of reflect the increased lot costs that we've seen coming through in some of the closing, that's kind of an outcropping of our land and lot strategy is to try to buy more lots finished, see that come through and is helping us to drive our returns up, our homebuilding pre-tax return on inventory has improved 200 basis points over the past 12 months, and that's been very helpful for us.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Yeah, now I know, clearly. And then, with respect to Express specifically, I believe that, when you first launched that product line, your anticipation was that it was going to garner lower gross margins, but then as you actually got into it, do effective execution, you actually, I believe found that the margins there have been much more comparable to your company average, I was curious as to whether that's still the case today? And whether that's your expectation going forward?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yes. Steve, you stated that dead-on, our Express gross margin has been better than we originally anticipated when we launched the brand in the spring of 2014, and it's right in line with our company average, and we really don't see anything today that would anticipate that changing as we move throughout fiscal 2018.","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","Excellent. Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Susan Maklari of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Can you talk a little bit to, perhaps what you're seeing in the Texas markets, it seems like you had some good results down there, can you just talk a little bit about what's actually going on, on the ground?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Texas is a very, very good market for us. We benefit from being incredibly well-positioned, I think, we're the top builder in every market in Texas. And just great execution combined with solid demand and tight, tight inventories. No, we love Texas.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then, I'm wondering if you could just dive in a little bit more into the raw material inflation that you're seeing, kind of what's been going on there, and how you're thinking about that as we move through the fourth quarter and then into 2018?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Sure, Sue. We haven't seen any significant moves in our raw material cost inputs, I know lumber's been the headline. Out there it really \u2013 it has been a lot of headline noise. We've seen a slight tick up in our lumber costs year-to-date, but nothing significant, and we clearly offset that in terms of our revenues offsetting our stick and brick costs. So we're really not seeing any noticeable changes in any of our raw material costs at this point.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And so you expect that to stay relatively consistent then?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yes.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jay McCanless of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Good morning.","Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","A quick question on the Midwest segment and the order decline there. Can you talk about geographically what's going on and how you guys are addressing it?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","The Midwest segment's a pretty small region for us, some of those markets, we have reworked a little bit of the management leadership in one of those markets, and we feel pretty good about where that team is going to be positioned in 2018 and 2019. So, I think we're going to see some improvements in those markets. They've been pretty consistent, they're just like a lot of other places, fairly supply constraint. Chicago market, still a little slow, seems to be little slow coming out compared to the balance of the country, but the other markets, I think we'll see some good things in 2018 and 2019.","Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","And then, the other question I had, just to Express specifically, what type of pricing power are you seeing there, and I know some of your competitors have announced new brand names and new products to maybe target that brand name or to target Express, what are you guys seeing right now, and how's the pricing power for you guys on that Express brand?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah, the key to the Express brand is affordability and making the \u2013 keeping that very broad customer segment where the most people can buy the most house. And so, the pricing power is probably higher or greater than where we have pushed pricing in Express because we are very sensitive to maintaining a very affordable product.","Those buyers typically are not the most sophisticated, and you can make kind of a slow conveyor \u2013 presentation with them, but at the end of the day, we're selling houses to people that we want to sell the second, third and fourth house. We want it to be a great investment for them, and we want to give them a great house.","So that's a long way of saying, yes, there's probably pricing power there. But as long as we can maintain the margins we're making and absorptions we're making, and retain a very affordable, very well built house, we lack that model. We lack what it's doing for our returns.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And Jay, you will see in our supplemental information that our average ASP on Express continues to tick up a little bit. That's more of a reflection of our geographic mix though, as we continue to roll Express out, and it continues to penetrate some of the higher-priced markets a little bit greater than it had been in prior quarters, but it's not \u2013 we obviously will move price somewhat, but we are continuing to stay very focused on affordability.","And then, in terms of other builders in the entry level space, first time homebuyer space, certainly we're seeing other builders start to introduce new names, new brands, new communities out there, but as we've said for a long while, that market is pretty large, and there's a lot of demand from those entry level buyers today. So there's a lot of room for other participants to participate in that market, but we're still focused on penetrating that and gaining as much market share as we can there because we feel like there's still a lot of demand and very little supply to that entry level buyer.","Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Sounds great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko of SIG. Please go ahead, sir.","John Gregory Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group","Hi, good morning. I wanted to just clarify your tone on the share buybacks. I mean, your debt levels have come down further, generating cash, you bought back some stock this quarter, as you always do to offset the stock comp, but you upped the authorization.","So is this more status quo \u2013 should we think of the buyback approach status quo, or is there an incremental focus on share repurchase here as you generate cash and get your debt levels lower because you did seem to call it out a bit more in the prepared comments as well. Just trying to gauge what the real message is?","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Jack. We have had an authorization outstanding for quite some time on share repurchases. Actually \u2013 and we've talked about potentially starting to repurchase shares to offset dilution, actually this quarter was the first quarter in which we've actually repurchased any shares under that authorization. So, it was a step forward for us into an era of beginning to start to offset our dilution from our share creep.","And we would expect to continue to at least partially offset that dilution, we \u2013 our board did increase our authorization to a $200 million level effective for the next year; that is an increase from the prior-year authorization of $100 million. So certainly as the business is growing, as our profits grow, as we continue to expect strong cash flow generation, we do expect to continue to be able to repurchase shares within that authorization going forward. So, yes, we are saying a little bit more about it because we've actually repurchased some shares this quarter.","John Gregory Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. And then, around your 2018 outlook, you talk about driving more of the top line through absorption, you're also going to grow, I think, Freedom's going to be somewhat of a driver of growth. How do we think about Freedom versus Express absorptions. Do they absorb about the same faster, slower and what's that mean to that expectation for further absorption improvement next year?","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","If we're \u2013 we will find out what happens as time goes on. I can tell you the way we are believing, it's going to take place right now is, the Freedom will come in at a little lower absorption than the Express program, but we think, we can get a little bit more margin there, so the returns are going to be equivalent to that push to 20% we're trying to get to, and it's \u2013 right now, we're seeing very, very strong demand. Part of it is, it's just nothing else \u2013 nothing else in the market like it. It's just been harder to roll it out than we really kind of thought it would, because of zoning requirements, and really city approvals and things. But we're very excited about it. I think, it's going to be great.","John Gregory Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alex Barr\u00f3n of Housing Research Center. Please go ahead.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC","Yeah, thanks. Congratulations on the results. I wanted to ask about the leverage; so you guys, I think, at this point have the lowest leverage of any builder. Curious if you guys, the thought process is to stay here or you're just being opportunistic about more \u2013 other opportunities?","And my second question has to do with, heard some rumblings that some of these rental companies are thinking of developing entire communities for, I guess, single family communities for rents, and giving your platform of being very efficient to develop homes; wondering if that's something that you guys are potentially contemplating on doing, entering those types of deals?","Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.","I'll take the second question first, Alex. Thank you very much for your comments. We've heard some of the rumblings about that as well, probably just rumors or articles written here and there. We've not really explored the build out of a community for ourselves as a full rental community. We've had great demand selling houses, and generally, we prefer to sell them, and it's more capital-efficient for us, and that's the way it has historically worked for us.","We'll see how they do with the full on rental communities \u2013 we do see it's something that can make good business sense for us to bring our building platform to bear, community development expertise to bear in developing a rental community, maybe that's something we will pursue. But at this point, we have no immediate plans to pursue that.","Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.","And then, Alex, in terms of the leverage, we do lock our flexible opportunistic position we're in today, as we look at opportunities to invest in the business; we just try to balance that with where we want to keep our liquidity. And to the extent that we have capital available to continue to reduce debt, we certainly will.","But if we see enough opportunities to invest in the business that we need to replace the debt, and not reduce it further, then we'll do that as well. So we certainly like our position, willing to take the debt lower if need be and the cash flow is available, but certainly, it's got us in a really strong position to be able to really take advantage of opportunities as we see them in the marketplace.","Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC","Great. Thanks. Congrats again.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you.","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","Thank you. We're showing time for one additional question today. Our last question will be coming from Mike Dahl of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks for fitting me in. Couple of quick ones. First, related to the guide and some of the comments around absorption and community count. Just hoping to get a little clarification on just how the 10% to 15% in dollar terms breaks out, because presumably mix is continuing to shift towards Freedom and Express, which while you've had some pricing power there is still mixing lower. So what's generally your expectation for how ASPs play out for next year when you kind of add that altogether?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","So we don't give specific guidance on ASP or community count really. I mean, we end up talking about it, because obviously you guys want to hear about that. So we do talk about it directionally, but no specific guidance for a reason, because those are two of the hardest for us to predict.","ASP being very much market-driven and coupled with a lot of mix impacts that we have had going on that you already referenced, Mike. So we continue to expect our ASP to be around flat. In reality, it continue to creep up at a low-single-digit percentage here for the last year or two. So we'll see as we move throughout 2018, but once again, not really expecting a whole lot of movement on the ASP front.","Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's still helpful. And then, secondly, just if we think about some of the comments around your price, obviously there's kind of a push and pull. You've got some power in the market on the low-end, but you want to manage and make sure it's an affordable product in those segments.","You mentioned that the cost side is fairly benign for you guys. So can you give us any level of quantification since overall margins are stable, you know what the underlying land costs are inflating at currently, and what the embedded expectation is for 2018?","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Sure, we saw our lot cost at the beginning of the year, it'd be up a high-single-digit percentage. Now that we've moved into the back half of the year, that's moderated a bit, and this quarter on a year-over-year basis was up a mid-single-digit percentage. So we would expect in 2018 to continue to have an increase in our lot costs, but hopefully it maintains that mid-single-digit range that we're at today or you know trends down just ever so slightly to a low-single-digit.","Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks and good luck into year-end.","David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thank you.","Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you.

In addition to Jessica, I am pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer;","We are off to a great start in 2015 and are looking forward to the spring. In the first quarter, our homes sold and closed increased by 35% and 29% respectively, and we had another solid quarter of profitability with $220.7 million of pretax income on $2.3 billion of revenue.","Demand for new homes remains stable across most of our markets during this quarter, and consistent with normal seasonality our weekly sales pace has accelerated in January. We are in a strong competitive position for the upcoming spring sales season with a well-stocked supply of land, lots, and homes.","For our full year in 2015, we expect to generate a 20% to 30% increase in revenues with similar levels of profitability and operating margins as we share on our last call. Our continued strategic focus is to leverage our operating platform to generate double digit growth in both revenues and pretax profits, while improving our cash flows and increasing our returns. Mike?","Michael Murray","Net income for the first quarter increased 16% to $142.5 million or $0.39 per diluted share compared to $123.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share in the year ago quarter. Our consolidated pretax income increased 16% to $220.7 million in the first quarter compared to $189.7 million in the year ago quarter, and homebuilding pretax income increased 13% to $206.1 million compared to $181.9 million in the prior year quarter.","Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 37% to $2.2 billion on 7,973 homes closed, up from $1.6 billion on 6,188 homes closed in the year ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $281,000, up 7% compared to the prior year primarily driven by a 4% in our average home size and a small increase in our average sales price per square foot. Bill?","Bill Wheat","The value of our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 40% from a year ago quarter to $2.1 billion, and homes sold increased 35% to 7,370 homes on a 6% increase in active selling communities. Our average sales prices on net sales orders in the first quarter increased 4% to $286,100. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 24%, relatively stable compared to 23% in the year ago quarter.","The value of our backlog increased 29% from a year ago to $2.7 billion with an average sales price per home of $293,600, and homes in backlog increased 21% to 9,285 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the first quarter was higher than our expectations at 81%. We expect our second quarter backlog conversion rate to be in the range of 81% to 85%. Jessica.","Jessica Hansen","We are experiencing strong growth and profitability in the heart of our business in our D.R. Horton branded communities, which accounted for the substantial majority of our sales and closings this quarter. We are also pleased with the progress and performance of the rollouts of our Express Homes and Emerald Homes brands. Our Express Homes brand, which is targeted at the true entry level buyer focused primarily on affordability, is now being offered in 38 markets and 11 states, with the significant majority of our Express sales and closings to-date coming from Texas, the Carolinas, and Florida.","This quarter, Express accounted for 13% of our homes sold, 10% of homes closed, and 6% of home sales revenue. The average closing price of an Express Home in the first quarter was $169,000. Customer response to our affordable Express product offerings has been extremely positive, and we expect to have Express Homes communities open in the substantial majority of our markets by the end of this fiscal 2015.","Emerald Homes, our brand for higher end move up and luxury communities is available in 35 markets across 15 states. In the first quarter, 7% of our homes closed were priced greater than $500,000, accounting for 17% of our home sales revenue, up from 5% of homes closed, and 14% of revenues in the same quarter last year. Mike?","Michael Murray","Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 19.8%, in the middle of the expected range we shared on our last call. This was a 70 basis points sequential decline from the fourth quarter, 80 basis points of the margin decrease was due to cost increases in excess of sales price increases and changes in product mix, and 10 basis points was due to slightly higher relative cost for warranty and construction defect claims. These margin decreases were partially offset by a 20 basis point improvement related to less impact from purchase accounting for acquisitions. ","Our general gross margin expectations for fiscal 2015 remain unchanged from what we shared last quarter. With the strong performance of our Express Community so far, we continue to expect this brand to grow quickly as a percentage of our product mix helping us generate strong growth in both revenues and profits, but bringing our average gross margin percentage down this year.","In the current stable housing environment, we continue to expect our average home sales gross margins to be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations that can range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix and their relative impact of warranty, litigation, and interest costs. As a reminder, our reported gross margins include all of our interest costs. Bill?","Bill Wheat","Home building SG&A expense for the quarter was $238 million compared to $183.4 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of home building revenues, our SG&A improved 60 basis points to 10.6% compared to 11.2% in the prior year quarter as our significant revenue increase this quarter improved our SG&A leverage.","For the second quarter, we expect our SG&A as a percentage of home sales revenues to improve year-over-year by 30 to 50 basis points to the range of 10.6% to 10.8%. We expect our third and fourth quarter SG&A percentage to trend down sequentially from the second quarter on higher expected volumes. Our ongoing annual target for SG&A as a percentage of home building revenues is 10%. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Financial services\u2019 pretax income in the first quarter increased 87% to $14.6 million from $7.8 million in the year ago quarter. 89% of our mortgage companies loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our home building operations. FHA and VA loans accounted for 42% of the mortgage companies\u2019 volume, down from 45% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company this quarter had an average FICO score of 717 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. David?","David Auld","At the end of December, we had 21,300 homes in inventory, of which 1,600 were models, 12,400 were spec homes, and 4,500 of the specs were completed. Our construction in progress and finished homes inventory increased by $178 million during the quarter as we prepare for seasonally higher demand in the spring. Our first quarter investment in lots, land, and development totaled $564 million, of which $309 million was to replenish finished lots and land and $255 million was for land development.","At December 31, 2014 our lot portfolio consisted of 125,000 owned lots with an additional 60,000 lots controlled through option contracts. 71,000 of our lots are finished 33,000 are owned and 38,000 are optioned. Our 185,000 total lots owned and controlled put us in a strong competitive position in the current housing market, with a sufficient lot supply to support strong growth in sales and closings in future periods.","As we invest in new communities for all three of our brands our main underwriting criteria remains unchanged. A minimum annual pretax return on inventory of 20% defined as pre-tax income divided by average inventory over the life of the community. We expect each community regardless of brand to achieve this target by optimizing the balance between absorptions, margins and inventory levels. We expect our total home building pretax return on inventory to improve this year as compared to last year. Mike?","Michael Murray","During the first quarter we recorded $2.2 million in land options charges for write-offs of earnest money deposits and due diligence cost for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded $3.8 million of inventory impairment charges related to a pending land sale in our west region. Our inactive land held for development of $304.3 million at the end of the quarter represents 13,900 loss, down slightly from September and down 36% from a year ago. We are proactively working through these older unproductive assets to redeploy the capital, and improve the cash flows and returns.","We continue to formulate our operating plans for each of our remaining inactive land parcels and we expect that our land held for development will continue to decline this fiscal year. We will continue to evaluate our inactive land parcels for potential impairments which may result in additional impairment charges in future periods, but the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate as they have in the past. Bill?","Bill Wheat","At December 31st our homebuilding liquidity included $517.7 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $506 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility. We had $375 million of cash borrowings and $94 million of letters of credit outstanding on the revolver. Our gross homebuilding leverage ratio was 39.3% and our homebuilding leverage ratio net of cash was 35.4%.","The balance of our public notes outstanding at December 31 was $3 billion. Our only public debt maturity in fiscal 2015 is our $158 million of Senior Notes due in February. At December 31, our shareholders equity balance was $5.3 billion and book value per share was $14.40, up 11% from a year ago. Jessica?","Jessica Hansen","Looking forward, we would like to highlight some of our expectations for the fiscal year which are unchanged from our last call and based on the current stable housing market conditions. In fiscal 2015, we continue to expect to close between 34,500 and 37,500 homes and generate consolidated revenues of between $9.5 billion and $10.5 billion. We also continue to expect to generate a similar level of profitability and operating margins is what we shared on our last call. We anticipate our home sales gross margin for the full year of fiscal 2015 will range from 19.5% to 20.5% with potential quarterly fluctuation outside of this range.","We estimate our homebuilding SG&A expense will range from 10% to 10.3% of homebuilding revenues for the full year with our next quarter being higher than this range and the third and fourth quarters at the low end or below the annual range.","We expect our financial services operating margin to range from 25% to 30%. We are forecasting our fiscal 2015 income tax rate to be between 35% and 36% and our diluted share count to be approximately 370 million shares.","For our second fiscal quarter of 2015 we expect our number of homes closed to approximate the beginning backlog conversion rate of between 81% and 85%. We anticipate our second quarter home sales gross margin will be in the range of 19.5% to 20% subject to potential fluctuations from product mix, warranty and interest cost. We expect our homebuilding SG&A in the second quarter to be in the range of 10.6% to 10.8% of revenues, David?","David Auld","In closing our first quarter growth in sales, closings and profits in a relatively stable market is a result of the strength of our operating platform and we are excited about the spring selling season and the opportunities ahead. This quarter, the value of our sales and closings increased by 40% and 37% respectively and we generated another solid quarter of profitability with a consolidated pretax income of $220.7 million on $2.3 billion of revenue.","We remain focussed on growing both our revenues and pretax profits at a double digit pace, while improving our cash flows and increasing our returns. We are well positioned with our solid balance sheet, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our three brands, attractive finished lot and land position and most importantly, our tremendous operational team across the country. We\u2019d like to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and we look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operations during 2015.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is coming from David Goldberg of UBS. Please go ahead.","David Goldberg","Thanks, good morning everybody and congratulations on a great quarter.","David Auld","Thank you, David.","David Goldberg","My first question was on competitive behaviour. We've been hearing about more and more builders talking about incentives increasing, obviously you guys haven't had to change your gross margin forecast. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on what you're hearing from the field. Are you hearing buyers are coming and asking for more incentives and you're just not willing to be flexible that way, or is the value proposition such that you think you already have a more competitive product essentially?","David Auld","David, this is David Auld. I think we have been focussing on the value proposition really since last spring, and we just -- because of our broad footprint, number of communities we have, we are just not seeing the same pressure at any one location that some of the other guys are.","Bill Wheat","And just specifically David, our incentive levels are in the same range that we have seen really since last spring. It\u2019s obviously that sort of community by community levels, so we see some variation there, but in general, we\u2019re hitting our absorption targets pretty consistently and therefore, at a high level we are not seeing any big changes in incentive levels.","David Goldberg","Got it. And just as a follow-up, I think everybody would love to get some color on the markets in Texas, obviously you guys have a very big position, there's a lot of concern given what's going on with oil, maybe you can just kind of give us some on the ground, I know you said January sales and traffic were up sequentially as would expect, generally, but maybe focus in on the markets in Texas and how you're seeing them move here, if we're seeing any pause from the buyers, would be helpful. Thank you.","Michael Murray","Hi David, this is Mike. We saw our Texas operations perform in line with the company and our expectations for the first quarter and into the first few weeks of January so far. So, while we would expect that there could be some general slowdown in Texas at some point, specifically perhaps Houston and Midland, we haven\u2019t exactly seen it yet, and we\u2019re very encouraged seeing the results inline with the expectations right now.","David Goldberg","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Stephen East of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Stephen East","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Just following on Texas, since we get so many questions about it, have you changed what you're doing on land deals? What type of contingency planning are you going through, and again, I understand primarily Houston, but I would love your opinions about how much you think the other markets would ultimately be impacted versus what Houston would be impacted.","David Auld","Stephen, this is David. Obviously Houston and Midland are going to have a tougher time if oil prices stay down than the balance of the markets and Texas. All of them will be impacted. From an investment standpoint, we are well positioned in Texas. We don\u2019t have to go out today and take a lot of risk on the land side as the competition from other builders decreases even if the market stays relatively strong, you know price tomorrow just on rumor and innuendo is probably going to be less than it is today. So we are in the market, we are going to continue to be in the market, but we are not in a place today where we have to go buy anything, so we are going to take a more conservative approach than what you have seen in the last couple of years.","Bill Wheat","And Stephen, this Bill, just to add some specifics to Houston and Midland, our fiscal 2014 revenues in Houston were about 5% of the company and our fiscal 2014 revenues in Midland were less than 1%, so it is certainly compared to the rest of the company relatively small piece, but as you know we manage our business market by market, so we are treating these markets and while we are seeing there individually, we\u2019ll adjust our investment decisions by what we see in those markets.","Stephen East","Okay. Fair enough. And then sort of a two-part, one southwest and west strong order growth just trying to understand where that's occurring and why it's occurring. And then David, you're sort of finishing your first hundred days, if you will, I would love to get your thoughts about what you're seeing maybe it\u2019s a little bit different than your expectations, maybe a direction you'd like to move the company a little bit more or a little bit less, just sort of an initial hundred day wrap-up if you would.","David Auld","I can tell you from the 100 day perspective; I\u2019ve been a part of this management team for 25 years. There were no surprises coming up here, the difference in operational philosophy were we just continued to drive down subdivision by subdivision by subdivision, house by house. That\u2019s been a part of our program for a long time. I\u2019ll probably provide a little more focus on that or conversation with our operators about it, but it\u2019s always been there.","Stephen East","Okay, fair enough.","Bill Wheat","Stephen, this is Bill, you asked about the west and the southwest, obviously the west is a bigger region for us. We have some very good positions in our western markets, and we\u2019re seeing, we have seen pretty good strength in the market there through December, and so we feel like that\u2019s reflecting in our sales growth that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call out one market in particular. Southwest is pretty small for us, it\u2019s basically Arizona, New Mexico, and obviously there\u2019s been a lot of volatility there over the last couple of years, and so you\u2019re seeing a nice increase this quarter, but I wouldn\u2019t read too much into our southwest results given its size.","Jessica Hansen","The changes you are seeing, Stephen, though are truly being driven by absorption, which is what we are pretty excited about that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been focussed on for quite some time now, and with our active selling communities only up about 6% on a year-over-year basis for the entire company and you saw a very strong pick up in our absorption pace this quarter.","Stephen East","Okay, thanks and congratulations on a nice quarter.","Bill Wheat","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Robert Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi this is Collin [ph] filling in for Bob actually. I just had a question on ASP, you guys saw a pretty solid increase in ASP year-over-year. How do you think this pricing is going to trend throughout the year sequentially?","David Auld","Collin [ph] we are kind of projecting ASPs to be flat sort of hard to really predict given the changing mix that we are seeing with Express representing a larger proportion of our sales and deliveries, but we are looking for a flat sales price outlook for the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Stephen Kim from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much guys, yeah congratulations good job executing. I wanted to ask you a question about costs. And as we've been talking to folks in the industry, we've kind of gotten some I would say, we haven't really gotten a lot of agreement about the ability to extract some concessions from your subcontractors, your suppliers etcetera.","Was wondering if you, given your significant gap that you created here between you all and number two, whether you're seeing more success in driving down your input costs, whether it be across labor or materials or really anything, if you could call out something that would be very helpful. Thanks.","Bill Wheat","Yes, Stephen this is Bill. You know that\u2019s something we are still working to kind of trying to find the balance on. If we look year-over-year this on our closings this quarter, our stick and brick cost still increased on a per square foot basis about 6% and our revenues were only up 3%. So we still got some work to do there, we\u2019ve seen that trend over the last few quarters and that\u2019s something we are very focussed on.","And in terms of improving our cost relative to our ability to raise our prices. There is certainly there are always things that we can do with our scale, market by market and globally there are national arrangements and we can assure you that that\u2019s something that we are very focussed on throughout our organization as to even out that relationship and stabilize that going forward, so we can improve our margins.","As far as specific matters, it\u2019s across the gamut [ph] in different categories, you know with oil prices down we have the potential of seeing some benefit on some categories like shingles and things that have petroleum products in them, but I would tell you we are just focussed on anything we can do across the board to improve our improve our cost structure.","Stephen Kim","Got it, okay so it\u2019s a little early still but still hopeful.","Bill Wheat","Absolutely.","Stephen Kim","I wanted to also than follow up if I could a little bit on the other half of the margin equation, which is your price. So obviously you put up a very good order number here as we expected you to. You are continuing to obviously gain a lot of share. But you also mentioned you\u2019re your pretty much your absorption rates were, I think you said in line with your targets. And I guess, I'm trying to figure out whether or not the order growth that you achieved in the quarter, and are achieving generally, is enough for you to perhaps think you might have more opportunity on a pricing side, to get a little more aggressive with pricing. Because from your commentary it didn't sound like -- you maintained your guidance on margins and things like that. Do you think that you do have the ability to push pricing more than you have been, given what you've seen so far in the spring selling season?","Bill Wheat","Stephen its way too early in the spring selling season to really hand out that kind of message, we are happy with where we are. We feel like if it continues, if the market is a good market to this spring, then yes, we will try to push margins. But based upon where we are today it\u2019s just not something we can put out there.","Stephen Kim","Okay.","Bill Wheat","Stephen, as we talked about our goal is to increase efficiencies and at a community by community level and that means, taking the communities to the planned pace that we want for each community. Pace then begets good momentum, positive momentum to given community and certainly as David said its early spring. Spring is not even really here yet. But we\u2019re in line with our expectations and we would expect that we\u2019re going to get every margin of dollar that every dollar of margin we can as we move to the spring and as our pace and absorptions stay on track.","Stephen Kim","Okay, great. Thanks very much guys. Good Job.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ken Zener of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Ken Zener","Gentlemen, Jessica.","Bill Wheat","Good morning.","Jessica Hansen","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zener","Several items I just like to clarify and get a little feedback on. So, your sales pace rose sequentially it seems, is that normal seasonality to you or was there really just a step function in the absorptions that as we move into the second quarter and third quarter we\u2019ll have more normal seasonality?","Jessica Hansen","Ken, we actually saw our active selling communities on average trend down a little bit, so you\u2019re right our increase in absorption was up, say, call it low to mid single-digit. That\u2019s actually pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen over the last few years.","Bill Wheat","Right.","Jessica Hansen","So, nothing out of line. What\u2019s more important which I think is what you\u2019re getting at, is the pickups that we\u2019ll see from December and March, and we\u2019ll be very focused on driving that increase in absorption and making sure that we\u2019re hitting that normal seasonal trends.","Ken Zener","So, to get to that and realizing you guys aren\u2019t necessarily going to give guidance, but historical over the last let\u2019s say 15 years you usually had December pace decelerate to 15% to 18% from September? And then usually you picked up around 50%, 55% in the March quarter, while the December pace is now different slightly. Do you think the March pace, is there any reason that that would accelerate or decelerate versus that kind of 50% rate that we\u2019ve seen historically?","David Auld","I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that we would say that December would read into March. Obviously with improved pace in December we would feel very good if we see our normal 50% increase into the March quarter.","Ken Zener","Okay. And then I guess last question around Express, given that you\u2019re looking for flat pricing this year, you\u2019re costs are kind of still up. You\u2019re obviously executing well in terms of understand how your gross margins are trending. Do you think \u2013 this is a bigger question, but if you\u2019re getting more mix from you Express product? Would it surprise you if 2016 if your price mix was actually down, its not necessarily a bad think obviously if your pace is up at the rate that you\u2019re going, but would that surprise you?","David Auld","I don\u2019t like we\u2019d be surprise, because there\u2019s a lot less competition at that price point, and it\u2019s going to drive, its continuing to drive month over month, quarter over quarter increases.","Bill Wheat","Yes. Ken, I think we would agree with you. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. It\u2019s not a bad thing at all, if our average sales price were to go down because our Express mix has grown. And that\u2019s really part of what\u2019s behind our expectations for our average selling price to be roughly flat this year. Obviously we still saw an increase in Q1, but our expectation was roughly flat because we do expect Express to grow as a percentage of our business this year. And while we may see appreciation in some markets are mixed toward Express may offset that somewhat.","Ken Zener","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Eli Hackel of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Eli Hackel","Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on Express but a little differently, obviously you\u2019re rolling it out throughout your markets now. I\u2019m just curious is sort of what happens when you roll it out sort of the buyer types that are coming. Are these people that have been trying to buy a home for year or two and just there hasn\u2019t been anything in their price point and there\u2019s sort of jus a flood of buyers that come and they\u2019re happy there\u2019s something finally that they can afford. I\u2019m curious about sort of what happens as you enter markets and who\u2019s showing up at the door?","Michael Murray","Hi, Eli, this is Mike. I think you have hit it pretty well. I think that\u2019s been an underserved market segment and that they\u2019re getting a new home product at a very affordable price is an alternative they haven\u2019t had. That combined with some general strengthen in the economy over the past few years and in some job numbers working together to provide that product has been a good outcome for us quite frankly.","Eli Hackel","Great. Okay. Thanks. And then just little direct \u2013 different direction. You talked earlier about increasing cash flows. What type of return \u2013 what type of horizon are you thinking about the cash flows sort of going from negative to positive and you could just talk about preference in order and use of cash when it does do that flip? Thanks.","Bill Wheat","Eli, this is Bill. We\u2019ve talked about fiscal 2015 being the point in which we kind of hit an inflection at a roughly breakeven level for cash. We could be slightly positive, slightly negative that will largely be determined based on what we see in the market in the spring and whether that affects our investment decisions in inventory, but then our expectation is then moving into fiscal 2016 that we should general solid positive cash flows.","We\u2019ve talked quite a bit about the fact that our land supply is at an adequate level and should support growth in sales and closings in the revenue in the next couple of years without really needing to increase that land supply. And we think that\u2019s going to be a big driver towards getting us to a positive cash flow position. What we will do with it when we get to that point is really, we\u2019ll make that decision when we get there.","Today we\u2019re still seeing very strong opportunities in our business to continue invest in strong markets and so that to the extend we see strong opportunities to reinvest in the business that will continue to be our number one priority. Beyond that we\u2019ve continue to be a consistent dividend payer and we\u2019ll always look at our dept levels and to the extent that we feel like it\u2019s most appropriate for us to reduce and we will look at that as well.","Eli Hackel","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Eric Bosshard","Good morning. Just follow-up on Express, just curious as you continue to roll these homes out and have success. How things evolving with the strategy especially as you move into the other markets just thinking if there\u2019s anything different on price points or features, anything that you can do to improve the margin profile, just give us a little bit of an update if you could on how the product is evolving?","David Auld","Well, as you rolled out a new product you gain efficiencies every time your build. And we are also giving a better definition of who is buying. Why they are buying. And targeting what we\u2019re building, what we\u2019re putting in to that buyer. So, the general belief is over time we\u2019ll get add it and we\u2019ll make more money delivering it.","Bill Wheat","And thus far express while the average margin is below the company average. I think we would in general say that margins have been a little better than our original expectations on Express. Still below the average and as we execute and roll it out I think there is definitely will be opportunities to improve on that.","Eric Bosshard","Great. And then, that\u2019s helpful. Secondly, in terms of land costs, if you give us some perspective on the cost of land that you\u2019re using and expect to use over the next year, if there\u2019s any meaningful change in the margin opportunity or the pricing requirements associated with the inflation that\u2019s taking place in your basic land?","Bill Wheat","No, doubt, our land costs are a components that we do expect to increase. We have seen our land as a percentage of our overall revenues or on a per square foot basis, similar to how it look at stick and brick. It has increase as well on a year-over-year basis, it\u2019s up about 6%. And as we work through some of the communities that where we bought the lots and land in 2011 and 2012 and began to work through more of the ones we purchased in 2013 and 2014. We would expect that to increase somewhat. But that\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re certainly focused on and as we look at our expectations for pricing and demand in our markets going forward we certainly focus on trying to only pay what we can afford to hit our margins and return objectives going forward.","Eric Bosshard","Does the up 6% is that kind of sustain that where it should be your \u2013 as you work in more of a 2013, 2014 land, is that still up a little bit that 6% number?","Bill Wheat","That\u2019s on per square foot basis, and that\u2019s where things have been just recently. Would not be surprise for that to continue to move upward a bit as we move through 2015.","Eric Bosshard","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Will Randow of Citi. Please go ahead.","Will Randow","Hey, good morning and congratulations.","David Auld","Thank you.","Jessica Hansen","Thanks Will.","Will Randow","As you guys think about buying land today, I want to get a sense of what are assuming for ASP inflation if you will, I\u2019m assuming low single digit, I know you\u2019re not looking for inflation in your numbers and I would assume that land has actually become a bit cheaper as a percentage of called it home sales revenue for the last call it six months versus 2013 where we can have that double, but love to get your views on that?","David Auld","From price of a lot to the selling price of the house, we haven\u2019t seen a decline over 2013 primarily I think because what we\u2019ve delivered in 2013 we bought in 2012.","Bill Wheat","As we look forward will underwrite a land purchase, we assume flat pricing on the homes as well as flat pricing on the cost develop if it\u2019s a land parcel to be developed as well and stick and brick. It just too hard to start predicting, this is going to go up by this percent, these costs to go up by that percent. It\u2019s much for us controllable underwriting process to look at pricing on a flat basis and then understand what that performance we expected to be to make the investment decision.","Will Randow","And in terms of regional exposure it seems like the southeast firing pretty strong particular, Atlanta where you\u2019ve done a recent acquisition. I guess what\u2019s been your strongest market and your weakest and where have been surprised? Thanks.","David Auld","I mean, we\u2019ve done. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve been surprised. We\u2019ve made a conscious decision to push assets to the East, Southeast particularly. We like the just the demographics and the growth trends and the job growth there. Texas has been strong despite the softening of oil. Texas is going to remain strong at least in my opinion.","Bill Wheat","I think our investments we\u2019ve made in the last couple years in terms we look at the inventory growth by region you\u2019re now seeing that deliver in our results especially on the Southeastern and South Central.","Will Randow","Appreciate the color, and congrats again.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Mike Dahl","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to follow-up on I guess the Texas comment for tying [ph] in Express. If we look at the growth in Express, seems like its accounted for about half of the overall growth in unit orders for the company, presumably it\u2019s a bit higher in Texas, so just wondering how your thinking. Would unit Express still be up in Texas? Just trying to think about how many of these comments are for in specific versus the market?","Bill Wheat","I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that our units would still up in Texas without Express or Express is certainly is a key part of our rollout right now at Texas and in other markets. But I think there is some Company\u2019s specific factors with respect to D.R. Horton in Texas versus what you may hear from some other builders, obviously we\u2019re based in Texas we\u2019ve had a strong position in Texas historically and we have a strong operating platform there that\u2019s allowing us to execute in the current market and we believe would allow us to execute very effectively if the market changes. It has historically and we believe that that we\u2019re in good position to handle whatever the market may bring to us coming forward.","Mike Dahl","Got it. Thanks. And shifting gears, I guess, curious your thoughts on the FHA premium issue, you given the 42% FHA, VA and how your sales people are thinking about this? Is this something where that buyer is even aware of the change in premiums yet or is it a tool that you have your sales people needing to educate buyers and whether or not you\u2019ve seen any initial response from that? Thanks.","Jessica Hansen","Yes, Mike, it\u2019s definitely a tool for our sales people and something that they\u2019re already out there talking to our potential home buyers about. I think some people do come in educated just because that makes a lot of headlines when there are changes on that front. And then there are some people who probably come in that are little less educated. But our salespeople, but our sales people already have flyers out and about letting people know about the change and we\u2019re definitely using that to our advantage from a marketing perspective, a little too early to know what kind of impact that could have, but clearly any incremental easing, in this case lowering of insurance premiums we would look at as a positive.","David Auld","And whether that they are educated about exactly what it means or don\u2019t \u2013 exactly what it means, it has people taking about buying a house and that\u2019s always a good thing for us.","Mike Dahl","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Nishu Sood","Thanks. Wanted to follow-up discussion about the gross margins. It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve had a kind of normal year from a seasonal flow perspective, so if we do end up with that this year stable pricing, incentives et cetera and closings volume rising throughout your fiscal year. Would we expect to see the normal gross margin leverage on fixed cost and therefore some increase this year goes on?","Bill Wheat","Nishu, we really don\u2019t have any significant fixed costs in our gross margin at all, virtually all of our costs are associated in a variable within our margin. So we really don\u2019t see that leverage with volume across our year. We do on the SG&A side, because obviously there\u2019s a fixed component to SG&A, but there is not in terms of margin. What you would see if we see the normal lift and we see consistency through the market that may allow us in our communities to adjust pricing which certainly could help, but no, we don\u2019t expect anything seasonally from a leverage of fixed cost to help our margins. We\u2019re guiding to a range of 19.5% to 20.5% could have some potential quarterly fluctuations there. And right now three weeks into January really the spring and what we see in the market in the spring is going to determine the trajectory of our margins going forward for the rest of the year.","Nishu Sood","Got it. And that\u2019s very helpful. And second question I wanted to ask about the January comments you made. So I know it\u2019s obviously a difficult time of year to assess trends. But given the strong demand that\u2019s you been seeing, any kind of anecdotal indicators you\u2019ve seen to help you understand where that\u2019s coming from? Is that the market? Is that the lower rate environment we\u2019ve seen? You know, gas prices, some of the mortgage stuff that has helped out or is it kind of just D.R. Horton specific? Any kind anecdotal color on that would be helpful?","David Auld","I think weather patterns have been better this year and last year, I mean, we didn\u2019t gave a weather report last year, but I do think that weather impacted people\u2019s ability to get out and buy else. I think the FHA conversation has got people thinking about buying a house and going into models.","The gasoline price is a huge \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s money directly back into the economy every week, I mean, there is no better way to get money into the economy and give it directly to the consumer. I think it\u2019s a combination of three things. I think we\u2019re better position this year coming out the blocks when we last year. We\u2019re excited. We got good people working hard and are well positioned to capture what we think is going to be a good spring.","Nishu Sood","Okay. Great. Thank you for your color.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Adam Rudiger","Hi, thanks. On the heels of that question, this is kind of addressed, but I was curious if you think about your year-over-year change in orders per community how much of that you think is due to say in acquisition, say the product mix maybe incentives that you increased a little bit early in the year, just trying to get a sense of how much of this might be like kind of true organic changes in buying patterns versus as asked earlier kind of Company specific?","Bill Wheat","Yes. Adam, there is just clearly a couple of things running from our acquisition of Crown communities, they are very efficient community builder, so there is a component there as well as the mix to Express. That\u2019s at a higher absorption rates, there is no doubt those are components, but with our sales increase of 35% on an average selling community increase of 6% obviously there\u2019s a lot of organic improvement as well across our organization. And I really thing that\u2019s results of us being very focused community by community and that\u2019s been an emphasis across our organization over the last year to deliver community by community hitting our absorptions, hitting our targets, staying on plan, and then adjusting inventory levels, adjusting our pricing according whether its down or up in order to make sure we stay on target to generate the best returns that we can. I really think that\u2019s that biggest factor.","Adam Rudiger","Got it. Thanks. The rest of my questions have been answered. Thank you.","Bill Wheat","Thanks Adam.","Operator","Thank you. As a reminder ladies and gentlemen, we do have to limit yourself to one and one follow-up. The next question is Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning everyone and nice quarter.","Bill Wheat","Thank you.","Michael Rehaut","First question I had just to go back to the community counts absorption stats from the quarter itself. Community count year-over-year I guess flowed a little bit and you said it was down a little bit sequentially. Is that more of a one quarter phenomenon at least from a sequential standpoint given that you had sort of this consistent low double-digit growth in 2014? Would that kind of stay in mid single-digit year-over-year rate for 2015 or how should we think about that?","Jessica Hansen","Yeah, Mike, what happened this quarter is pretty much exactly in line with what we shared on our last call. We talked about for the year we would anticipate our community count being up. If it\u2019s up in only a low to mid single-digit range. I think we still feel the same way about that for this quarter. We were up 6% on a year-over-year basis and we were down 2% on average sequentially.","So we could see some more sequential quarters that are decreases, but we will \u2013 I mean lot of it depends on our sales pace and as always what we see in the spring, but I think we still think for the full year low to mid single digits is about as much as we would get in terms of increase in community count and we still expect the vast majority of our growth this year to come from increase and absorptions rather than communities.","Michael Rehaut","Great. Now that\u2019s very helpful. And I guess just switching to the sales pace, maybe kind of a two part, with the strong improvement in 1Q and that follow the similar type of rate in 4Q on a year-over-year basis, just wanted to get a sense of if you kind of stripe out maybe the mix shift from the success of Express, what the kind of let\u2019s call the D.R. Horton branded bread and butter communities, would we see a similar type of increase or would it be more of like maybe mid-teen type of rate? That\u2019s one.","And two, just a clarification on the \u2013 when you talk about accelerating sales pace in January that\u2019s typical with seasonality, I presume that if those comments were more towards seasonality that on a year-over-year basis maybe you\u2019re still seeing a similar type of absorption that you saw in 1Q?","Bill Wheat","Mike, on the seasonality we are seeing January move in line with expectations. But three weeks in it\u2019s hard to call a full month and to compare year-over-year. It\u2019s kind of a short window for the comparison. We are encouraged with the January sales pace. It\u2019s meeting our expectations. But there is a seasonal lift that generally occurs this time of year as well.","And then the prior question on the organic Horton sales pace growth, I mean, we are getting lift from the Express rollout. That\u2019s good, but we are also seeing strong solid growth in the Horton brands as well.","Michael Rehaut","And is it mid-teens type of number, the right way to think about that, I mean, I know its maybe difficult parsing out, but clearly there\u2019s a positive mix impact from Express, so just trying to get that order of magnitude?","Bill Wheat","Yeah, Mike we don\u2019t have that specifically, but clearly there\u2019s still a strong double digit growth across really all of our brands right now to nail it down to whether its 15 or whether its 20 would be a little bit difficult for us right here.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jack Micenko with SIG. Please go ahead.","Jack Micenko","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just anything about mix and the absorption and the backlog conversion, are you going into spring 2015 with a greater, larger number finished specs than you did 2014?","David Auld","Yes, we are and it\u2019s really ties to our expectation where the markets going to be.","Jack Micenko","Okay. And can you give us some magnitude on our same-store sales basis how many more you think you have last year? Is that something you can give us?","David Auld","Well, it\u2019s tied to the absorption per flag. As we have pushed up absorptions in our subdivision performance, we have increased spec levels to facilitate the next 90 days sales.","Jessica Hansen","Jack, in absolute terms we\u2019re up about 1000 completed specs on a year-over-year basis.","Jack Micenko","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the impairment line, knowing that it\u2019s a fluid situation and you\u2019re going to opportunistic, I guess the question is more in context. Are you going to be \u2013 should we think of 2014 on that line something closer to 2014 or something lower like the 2013 or 2012 numbers just from a volume, I think you said you have $304 million in land you look to sale or something like that, any context there?","Bill Wheat","Jack, I think as we said that\u2019s kind of a opportunistic taking advantage of pulling those assets out, something that results in impairments, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Generally my gut would be that it will be little bit inside the 2014 level. Hard to exactly predict it though.","Jack Micenko","Okay. That\u2019s fair.","Bill Wheat","That\u2019s really project-by-project, the 304 million that\u2019s our land held for developments, some of which we may chose to bring out and build homes on. Some of which we may decide at some point to sell. What we\u2019ve seen thus far is typically the deals that we\u2019ve been to bring out and build homes on or develop and build homes. We have had very few impairments on those, as the projects that we determined that our best option is to sell in the current markets where it has been more of our impairment, so it will depend on our evaluations project-by-project.","Jack Micenko","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Please go ahead.","Jade Rahmani","Thank you for taking the questions. Just two small ones. What is the mix of spec sales in the quarter and can you also give the mix of first time and first time move up at your mortgage company? Thank you.","Jessica Hansen","Sure, Jade. In terms of our specs as a percentage of our closings this quarter it was right in the normal range we would see which was around 70% to 75% and then the mix of our products for the mortgage company, were you asking specifically about FHA and DA.","Jade Rahmani","First time.","Jessica Hansen","First time, I sorry, we are right around 40%, so that kind of in line with more long-term average range for us. But not surprisingly our Express percentage is running higher than the Company average.","Jade Rahmani","Thank you very much for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Roxland from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Mike Roxland","Thanks very much. Congrats on a good quarter. As we begin to open communities, I think its goes back to one of Bill\u2019s comments, as you begin to open communities on the lots you purchased in 2013 and 2014, is it possible that we could see further margin compression especially if you\u2019re enable to get a better balance between rising inputs and modest price appreciation?","Bill Wheat","Could you repeat some of the Mike, I\u2019m not sure we were quite following.","Mike Roxland","Bill, I think you mentioned or you made a comment that you expect to see lot costs continue to obviously increase and could serve as a potential headwind for gross margin going forward. So, if you\u2019re unable to get a better balance between the rising inputs in aggregate, you obviously going to be dealing with rising inputs, higher lot costs, prices that are modestly improving. Could we see some continued gross margin compression or future gross margin compression in outer year, so maybe not call 2015, but I\u2019ll say, 2016 and beyond?","David Auld","We don\u2019t have that visibility, if the market gets better, our margin will improve and the differential in land cost is not going to drive margins significantly higher or significantly lower.","Bill Wheat","Yes. What we ultimately pay for land is rolling the output of where we expect the market to be when we\u2019re buying it. My comments were specific to the next few quarters in 2015 as we\u2019re working through land that we may have purchased at bit higher prices in 2013 and 2014. But clearly as the market moderated a bit in 2014, the land market while it may not have come down much, certainly isn\u2019t rising at the pace it was, so that\u2019s self adjusting at some point here. So to comment really beyond the next few quarters we really don\u2019t have that visibility.","Mike Roxland","Got it, thanks for the color. And just quickly on home building SG&A came a little better than we expected, is it possible to talk about the SG&A the individual brand specifically Express and Emerald. You know given that Emerald is relatively a new market new buyer type for you, as you gain the experience in producing that product I think you actually sold a few million dollar homes in Texas the last quarter, have you been able to more effectively leverage your volume with Emerald?","David Auld","Mike [ph] we don\u2019t track the SG&A by brand in one of the strategies we\u2019ve looked to do is to leverage our operational platform to serve new customer segments and so that doesn\u2019t require a repeat of all the infrastructure to support those different operations, so we haven\u2019t tried to pass out what the sort of the home building SG&A burden is to those individual brands. But I would say that as we have anniversaried and more than that the roll out of these things we have gotten better, our execution has improved. We have had some of the inefficiencies that just come along with starting something new are behind us. And so I do think that we are gaining efficiencies and certainly as the volumes increase, it helps to absorb the SG&A cost as well.","Mike Roxland","Got it. Thank you for the color. Good luck -- for the balance of the year.","David Auld","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments.","David Auld","Thank you, Mannie. We appreciate everyone\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in April to share our second quarter results. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."]}}
