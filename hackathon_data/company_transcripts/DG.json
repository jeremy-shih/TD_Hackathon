Today is Thursday, December 4, 2014. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. A replay of the call will be available later today. Instructions for listening to the replay are available in the company\u2019s earnings press release issued this morning.","Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Thank you, Dorothy, and good morning everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks and then we will open the up call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases.","Let me caution you that today\u2019s comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions, and other non-historical matters, such as our 2014 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures, our planned fiscal 2014 and 2015 operating, merchandising and store growth initiatives, our beliefs regarding future consumer economic trends and various matters relating to our proposal to acquire Family Dollar. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning; our 2013 Form 10-K which was filed on March 20, 2014; and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents.","You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today\u2019s date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call. We will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Where available, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning\u2019s earnings release, which I have mentioned is posted on dollargeneral.com.","The purpose of today\u2019s call is to discuss Dollar General\u2019s performance for the fiscal third quarter and outlook for the fiscal year. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up to your questions on those subjects. During today\u2019s Q&A, we will not discuss our proposed acquisition of Family Dollar or related matters. Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up question, if necessary.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, everyone. This morning we announced the results for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. David and I will discuss the highlights of the quarter. Then I will address our current initiatives and provide an update on where we are with the Family Dollar transaction.","For the third quarter, net sales grew 7.8% to $4.72 billion. Comp store sales increased 2.8% as compared to the 2013 third quarter with increases in both traffic and average ticket. Extending that trend to 27 consecutive quarters, our comp sales trajectory improved as we move through the quarter and we have seen that trend accelerate into the fourth quarter. We had a good back-to-school season, along with strong sell-through for Halloween. And importantly, we are seeing a significant step up in comp sales as we start the fourth quarter. Momentum has built as we lapped the SNAP benefit cuts in the fourth quarter of 2013 and we expect to achieve a comp sales growth of approximately 5% for the fourth quarter.","Perishables and tobacco continue to be the largest contributors to same-store sales growth. Tobacco has continued to show very strong comp growth beyond its first full year anniversary. Our non-consumables were positive for the quarter marking the third consecutive quarter of improvement. We are extremely pleased with sales growth in our home and apparel categories this year. I believe our efforts on current trends and affordability in these areas have already begun to take hold with our customer.","Our gross profit rate of 30.1% of sales was 18 basis points less than last year\u2019s third quarter. While this was below our expectations due to higher promotional markdowns across consumable categories and end-of-season inventory clearance, this represented a significant improvement over our recent quarterly trend. Finally, adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter increased 10% to $0.79 per share.","We have updated our guidance to reflect performance through the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter for both sales and earnings. We continue to have a strong outlook for the fourth quarter. On the comp sales front, our initiatives coupled with our commitment to everyday low price continue to resonate with our customers. We kicked off the holiday season with a 3-day ad the week prior to Thanksgiving and continue to emphasize our savings over an 8-day period centered on Thanksgiving Day. We offered exclusive holiday savings across gifts, toys, electronics, clothing, d\u00e9cor, baking and additional categories for every holiday need. We are pleased with our customer\u2019s response to these promotional events. As we lap some of the retail challenges from the fourth quarter of 2013, we are seeing broad-based momentum build in our business.","I will talk more about our operating initiatives in a moment, but now I would like to turn the call over to David.","David Tehle","Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. First, let me walk you through our gross margin performance. Gross profit increased by 7.2% as a percentage of sales and decreased by 18 basis points to 30.1% in the 2014 third quarter compared to the 2013 third quarter. Our product category with the lowest gross profit rate is consumables and this category continues to comprise a larger portion of our net sales primarily as a result of increased sales of lower margin tobacco and perishable products. The gross profit rate decrease was also impacted by an increase in markdowns due to increased promotional and end of season inventory clearance activities. These factors were partially offset by higher initial markups on inventory purchases and improved inventory shrink.","We recorded a LIFO provision of $2.2 million in the 2014 period compared to a LIFO benefit of $3.7 million in 2013 period. This equates to 13 basis points of negative pressure on gross margin percentage. As compared to our forecast for gross profit, we successfully mitigated the impacts of the West Coast ports slowdown and driver shortages on gross margin due in part to stem miles from the successful opening of our Bethel, Pennsylvania distribution center earlier this year.","SG&A expense was 21.8% of sales in the 2014 period compared to 21.4% in the 2013 period. For the third quarter 2014 SG&A expense includes expenses of $8 million or 17 basis points related to our proposed acquisition of Family Dollar. The remaining 21 basis points of SG&A rate increase are attributable to increases in rent, utilities and incentive compensation expenses. Offsetting these items were convenience fees charged to customers for cash back and debit card transactions and retail labor expense which increased at a rate lower than our increase in sales. The third quarter tax rate was 36.5% compared to last year\u2019s effective tax rate of 35.6%. Both years included benefits from the reduction of reserves that were established in 2009. These amounted to $4.7 million in the 2014 quarter and $6 million in 2013 quarter. Excluding these adjustments, the increase in our tax rate relates to the expiration of various federal job tax credit programs and the impact of certain non-deductible expenses related to the proposed acquisition of Family Dollar.","Year-to-date, we generated cash from operations of $841 million, that\u2019s up $80 million from last year\u2019s 39 week period. Total capital expenditures were $289 million including $104 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores. $86 million related to new leased stores primarily for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment. $36 million for distribution and transportation related capital expenditures. $29 million for stores built by the company and $28 million for information systems upgrades and technology related projects. Our share repurchase program is on hold as we await the outcome of our proposed transaction with Family Dollar.","Turning now to guidance, top line sales for the full year 2014 are expected to increase approximately 8% at the low end of our previous guidance range and same store sales are now expected to increase at or slightly below the low end of our previous range of 3.0% to 3.5%. With same store sales growth of approximately 5% forecast for the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year to be in the middle of our previous full year adjusted earnings per share range of $3.45 to $3.55. This excludes any costs related to the potential FDO transaction.","In addition it assumes no additional share repurchases in the fourth quarter. It does assume the reinstatement of the work opportunity tax credit back to the beginning of the year which has always been included in our guidance for our effective tax rate for the year. The impact of the tax credit is approximately $0.04 per share. For the year we are on track to open approximately 700 new stores and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million which is down from our earlier expectations due primarily to the timing of the build out of our new San Antonio, Texas distribution center and lower overall costs for new stores.","With that I will turn the call back over to Rick.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you, David. As we have said for many quarters driving unit sales growth is key to our long-term strategy. And I am pleased to report that we continue to make progress in this area. Once again in Nielsen syndicated data, we have grown both units and dollars share in the mid to high-single digits in the most recent 4-week and 12-week periods on top of our long track record of share growth. I believe this is attributable to our commitment to affordability. With our focus on affordability, we are offering customers to trade down on purchase price for infants in key categories such as food, paper, home cleaning, and pet, unit growth is significantly ahead of sales growth in the most recent 12-week period. There is no doubt we may have sacrificed some sales as we look to drive units. Given the importance of unit growth and transaction growth as leading indicators of relevancy with our customers and of our future success, we believe this is the right trade-off for us.","Another factor impacting our comp sales growth worth mentioning is that we have had essentially no inflation. The foundation of everything we do at Dollar General is grounded in serving our customers. We remain committed as ever to providing our customers with everyday low prices they can count on. We want to make sure that our customers know that they can find nearly all of their everyday items in our small box convenient stores. Our customers are the first place we start as we build our merchandising plans for the coming year.","While on paper, it appears that the economy is improving, the low to middle income consumer who is our core customer continues to look for ways to manage her budget as she works to prioritize her spending and she trusts that we are on her side to help her stretch her budget. Keep in mind, she had a tough fourth quarter last year with the number of headwinds that are starting to moderate year-over-year, including SNAP benefit reductions, challenging weather, higher energy costs, reduction in unemployment benefits and the lingering effects on consumer spending from the 2% payroll tax increase in 2013.","As I reflect on our trends for the year, I believe that we underestimated the impact of these cumulative headwinds on our customer. As a result, there is no doubt that affordability is and will continue to be a focus of our core customer. Our renewed focus on $1 to $5 items continues to gain traction. We had more than 75% of our SKUs or 78% of our sales for the third quarter, that were items priced at $5 or less. This is important as we know we trade more customers with the $1 fixed price retail concept than any other small box retailers. Beyond that, we are continuing to add items with approximately 80 SKUs under our smart and simple brand at entry level price points across 26 merchandise categories.","In addition to the smart and simple brand, we continue to strategically introduce new $1 price point items on the shelf in key consumable categories, such as food, home cleaning and paper products that are focused on affordability. All-in, SKU counts in our dollar section of the store have increased more than 50% as compared to the end of 2013. New items include a combination of national brands and our private brands. In addition, we have expanded our dollar section offering to an additional 845 stores, with 96% of our stores having anywhere from 12 to 40 feet of dollar products across multiple categories with an emphasis on health, beauty, paper, home cleaning and food. These dollar category expansions are a great way for customers to have increased purchasing power in our stores. Given that our average basket is around $11 our expanded offerings can have a positive halo effect on our customer satisfaction as they leave our store with an additional item or two.","We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our $5 or less price point assortment on our non-consumable categories, which represent about 60% of our merchandise offering. This clear focus on expandable consumption items at affordable price points has contributed to solid growth in our home and apparel sales this year. As a result of these merchandise changes, we are seeing improvements in category sell-through rates.","Non-consumables are important to our sales mix as we strive to enhance our gross profit rate. In the coming year, our plans have been developed to advance expandable consumption items in multiple categories, including storage, candles and domestics. In addition, we are in the midst of repackaging our private brands across both select consumable and non-consumable categories. The goal of the repackaging is to enhance our customer\u2019s perception of our private brand quality and value for the price. We had a test launch of the new packaging in select products with very encouraging results. And the majority of new repackaged items will be on the shelf in 2015. We continue to grow our private brand with SKU count up 6% and penetration of over 24%. We continue to look at ways to leverage technology and engage consumers. We completed the initial rollout of our digital coupon capabilities in August and began to aggressively launch that program at the end of September and throughout October with our fast way to say promotion.","To-date sign-ups had significantly exceeded our expectations and we have already hit our target for the year end. With nearly 18 million digital coupons downloaded already activations and redemptions are having a strong impact on sales of coupon specific items. In 2015 we will be able to use the data captured from this program like a loyalty card, but without incremental cost. For instance insights from a customer shopping trip can be used to customize individual promotions to drive trips and baskets. This is an exciting opportunity that we should be able to capitalize on in 2015.","I am pleased to report that we had favorable results and improving our inventory shrink performance in the third quarter. Over time shrink improvement continues to be an opportunity as we remain steadfastly committed to reducing our shrink levels on a store by store basis. The store format and layout SKU rationalization of high-shrink items, defensive merchandising and exception based reporting all play a role as we look for shrink improvement going forward. Driving productivity at the store level is important as ever, as our overarching goal was to create time savings that we can reinvest to better manage our stores and service our customers.","In order to enable productivity gains we are elevating our category management processes to optimize all areas of the store be on the planograms to include all shelf and end cap displays. Over the last several years we have made significant strides in the productivity of our planograms through SKU selection and ongoing refinement. We feel we have established a strong foundation on our planograms that we can refine periodically. We are concentrating on simplifying work at a store level by reducing the complexity of planogram resets.","At Dollar General real estate is the core strength. Our real estate model is disciplined and focused on financial returns. Year-to-date we have opened up 617 new stores and relocated or remodeled 874 stores including approximately 380 lifecycle remodels. The lifecycle remodels are focused on our legacy smaller footprint stores and allow us to improve adjacencies and planogram layouts. These stores are getting closer to the same sales lift as we get in our full remodel with a much lower investment resulting in returns on the lifecycle remodels that are over 200 basis points higher than our full remodel.","Given the strong returns, we plan to significantly expand our lifecycle remodel program in 2015. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015, we will be utilizing our merchandising predictive technology capabilities in over 250 of our lifecycle remodels to optimize our space and SKU productivity. So we expect these remodels to drive even higher sales.","In 2015 we plan to open approximately 730 new stores and to relocate or remodel 875 stores with the priority on lifecycle remodel. In total square footage growth is expected to be about 6%. We will expand our footprint into three new states in 2015 Maine, Rhode Island and Oregon as we use our real estate model to identify winning sites for our traditional Dollar General format. We are right where we want to be as we enter the New Year. Our real estate pipeline is 100% committed and we are already working on 2016. Our new store productivity continues to be about 85% of our comp base and we are looking forward to successful store openings in 2015. Also in 2015, we will open our 13th distribution center as we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our growth. Site work has started on the new distribution center in San Antonio, Texas and we plan to begin shipping from that distribution center in late 2015. We have exciting plans for 2015 and have lots of opportunities ahead of us.","Now, turning briefly to our proposal to acquire Family Dollar, we are as committed as ever to this acquisition and believe that the synergies we expect to achieve through the combination of these two companies would benefit Dollar General shareholders and importantly the consumer for many years to come. We are working hard to be in a position to complete this transaction and begin the process of combining our two companies. To that end, as we have stated, we are actively engaging with the SEC and believe that we are making good progress on that front.","We filed our HSR notification with the SEC in mid-September. Since the filing, we have provided the SEC with tens of thousands of documents and have had a number of very valuable and productive discussions. Family Dollar shareholders are currently scheduled to vote on the Dollar Tree transaction at a special meeting on December 23. We are very aware of the calendar and we look forward to sharing more information with sufficient time for Family Dollar shareholders to make and inform voting decision at the December 23 shareholder meeting.","Our 75th anniversary has been a time to reflect on our company\u2019s rich heritage and our mission of serving others. It\u2019s also an exciting time to look to the future and envision what the next 75 years will bring for Dollar General. My sincere thanks and appreciation go out to the 106,400 Dollar General employees as we are in the midst of the busiest season of retail. Over the years, Dollar General employees have built this business through hard work and dedication to our mission and we owe them a great deal of gratitude. Thank you for an amazing 75 years.","Mary Winn, I will now open the call up for questions.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Yes. Dor, as previously mentioned we will not discuss our proposed acquisition of Family Dollar or related matters. Please limit your questions to one line and one follow-up question, if necessary. We will now open up the call for questions. Dorothy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Taylor LaBarr with Stifel.","Taylor LaBarr-Stifel","Good morning, Taylor. Again, thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit on the seasonal category trends throughout the quarter? How they performed relative to expectations whether it was the same comp cadence of improvement? And then also expectations going into the fourth quarter, it looks over the past few years seasonal has been relatively weaker in the fourth quarter relative to other categories. So, should we \u2013 as you look at your plans and trends today, is that a structural trend we should expect to continue or is that more of a multi-year easy comparison that we should think about?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, great questions. We had a very good Halloween and good back-to-school really pleased with that. I will tell you the bigger season had slowed down a bit, summer and spring, and of course, we experienced a little bit of slow traffic last year on Christmas. I will tell you we had an offering this year on the Christmas side that is much different than last year and it\u2019s focused on affordability. Many, many items below $5 and again this idea that the $1 price point is incredibly important to our customer, a lot of items focused on $1. And we \u2013 I don\u2019t see a structural change yet. We are looking for good things with seasonal in the fourth quarter. We will see how it plays out.","Taylor LaBarr-Stifel","Great, thanks.","Rick Dreiling","Thanks, Taylor.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Lasser-UBS","Good morning, Rick. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Obviously, a lot of focus on gas prices, but also on the competitive environment, in the third quarter we saw some improvement from some other discounters at least a sequential improvement from the second to the third quarter. So, my question is what do you think the possibility is that as gas prices decline that you will start to see some customers shift out of the discount convenience channel into other areas, especially after you have seen such a massive customer migration into your channel over the last several years?","Rick Dreiling","Yes. I think that the way I look at the gas prices, number one you are not going to see it takes a while for the consumer to really believe they got extra change in their pockets. It\u2019s going to take a series of trips to the gas station to realize there is a little more money there. I think the other thing to take into account would be that it makes the customer more malleable. They obviously have the wherewithal to search for more deals across more channels. But at the end of the day we are on our 27th year of same store sales growth. We have had good times, we have had bad times, good economies, high gas prices, low gas prices and our customer always seems to search us out. So I think the work we have done on affordability, I think we have hit that one out of the park. The unit growth that we are seeing is great. And again I think as long as we stay focused on affordability the customer is going to always be searching for us.","Michael Lasser-UBS","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. My follow-up question is now that you have focused on affordability and building units, how do you build the basket or get them to trade back off after you have introduced the customer to all these new products, was that \u2013 is that not the focus?","Rick Dreiling","Yes. I would tell you the focus is on transactions and it\u2019s focused on units. I \u2013 my personal feeling on this Michael is I never want to be in a position where I would tell my traffic is down and my basket is up. And I think that is \u2013 that\u2019s when you start to get yourself into a bind. Our basket has been around $11 every year I have been here and what we are seeing is our customers coming back more often to us.","Michael Lasser-UBS","Okay. Thanks and good luck with the holiday.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli-RBC Capital Markets","Good morning. Hi guys. Obviously, you have had the lower gas prices and you have also seen a little bit of recovery in some of the labor metrics for let\u2019s call it non-college educated consumers let\u2019s call blue collar kind of people, Rick when you think about kind of all the gives and takes on the consumer side, I mean how are guys kind of thinking about and how do you think it rolls through 2015?","Rick Dreiling","Yes. I think the middle income, low income customer, I do think there is still \u2013 I still think they have got some issues. I don\u2019t believe they have them to the magnitude they had them last year. I do feel better about the consumer, but I am still little more cautious. I am cautiously optimistic. And I think it\u2019s interesting when we \u2013 you can almost go back last year and look at when the staff cuts hit and what would happen. This year you can see when we have lapped those staff cuts you can see the change in consumer behavior. So again I am cautiously optimistic. And I think it will flow through to the retail sales line as we move through \u201915.","Scot Ciccarelli-RBC Capital Markets","And when you consider kind of incremental changes for \u201915, I know it\u2019s becoming a bigger topic for a bunch of our retailers just in terms of some of the changes being implemented with healthcare, affordable care, etcetera, have you guys thought about the potential impact that could potentially have on some of your consumer buying patterns?","Rick Dreiling","Yes. And again that\u2019s why we are so committed to the affordability piece, that\u2019s why we are working so hard, getting items into the store that price $5 or less or even centered around the $1 price point. The whole idea here is I believe affordability is going to be with us for a period of time yet.","Scot Ciccarelli-RBC Capital Markets","Got it. Thanks a lot guys.","Rick Dreiling","Yes. And our customer is always looking for a bargain.","Scot Ciccarelli-RBC Capital Markets","Understood, thanks a lot.","Rick Dreiling","Alright. Thanks Scot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer from Raymond James.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning Dan.","Dan Wewer-Raymond James","Thanks. Your focus on growing transactions and market share makes a tremendous amount of sense, but the one problem is that Dollar General\u2019s generally has now dropped for four consecutive years and inventory is about 50% of your tangible assets. So the focus on growing share is coming at the expense of lower returns, looking let\u2019s say into 2015 or 2016 are there any initiatives that could enable you to achieve both a better market share as well as a higher inventory productivity?","David Tehle","A couple of comments on that, first of all you have take into account tobacco when you look at the margin. And we made a strategic decision to add tobacco knowing what that would do overall. I think as we look forward, there are initiatives going on in foreign sourcing in our private label as well as shrink. And as Rick mentioned in his comments, we saw some positives in shrink this quarter. So, we still have the capability to add to that gross margin in that gross margin percent. Having said that, again I go back to what Rick said as you kicked this off driving unit sales growth and transaction growth will continue to be high priorities for us. And what we are going to be focused on, because we think ultimately that\u2019s what our long-term shareholders want to see, but yes, there is room in margin and there are things where we continue to work on, but again the unit growth and the transaction growth will always be at the top of the list.","Dan Wewer-Raymond James","And David, just a follow-up, you had in your prepared comments you noted that in the fourth quarter, you will get a $0.04 contribution from tax credits. So, I guess tax rate is going to be about 35.5%, 36%. Did you have a similar tax credit in the fourth quarter of last year?","David Tehle","So, what this is the, WOTC, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. And the way this works is these benefits expired December of last year and we have been waiting all year for the federal government to take action on this. Last night, the House passed a bill of tax extenders by a vote of 378 to 46. That bill was now sent to the Senate and the Senate is waiting for \u2013 we are waiting for the Senate to take action on it. We obviously can\u2019t predict what the Senate will do, but if past history is any indication more than likely a 1 year extension will be provided. This is what we saw back in 2012 when this happened also and then it will be retroactively applied back. So, we will get the full year credit in the fourth quarter. As we have done our guidance for the full year, we always had this in our guidance. This isn\u2019t anything new. We felt like WOTC would come back and we felt like it would probably be the fourth quarter, simply because that\u2019s how it happened in the past. So, again it\u2019s been in there and that\u2019s our thought process in terms of what hopefully will take place, but of course, we can\u2019t predict what the federal government will do.","Dan Wewer-Raymond James","Exactly. And you are always saying it was included in last year\u2019s fourth quarter earnings?","David Tehle","It was included all year, last year. Yes. If you go back to 2012, but it\u2019s the fourth quarter in 2012, because we had this situation where we have got reinstated.","Dan Wewer-Raymond James","Okay, right. So, we are just trying to get an apples-to-apples number for the fourth quarter so? And so you are saying that it was worth $0.04 a year ago in the fourth quarter?","Mary Winn Pilkington","No, Dan, it\u2019s Mary Winn. It was even because that have been adopted at the end of 2012, it was retroactive for 2012 and we took that all in the fourth quarter 2012. And at that point in time, we have provided the breakout of what that was on each quarter. And as it ended in 2013, it was effective all year in all four quarters.","Dan Wewer-Raymond James","Okay, I think I understand. Okay, thanks.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Beginning of 2014.","Dan Wewer-Raymond James","Here you go. Got it. Okay, great. Thank you.","David Tehle","Yes. It expired in December 2013.","Mary Winn Pilkington","That\u2019s right.","Dan Wewer-Raymond James","Okay, thanks.","Mary Winn Pilkington","You are quite welcome. Dorothy, we will move to the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, Meredith.","Meredith Adler-Barclays","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just go into a little bit more detail about how you use the data from your coupon program. I understand you see it as being similar to loyalty program, but less expensive, but could you just walk us through kind of how it works what you get and then what you do with the information?","Rick Dreiling","Yes. I mean, it\u2019s very similar to a loyalty card. The advantage is we don\u2019t have to massage the data, the company that we are working with does. And what you do is you offer them a coupon to see if you can change their behavior and the example would be Meredith, I offer you a $1 off Charmin toilet tissue and you don\u2019t respond to that coupon, right. And so then what would happen is that would mean you are buying your tissue somewhere else and I can turn around and make the offer more rich and then it allows me \u2013 and what happens is I have a slate of coupons and you opt into them. And again, the coupons you choose not to opt into would indicate you are probably buying your products somewhere else. And I can enrich in those \u2013 I can enrich those offers to drive your behavior.","Meredith Adler-Barclays","And do you get to in some way keep track of each individual\u2019s purchases over time?","Rick Dreiling","Absolutely, remember everybody enters their phone number and its how they register.","Meredith Adler-Barclays","Right, got it. And then I guess wanted to talking \u2013 you were talking about your \u2013 I don\u2019t want call them lifestyle remodels, but you know that\u2019s not what I mean, of lifecycle remodels and\u2026?","Rick Dreiling","Yes. Sure.","Meredith Adler-Barclays","And you talked about I think 250 stores where you are actually going to be changing the offering and I think probably matching it to the local community better, could you just talk about that initiative?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, absolutely. So what we are going to do is we are going to take a store that\u2019s a store historically smaller that would go into a relocation been Meredith and we are going to fresh in these stores up and remodel them. And the idea here is they are going to have we will go into the store and analyze it and do category management. I will use an example. This particular store in this particular market might sell more powder detergent than liquid detergent. And what we will do is adjust the set to reflect more powder detergent, right. And there are markets believe it or not where power is still the biggest item. We have some markets where and I will used the example of diapers. We have a diaper set that\u2019s exactly the same in every store across the chain. And now we will be able to contract diapers and maybe expand on incontinence items in areas where we are closer to \u2013 where the client is older. So we are really excited about this and it\u2019s the heat mapping concept that the guys have taken and spread out where we can really understand what\u2019s selling and what\u2019s not on an individual store basis now.","Meredith Adler-Barclays","And do you believe that that drives sales or margin or both?","Rick Dreiling","Actually, I would say both because what we end up doing is having the items the customer wants and hopefully they will buy more of them and then consequently it drives more transactions. And again I equate that Meredith down to more units and more transactions. We are focused on units and transactions.","Meredith Adler-Barclays","Great. Thank you.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Right, Dorothy we will move to the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning Matt.","Matt Nemer-Wells Fargo Securities","So I wanted to talk about promotional activity, it was very heavy early in Q2 and then it had moderated, but it sounds from your comments like it may pick back up again in Q3 given the higher consumables markdowns in the end of season inventory clearance, can you just give us some color around the cadence of the promotional activity?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, I think it is I would say it\u2019s certainly a little higher than quarter two, but I would not call it irrational or nearly as competitive as last year. Again our goal has always been to come to the market with the right items. And I would look at you and say it\u2019s primarily the promotional activity right now Matt around CST. And again, I think I brought up in the second quarter or first quarter that we were going to be in line on CST pricing and that\u2019s where you will find the bulk of the incremental markdown for us.","Matt Nemer-Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, could you just talk to the interplay between the port issues and the driver shortages versus potential relief on freight from lower diesel prices?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, I will tell you that that we do have some merchandise that\u2019s hung up on West Coast. We have worked very hard and absorbed incremental transportation costs to try and get in move that product around. I also know that we found out yesterday some of the shippers are refusing now to go in to the West Coast docks and which is going to create more pressure. We estimate that between the dock shortage, the higher cost to get merchandise moved that it\u2019s about 6 to 9 basis points. We offset that by the way with vessel where we were able to get our stem miles down. I do think that it\u2019s going to be a problem as we move through the fourth quarter and it will be a problem for everybody. We are working hard on trying to divert products to the East Coast. There has been no indication that they are going to support their brothers on the West Coast. So we are going to had stay tuned on that one.","Matt Nemer-Wells Fargo Securities","But is there anything as you see kind of gas prices down and diesel prices down is that big enough to potentially offset some of that how quickly does reset in your negotiations with the truckers?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, I think the down diesel prices will help, but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to help depending on the magnitude of what we encounter. I think you guys all know the West Coast. The President has said he is not going to interfere with that. He is going to let it take its own course. So, I think the gas price, the lower diesel costs will help, but it\u2019s not going to cover at all.","Matt Nemer-Wells Fargo Securities","Got it. Okay, very helpful. Have a great holiday.","Rick Dreiling","You too. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, John.","John Heinbockel-Guggenheim","Hey, Rick. So, let me ask you $5 items and under, where do you think that ultimately goes as a percent of sales, right? So, how do you think that goes in a reasonable period of time here? And then secondly as part of that if the number of items per basket are going up, ASP is going down, does that create some pressure managing retail labor, right, because you are trying to get throughput on more items with the same, kind of the same basket size?","Rick Dreiling","Yes. The first part of your question, we will let the customer decide, right. Why we are adding more $1 and more items under $5? We still have a broad selection of products, right. So, we are still very much in the game of letting the customer make the decision of what they want and part of the way we have \u2013 part of the way, part of our success over the last year has been our ability to broaden our appeal. And some of that is not only the affordability angle, but also having some more stuff in there.","The second part of your question, we are working on getting case packs down, which will make it easier for the retail team to absorb the incremental items. I also think that having been a retailer, having been on that side of the ledger, when sales are moving in the right direction, we have always somehow managed to conquer anything that\u2019s associated with it. And Greg and his team have done a marvelous job this year so far of working their way through that. We also John have \u2013 which we rolled out this year, a very serious stocking initiative and we are doing a much better job, not only in how we ship the product to the stores, but we are doing a much better job of measuring stocking productivity.","John Heinbockel-Guggenheim","Alright. And then just secondly, I know you don\u2019t \u2013 you never quantify where you sit with shrink, but where do you think that opportunity sits either relative to where it might have been when you first came in or relative to however you want to measure it is there is still a fairly large opportunity there?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, it is certainly not at the level it was when I came in. It\u2019s better than that. But I see it as a significant improvement to come yet.","John Heinbockel-Guggenheim","Okay, thank you.","Rick Dreiling","Back even John, where we were, we need to be better than where we were if that helps.","John Heinbockel-Guggenheim","Okay, thanks a lot.","Rick Dreiling","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, Ed.","Edward Kelly-Credit Suisse","Hey, guys. How are you?","Rick Dreiling","Good.","Edward Kelly-Credit Suisse","I would like to just ask you a question about the gross margin here. On a FIFO basis, you are actually almost flat, which is the first time in probably a couple of years, but you have seen that. And what I was looking into is maybe get some additional color on the puts and takes here, because the question is around affordability, for instance and the work you are doing there? What impact on the gross margin does that have? You have mentioned no inflation in the business, but I think we have seen inflation, for instance, in consumables. So, are you holding the line there? Is that having a negative impact, right? And then how are you offsetting all that?","David Tehle","Yes. I\u2019d say let me take a shot at some of this and then certainly Rick will comment too. You have to remember in our business, we are not as based on meat and produce and things of that nature, where there has been lot more impact of inflation. Now, we have had a little bit of inflation in our candy and some of our other perishables, a little bit in tobacco. And particularly as compared to last year, where it was actually going the other way and that\u2019s why we have this LIFO that I spelled out earlier on the call, but I think as you look at it, again I go back to the three basic items that help us on gross margin in terms of offsetting negatives and that is the foreign sourcing, the private label and the shrink and we continue to push all three of those in terms of trying to drive a little bit more on the gross margin and the gross margin percentage.","Edward Kelly-Credit Suisse","The work around affordability and particularly you think about like the $1 price point for instance, what impact does that have on margin? And then what impact does that have on gross profit dollars?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, the margin on the affordability items is actually accretive. They tend to \u2013 the $1 items tend to carry a little bit higher margin rate. As do and kind of that margin rate will \u2013 Ed not as great when to the $5 items, but the lower priced items believe it or not carry more and it should help our rate.","Edward Kelly-Credit Suisse","Alright, so do you think you are at the point where we should begin to see stability in the gross margin going forward or maybe even opportunity now?","Rick Dreiling","I \u2013 that is kind of where I am at right now to be honest with you. The work we have done on the margin, we all have to remember we got cigarettes in there which is a 17 basis points drag. Albeit we have cycled that, but we anticipate we have margin expansion opportunities going forward now.","Edward Kelly-Credit Suisse","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning Paul.","Paul Trussell-Deutsche Bank","Good morning Rick. Just to continue the conversation there on margins, just if you can hold our hand a little bit more on how you are thinking then about the fourth quarter, you have mentioned in the prepared remarks that you were a little bit disappointed in gross margins or is a little bit below I should say your initial expectations. Do you see sequential improvement ahead given some of the comments you just made around some of these initiatives on private label. And also if you can just remind us David on how we should be thinking about the impact of the incentive comp swing within SG&A?","David Tehle","Yes. So I think as we look at the fourth quarter right now we are calling margins to be relatively flat overall in terms of basis points. And then we do have a significant delevering of SG&A and you hit it right on the biggest piece of that, it has to do with the incentive comp. If you go back to our script from fourth quarter last year, you will see that we spelled out that incentive comp was a 45 basis point negative \u2013 excuse me a 45 basis point positive last year to it because in essence we had a fairly sizable reserve reversal in the fourth quarter since we did not pay any incentive comp. So that\u2019s the magnitude of what we are up against this fourth quarter.","Paul Trussell-Deutsche Bank","Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just to go back and kind of clarify the fourth quarter comp outlook is certainly encouraging to hear that there has been an improvement in trends recently and we certainly acknowledge that you have an easier compare as we move through the quarter, but still a 5% comp would be a pretty meaningful lift and acceleration on a one year basis maybe give us a little bit more color on what provides that level of confidence, how you think the discretionary categories will perform and to what extent if at all are you \u2013 do you believe that there will be incremental buying activity due to lower gas prices?","Rick Dreiling","Yes. Really good question and I will break it into a couple of different buckets here. This week last year was the first major snow event of the year in which we took a pretty sizable \u2013 we had sizable difficulty managing the weather this Saturday, this coming Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday and next week. If you look at January Paul of last year and I think we called it out on the conference call for the fourth quarter. We came to work and had a thousand stores shutdown in several locations, right. And we dealt with a very, very, very weak January last year. January historically is one of our better months, better periods of the year.","So I feel very comfortable in that there was \u2013 and remember I am getting a little ahead of myself here is I think as I recall there was a major snow event the week before Christmas last year. And unless you read the farmers almanac, I am very positive on weather for the quarter. But I think that with \u2013 we have got that in our favor. And then I think the quality of our merchandise offering for Christmas is much better than it was last year, much better focused on affordability. This is obviously the big trick-or-treat weekend. This is the first weekend where we see a lot of the Christmas trees being bought and all the decorations. And I am still a little bit of a merchant and we have reviewed all of our merchandising plans for December and January with the team and we look pretty good.","Paul Trussell-Deutsche Bank","Best of luck.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Mushkin-Wolfe Research","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to kind of step back and maybe just review, I know we have suspended the share repurchase, but maybe we can just remind everybody kind of how you look at your balance sheet just generally in share repurchase notwithstanding obviously the activity, but just kind of a review of how you guys think about things?","Rick Dreiling","Sure. Obviously, our number one priority is investing in the business. We are a growth company. It\u2019s important to us to be opening up stores. So making sure that we have the capital to open new stores to do remodels, to do relocations and that we have the infrastructure in the back end of the business to support those stores whether that be in the transportation and distribution area, in IT that we have systems that will help make sure that we are supporting the stores, it\u2019s all about the stores obviously. And then with the cash we have left over, our priority is share buyback. And again buying back as much stock as we can with what we have left after we have invested in the business and because of the pending efforts on Family Dollar, we have suspended that share buyback on a temporary basis.","Scott Mushkin-Wolfe Research","And a follow-up as far as like the levels of leverage you are comfortable with on the balance sheet, can you refresh us on that one as well?","Rick Dreiling","Sure.","Scott Mushkin-Wolfe Research","Well, outside the M&A activity?","Rick Dreiling","Right. Yes, exactly and that\u2019s very, very important. We became investment grade a while back and our thought process is that we want to stay investment grade in order to do that debt to EBITDA needs to be somewhere in that 3.0, maybe a little bit higher than that 3.1 somewhere in that range overall is where our targets are. Right now, we are at 3.1. We had a fairly sizable share buyback earlier in the year, $800 million that\u2019s still with us that\u2019s impacted that industry. That\u2019s why it\u2019s 3.1. We had been in 3.0 pretty solidly for many quarters on that.","Scott Mushkin-Wolfe Research","Alright, that\u2019s perfect. And then I had another longer term strategic question really revolving around the merchandising, I know you guys have got the DG market out there and it\u2019s still I think in test mode, but what is the kind of longer term think about how you are thinking about perishables in your business? Lot of our research shows at the lower end, you started to embrace a higher degree of wanting more fresh items and want to think is that something you think you can do by yourself? Will you need a partner? I mean, how are you thinking about fresh going forward?","Rick Dreiling","Yes. I think \u2013 as I think about this, one of the areas that we have struggled with the most on the DG market side is the produce and the meat side, the fresh side. And when you grow up like I did managing in a grocery store, managing in produce and meat, you realize that it\u2019s basically, you treat it like a living thing. And when you don\u2019t grow up with that, it\u2019s very hard to get people to understand the importance of rotation and the importance of display techniques. So, it sounds easy to do, but it\u2019s much more difficult than that. I think long-term, it\u2019s possible that a Dollar General might have some subset of fresh merchandise like maybe some oranges and some apples and bananas and potatoes, but long-term right now at least and by the way you never say never, but right now I would say us getting into any kind of significant position in that kind of perishable merchandise is probably not on our radar screen right now. Now, frozen food we love and we have done a lot of great work on that. And by the way, we have done some good on easier to manage perishable items like cheese and butter and orange juice and some items like that, lunch maybe.","Scott Mushkin-Wolfe Research","Alright, perfect guys. That does it for me. Thank you.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Binder-Jefferies","Hi, good morning. My question was around gross margin, you cited some promotional activity, I am just curious how much of the promotional activity is reactive versus more predatory from your perspective and if gross margin opportunities exist, do you think you can get more predatory in particular areas?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, I think I will answer that one. I would characterize it probably more reactionary than predatory. We are intently focused on everyday low price and \u2013 but part of that is you have to be careful that there are some items out there where the consumer might judge your everyday low price based on what they see in the end. So \u2013 and again, I will reiterate primarily the promotional activity that we had in the quarter was all on CFD. So, yes \u2013 and I would also say the more and more stable the promotional environment gets, it allows you to make investments in other areas of the business that you might want to like the non-consumable side.","Dan Binder-Jefferies","And my follow-up question was on home and apparel if I realize there has been a lot of mix change here and the price points you have talked about quite a bit, how much of the improvement in those businesses do you think is a function of the price points changing versus the quality of the product or the particular products that you are putting on the shelves?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, it\u2019s actually a combination of both. We are doing a much better job of color, a much better job of getting the product into the stores at the right time, a much better job of clearing out the old product prior to the new product getting in. And then I have to tell you, we are promoting the product very similar to how a department store would.","Dan Binder-Jefferies","Great, thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Dorothy, we probably have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. Your final question comes from the line of Mark Montagna with Avondale Partners.","Rick Dreiling","Hey, Mark.","Mark Montagna-Avondale Partners","Hey, good morning. A question about IMU, wondering how many quarters in a row has it been at the IMU has been noticeably higher? And then does that coincide with the rise of the dollar items or is there something else that\u2019s helping drive that?","Rick Dreiling","Off hand, I don\u2019t know how many quarters in a row it has been up, but I can tell you it\u2019s a combination of the dollar items and doing a better job of buying.","Mark Montagna-Avondale Partners","Okay. And then as a follow-up, David, on the guidance for the fiscal year, I think you said that it does not \u2013 it\u2019s not impacted by the cost of the potential that you are spending on the FDO pursuit, but in the third quarter, you included $8 million into SG&A. I just want to make sure I heard that right in understanding what you are saying on that?","David Tehle","So, in the third quarter, we excluded the $8 million we spelled it out and we excluded it. As a matter of fact, if you go to the press release, there is a chart at the back that will show you what\u2019s excluded from earnings per share and that is excluded. And again, any cost that we will have in the fourth quarter will be excluded also.","Mark Montagna-Avondale Partners","Okay, alright. Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Alright, operator, that concludes our call today. Emmett, Joe and I will be around if anybody has any questions. I know we lost a few people in the queue, but thank you very much for your time and attention and we look forward to speaking to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today.

Good morning, and thank you for participating in today's call, which is being recorded by Conference America. No other recordings or rebroadcast of this session are allowed without the company's permission. It is now my pleasure turn the conference call over to Ms. Mary Winn Gordon, Dollar General's Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations.","Mary Winn Gordon","Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO.","We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions.","Our earnings release can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases. Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, objectives, anticipated financial and operating results and other nonhistorical matters. Some examples of forward-looking statements discussed in this call include our 2013 forecasted financial results and anticipated capital expenditures, our planned operating and merchandising initiatives for fiscal 2013, comments regarding the expected refinancing of our credit facility, expected ongoing share repurchases and future consumer economic trends.","Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2012 10-K, which was filed this morning and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date.

Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release. This information is not a substitute for any GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.","Richard W. Dreiling","Thank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. 2012 was another great year for Dollar General. We're very pleased with the financial results for the fourth quarter and for the full year. The results indicate that we are continuing to increase our overall market share in consumables in both units and dollars even as our customers face a sustained difficult economic environment.","While there remain significant factors facing our core customers, I believe that Dollar General is more viable today than ever before. Our track record of improvements and gains over the last 5 years gives us the ability to capture the significant growth opportunities ahead of us. We remain committed to controlling what we can control.","Dave is going to talk about the details of the fourth quarter, but I'd like to quickly reflect on our financial accomplishments for the full year.","Full year sales increased 8.2% to a record $16 billion. Excluding the 53rd week in 2011, full year sales increased 10.4% and sales per square foot increased to $216 compared to $209 a year ago. Sales per average store reached a record $1.57 million.","2012 marked our 23rd consecutive year of same-store sales growth. Same-store sales were up 4.7% for the year. For the fourth quarter, same-store sales were up 3% against a very strong prior year performance of 6.5% comp growth.","Operating profit, excluding certain items, grew 9% over last year to a record $1.66 billion and an impressive 10.3% of sales. Gross margin rate was flat compared to 2011, and we had solid SG&A leverage.","For the fourth quarter, we had gross margin expansion of 34 basis points that was better than anticipated, primarily due to improved transportation efficiencies and higher incoming markups. Interest expense was down $77 million for the year, due to the combination of lower interest rates and lower debt levels. On the bottom line, our adjusted net income increased 19% over 2011.","In addition, we produced over $1 billion of cash flow from operations, an 8% increase over last year. And we deployed cash to repurchase 14.4 million shares of stock for $671 million.","We also announced today the expansion of our share repurchase authorization by $500 million as we plan to be consistent in our return of cash to shareholders through ongoing share repurchases.","We currently have a total repurchase authorization of $644 million remaining. Our track record of strong financial results continues to be a testament to the structural advantage of our business model. Our strategy of small box convenience, combined with great value, resonates with consumers. EDLP, the cornerstone of our relationship with our customers, is more relevant than ever as shoppers look to make the most of their household budgets.","In addition to our financial results, we accomplished a great deal in 2012 on the business side as well as laying the groundwork for 2013 and beyond. We hit our target of opening 625 new stores and exceeded our target with combined remodels and relocations of 592 stores in 2012, increasing our selling square footage by 7%. Most of this growth was in our existing 38 states with new store openings in 2 new states. A milestone for the company in 2012 was the expansion of our footprint into California, opening our 10,000th store in Merced back in March of 2012. We also opened our first 3 stores in Massachusetts.","We now have more than 100 stores in both the Dollar General Market and Dollar General Plus formats. We plan to spend time in 2013 analyzing trends and refining our approach to these formats as we better understand how to make them as profitable as possible. As part of this effort, we have also added resources to determine the right locations and right product offerings to drive sales and returns. We are already seeing steady progress in sales growth and our inability -- in our ability to manage costs in these formats.","To support expansion into new and existing markets, we also opened a new distribution center in Alabama and built out a lease facility in California. From the expansion of our distribution network to enhancing and upgrading our IT systems, we continue to elevate the processes and technology we use to operate the business.","On the merchandising front, we continue to innovate and maximize the sales productivity of our stores. We added additional coolers in approximately 1,400 stores, bringing our chain average to about 11 cooler doors per store. At the end of the year, more than 40% of the stores in the chain were licensed to sell beer or beer and wine.","According to syndicated data, we continue to grow our market share in consumables by high single digits in both units and dollar share over a 4-week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week basis.","As part of our ongoing efforts to increase our gross margin rate, we added more than 200 private brand items in 2012 and continue to expand other private and proprietary brands in consumables. We now carry nearly 2,100 private brand SKUs in consumables with strong sales growth in food, perishables, candy and snacks, home cleaning and health and beauty. We exited 2012 with a private brand penetration of 23.6%, and private brands grew faster than overall sales.","Across our non-consumable categories, our focus on improving product quality and better meeting our customers' needs has resulted in strong sales through the year. We believe that our improved quality, as well as our improved branding, packaging and presentation have contributed to our growth in both the seasonal and home categories.","In apparel, we are seeing progress with the merchandising and the in-season promotional strategy we implemented earlier in 2012. Through focused initiatives, we've improved our in-stock position throughout the chain, which is very important to our customers and our positioning of convenience. For the year, the number of items that our customers couldn't find on the store shelves improved by 25%.","In 2012, we saw the highest results ever in our customer service program, Customer Connect, which measures the overall shopping experience, including customers' perceptions of in-stock levels and store standards.","From an expense reduction standpoint, we continue to leverage our work force management system implemented throughout 2011. This system provides our store managers with an electronic tool that assists them as they prioritize and manage work, allowing them to be more effective in how they manage their staff and their stores.","We also made further inroads with regard to hiring and developing our employees. In 2012, about 62% of our management positions were filled from internal candidates. This represent continuous improvement over the last 3 years as we have made this a priority for our company. I am pleased to report that our store manager turnover is at its lowest level in 5 years and continues to trend in the right direction. As Dollar General grows, we want our employees to have the opportunity to build their careers and grow both personally and professionally with the company.","Our strong cash flow for the year allowed us to receive investment grade status with S&P, and most recently, a review for upgrade from Moody's on their current rating of BA1. And finally, we were added to the S&P 500 in November.","Before I turn the call over to David, I want to provide some color on our fourth quarter sales. We were very pleased with our performance throughout the quarter given the more difficult overlaps we had in January. Sales were fairly consistent throughout the quarter with the strongest growth in December.","Consistent with the rest of the year, fourth quarter sales were primarily driven by consumables, with perishables leading the way. Additional coolers contributed to the increase in perishables. Sales of convenience items, such as carbonated beverage, salty snacks and candy were strong in the quarter. Sales of health care products were up nicely, thanks in part to the cold and cough offerings, including our exclusive Rexall brand for the flu season and other product initiatives.","As you've heard across various retail channels, holiday seasonal sales were challenging as consumers remain cautious with their discretionary spending. Pricing and promotions were competitive, although not irrational, and consumers searched for value during the holiday season. We believe our customers were very careful with their holiday spending in the fourth quarter. For us, this impacted our seasonal and home categories.","Across the entire spectrum of non-consumables, we saw some bright spots. We had good performance across ladies clothing, sleepwear, shapewear, infants and toddlers, men's work wear and accessories. We are all -- we are making progress with the merchandising and markdown strategy we implemented earlier in 2012.","All in all, even when considering the impact of the payroll tax increases and delay of income tax refunds, we are pleased with our fourth quarter sales.","Now David will share a more detailed review of our overall fourth quarter financial performance and 2013 guidance.","David M. Tehle","Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick said, we had another great year and we had better-than-anticipated performance in the fourth quarter. These strong quarterly results were attributable to better-than-anticipated gross margin expansion.","Interest expense was $27.5 million for the quarter, a reduction of $12.6 million from last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to our debt refinancing. Please note that our fourth quarter 2012 earnings per share also includes a $0.02 benefit related to the retroactive reinstatement of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit from prior quarters. We provided the detail by quarter in our press release for modeling purposes.","Turning to our cash flow. We generated more than $1.1 billion of cash from operating activities for the year, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Total capital expenditures were $572 million, including $155 million for new leased stores; $132 million for stores purchased or built by us; $83 million for distribution centers; $80 million for remodels and relocations of existing stores; $71 million for improvements and upgrades to existing stores; $27 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects; and $17 million for transportation-related capital.","At the end of the year, total inventory at costs were $2.4 billion, up 12.8% on a per-store basis, above our same-store sales growth with inventory turns at 5.0x for the year. Inventory increased for the quarter, due primarily to new core items introduced in 2012, improved presentation levels of select categories and the receipt of 2013 items related to the Phase Five planogram resets. We are taking actions to ensure that the rate of growth will moderate throughout the course of 2013. The quality and aging of our inventory continues to be in good shape.","Total outstanding debt at the end of the year was $2.8 billion, an increase of $154 million from 2011. We exited the year with a ratio of adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR at 3.0x assuming rent capitalized at 8x.","We continue to be pleased with the efficiency of our capital spending with a top tier return on invested capital of 21.1% in 2012.","To summarize, we have continued to deliver strong financial performance in a volatile environment, including exceptional cash flow generation and return on capital.","Over the last several months, we have finalized our plans for 2013. We are anticipating another strong year and are excited about making investments to grow the business for the long term while still delivering excellent financial results. We expect top line sales for 2013 to increase 10% to 12%. Overall square footage is expected to grow approximately 7% in 2013. And same-store sales on a comparable 52-week basis are expected to grow 4% to 6%. Operating profit is forecasted to be in the range of $1.78 billion to $1.845 billion.","Given the rollout of tobacco, we expect contraction of our gross margin rate throughout the course of the year. Excluding the impact from tobacco, we would expect that our underlying gross margin rate would actually expand slightly in 2013. At the same time, we expect that our gross margin in the first quarter of 2013 will contact at a greater rate than the rest of the year. The expected first quarter contraction is attributable to anticipated higher inventory strength, higher markdowns and lower incoming markups, which are due mainly to the overall anticipated sales mix and the rollout of tobacco. The rate of gross margin contraction is expected to moderate as we move through the year.","For the second half of the year, we expect stronger sales and earnings performance than the first half as we gain traction from our merchandising initiatives such as the Phase Five planogram implementation, tobacco rollout and further cooler installations.","As you model the first quarter, also keep in mind that we will be lapping a strong 6.7% same-store sales growth in 2012 and that the major sales drivers should kick in as the year progresses.","We're forecasting net interest expense for the year to be in a range of $100 million to $110 million. We have commenced efforts to refinance our secured term loan and revolver with a new unsecured long-term debt that will consist of a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility, a senior unsecured term loan and additional senior unsecured notes.","We are committed to managing our leverage ratios to achieve and maintain investment grade ratings. We are continuing to target an adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR ratio of at -- excuse me, at or below 3.0x, which we believe will provide our most efficient capital structure. At the same time, if circumstances in the debt and equity markets are such that we deem it prudent to temporarily increase or decrease our debt levels, we may do so.","We expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 38%, although it will likely vary from quarter-to-quarter.","Finally, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.30, growth of 10% to 15% on an adjusted basis excluding the discrete tax item in the 2012 second quarter of $0.04 per share. We're assuming about 327 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year, which assumes the anticipated repurchase of more than $500 million of our common stock.","2013 capital expenditures are forecasted to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million. Approximately 50% will be for investments in store growth and development including new stores, remodels, relocations and purchases of existing store locations. Approximately 30% is for transportation, distribution and special projects, including the new distribution center in Pennsylvania. The remaining 20% is for maintenance capital. In 2013, our capital spending for store growth is lower than 2012, due to fewer DG Plus and DG Markets.","Our guidance for 2013 reflects our expectation of another strong year for Dollar General. As has been the trend for the last several years, we believe our customers' discretionary spending will continue to be constrained in 2013. As our track record demonstrates, Dollar General is well positioned to serve our customers regardless of our the economy plays out.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rick.","Richard W. Dreiling","Thanks, David. We outlined our 2013 key sales driving initiatives for you in our third quarter conference call, so I will not expand upon those today. Rather, I thought I would share with you what excites me and the rest of the management team about Dollar General's prospects.","Dollar General has a strong pipeline of growth available to us. We have a unique position across retail given our low cost to build and low cost operate. Our new traditional stores have a capital requirement of only $170,000. With a very fast sales ramp-up, our new stores are typically cash flow-positive in year 1 and have an average cash payback in under 2 years. This model provides us with continued great store economics. Despite our remarkable store growth over the past 4 years, we believe there still remains substantial opportunity for store growth in new and existing states.","Today, our 4 operating priorities are as relevant as ever. We're committed to driving productive sales growth, enhancing gross margin, leveraging process improvements and information technology to reduce costs and strengthening and expanding Dollar General's culture of serving others.","We believe that adherence to these priorities and our focus on multiple levers to drive sustainability of results will continue to separate Dollar General from the competition and allow us to provide our customers with a consistent low prices that they trust. The Dollar General management team has a proven track record with the organizational capability in place to enable future growth.","Dollar General has a robust financial outlook for 2013, and we are committed to returning cash to shareholders. We have an efficient capital structure, and we'll look to repurchase shares with our operating free cash flow.","Finally, my personal thanks to over 90,000 Dollar General employees who are committed to serving our customers every day. The tremendous results we have driven over the last 5 years could be attributed to the dedication and commitment of our employees. My sincere thanks goes out to the team for all that has been accomplished and the energy the team is applying to our 2013 goals.","Our strong track record over the last 5 years gives me great confidence that Dollar General team can successfully execute our 2013 goals. We've built a solid foundation for growth and we are continuing to capture multi-year opportunities on both the top line and bottom line with our focused strategies and the investments we are making.","With that, Mary Winn, I'd now like to open the line up for questions.","Mary Winn Gordon","Okay, Kate. We'll take the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So 2 broad questions, first on Dollar General Plus. What do you guys need to see to be comfortable -- more comfortable with the format to accelerate the growth? Could you get up to a couple hundred openings a year? And then as part of that, even if the ROI were lower than a Dollar General store, would it not make sense to accelerate the growth even if you took a little bit of a hit on percent ROI?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, to answer your question, the Dollar General Plus format, we are pleased with what we're seeing, very pleased with sales. And what we're working on is managing that costs that it takes to construct the facility, as well working on the margins. We think, as this continues to play out, they will never be as profitable as a DG -- just a DG traditional. But your theory is 100% right. They'll drive enough dollars that will make it up -- make up the shortfall in the percent.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I guess and then secondly, where are we on employee and manager turnover and shrink because I know there's a close correlation between the 2 and I think there's opportunity there. Where are you with both of those?","Richard W. Dreiling","Another great question. Our -- actually, our store manager turnover is the lowest it's been in the entire 5 years I've been here. Our shrink has started moving up slightly over the last couple of quarters. However, the number of units that are actually shrinking out of the store is down substantially. And what we're seeing is that we've introduced some higher-value SKUs. And while units are down, dollars are going up. We've spent the last 1.5 quarters rolling out some defensive fixtures, particularly in the health and beauty aid area, and we feel very confident as we get that installed and completed at retail as we move through the back half of next year we'll see shrink start to come back down.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So it's a big opportunity for '13 assuming you've built some improvement in, right?","Richard W. Dreiling","That's correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First, I'd like to see if you can comment at all about what you're seeing so far in the first quarter of '13.","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, right now, I would look at you and say, as David called out a couple of things: number one, there's no doubt that there's $18 billion worth of tax refunds that are still working their way into the system. There's, what is it, $180 billion in payroll tax adjustments that are out there. And Meredith, those don't just affect Dollar General or the dollar channel, that affects all of retailing in general. We're up against our stiffest quarter of the year last year in terms of sales comp. And my chief merchant was reminding me just this morning that last week the temperatures in United States were about 70 degrees, and this year (sic) [week] they're about 38. So you had that significant weather factor we're dealing with. We are incredibly confident that as we move through the year and our merchandising initiatives get put in place and we come up against softer comps, that we're going to see our results begin to accelerate as we move through the year.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then I have a question for David about how you account for the tobacco inventory as it comes in. I believe you guys use retail accounting. And is there a separate pool for tobacco? Or is it going to put in with other consumables? And I guess that would imply -- that's one of the reasons the gross margin would be down so much in the first quarter because you bring the inventory in even though you haven't sold any of it, is that right?","David M. Tehle","Yes, there is a separate pool that it goes into, Meredith, for accounting reasons. It's a different enough product that we felt like it deserved to have its own department. So we added another department for tobacco. And obviously, it's going to be a low-margin department because tobacco is a low margin and then that'll get into the consumable overall margin. So again, even though it isn't in -- put in a department -- an existing department, it still has that impact of lowering the overall consumable margin because it is a low-margin item.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Even before the product sells, you mean?","David M. Tehle","Well, it comes in and gets put into its own department. Yes, that's right. Overall, it averages down our margin percent.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then, I have a question back to you, sorry, Rick, about the competitive environment. I think you said in the third quarter that you saw it being a bit more competitive and you were going to make selective price investments. Can you talk about how the quarter actually played out and what you're seeing now?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, the quarter actually played out relatively consistent period-over-period. December was actually strong for us. I would call it the best of the 3 periods. The competitive environment, while I would say it was competitive, it was certainly not irrational. I think people were concerned about protecting margin as we move through the quarter.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And now?","Richard W. Dreiling","I think the competitive environment right now is reasonable. It's competitive, but it's not irrational.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deborah Weinswig with Citigroup.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So as we look at where you are with zone pricing, can you talk about kind of where we are right now and where we're going?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I -- we talked about zone pricing on the last call about 12 weeks ago, and we have begun the process of implementing a couple of price zones. To be quite frank with you, we're very pleased with what we're seeing.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then trends of the -- I thought it was an interesting call out in terms of the increased use of debit cards is one that pressured expenses. Would that tell you you're getting a different customer in your store? Or what does that tell you?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I think the increase in debit really more reflects just the change in society, I think, and how they deal with cash. I don't know necessarily if we're attracting a different customer or our customers moving up. I think it's just a social change that's taking place.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, with regards to global sourcing, how is that starting to change what you're seeing in your stores and also impact your margins?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I think, and I'll let David tag team on this, I look back on sourcing last year in 2012, we probably had one of our better years in terms of the amount of product we brought in. Obviously, that helps us with our margin. And we're starting to broad -- be more broad based in the countries we deal with and the categories we're dealing with. David, I...","David M. Tehle","Yes, we almost had $2 billion of receipts overall for the year. And again, we set up new satellite offices in Vietnam; Istanbul; Monterrey, Mexico; and then West Central China. So we're getting more specific on our overall sourcing and we're very","pleased with where it's going. The other thing that it does for us, obviously, is it helps us as we deal with domestic vendors because they know we have a very viable foreign sourcing program and make sure that they have to be very sharp on their pricing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So my first question is can you comment on comps in the seasonal, home and apparel categories relative to the total comp for the quarter?","Richard W. Dreiling","You're talking about in quarter 4?","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I mean, overall, we were pleased with what we had in apparel. We made traction in women's hanging apparel, shapewear, accessories. Men's work clothing was good, and infants and toddlers were good. We did, in the fourth quarter, feel a little bit of pressure on the seasonal and I believe it was home decor, both of which we think reflects the customer probably being just a little more cautious on what they were buying for the Christmas holiday.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then as we look at the early receipts of Phase Five items in the quarter, does that imply that Phase Five has more sort of non-consumables merchandising? Can you just talk about the mix of sales anticipated after you roll out Phase Five?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, great question. It's actually, it's more on the consumables side, particularly focused on HBA. We had several categories that we continue to be under-penetrated on the HBA, and we believe that's where we have the greatest opportunity for sales growth, and ultimately, margin enhancement down the road. We are actually, for the first time, Matt, working very hard to get a lot of this work done earlier than we have traditionally. We've tended to let our initiatives roll out through the year. We're working very hard to be complete by the middle of the second quarter. And I think you'll see the traction, as David called out, not only in sales, but in margin as we move towards the back half of the year.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just lastly, as we model in the impact of the new Pennsylvania distribution center, when should we anticipate that hitting the model and kind of where are the pressure points?","Richard W. Dreiling","I would say the late 2014, David? Or 2013, excuse me.","David M. Tehle","Yes, late '13, yes. Very late in the year is what we're looking at right now. Maybe early 2014, but very late. Very, very late, yes.","Operator","Our next question, comes from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First question, just on gross margin. In Q4, obviously, came in better-than-expected and it sounds like a couple of things were levers to the upside. I was hoping you can maybe give a little bit more color on where you exceeded your plan and a little bit more info on the transportation efficiency and the markup piece, especially?","Richard W. Dreiling","Sure, David?","David M. Tehle","Yes, on the transportation, clearly the 2 things that -- obviously, the LIFO we got a favorable from and we pretty much knew that was going to happen. I think the items where we got a little more help than we were anticipating would be transportation and then the incoming markups. On transportation, cartons per load, we did a little bit better on the cartons per load. We reduced our stem miles, again a little bit more than we even anticipated, which is great news because obviously that's why we're adding new distribution centers. And then the cost with the various carriers came down a little bit also in terms of just a little better work that we've done with the carriers to minimize the costs. So transportation, in general, managed very, very well, and we saw the results of that in the quarter. And then on the incoming markups, that's really just a mix of receipts. In terms of what was received in the quarter, a little bit richer on the receipts in terms of helping our margin on that.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Then thinking about the gross margin x tobacco into 2013, you implied it would be up. Is it more of the same? Are some of these transportation benefits kind of structural and sticky and that's what's driving it up?","David M. Tehle","Yes, I think as we look at -- forward next year, clearly, tobacco is the #1 reason that we see the margin not leveraging. We're pretty clear saying that without tobacco, we would see a little bit of leverage in our margins. So really, it's just the impact of tobacco that's the reason that the margin doesn't leverage next year.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","No, no, help me understand that. I was asking, excluding tobacco, an up margin is a pretty good result given what I would assume is still going to be negative mix. In the current environment, I was just trying to understand what that was the upward benefit.","Richard W. Dreiling","It could be private -- go ahead, David, private brands, transportation.","David M. Tehle","Private brand, transportation, foreign sourcing and then the back half of the year shrink where we're modeling shrink to do better. So for the full year, we'll get a little bit of a positive impact out of shrink.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. And then final question. Just the pace of tobacco, any changes to that being completed by mid-year, and any further insights as to how that category you think will perform?","Richard W. Dreiling","We anticipate having the rollout sometime between the very end of April and first part of June. So yes, the first part of the year. Of the stores that we've had up and running now in Florida for a while, we continue to be excited about what we see in terms of traffic and what it's doing.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Mann with Johnson and Rice (sic) [Johnson Rice].","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Just following up on that last question on gross margin. You've laid that out as one of your objectives, to grow margin over the longer term. Margin's kind of been, I guess, flattish for the last several years. Can you just talk about that longer-term opportunity, x tobacco? Do you expect it to continue to grow next several years?","David M. Tehle","Yes, we still believe, as we've mentioned, that we have opportunity, David, in the -- probably in order of importance, the private brand, #1; foreign sourcing, a very close #2; shrink; and then transportation. So as we look at it, those are all multiyear initiatives that we have. And again, there's still plenty of room in all of those in terms of adding to our long-term growth in our margin.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Great. In terms of remodels that you've done, can you just update us on how they've been performing and what you would expect from the remodel activity in '13?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, our remodels continue to be on pace to what we've demonstrated over the last 5 years. David?","David M. Tehle","Yes, we continue to see a nice sales lift, a 4% to 5% sales lift, nice payback. Again, payback less than 3 years and about $80,000 of capital expenditures that are put into it, and again a nice IRR that we experienced out of that. So still very bullish on what we're doing there.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Then, last question. With California stores now under the belt for a year or so, can you just compare the performance there versus other new store openings?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I mean, we have 50 stores operating in California right now. We'll add at least another 50 over the course of 2013 and we are pleased with what we're seeing. Certainly, a higher-cost operating market, but we're seeing a higher sales volumes there also.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Montagna with Avondale Partners.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Just a question with the Social Security taxes. Are you seeing -- we've seen a lot of restaurants posting bad results. Are you seeing evidence of that -- those customers shifting purchases to buy at-home meals like pizzas and other items that could be a substitute?","Richard W. Dreiling","Our perishable business continues to be on fire. So I think you could make a logical leap there. I would say this, Mark, that when times get tough is when our customer needs us even more. I think part of the reason that I was so bullish on '13, it's very probable things are going to be a little harder out there. You take that, the convenience, the EDLP pricing, the consistency, when our customers -- when they need us, we're there. And when they have a little more money, they have little more money to spend.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","So if you're saying it's on fire, is it fair to assume that you're seeing a spike in that type of purchase?","Richard W. Dreiling","With the amount of coolers we've added over the years, it's very, very consistent.  It's doing really well.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, just with the interest expense. You've got the new credit agreement that it sounds like you're close to closing on. Do you expect that to reduce interest rate and the -- if so, is that factored into the guidance?","David M. Tehle","The new deal is factored into our guidance. We gave an interest expense, I think, of $100 million to $110 million. Right now, look at -- we're trying to figure out as we close the deal out what the best place is to put our money. We're definitely -- we're refinancing the existing senior term loan and the existing $1.2 billion secured asset base revolving credit facility. And we see ourselves coming out with a new unsecured bank facility as well as some new senior unsecured notes. So we're trying to decide particularly -- we'll definitely have a term loan A out there and the new cash flow revolver. And then we're trying to decide on the senior unsecured notes, particularly between 5-year and 10-year notes where the best place is to put our money. And quite frankly, the interest rates are so low. Right now, on the 10-year notes, we may get a little heavier on that, which may actually be a little bit higher than the interest rate on the 5-year notes. But long term, it's the right decision for the company to lock in those historically very, very low debt rates.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I was wondering if you could talk about what is giving you such confidence that you can drive sales later in the year given the tax refund impact and the payroll tax that you're seeing now? And then, as part of that, could you talk about the trade-down customer versus the core customer? Is there anything to report there in terms of difference in trends or something that you've seen anecdotally or you have any data behind that can help you understand the dynamic of the business?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, John, when I think about sales as we move through the year, I want to start off with the initiatives we have in place and the fact that we're trying to get them done earlier than we have historically. So you're rolling out cigarettes, which we know drives transactions. We have Phase Five, which we are very excited about, which is the idea of going into our legacy stores and getting our best planograms put in place in there entirely. We're going to continue to add coolers. We'll finish and continue to work on, probably get close to finish our beer and wine initiative in 2013. The preliminary indications on zone pricing where we have gone in and have been able to adjust some retail to drive sales have been very, very exciting, to be honest about it. And our in-stock initiative, I don't want to sell short the fact of how hard the retail team is working on getting all of those things in place. I think that as I think about the shortfall and the income tax refund, that's sooner or later going to make its way back into the system as we move through the year. And I want to come back to this, the shortfall on the payroll tax. This is yet another perfect example of when times get tough, our customer needs us even more. And the fact that the box is getting so much more viable, the trade-down opportunity continues. We've seen no erosion in what's happening with the trade-down customer. That continues to be one of the higher-income segments or one of those that we continue to grow. So very, very, very bullish. And I'll leave you with this thought. I don't want to get round -- long-winded on this. But when you're in retailing, there's nothing more than unit share growth. That is the most important thing. And our unit share growth continues to be in the high single digits.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up on John's question with the top line expectations for 4% to 6%. Could you just give us some color on how we should think about first half versus second half and how significant the benefits are from the initiatives later in the year?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I think, as David called out, what we're seeing is you've got the weather change, you have all these initiatives rolling out that our margin and our same-store sales will gain traction as we move through the year. And this -- I was actually thinking about this the other night. This is very similar to 2008. And I actually believe 2010 or '11, when we gained speed as we moved through the year because we were able to get these things done. So we plan on some pretty great performance towards the back half of the year.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And so does that suggest that first half should be a little bit below the top line guidance or maybe at the low end?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, we only give year-to-date guidance. I'm sorry on that, Paul. We just kind of stay focused on the entire year.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Understood. And then from an inventory standpoint, you gave us some color in the 10-K released this morning. Seems like consumables and apparel inventories are in pretty good shape. If you can just speak a little bit more to home and what you're doing there from a presentation standpoint and then how we should think about seasonal inventory need for markdowns and how that will carry out over the balance of the year?","David M. Tehle","Yes, yes. If we look at the increased inventory that we saw in the fourth quarter, the 3 biggest reasons for that increase: first of all, the new items that were introduced; early receipt of the Phase Five because we really want to get that set up in 2013 and get that in place; and then department initiatives that we talked about in terms of presentation levels. If you look specifically at home, we definitely increased the presentation levels particularly for bath, for bed and for window treatment because we think there's a lot of sales growth that we can drive there overall. And I'm sorry, your question on seasonal?","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just is the seasonal -- do you feel good about the content of the seasonal inventories?","David M. Tehle","Yes, we do, we do. I mean, most of it is core. Again, one of the key points, the inventory that was brought in, in the fourth quarter was core inventory, which means it's everyday inventory that should sell along with everything else that we sell. So yes -- no, we feel good about our seasonal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Austin Pauls with RBC Capital Markets.","Austin Pauls - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","My question is on shrink. I understand that you would expect to see some increased strength as you roll out cigarettes to the chain. But I think you said earlier that you've also seen some increased shrink on higher-dollar SKUs. And I'm curious what product categories that is and if that's something you've started to see recently?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, Austin, what has happened is over the course of the year is we began to broaden the mix of items in categories to increase the level of penetration that we have in those categories. And primarily, what you would see as you look at our shrink numbers, those higher-value items are in clothing and particularly HBA. And the good thing, particularly about HBA is there's defensive merchandising structures that you can put in place, and we began the roll-out of those fixtures. And that's why we're so confident we're going to get back ahead of this as we move towards the back half of the year. And I would also, Austin, like to reiterate our actual units that we're shrinking are down. And we've seen this probably over the last 2 or 3 quarters. We've seen this a little bit of a trend.","Austin Pauls - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. And so do these increased shrink numbers, does that give you any hesitation against adding more higher-dollar SKUs to your assortment? Or is that something you think you can offset?","Richard W. Dreiling","No, I think it boils down to we're adding the right SKUs. We didn't -- we weren't quite smart enough that we had to do a little bit better job protecting them, and I think we've figured that out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Question on tobacco. The last -- during the last call, you talked a little bit about the distribution agreement with Nash Finch and you mentioned that it didn't require you to sacrifice margin from other categories, candy and health and beauty aids, I guess, to subsidize the distribution of tobacco and cigarettes. So I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that particular dynamic and just talk about the distribution agreement that is in place for tobacco?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I would rather not give you the specifics of the agreement. But I think what we've been able to do, Patrick, is negotiate a deal with Nash Finch that's focused solely on the movement of cigarettes. And most of the time, when you enter into a third-party agreement with that kind of an item, the fact that it's low growth [ph] for you, it's also low growth [ph] for the provider. And they want candy or HBA items to go with it to make it more valuable to them to do business with you. The exciting thing about it is the merchants here not only negotiated that deal, they negotiated a deal with FedEx to move the products through the system. And the combination of those 2 items has made it very beneficial for us to be in the cigarette business or more beneficial than, I guess, you would historically fall into.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just your California stores, maybe. I'm just wondering if you could give us -- it's been -- you've had them in place for a little bit longer and I'm wondering if you could give us some more color either on sales and\/or mix or profits, whatever it might be.","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, we got 50 stores open there now. We'll get another 50 stores open in 2013. I would say the fact that we've entered a new market, we entered it at clustering stores. Rather than having one in Northern, one in Southern, one in Eastern and Western California, we came in and clustered them, started off with, I think, is an incredibly solid marketing program in terms of positioning the stores in the eyes of the consumer. We're happy with sales, and we believe that we have a lot of opportunity there. And we're working on the portfolio there in order to, like I said, you go into a new market, you always try to -- you don't want to get in there too fast. You want to make sure you've got everything moving in the right direction. And we're very pleased with where we're going.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","And I think you -- you had said that the mix of stores in California would be more -- a little bit more skewed toward the Dollar General Market stores -- store counts. Is that still the case with this lower kind of growth expectation for that concept overall?","Richard W. Dreiling","Patrick, we went in there and we took the opportunity to plant all 3 concepts there. I would look at you and say, as I look out into the future, the Dollar General Market will have virtually the same role there as it does across the chain. We're going in there very balanced. And always remember, our Dollar General traditional is the bread-and-butter of this chain, and those 2 other concepts are designed to enhance certain opportunities in certain markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aram Rubinson with Nomura Securities.","Edgar Roesch - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","This is Ed actually. And I want to ask you, Rick, as the perishables have accelerated, are you feeling good about your supply chain for those items from the perspective of the service levels you're getting from your providers and also the in-stock levels that you can keep in those 11 coolers?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, what has happened as that business has matured, we started to actually installing in our higher-volume stores reserved stock refrigerated and frozen coolers in the backroom to keep us in stock. Part of the reason we've expanded the number of coolers is to give us an incremental shelf-holding power also. When I got here 5 years ago, you'd have 3 coolers in the store and 2 of them would be milk and it still wouldn't satisfy the needs of the store. So in terms of the set, what we're putting the -- in the backroom, we think that's keeping us in stock. And right now, we're very pleased with the supply agreement that we have with the providers that are taking care of it. I think over the last 5 years, they have really stepped to the plate in terms of service and in terms of getting the items we want to be serviced with in place for us.","Edgar Roesch - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","It sounds great. And then maybe this is a question for David. You spent $130 million on purchasing or building stores last year. It's not a huge amount, but there's more budgeted in 2013. So just wondering, 2 questions. Is this more often employed when you're building a DG Market or a Plus store? Is that relevant? And then also, what's kind of the future for this program?","David M. Tehle","Yes, we continue to experiment with both fee development, as well as store purchases and that number includes both of those categories as we move forward. And I think we'll continue to do some of both, probably a little heavier on the fee development as we look into 2013. It really helps us learn the cost structure and obviously helps us deal with our developers when we're doing it ourselves and checking out different -- we try to check this out in different markets because again, it gives us a good look at what the true costs are in various markets.","Edgar Roesch - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Are you happy just kind of owning those stores? Or do you expect maybe a sale-leaseback to free up some cash?","David M. Tehle","Yes, we'll continue to look at that. Certainly, at some point in the future, there might be a sale-leaseback done. We don't have any plans for that right now. Most -- we're very careful when we buy stores to make sure that they're stores that we're willing to keep for a long period of time, that they're high-performing stores and that everything we see in them makes it an asset that we'd want to own and get -- ultimately get a good return off of.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with BB&T Capital Markets.","Anthony C. Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I had a question related to tobacco. Now that you've been selling for a few months, was just wondering, first off, is that in any way, shape or form contributing to the uptick in the shrink? And then second off, if you can just tell us anything just in terms of the tobacco basket, in other words is that accretive to the total basket size? Are people substituting from that basket? Are people just coming in and just picking up tobacco and walking out the store? Any color would be appreciated.","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I'll give you a couple of things. First off, the incremental shrink that we're experiencing has nothing to do with tobacco at this stage of the game. We're just now starting to roll it out. And it really and truly falls back to the higher retail-priced HBA items and some clothing items. In regards to tobacco, I'll give you a couple. It's a little early in the game, but I'll give you a couple high-level thoughts or takeaways here. In our test stores, we're selling 33% more tobacco than we thought we would sell. That's point #1. Point #2, 1\/3 of the cigarette transactions we have are cigarettes only, which we look at as that person coming in and exploring us for the first time and seeing the store. Other than that, the basket is definitely higher. There's no doubt about that. It's not as high as the basket plus the cigarettes, and we're still working on that. But what we are seeing is a nice comp increase and more importantly, a nice increase in traffic. And once we get 1,500 or a couple of thousand stores on the deck, Anthony, I think I can give you a little more information. But we are excited with what we're seeing in regards to traffic.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan and Stanley (sic) [Morgan Stanley].","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On your guidance here for the gross margins x tobacco to be up, what are you assuming there on your discretionary sales? Are you expecting them to remain in line with recent trends? Or does that assume some improvement as the year progresses?","David M. Tehle","It's pretty much in line with what we've been seeing. I don't think we'd see a big change one way or another...","Richard W. Dreiling","No, yes.","David M. Tehle","In that, yes.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Are you contemplating breaking out the gross margin with and without tobacco throughout the year so we can see how the core is doing?","Richard W. Dreiling","No, we really wanted to do that for you all to give you a flavor of how we're seeing the year. So we we'll leave it -- we're not going to break it out going forward.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just as the year -- as you look at the whole year here, which is more impactful on sales and margin, the tobacco or the Phase Five project?","Richard W. Dreiling","I think, if I was going to call it right now, I'd say in terms of sales, tobacco; in terms of margin, though, it will be Phase Five.","Operator","Our last question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.","Joseph I. Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Most of ours were asked already, but the one other thing I did want to get on and ask was on the cigarette and tobacco rollout, I know it's supposed to be in all stores by mid-summer, so where are you today in terms of the number of stores, I guess, versus that goal? And how will it be rolled? Is it just kind of like each week a bunch more stores? Or is it -- what are the waves like?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, good question. We anticipate we'll be done by June 1, if not a little bit before. And right now, we are on track. Obviously, there's licensing requirements and all that's being taking care of. The purchasing agreement, all of that has been taking care of. And what we'll see is -- the fixtures have actually been built and shipped to the stores. And over the course of the next couple of months, we'll see a gradual wave-out. I don't really want to commit to x number of stores per week yet. We'll kind of -- these things kind of start off slow and gain a lot of traction as you get to the end of the roll-out.","Joseph I. Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Got it. And then also just a similar kind of question on the alcohol. Because I know you're in around 40% of the stores where you actually have licenses. And I know, if I recall correctly, 60% is sort of the max potential just based on licenses and things. How does that roll out? And how should we think about the phasing of that?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, it'd probably be in the area of 50% to 60% probably where we'll actually go. We are staying away from any community that has any kind of problem with anything. And of course, we have dry counties we're dealing with. But we do anticipate that we'll get the final tranche done toward the end of 2013.","Mary Winn Gordon","Thank you very much.

Today is Thursday, March 16, 2017. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the Company's earnings press release issued this morning.","Now I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Thank you, Kayla and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Todd Vasos, our CEO and John Garratt, our CFO. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under investor information, news and events.","Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, future estimates and other non-historical matters including, but not limited to, our fiscal 2017 financial guidance and store growth plan; investments and initiatives; capital allocation strategy and related expectations and future economic trends or conditions.

We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call, except as may be otherwise required by law.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, Mary Winn and thanks to everyone for joining our call. I will start today's call by providing a review of the financial highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 and our planned strategic investments for 2017. Then John will provide additional detail regarding our financial results and review our guidance for fiscal 2017. I will then come back and discuss our operating priorities for the coming year before opening the call up to questions.","While our overall fiscal 2016 sales performance was softer than we anticipated when we entered the year, I am very pleased with the way the team managed through what proved to be a challenging retail macroeconomic environment to deliver same-store sales growth of 0.9% and diluted earnings per share growth of 12% for the year.","We're continuing to strategically invest in our business for the long term. In fiscal 2017, these investments will be focused on an increased compensation structure and additional training for our store managers, as they play a critical role in our customers' experience and the profitability of each store. Also, as I will discuss a bit later in the call, we're investing in strategic initiatives that we believe will help to differentiate us from the competition over time.","Now let's recap some of the financial results for fiscal 2016. Full-year sales increased 7.9% over the prior year to $22 billion. Same-store sales for the year increased 0.9% over the prior year, marking our 27th consecutive year of same-store sales growth. Our same-store sales for the fourth quarter increased 1% over the prior year fourth quarter, driven by strength in consumables and home, partially offset by negative performance in the seasonal and apparel categories.","For the full year, operating profit increased approximately 6% with diluted earnings per share of $4.43. As compared to the prior-year fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share improved 15% to $1.49 per share. For the year, we returned nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders.","We continue to believe many of the headwinds we faced in 2016 are transitory in nature, such as the impact of average unit retail deflation, due in part to commodity cost declines as well as customer behavior, due to changes to the federal SNAP benefits program. We estimate that overall average unit retail deflation and changes to SNAP benefits negatively impacted our same-store sales for 2016 by approximately 115 to 125 basis points, with overall average unit deflation being the largest factor.","In 2016, we continued to deploy our capital to invest in new stores, relocations and remodels which continue to provide compelling returns. We invested in our infrastructure such as new distribution centers to support continued growth. During the year, we celebrated the grand opening of our 13,000th store, opening 900 new stores and bringing our total store count to 13,320 stores at the end of our fiscal year.","We increased our selling square footage by approximately 7% and remodeled or relocated a combined 906 stores, exceeding our initial target of 875 locations. We continue to be pleased with the return on investment and performance of our real estate program, as our new stores overall are yielding returns of approximately 20%.","We also continue to be very pleased with the performance of the 42 former Walmart Express locations that we purchased and rapidly converted to the Dollar General banner.","Within our distribution network, we completed our 14th distribution center in Janesville, Wisconsin. We began receiving inventory at this location in December of 2016 and shipping in January 2017. During the third quarter, we started construction of our 15th distribution center in Jackson, Georgia and expect to begin shipping from this location in the fall of 2017. These investments are key to driving the efficiency and speed of our network and to support our growing store base, while reducing our stem miles.","As for the fourth quarter sales cadence, all periods had positive comps, with November and January exhibiting the best performance. In December we, like many retailers, experienced a slowdown in traffic that impacted our same-store sales performance. Overall, the team did a great job during the fourth quarter to drive the top line with tight controls on gross margin and SG&A expense to allow us to deliver fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share growth of 12%.","We estimate that the 53rd week of 2016 added approximately 2 percentage points to our EPS growth rate as compared to 2015.","We're constantly striving to meet the changing needs and demands of our customers. In the second half of the year, we made pricing and marketing investments in designated market areas where we saw opportunities to be proactive, as we looked to help drive consumer traffic and improve same-store sales and market share. Our objective was and is to provide our customers with affordability, value and convenience at a time when they need us the most.","These proactive pricing actions were implemented selectively across about 17% of our store base and on about 450 targeted, high household penetration, fast-turning categories. We're seeing anticipated improvements in transactions, units and weekly same-store sales across the majority of these participating stores. We believe we're on the right track as these investments are positively impacting sales and gross profit dollars.","In 2016, our digital coupon enrollment increased over 200% as we continued to expand our customer engagement through this innovative program that we brought to the channel. Importantly, the average basket for our digital coupon transactions continues to run more than 2 times higher than our average basket, indicating that our customers appreciate the value being offered.","We continue to increase our overall market share in highly consumables, growing mid-single digits based on the most recent syndicated data over the 4, 12, 24 and 52-week periods ending January 28, 2017. With 2016 in the books, the team is focused on moving the business forward. Our recent strategic review is a very exciting part of advancing our business.","With the full support and engagement of our Board of Directors, we undertook a comprehensive, strategic review of our business focusing on the actions that had the greatest potential to drive shareholder value over the longer term. We undertook this review and analysis from a position of strength, as we believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail.","Over the last eight months, the leadership team has conducted robust scenario analysis to envision the future of Dollar General through 2025. The goal of this review has been to assess our current performance, key trends and the evolving competitive landscape to align on the prioritized opportunities we should pursue for additional growth.","We recognize customer preferences are changing more rapidly today than perhaps at any time in the retail history and the current pace of change does not appear likely to slow. Our review analyzed those trends that are changing and that are likely to change and how successful retailers are expected to do business over the next 10 years. While focusing on our customer base, we assessed the size of the opportunities presented by these trends and how we can leverage our strengths to capitalize on them.","The strategic initiatives determined as the best fit to be big ideas for Dollar General are more evolutionary in nature and are in keeping with our brand heritage and organizational capacities. They were also filtered through the lenses of, one, growing the core and second, extending into adjacent opportunities. These initiatives are in varying degrees of development with staggered implementation time horizons.","One area that we identified as a near term strategic opportunity is leveraging digital to influence our customer shopping behavior over time. Digitally- influenced sales are becoming more and more prevalent across retail, as customers are increasingly utilizing and being targeted through digital channels and tools to shop smarter and faster. Lower income shoppers are also following these general trends as smartphone penetration continues to grow with this population.","Digital engagement is expected to increase and influence retail sales and our mission is to develop capabilities that highlight and improve our historical value proposition to our customers, namely the intersection of value and convenience.","To do this, we're focused on building capabilities centered on our core customers' needs, leveraging our unique assets. Capabilities to support this goal will be phased in over time. We're uniquely positioned to capitalize on our 13,000 plus and growing store base to be highly responsive to our customers in an evolving digital environment.","We're establishing a dedicated strategy department to work with the business owners to build out and coordinate the implementation of our initiatives. Over time, I look forward to sharing more with you on our strategic initiatives and how they support our four ongoing operating priorities.","Now let me turn the call over to John.","John Garratt","Thank you, Todd and good morning everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through the highlights of 2016 and our strategic review, let me take you through some of the important financial details of the fiscal quarter and year. I will also spend some time discussing our 2017 guidance.","Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.6% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 19 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. The gross profit rate decrease was primarily attributable to higher markdowns, driven mainly by promotional activities and inventory clearance and a greater proportion of sales of consumables. Partially offsetting these items were higher initial inventory markups.","For the quarter, SG&A as a percentage of sales increased 6 basis points to 20.3%. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to retail labor costs which increased at a rate greater than the growth in net sales. Partially offsetting these costs were reductions in incentive compensation expenses and administrative payroll costs which were essentially unchanged.","In addition, we had an SG&A reduction totaling $4.5 million in the quarter associated with the sale or assignment of leases for a total of 12 store locations which had been previously closed due to the acquisition of locations from another retailer. You may recall that we took a charge of $11 million in the third quarter of 2016, primarily for the lease terminations with the relocation of Dollar General stores into these purchased locations.","This quarter's reduction in SG&A dollars is a partial offset of the previously recognized expenses.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 36.8% compared to 36.1% in the 2015 quarter, due to the one-time benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of last year for retroactive tax benefits, primarily for the work opportunity tax credit.","Our balance sheet is strong and our working capital is in good shape. Cash and cash equivalents at year-end were $188 million. Merchandise inventories were $3.26 billion at fiscal 2016 year-end, down about 70 basis points on a per-store basis year-over-year. For the year, growth in our inventory and net sales were very much in line.","Exiting the year, we believe our inventory is in excellent condition as the team has been focused on better aligning our inventory growth with our sales growth, while also improving our in-stock position. In 2016, we generated cash from operations of $1.6 billion, an increase of 15% from the prior fiscal year. Total capital expenditures were $560 million in 2016 and included the majority of the cost of our new Janesville distribution center.","For the quarter, we repurchased 4.2 million shares of our common stock for $311 million. Since late 2011 through the end of the 2016 fiscal year, we have repurchased $4.6 billion or 74.4 million shares of our common stock. As of year-end, we had a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $930 million under our repurchase program.","We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in new and existing stores and the infrastructure to support our growth. Our goal is to create lasting value for our shareholders through our share repurchase program and anticipated quarterly dividends, while maintaining our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3 times adjusted debt to EBITDA.","Turning now to guidance. For fiscal 2017, we anticipate net sales growth of 4% to 6%, with the lapping up the 53rd week in 2016 expected to negatively impact net sales growth by about 200 basis points. Growth in same-store sales is expected to be in the range of slightly positive to up 2%. With the investments in the business for store manager compensation, training and strategic investments, we anticipate deleveraging SG&A in 2017.","Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 is forecasted to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.50. Our fiscal 2017 diluted EPS guidance includes an anticipated negative impact totaling approximately $0.34 per share, lowering the fiscal 2017 EPS growth rate by approximately 8 percentage points as follows, approximately $0.16 per share relating to anticipated store manager compensation and training, along with other strategic investments; approximately $0.09 per share due to lapping of the 53rd week in 2016; and approximately $0.09 per share for the combined impact for early adoption of income tax changes for stock-based compensation in 2016; lower estimated share repurchases in 2017 that will be weighted towards the second half of the year; and an anticipated charge related to the retirement of debt.","Capital spending is forecast to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million, with about 45% for new store growth, relocations and remodels, 35% to 40% for special projects including our distribution center infrastructure to support our store growth and the remaining 15% to 20% for maintenance.","As you model 2017, please keep in mind the following, we anticipate that in the second half of 2017 same-store sales and financial performance will be stronger than the first half, given the lapse from 2016. The 2016 53rd week also shifts the timing of markdown clearance from the third quarter of 2016 to the second quarter 2017 which we anticipate will negatively impact gross margin in the second quarter and have a corresponding benefit in the third quarter.","As you look at the quarterly cadence, our EPS comparisons begin to ease in the 2017 third quarter. We anticipate that the third quarter will have the strongest EPS growth of any quarter in 2017. We will be lapping a $0.03 per share benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2016 for the Company's early adoption of the income tax changes for stock-based compensation that we do not expect to reoccur to the same extent in 2017.","Our early Q1 same-store sales, particularly in February, started out slowly. However, as customers have received federal tax income tax refunds, we have noticed some improvement in overall comp sales trends. Additionally, to date during the first quarter, we have experienced a more pronounced mix shift to the consumables category which has a lower gross margin.","We continue to believe that we have compelling new store economics with significant runway for growth across channels, customer and product segments that we intend to capture over time.","Looking beyond 2017, we remain focused on the long term opportunity ahead of us, with the goal of delivering 10% or higher earnings-per-share growth over the long term on an adjusted basis. We will continue to focus on the things that are within our control, including managing our working capital and always being a low-cost operator. We will also be financially disciplined in our capital allocation.","Now I would like to turn the call back to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you. As John mentioned, we remain focused on capturing the long term opportunities ahead. Our ongoing operating priorities remain. First, driving profitable sales growth. Second, capturing growth opportunities. Third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as our competitive advantage. Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth. As we look to attract and grow new customers and trips and capture share with existing customers, a key area of focus for 2017 is to build on our 2016 progress. This includes expanding the merchandising initiatives in our existing store base to drive traffic into those stores and improve same-store sales.","Based on the lessons learned from the conversions of our recently-acquired Walmart Express locations to our Dollar General Plus format that include fresh meat and produce, we're remodeling about 300 traditional stores to include 34 cooler doors, an increase of about 160% from the existing cooler footprint in these locations. This allows for a much greater perishable assortment which helps drive trips and basket size.","Additionally, across about one-third of these locations, we're testing an assortment of fresh produce. We will also be strategically investing in the portion of our existing store base that has been open for five years or more or what we define as our mature store base. We have a focus on stores that have fewer than 10 cooler doors which in relative terms are expected to drive the highest returns. By the end of 2017, we anticipate that across our store base we will have an average of 17 cooler doors, up from 10 in 2012.","Merchandising initiatives across all departments have been deployed to provide consumers with more of the products and brands they want and need to save time and money every day across this select group of stores. For example, health and beauty represents large and growing department at Dollar General. These products remain a significant opportunity for us to increase our share of wallet with our customers, as well as have only -- we only have about half of the share with our customers in these areas as compared to other consumables like paper and cleaning.","We're also redesigning the health and beauty area of a select group of stores to drive awareness and conversion. For 2017, we plan to further integrate our traditional and digital media mix to ensure we're reaching our targeted customers where, when and how they decide to engage with us. Through applied predictive technology, we believe we can drive greater productivity of our advertising media mix through optimization and modification of our spending, including reallocating funds previously used for our NASCAR sponsorship.","We will also leverage in-store operational initiatives such as improving our on-shelf availability and our customer experience. We have ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion through improvements in shrink, global sourcing, private brands, distribution and transportation efficiencies and non-consumables sales. As always, we will continue to ensure that our value proposition resonates with our customers. We're committed to providing them with everyday low prices that they know and trust from us.","Second, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth, with a proven high-return, low-risk model. 1,000 new stores are in the pipeline for fiscal 2017, along with the combined 900 remodels or relocations, bringing our expected square footage growth in 2017 to about 7%, modestly below our previous forecast due to a greater mix of smaller stores.","I believe we continue to have a first-mover advantage to secure the best sites, while driving compelling new store average returns of approximately 20%.","The range of different DG formats is a strength that we can leverage based on the marketplace. We're able to flex our square footage to match the market opportunity, ultimately allowing us to have a higher capture rate for sites. The primary format will continue to be our traditional Dollar General box which is about 7,300 square feet of selling space and provides us with strong new store economics and returns. This format consistently proves to be our highest return format against which we benchmark the performance of all others.","We're planning for the future as we segment our store opportunities that we believe can have a greater impact on sales and productivity, while continuing to drive strong returns. We view this as more of an evolution of our existing highly-productive traditional store format rather than a wholesale change. As a leader in store format innovation, we're in the unique position to benefit from our knowledge across our multiple formats.","Given our success over the last two years with the results of our smaller box that is less than 6,000 square feet used in certain metro and rural locations, we anticipate opening an additional 160 locations this year, bringing the total smaller box store count to about 250 by the end of 2017.","Finally, we're testing an even smaller box under the DGX banner, with about 3,600 square feet to target metropolitan shoppers with our everyday low prices on essential items in a convenient, easy-to-shop format. The DGX format is geared to meet the needs of our millennial shoppers which are an emerging and important part of our customer base and well help us broaden our appeal to attract a new segment of urban customers who put a high premium on value and convenience.","We expect to learn valuable lessons about our metropolitan shoppers from this format which we can then apply to our other formats in urban locations. This test is in the very early stages, with two existing locations and two additional sites identified for 2017 store openings.","Across the format, we constantly are editing the assortments and taking our best-selling items from one format to the next to satisfy our customers' changing needs, while continuing to drive productivity. For example, in addition to digital, our core customers are becoming more interested in healthier, better for you options and a greater fresh assortment.","Our range of formats positions us well to seek opportunities to capture this growing customer sentiment, as we continue to our cooler expansion that allows for a greater offering of perishable items. We're disciplined and focused on financial returns. We're very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2017, as our pipeline is full.","Third, we will leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. As evidenced by this year's results, we have a clear and defined process to control spending. All of our spending is filtered through three criteria. First, is it customer facing? Second, does it align with our strategic priorities? Finally, third, how does it impact our risk profile? In our stores we're focused on simplifying our operations by reducing inventory, product movement within the stores and operating complexity so that our store managers and their teams can reinvest time savings to provide better customer service and a clean in-stock shopping experience for our customers.","At the store support center, work elimination and process improvement are ongoing efforts to take cost out of the business. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.","Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are a competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great on-boarding and training and open communication. In 2016, we had our lowest level of store manager turnover in four years.","To build on these improvements, we're making strategic investment in compensation and training for our store managers. Our data-driven approach to store manager compensation segments our stores based on labor market data and stored level complexity. We're making this investment in our store managers, as we know what a key role they play in our customer experience and the profitability of our stores.","In 2017 and beyond, we expect that this investment will help to further reduce our turnover and an improved customer experience. Additional returns on this investment are anticipated through higher sales and lower shrink. In 2017, we plan to create approximately 10,000 new jobs as a result of our 1,000 planned new store openings and two new state-of-the-art distribution centers. The creation of new jobs will be roughly 9% overall increase to our workforce and marks the largest one-year employee increase in our 78-year history.","As for our customer we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions, but acknowledge that for our core customer it is always challenging. Given the pressures on her income and spending, regardless of the economic outlook for our customers, we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General.","This morning, an announcement that Jim Thorpe would be retiring from Dollar General. When Jim rejoined the Company in 2015, we agreed upon a clear set of objectives for his tenure as Chief Merchandising Officer. As I knew he would, Jim has delivered on the merchandising strategies we identified as our highest priorities. I'm grateful for his contributions and want to wish Jim and his family the best.","Our strong business fundamentals and our long term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. Our business generates significant cash flow and we're in a position to invest in store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program and anticipated dividends.","I would like to recognize the drive and dedication of the more than 120,000 employees of Dollar General. Our focus remains on being successful over the long term. That success will be attributable to our people, as we look to capitalize on our unique and powerful mission of serving others.","With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions.","Mary Winn Pilkington","All right. Operator, we will take the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys. So I guess my question is the expectations you laid out for us this morning, does that anticipate any further price investments? Because you guys are kind of talking about labor and let's call it operating cost increases and the last two quarters or so it has been more focused on price investment.","So I guess I'm just trying to get an idea of where you think you are today in terms of the pricing investments. Where are you going? Are we comparatively priced where you want to be or is there more to come? Thanks.","Todd Vasos","Yes, Scott, as you know, we're very diligent in our pricing and the way we look at pricing every two weeks on our top items. With the proactive strategic pricing investments that we made last year, we feel that we're in very, very good shape right now on pricing. Matter of fact, as good as at any other time in the recent past.","We will continue to watch prices as they maneuver from area to area. We look at it by DMA, so we know throughout the nation where pricing is and there is always some pricing activity that happens in certain areas. But we feel as we sit right now, we're very well-positioned on pricing, but we will continue to monitor it so we offer our consumers that value that she has come to know from Dollar General.","Scott Ciccarelli","And then just a quickie second one, did you guys mention the deflation and SNAP impact in the quarter?","John Garratt","Yes. In terms of deflation, as we have said, we see the commodity deflation piece of it transitory. We did start to see some reduction in our average unit retail deflation as we went from Q3 to Q4. And as we look into this quarter, do expect to see -- have seen some signs of commodity deflation waning, but it continues to be a headwind. But bear in mind, we will start to lap this jump last year as we work through Q2.","In terms of SNAP, that continues to be a headwind as well. As you know, many of our customers utilize SNAP and other government assistance programs and it does take time for them to adjust their budgets. So it still is an impact. We do believe customers are starting to adjust and normalize their spend and we will start to lap the bulk of that impact as we work through Q2 as well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Alan Rifkin with BTIG.","Alan Rifkin","Thank you very much. Todd, for the 17% of your stores where you made the pricing and marketing investments a few quarters ago, can you maybe shed some color on how that group of stores did relative to the corporate average in the quarter? And when might we expect an acceleration in that initiative since it sounds like it is producing results?","Todd Vasos","Yes, Alan, what we saw -- and we look at it on a lot of different levels -- the great thing is we saw sales, we saw traffic, as well as our gross margin dollars all increase in those stores in aggregate since we have rolled out these pricing investments. I can tell you that in these stores, these stores have performed better than the chain average over the time that we have rolled those out.","In saying that we have said from the beginning that we will continue to watch and monitor price. And if we feel we need to take further pricing actions, the great thing is we have this model to be able to springboard on. At this point, we don't see a further action needed because we're priced very, very aggressively in most of our areas today, if not all. And we feel that right now, we're in a real good spot, but we always reserve the right to make sure that we -- make sure we deliver that value and convenience to our consumer. And over time, we may need to deploy further price, but at this time we think we're in great shape on that proactive pricing that we took advantage of earlier on.","Alan Rifkin","My second question has to do with the long term growth model. In the past you were talking about 10% to 15% growth. Now we're talking about 10% or higher, so you have kind of eliminated the higher end of the band.","Is that a function of just higher wage rates on your part that you believe will be persistent or it also a function perhaps of increased competition over the longer term? Curious why you are taking down the high end of the range.","John Garratt","Yes. Well, I will start by saying that we feel good about this year's performance, delivering over 10% earnings-per-share growth following double-digit earnings-per-share growth last year. And we're really trying to focus on the long term and make sure that we're making the right investments for the long term.","In terms of this year, we did mention that we're investing for the long term and have some headwinds which takes us outside of the model and as such, we're not talking about this year in the context of the model. But again, our focus is on the business fundamentals which remain phenomenal with great unit level economics that remain unchanged. And our focus and our goal remains to drive 10% or more earnings-per-share growth over the long term.","But as we go through time, making sure that we make investments as needed so it is sustainable growth. So as long as we're delivering double-digit earnings-per-share growth, we think we're serving our investors well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","So, Todd, a couple of things in one. Just touch on again the timetable for the produce rollout. You said one-third of the stores, but just what is the magnitude and then maybe beyond this initial test? When you think about what more you can do with a 7,300 square foot box that would make you more like DG Market, is there a lot more that can migrate; maybe even assortment in dry grocery? And then where does DG Market stand? Is that ever likely to be accelerated or it is kind of what it is; kind of a test kitchen, if you will?","Todd Vasos","John, let me first start by talking about the produce. As you may recall from the last call, we talked about testing produce in our 7,300 square foot stores. That test is ongoing and due to that test as well as the stores that we took over from the Walmart Express stores, if you will, we're going to take about one-third of our smaller box remodels next year and put produce into those, so that is that 6,000 square foot store.","We believe, because where our consumer is moving toward more of a fresh alternative, including better for you and healthier for you, we believe this is the right thing to do. But as you know us pretty well, we're going to do this very methodically and we're going to ensure that we have a return against this so that we can scale it across many more stores.","So we're going to go a little bit slow to make sure it works out the way we anticipate it working. Early results are showing some real positive signs, but again, they are really early results.","In talking about DG Market, we continue to be happy with the progress that we have got in our DG Markets. Our sales comps are in line with our chain. Our margin expectations are good. We're using DG Market a little bit differently right now, but reserve the right to look at it a little differently later. But right now, we're looking at it as a true test kitchen, if you will, for our DG Plus format as well as our traditional format.","I don't think we would ever be thinking about produce and meats in smaller stores if it wasn't for having the capability of DG Market as an example. So it is a great launching pad for a lot of other pieces that can go into and your last point being that smaller store. We believe that there is still a lot of opportunity for us in and around that food arena, whether it be dry grocery or perishables in our smaller box.","As that consumer's preference continues to evolve over time -- you know us pretty well -- we evolve with her and that is the great thing about having these different formats. We have the test and learns already done and available to roll out as those preferences change. So we feel good about where we're and where we're headed and we will be right in lockstep with the consumer.","John Heinbockel","And then just as a quick follow-up, when you think about maybe evolving more DG Market into a core box, how much general merchandise do you need to have to be differentiated versus other competitors? Because you don't want to go too far in that regard, right?","Todd Vasos","Yes, exactly right. As we have always said, non-consumables really rounds out the basket for us and it obviously, as we know, works that gross margin line pretty nicely for us. But again, as the consumer changes, so do their preferences for non-consumables. And we continue to eat evolve our non-consumable offering as well.","And we believe that we have real opportunities in seasonal and home categories that really resonate well with our core consumer. Party and occasions really resonate well in our core consumer's wallet as well. So we believe we've got opportunities to continue to grow. And as we talked about our strategic initiatives, I can tell you that that is in focus for us strategically over the long term on how we look at our non-consumable business for the long haul here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi","I wanted to ask on the expense side of the business, just any updates on zero-based budgeting? And then also if you could give any further color around the store manager, kind of the data behind the compensation decision. Is it largely in response to minimum wage changes or what other factors might you be able to share with us behind that? Thank you.","John Garratt","I will take the first part of that question. In terms of zero-based budgeting efforts, we're very pleased with the efforts. Came out of the gate very strong on this and as you saw with the SG&A, nearly leveraged SG&A at that comp of 0.9%, so exceeded our expectations. It has really become ingrained in the way we operate here. We have always had a culture of cost discipline here.","But as Todd mentioned, the filters, I see everyone in this organization looking at all of the spend in terms of the customer, the strategic priorities and the business risk. And with that targeted focus on spending, I think that was a key contributor to the great cost discipline and performance we saw this year.","Looking ahead, we continue to have the rigor in place around zero-based budgeting. The teams continue to work very hard on building a pipeline of future savings while making targeted investments as needed.","Then also, we look at it broadly in terms of operating margin, managing all of the levers within not only SG&A with the latest tools, zero-based budgeting, but also all of the levers available to us within gross margin.","Todd Vasos","Vinnie, when you look at the store manager pay initiatives that we have outlined, the great thing about Dollar General is that we don't do anything blindly here. So if you look back to mid last year, we took a large group of stores and we instituted a new pay scale for them, even outside of what the government was looking at rolling out at the time.","We wanted to see how those stores would perform over time and if we could move the needle on sales as well as our turnover rates, both in our store manager turnover as well as our hourly turnover rate; and if shrink over time would be able to benefit from this as well.","The great news is we have seen sales increases, we have seen stability in our store managers, the turnover rate and we have even seen stability in our hourly turnover rate in those stores as well to a greater degree. The great thing about this, a little different than the government program, it is not a one-size-fits-all program. It was really designed to best fit our store managers in the areas that they operate in, as well as the complexity of their individual stores.","So this has really been well-designed. Our store operations team did a great job in putting this together. And I can tell you that we have already rolled it out to our stores and it has been very, very well received, as you can imagine. So we're looking for great things in the future to continue to happen, both on the top line as well as our turnover lines in our stores from this initiative.","Vincent Sinisi","Very helpful color. Thank you, guys. And maybe just a fast follow-up, just general kind of qualitative thoughts on the low-end consumer. I know -- I think it was like two quarters ago maybe, you had said kind of a bit more cautious. Today you said kind of still cautiously optimistic. Just kind of any underlying thoughts for the 2017 outlook on the low end? Thanks very much.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, Vinnie. I think when you look at our core consumer, as we've said, they are always a little bit stretched. I mean, that is just how they live. In saying that, we go out to our customers quite frequently. We just got a report back that really addresses your comment pretty well and here is what the customer sentiment is right now. It is, you know what, I feel a little bit better about the way things are. The only thing is my finances aren't any better. And so it is not allowing me to take that next step in freely spending a little bit more, because I have so many other headwinds in front of me and also some unknown; around healthcare as an example, around rents and a lot of the other things that are headwinds.","The great thing about Dollar General is we're uniquely positioned to help her. And I think that as we look over the long term, making sure we're there with the right price and convenience and the right item for our consumer is going to be the win-win that she needs to continue to pull that budget together for her family.","We feel real good about where we're with the consumer and we will do everything we can to help that consumer be able to stem any tide that she may feel that may be going against her at this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis","I have a question about the gross margin outlook which is embedded in the guidance. You didn't comment on it and working through the midpoint of the other metrics which you did provide, I am coming up with approximately 30 basis points of pressure.","I guess as we look forward to next year, you have freight costs up, you have consumable shift. You saw some deflation in price investment. In the fourth quarter, that was offset by higher initial markup. So as we're looking into next year what should we be modeling and thinking about for the gross margin line? Thanks.","John Garratt","Well, I will start by saying that we really look at gross margin and SG&A in tandem and look to make the right trade-offs between both of those for the long term; and do make sure that we protect our low-cost positioning as well as our everyday low prices.","As we mentioned at the outset, given that this year is a little bit different in terms of the model, we weren't planning to go through all of the elements of the growth model in the context of 2017. But I will tell you over the long term, while it is always competitive in retail, the team does a phenomenal job controlling what they can control. And over the long term, we continue to see opportunities to increase margin with all of the levers available to us.","We continue to see opportunity to improve shrink over time, continue to see opportunities and drive opportunities with supply chain efficiencies, continue to see private label and foreign sourcing penetration as opportunity and the team continues to do a phenomenal job with category management. So that is really how we look at managing all of the levers within operating margin to grow that over the long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Todd, as you skew more toward fresh products, meat, produce, dairy, does that put you more in the competitive crosshair of the hard discounters? Or is the view you are already competing aggressively against those players and so a skewing more towards that assortment won't really matter?","Todd Vasos","Michael, the competitive environment is always stiff out there and we do compete with those competitors today. The way we look at this is whatever our customer is asking for, we want to make available to her in a very convenient store base, as well as at a great price. And we see the opportunity in fresh and frozen to being able to be able to give her what she needs at the time she needs it.","So I would tell you that while we do know that our competitors sell a lot of the same type of goods, we have a real competitive advantage and we own that last mile. And that last mile is being close to her doorstep at home. Nothing really trumps that convenient factor that we can offer, other than price. The nice thing is we have both.","Michael Lasser","Todd, I want to follow up on your comments around being comfortable with where your pricing is right now. Does that assume that market level prices stay the same and then you might have to react if prices come down? Or you are comfortable with where prices are and you are not assuming they are going to go lower","Todd Vasos","Yes, I would never assume that they won't go lower. We look at pricing now and where we think pricing may go, as I made these comments. So we feel good about where we're today and we feel good about the flexibility that we have in our model to be able to price where we need to take price across the DMAs that we operate in.","But the great thing is we have never lost sight of price here and by not losing sight of price we don't believe it is ever going to be a hard left or a hard right we're going to have to take on pricing. We feel that we're very competitive now and we can continue to be very competitive, no matter what may face us in the future.","Michael Lasser","If I could just add one more quick one because I think we're going to be talking a lot about it for the next couple of months. You mentioned that as tax refunds were delayed, it probably caused some sluggishness in the first part of your quarter.","Because over the full course of your quarter, all of the refunds that were distributed last year should be distributed this year, do you think you get all of that back or is some of that spending maybe leaked to other buckets and as a result, it won't be a full net-net impact to your results?","Todd Vasos","Well, as you look at the tax refunds, you could definitely tell early in the quarter, as John indicated. We saw some general softness around not having those tax returns out there. We saw a pick-up as they started to flow. But I have to remind you, we've got a lot of time left in the quarter still. Those tax returns, while flowing, aren't yet completely caught up, but they are getting closer.","And I am a retailer and as a retailer when you move through certain periods of time and you don't get what you thought you were going to get, you don't bank that it is going to come. And what you do is you put initiatives in place as we did to capture a greater share of these tax returns as we move through the quarter. So we have done some things here to hopefully capture a greater share of those tax returns as she is ready to spend them.","But I just want to say we still have a lot of the quarter left. Remember that Easter shift that is occurring between March and April this year. And as we move into April, we're looking for some increased sales and hopefully deliver a pretty good quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Edward Kelly","I wanted to ask you about -- back to store managers. You're seeing some earnings pressure because of proactive investments and wages and training. Assuming 20% or so annual store manager turnover, 1,000 new stores, you are going to have to hire and train something like 4,000 store managers this year.","So how much of this wage increase and pressure just relates to finding good people? How are you finding that? And then how is this dynamic impacting the execution risk associated with your growth plan?","Todd Vasos","Yes, that is a good question, Ed. As you look at our store manager, the one great thing over the last couple of years is that we have been dealing with this turnover and about the same rate for quite a while now. And our pipeline for good, talented store managers has not let up. We have been able to fill that pipeline and we continue to be able to fill that pipeline.","This investment is not really geared toward that as much because we can't find. It is more geared toward making sure that we take care of our current store managers, but also making sure that we continue to be able to retain and attract the right individuals as we go forward.","So I think it is really twofold. But as we look at it, we feel very good about being able to attract and retain good, talented individuals. And this test that we did back midyear last year and still ongoing has really proven to show us that we can really stem the tide of turnover by getting that right individual on the front side into our stores to run that.","Being an old operator as I am, the store manager is the key linchpin to everything that happens at retail; always has been and at least probably in my lifetime as a retailer always will be.","Edward Kelly","Then just a quick follow-up, of the $0.16, how much of that relates to what you are doing with store manager pay?","John Garratt","That is the vast majority of it. Yes, there was also the training that went with it, but the bulk of it was the store manager investment.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Kayla, we have hit the top of the hour, so I think we will end it there.

Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up question, if necessary.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, Jennifer, and welcome to everyone joining our call. 2019 is off to a great start and our strong financial performance illustrates the progress we have already made against our goals for this year. This performance was driven by our innovative merchandising and marketing strategies as well as our focus on operational excellence. We delivered value and convenience across our footprint of more than 15,000 stores, and we believe our neighborhood store concept continues to resonate with our customers.","As most of you know, we have a lot of exciting things happening at Dollar General, and I'm looking forward to updating you on our progress during today's call. I'll start with a few key highlights from our first quarter before turning the call over to John for a more in-depth look at our financial results. After that, I'll walk you through the progress we're making on our four strategic initiatives, and finally I'll highlight the continued momentum our four operating priorities are generating for the business.","Turning now to our first quarter performance. We delivered comp sales growth of 3.8%, additionally net sales grew 8.3% to $6.6 billion compared to net sales of $6.1 billion in the first quarter of 2018. This strong net sales performance in the first quarter of 2019 showed once again that we can continue to drive sales growth from both new stores and mature stores. Additionally, during the first quarter, we continue to gain market share and highly consumable product sales, which was a key driver of our strong and balanced performance. Syndicated data indicated we had mid to high single digit growth in both units and dollars over the 4, 12, 24 and 52 week periods ending May 4, 2019. Our 3.8% comp growth rate for the first quarter of 2019 resulted from both an increase in average basket size as well as our highest customer traffic growth in over a year.","Driving profitable traffic to our stores remains a priority, and we're pleased to see our efforts delivering during the quarter. We saw another very strong quarter of growth in sales of consumables. Our non-consumable sales growth was driven by strong results in both seasonal and home. As part of our ongoing merchandising strategy, we continue to reduce space for hanging apparel in order to reallocate square footage to categories that our customers are shopping most in our stores. As expected by intentionally downsizing our apparel offering, we saw a negative overall comp in apparel. That said, we believe we are executing the right back-to-basics apparel strategy, and we are reallocating the square footage to highly productive items that our customers are seeking. As we noted in our last call, we believe sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 benefited from the acceleration of certain SNAP payments from February to January.","Although the shift in these payments created a sales headwind for Q1, I'm pleased to note that we only gave back approximately half of the benefit we saw in the fourth quarter. We attribute this result to our strategic promotional activity in the fourth quarter, which we believe drove loyalty and share gains among existing and new customers as we intended. Even as we continue to gain share, we believe there is significant opportunity for us to take even more share. We will continue to keep the customer at the center of everything we do and we're excited about the many opportunities we have to become an even more important partner to her as we move through 2019 and beyond.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to John to provide you with a little bit more detail on the first quarter financial results.","John Garratt","Thank you, Todd, and good morning everyone. I'm going to walk you through the financial details of the first quarter. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profits. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.2% in the first quarter, a decrease of 23 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to increases in distribution and transportation costs, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category, which generally has a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories, and sales of lower-margin products comprising a higher proportion of sales within the consumables category. Partially offsetting these items were higher initial markups on inventory purchases. As we said we would, we normalized our promotional markdown activity in the first quarter, following targeted increases at the end of fiscal 2018.","SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.5%, an increase of 6 basis points. The increase was primarily driven by increased employee benefits and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales, partially offset by lower repairs and maintenance and workers\u2019 compensation expense. As we noted on our fourth quarter call, we are investing this year in our four strategic initiatives. We remain excited about the long-term transformative potential of these initiatives and believe we are making the right upfront investments in 2019 to deliver mid-to-long term benefits.","Moving down the income statement, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8% when compared to 21.6% last year. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter increased 8.8% to $1.48. The team did a nice job delivering the bottom line in the quarter despite headwinds from the investments and initiatives and the change we made to our inventory replenishment process.","Turning now to our balance sheet, which remained strong, merchandise inventories were $4.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 14.3% overall, an increase of 8.2% on a per store basis. As we have previously discussed, we began implementing a change to our inventory replenishment process in the first quarter that we believe will allow us to support even higher levels of on-shelf availability. As anticipated in addition to the gross margin headwind impact in the quarter, the change also contributed to our slightly higher overall inventory levels.","In addition to our inventory replenishment efforts, we are implementing more rigorous on-shelf availability processes. These processes are focused on improving the in-stock performance of stores that do not meet our standards. In the first quarter, we saw a 26% in-stock improvement in the below standard stores. We know on-shelf availability is a critical component of the overall customer satisfaction and convenience and ultimately sales. We believe that we can continue to drive improvements in this area. We continue to believe our inventory is in great shape and that these tactics position us to support and drive sales growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond. Our goal over time remains to have our inventory growth be in line with or below our sales growth.","The business continues to generate significant cash flow from operations totaling $574 million in the first quarter, an increase of $25.5 million or 4.7%. Total capital expenditures for the first quarter were $145 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, continued investments in construction of our Amsterdam, New York distribution center and spending related to the strategic initiatives.","During the quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $200 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $83 million. At the end of the first quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $1.1 billion.","Our capital allocation priorities have served us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividends, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio approximately three times adjusted debt to EBITDA.","I want to touch upon our fiscal 2019 financial guidance. As most of you know, tariff rates recently increased from 10% to 25% on certain goods from China. As we have discussed with you on previous calls, we have been executing on a variety of efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and our business.","Our efforts have focused on four key areas; continual negotiations with our vendors, product substitution, product reengineering and country of origin and diversification. We will do everything we can to minimize the impact of tariffs on our customers, but even with these efforts, we believe our shoppers will be facing higher prices as 2019 progresses. Our focus remains on maintaining our everyday low price leadership, which is a key pillar of our value proposition.","Even though the outlook for additional tariffs appeared to be more positive as we entered 2019, our focus on these efforts never waned. As a result of this work and our strong start to fiscal 2019, we believe we can deliver on our current 2019 guidance. With this in mind, we are reiterating the 2019 guidance announced on March 14, 2019. Our guidance does not contemplate the impact of any additional increases in tariff rates or the expansion of additional products subject to tariffs beyond those currently in effect.","I also want to provide you with some updated color on some of our expectations. We have noted that we are seeing a more balanced transportation marketplace which has helped to alleviate some of the pressure we saw in the back half of 2018. However, fuel costs have risen more than initially forecasted and we anticipate these costs could be a gross margin headwind throughout 2019. Despite transportation and tariff headwinds, we continued to believe that we should see improvements in the gross margin year-over-year comparison as we move throughout the year.","Regarding SG&A, we continue to expect to spend approximately $50 million on our strategic initiatives in 2019. While we expect these expenses to sequentially increase throughout the remainder of the year, we anticipate that the overall impact of these investments will most significantly pressure operating profits in the second quarter. As anticipated, the change we made to our inventory replenishment process resulted in a higher inventory level at the end of the first quarter and we expect to see somewhat elevated levels throughout 2019.","We are very pleased with our strong first quarter and are proud of the team's execution. We believe our guidance reflects the strong start to the year, while contemplating known headwinds as well as the fact that there is still a lot of year left ahead of us. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing in initiatives for long-term growth. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing operating priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, John. We\u2019re very pleased with the first quarter results and the strong start to 2019. We have an innovative, robust portfolio of initiatives that are beginning to gain momentum and want to take the next few minutes to update you on the progress we've made this past quarter.","Starting with our non-consumable initiative or NCI; as a reminder, NCI is our early stage initiative focused on a new expanded product offering in key non-consumable categories of home, domestics, housewares, party and occasion. The NCI offering was available more than 1,100 stores at the end of the first quarter and we plan to include it in approximately 2,400 stores by the end of 2019. We have learned a lot from these stores and we are already applying the lessons learned from successes in many non-consumable departments across the chain.","We're very excited about the results we're seeing from these stores and have now moved through many replenishment cycles. We are seeing lifts in non-consumable sales, particularly within seasonal and home, but also delighted to be seen a positive halo effect in consumable sales. Additionally, while it's still early, we're seeing a positive impact on customer traffic in these stores. As a result, we are driving higher sales and seeing improvements in both mix and gross margin in these stores.","Next I want to update you on DG Fresh, which is one of the new strategic initiatives we introduced in our Q4 call in March. As a reminder, DG Fresh is a strategic multi-phase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods such as dairy and deli. We began shipping from our first DG Fresh facility in Pottsville, Pennsylvania in January, and we're serving more than 800 stores in the Northeast. While it's still early, we're already successfully reducing product cost on these types of items.","We believe that we continue to scale DG Fresh, it will be meaningfully improve our gross margin. Two other important goals for DG Fresh are to drive higher on-time delivery and in-stocks. And we're encouraged by the early results, which are in line with our projections. In addition to the gross margin and in-stock benefits, DG Fresh will eventually allow us to control our own destiny in these categories. This will include a water selection of both national and private brands that our customers seek, as well as enhanced offering of better-for-you items. While produce is not included in the initial rollout, we believe DG Fresh could provide a path forward to expanding our produce offering to more stores in the future.","We have signed leases on three more DG Fresh facilities that we intend to open in 2019. We've planned to begin shipping from our second facility in Clayton, North Carolina within the next few weeks. For fiscal 2019, our goal remains to rollout our self-distribution model to as many as 5,000 stores from up to four facilities. We\u2019re excited about DG Fresh and the many benefits it can deliver for our customer and our business, and we believe it can be a creative as early as 2020.","Turning now to digital. During the first quarter, the team continued to make great strides in deploying technology to further enhance the in-store experience. One great example of this work is our launch of the all new Dollar General app, which redesigns the coupon clipping experience for our customer. We are moving friction in the clipping process in several ways. Our customers can now search for coupons by product category, type or name, and they can also use the app to scan a product and search for any available coupon. In addition, we've introduced new features that help integrate our digital and traditional media including and interacts with circular.","We are very excited with the early feedback. Our digital coupons continued to grow in popularity with our customers and we now have approximately 17 million digital coupons subscriber accounts and more than 300 million digital coupons were clipped in the first quarter. We also continue to innovate within the DG GO! App.","As a reminder, the app allows customers to use their phones to scan items as they shop, see a running total of the items in their basket using our card calculator and then skip the line by using the DG GO! checkout. Through the end of the first quarter, we have had more than 200,000 downloads of DG GO! and are averaging more than 40,000 monthly active users.","We have DG GO! checkout in approximately 250 stores and our goal is to have DG GO! in approximately 750 stores by the end of the fiscal year. We have previously noted that our customers are using the card calculator functionality frequently as a budgeting and optimization tool, even when they are not using DG GO! to check out. Based on this insight, we intend to make card calculator available in more than 12,000 stores by the end of the fiscal year.","As we move through 2019, we will continue to focus our efforts on developing new tools to enhance the value and convenience proposition for our customers. For example, we\u2019re working on consolidating our DG GO! and Dollar General coupon apps into one easy to use customer friendly app. Additionally, we are identifying opportunities to harness the power of the data we have available to us and how we use that data to increase our ability to personalize the shopping experience for our customers.","We will continue to evolve our digital suite of tools to serve not only the customers we have today, but also the customers of the future. Our digital strategy is an important component of our long-term growth strategy and we\u2019re excited about the many opportunities ahead.","Our fourth strategic initiative is Fast Track. Fast Track is a two-pronged approach to increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. There are two key components to Fast Track. First, we are streamlining the stocking process in our stores. This starts with an update of sorting processes at our distribution centers that is facilitated and our ability to optimize the way we pack our rolltainers.","Our goal is to reduce the number of steps required to get product from truck to our store shelves. To help you visualize this, our goal is that each rolltainer only contained products for one or two adjacent aisles. While this may sound simple, the improved efficiencies from this change are expected to save a significant amount of store labor that can be redeployed to other customer facing activities or channeled into labor productivity gains.","Our goal is to complete the resorting process in all existing traditional distribution centers by the end of 2020. As part of our streamlined stocking process, we will also look to incorporate more shelf ready packaging. While this will take a little bit more time to achieve, we believe we can reduce the number of case packs that must be broken apart and thus reduce the amount of time spent restocking shelves between deliveries and\/or reduce the number of items mischaracterized as an out of stock.","This should have a positive impact to us on-shelf availability. As items that may appear to be out of stock that are actually either on our sky shelves or in our backroom. The second key component of Fast Track is a self-checkout test, which will allow customers to scan and pay for their items with little to no assistance from our associates.","I believe this checkout option can further improve speed of checkout for our customers and reduce the number of labor hours devoted to checking out our customers. Our goal is to begin the self-checkout pilots and select stores later in 2019. As John mentioned, while there\u2019ll be a significant SG&A price tag for Fast Track in 2019 in upfront one, we believe that it can enhance customer convenience and also drive SG&A expense over time.","We believe we are the innovative leader in our channel and we are excited about our long-term strategic initiatives. We remain committed to our four operating priorities. And I want to take our last few minutes to update you on some of the recent efforts.","Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. Cooler door expansion continues to be the most impactful merchandising initiative. We began our cooler expansion efforts in earnest in 2013. In addition to being a great traffic and ticket driver, our success and expanding our cooler footprint has provided the scale necessary to initiate DG Fresh.","In the first quarter, we edit more than 12,000 cooler doors across the chain. We also increased the number of stores with our better for you offering in the first quarter, bringing the total for the chain to approximately 3,400 stores. Our new good and smart private brand continues to be popular with our customers and remains an important part of our better for you offering. We have many ongoing efforts in the health and beauty area in 2019.","Most recently, we launched believe our private cosmetic brands with all items priced at $5 or less. We have seen great initial customer response to this aspirational brand and we are excited for more of our customers to try these goods over time. The final merchandising initiative I want to highlight today is the partnership with Western Union, as we announced in the first quarter. This is a great opportunity to leverage our real estate footprint to offer our customers the ability to send or receive cash in more than 15,000 convenient locations.","This agreement creates value for Dollar General in two key ways. First, we receive a commission for each transaction and second by delivering a new service that our customers want. We believe that it can become a traffic driver over time.","As you hear from us frequently, the customer is at the center of everything we do and this new service is another great example of offering her solutions she wants. Beyond these sales driving initiatives, we are continuing efforts to capture several gross margin opportunities. In addition to the gross margin benefits of NCI and DG Fresh reducing shrink remains an important opportunity for us. We rolled out nearly 900 more electronic article surveillance units in the first quarter, bringing the total number of stores that EAS to approximately 11,000. Our goal remains to have EAS an approximately 13,000 stores by the end of the year.","We also continue to pursue distribution and transportation efficiencies to support our profitable sales growth. As John noted, we are seeing some continued inflation in 2019 and transportation costs, primarily from fuel rates, which further emphasizes the importance of these efforts. For example, we continue to make progress in reducing stem miles and our long view distribution center has ramped up nicely since we began shipping in January. And we intend to begin shipping from our distribution center in Amsterdam, New York later this year.","We also further expanding our private fleet and intend to grow it by at least another 75 tractors by the end of fiscal 2019. This year\u2019s private fleet expansion will be largely focused on our DG Fresh facilities. And we believe it remains an important part of our overall transportation strategy.","Finally, foreign sourcing remains a long-term gross margin opportunity and our goals include increasing penetration as well as diversifying countries from which we source. The team is successfully finding products in key categories that can be sourced internationally and we believe there are many additional products and channels to explore.","Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven, high-return, low-risk model for real estate growth remains a core strength for our business. Our real estate model continues to focus on the five metrics that have served us well in evaluating thousands of new stores in the recent years. These metrics include new store productivity, actual sales performance, average returns, cannibalization, and the payback period. Even as we see changes on the competitive landscape, our real estate projections continue to perform well against these metrics. Reinforcing our belief that new store growth is the best use of our capital.","Our remodel and relocation program is in a great supplement to our new store growth strategy and overall we continue to see strong results from our portfolio of real estate projects. We made tremendous progress toward achieving our real estate project goals in the first quarter. During the quarter, we opened 240 new stores, remodels 330 stores, including a 128 DGTP remodels, and relocated 27 stores. We also added produce to approximately 50 stores, bringing the total of stores across the chain, offering produce to approximately 480.","As a reminder, on average, our traditional remodel stores, which have an average of 22 cooler-doors deliver a 4% to 5% comp lift and the DGTP remodel, which has an average of 34 higher capacity coolers, delivers a 10% to 15% complex with the addition of produce driving comps to the high end of this range. We have a robust real estate pipeline in place and we are excited about the continued growth ahead of us in 2019.","Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. The discipline with which the team approaches spending continues to be a great strength. Our clear and defined process to control expenses, governed spending decisions and has resulted in a strong cost control mindset. We continue to focus efforts around the organization on reducing costs were possible through a zero-based budgeting process. While this operating philosophy is generally focused on cost reduction, it has also proven to be a great springboard for many of the ideas. In fact, this process was the foundation for both Fast Track and Western Union and we believe that continues to serve us well as we reinforce our position as a low-cost operator.","Our fourth and final operating party is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage. We believe the opportunity to develop a career with a growing retailer is unique in many of the communities we call home and we are proud of the thousands of associates, who have taken advantage of this opportunity. More than 11,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes and we continue to champion strong development and training programs for our associates to grow.","On the supply chain side, our first class of employees has completed the private fleet driving training program. This program pays for distribution center associates to obtain their commercial drivers\u2019 licenses and further their careers. To keep a close eye on \u2013 we keep a close eye on key metrics related to our employee \u2013 our people and we are pleased with what we are seeing. We continue to have a robust applicant flow at every level. Additionally, while it\u2019s still early in the year, store manager turnover is trending better in 2019 than 2018, which was our best year on record. We are continually engaging with our entire employee base and we believe this dialogue is vital to cultivating the strong Dollar General culture. Remaining an employer of choice is an important priority for us and we believe that we are well positioned to continue to attract and retain talent.","In closing, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter and excited about our position and outlook for the remainder of 2019. As we said we would, we are driving growth on multiple fronts and I\u2019m delighted with the team\u2019s ability to deliver across so many complex projects simultaneously. Our real estate growth strategy is generating thousands of new store openings and remodels, and we have a portfolio of robust initiatives in place that we believe will have a meaningful positive impact on our business for years to come.","In short, we are using our mature and stable business as a foundation to drive innovation and growth. We believe we operate in the most attractive sectoral retail and we continue to differentiate the Dollar General business for the rest of the retail landscape through our distinct combination of value and convenience in a unique real estate footprint.","Our mission of serving others guides all we do at Dollar General and the team remains focused on serving our customers every day while driving long-term value for our shareholders. I want to thank each of our more than 137,000 employees across the company for all of their hard work every day. I\u2019m excited about what we can accomplish together in 2019.","With that operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Matt Boss from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Todd Vasos","Good morning, Matt.","Matt Boss","Hey, congrats on a great quarter guys.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Matt Boss","So Todd, maybe to start off, you outlined a laundry list of top-line initiatives underway. I think you probably could have hosted an Analyst Day for how much is clearly going on. I guess maybe could you help segment opportunities do you think contributed to your first quarter comp? What you\u2019re the most excited about maybe into the back half of the year versus initiatives you see accelerating into next year and beyond?","Todd Vasos","Sure. Our cooler program continues to be one of the key drivers, Matt, to what we\u2019ve seen in our success so far in 2019, and also what we\u2019ve seen in the past. But what I\u2019m also excited about is, what we\u2019re seeing in a lot of the initiatives that we continue to work on in our HBA world. As an example, the teams are doing a great job there, and the customer is really resonating to our great prices, our values, as well as our extensive private brand and national brand offering in those areas. So, they continue to do very well and our new cosmetic line Believe, I think will continue to build momentum as we move into the second quarter and back half of this year.","As you look at later parts of this year and into next, we believe that many of our initiatives, including NCI, will continue to build momentum; and also, our DG Fresh initiative as I look at that over the long-term, later this year and in the next, it\u2019s already starting to deliver the gross margin that we see through better cost of goods. But also, it\u2019s showing us that we can be better in stock by controlling our own destiny there. And so, we believe that that\u2019ll start paying even more dividends as we move to the back half of the year. We\u2019re very bullish on what we see in our topline right now, and we\u2019ll continue to push as much as we can if you continue to see these great results as you move through the back half of the year.","Matt Boss","Great. Maybe then just a follow-up. On the SG&A front, so excluding the incremental $50 million of initiative spend, any underlying change to the 2.5% to 3% comp as the expense leverage point. And Todd, I guess larger picture, is it fair to think about this year\u2019s strategic initiatives build as a peak level as you kind of look forward?","Todd Vasos","Yes. I\u2019ll let John start now, and I\u2019ll \u2013 and I\u2019ll add a little cover.","John Garratt","yes. In terms of SG&A, we\u2019re pleased with the Q1 cost control. We deleveraged six basis points. As we mentioned, we\u2019re investing in initiatives for future growth. There was somewhat of a shift from Q1 to Q2, but very pleased with the cost control. In terms of the leverage point, as we discussed before, there is an impact as you\u2019re investing in things like DG Fresh, which we see as enhancing our operating margin over time. That does put pressure on SG&A as you\u2019re investing some labor in the stores and other initiatives like that. But I would say, we remain laser focused on cost control. We don\u2019t see it differently. And the main change here is that dynamic of investing in these strategic initiatives, which we see helping our operating margin and being as accretive as early as next year.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question or comment comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open.","Michael Lasser","Thanks for taking my question. given the success you had in the first quarter, why shouldn\u2019t we expect a comp better than the 2% that\u2019s implied at the \u2013 in your full-year comp guidance of 2.5% over the next few quarters?","Todd Vasos","Hi, Michael. This is Todd. When I look at the rest of the year, we do feel very good about where the company is headed. We\u2019ve got a lot of year ahead of us, right? And there\u2019s a \u2013 there could be a lot of noise out there. We don\u2019t know what these \u2013 this last list of tariffs may or may not do to our core consumer, and really the consumer base in general. So, I think we\u2019re \u2013 our guidance reflects appropriately where the \u2013 where we are today and where those risks still may lie. but we\u2019re doing everything we can to continue to drive that top line, and of course drive traffic. And our key here is traffic, and traffic is king. We know that. And we continue to \u2013 all of our efforts around our sales are really guided by that traffic growth.","Michael Lasser","On the subject of tariffs, we know that 5% of your sales come from direct imports with China being one of those countries. Do you have an overall estimate of your cost of goods exposure to China if the list 4 does go through?","John Garratt","Yes. So, as you indicated, it\u2019s about 6% of our purchases measured at cost are tied to direct imports, predominantly China centric. although we have been diversifying in recent years. This is an impact facing all of retail. Our exposure is relatively lower compared to many. And the team has been working very diligently to mitigate this impact as evidenced by the updated guidance or the guidance that we maintained. the team is working on continual negotiations with vendors, product substitution, product reengineering, and continuing to change the origin of countries where it\u2019s coming from. We\u2019re doing everything we can to minimize the impact on customers. but as you know, as others have said, this is \u2013 probably something that\u2019s going to impact the customers particularly if the list 4 comes out. I\u2019d rather not speculate on what that impact will be. It\u2019s hard to say how that -- things will shake out there. But we believe that we\u2019re very well-positioned to serve our customer and we\u2019re priced right. We\u2019re conveniently located and we\u2019re there to help her in good times and bad.","Todd Vasos","And Michael, I\u2019ll just \u2013 I\u2019ll just add as well. Remember we\u2019re a limited source of \u2013 limited skew retailer. Meaning, we don\u2019t have to carry everything and we can make decisions on what to carry and what not to carry depending on cost of goods and what may or may not increase. And I think the team has done a real nice job in the first few lifts and while lift four is very extensive that work is ongoing right now as well. So stay tuned. We\u2019re hoping that there\u2019ll be some resolution here. but make no mistake that this will \u2013 if the lift four goes in, it will cost the consumer on, they\u2019re in and with our budget. The great thing is though, I believe that Dollar General stands ready to build to serve that customer, because she\u2019ll need us more at that time.","Michael Lasser","Sounds good. Thank you so much and good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.","Karen Short","Hi. Thanks very much. A great quarter.","Todd Vasos","thank you.","Karen Short","Just a quick \u2013 just a question in terms of having such a strong 1Q, obviously, you indicated there will be more SG&A pressure in Q2. but I guess any thoughts on keeping kind of the full-year overall guidance given that some of these costs abate in the second half and gross margin compares also got quite a bit easier?","Todd Vasos","Yes. I\u2019ll start by saying we feel great about the fundamentals of business and the strong start to the year. As I did note there was some investment spending shifted from Q1 to Q2 and importantly, we absorbed the impact of the recently enacted tariff increases, not previously assumed into the guidance and it\u2019s not mentioned there\u2019s still a lot of year left. The tap \u2013 the comp laps are a little tougher as the year goes on. But we feel great about the business, we feel comfortable about the guidance we\u2019ve provided, and we\u2019re very pleased with the start of the year.","Karen Short","Okay. And then just switching to comps for a second on the NCI, maybe can you give a little bit of color on the comp lift that you\u2019re seeing in the stores and also the margin impact. and then you made a comment on the 26% improvement, I guess in stocks at the below standard stores. Any color you can give us on the comp benefit from having a veterans doc?","Todd Vasos","Sure. On an NCI program that we\u2019re very pleased with the early results there. The team has done a really nice job in procuring goods. We\u2019re now into our fourth and fifth replenishment cycle. And some of the products that I\u2019ve seen recently with this newest wave is even better than the previous one. So, I could tell you that, we feel very good with what we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re seeing overall width in the store, both in our non-consumable areas and our consumable areas. So, we\u2019re getting a very nice halo effect out of that. And not only are we seeing those lifts in our top-line sales, but we\u2019re seeing gross margin benefits, of course, in our non-consumable area. but overall as well for the entire box.","So, we\u2019re feeling very good about where we\u2019re going. We\u2019ll do up to 2,400 stores this year and looking to see how we accelerate that as we move into 2020 and beyond. But again, we feel very good. your second part of the question was on the in-stock piece, we\u2019ve been working very hard. It started at the end of last year in re-looking at how we look at on-shelf availability and very proud of what the team has done in and around making sure we have product on the shelf for our consumers.","Now, it did come with a little bit of a cost of some inventory. but as you alluded to and we\u2019ve talked about in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re seeing in the 20% range, increase of on-shelf availability meaning in-stocks for our customer. And I could tell you that in those stores, it\u2019s meaningful and it does add to the comp. So, we\u2019ll continue to work that piece. And as I also talked about as Fast Track continues to move forward, and this would probably be more into the late 2019 and into 2020. We\u2019re going to be getting some on-shelf availability benefits from that as well as we continue to reduce those case packs, and rationalize our skew base on the shelf to better keep our in-stock levels on fast movers. And stay tuned for more of that. We believe that will pay some real benefits as we move into the end of the year and in the 2020.","Karen Short","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Paul Trussell","Good morning and great quarter.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, Paul.","Paul Trussell","the gross margin performance in 1Q was better than my forecast. Just curious how it stacked up to your expectations. and previously, you had mentioned that you expected the most pressure on a year-over-year basis in 1Q. Just want to make sure that guidance still stands and just give some overall puts and takes on GPM","John Garratt","Yes, we were pleased with the performance in Q1. We indicated that on our Q4 call that Q1 would be pressured, but we did say that we expected to see sequential improvement on year-over-year basis as we went from Q4 to Q1. But nonetheless, we did see pressure from the change in the replenishment process as well as the ongoing pressure of distribution, transportation costs and the ongoing mixed pressures.","However, as we said, we would, we were successful in normalizing the promotional markdown cost, while at the same time delivering strong comps in traffic. So we're very pleased with that. The team did a great job managing through the various headwinds. And as we said in our prepared statements, we expect to see further sequential improvement over the balance of the year on a year-over-year comp basis. And in longer-term, we believe we have a lot of opportunity to increase not only gross margins but operating margin over time.","As Todd indicated, we're very excited about the progress we're making in DG Fresh as we convert items and convert stores, we're seeing the benefits, the cost savings we expected there, very pleased with what we're seeing from MDI in terms of not only the sales lift, but also the improvement that add to mix.","We're investing more in the AS units, we're going to be adding another 3,000 this year. We've seen great success from that and the benefit it has on shrink. And there continues to be opportunities for us with category management, increasing foreign sourcing, penetration, increasing private label penetration and we\u2019ve mentioned the non consumable opportunity. And then lastly while we did see pressure from transportation costs in Q1 and fuel remained the pressure. We're very pleased by what we've seen in terms of the proactive efforts of the team to mitigate these efforts and take advantage of an improving environment.","So we're optimistic that over the long-term we can not only maintain but enhance overall operating margin over the long-term. And that's the way we look at it.","Paul Trussell","Thanks for that color. And just as a follow up, Todd, could you maybe just speak bigger picture to what your core consumer is saying about their financial health in overall sentiment on the economy? And then may be rank for us, as you look in your stores, coffee beans occurring from your core customer coming more frequently versus shopping the store more broadly versus actually getting that trade down from higher income shoppers. Thank you.","Todd Vasos","When you look at our gains, our core consumer is continuing to tell us, I feel pressured, but again, this core consumer always is under pressure financially. Their income levels are on the lower end, as we all know, in saying that she continues to tell us that, she's back to work. She continues to tell us that, she has got a little bit more money in her pocket, a more so from a productivity meaning more working hours than actual wage growth, but yet more money, she has headwinds, make no bones about it. She still has headwinds of healthcare being one of the largest rents, continues to be out there for her as a headwind, but as we looked \u2013 in the last year when we started to hear from our consumer that she was feeling a little bit more stressed. We continue to hear that.","But what we do very well here is we were able to move our promotional activity, our mix inside the store, our end-cap presentations to match where we believe she will be and we did that in the first quarter and I believe very successfully and we'll continue to do that as our customer tells us where she believes she'll be in her journey as we move through 2019. As you look at our consumers overall though, I would tell you that our consumer that makes a little bit more money. So that next level of consumer is our fastest growing consumer that we have here at Dollar General. So that trade in is alive and well, but it's not coming at any cost of our core consumer. And our core consumer continues to come more often as well as we're seeing that she is spending the more once she's in the store, so we're both getting the transaction growth side and that basket size.","So we feel very good about our customer segments and where they're headed. And the great thing is we're attracting the higher-end consumer, I believe, because of all of the work that we've done in this box over the years.","Paul Trussell","Thanks so much. Best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. your line is open.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and also congrats on a nice quarter.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Rupesh Parikh","So I have two questions on your DG Fresh effort. So as I guess first, anything that has surprised you thus far, I know it's only been a few months at this point and then as you think longer term or even in the intermediate term, how do you think about what flows to the bottom line versus being reinvested in the business from some of the gross margin benefits that you expect to see?","Todd Vasos","Yes, right now I would tell you that the DG Fresh initiative is really performing above where we thought it would perform. Again, our teams are very good at executing very complex projects. And this, as you can imagine is one of the big ones. But I would tell you, opening a thousand stores a year and remodeling another thousand is no easy feat. So, we're very good at this type of work and I would tell you that DG Fresh was no different and it's executing as we thought and are producing the results that we thought.","You heard from John, we're seeing the cost of goods savings. We're seeing better in stocks already at store level and we're only 800 stores in and so more to come as we move through the next cycles of this. The great thing is that the plan is rolling out as designed. We've already got all four of our DCs signed and ready to go. And the next one will be shipping here in the next few weeks. So we feel good about that. And then as you continue to look at DG Fresh on that margin rate, the great thing about Dollar General is we never took our eye off our price, whether that be in our fresh area or our dry areas of the company and we're priced very, very well across the board.","So I would tell you that we feel very good about that and we feel very good about those margin gains that should come from this over time, the majority of it should drop to the bottom line which is very exciting.","Rupesh Parikh","Great. And one quick followup question, whether clearly a challenge last year and it sure is also a challenge Q1, just curious if you guys think you're having a negative impact on your business?","Todd Vasos","No, I would say there are lot of puts and takes between weather lapse, weather this year and the pull forward of the snap benefit, when you net all that together, all that noise together, it's about a push and really the 3.8% comp was a solid 3.8% comp not impacted by any outside noise.","Rupesh Parikh","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open","Anthony Chukumba","Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So related question on comp, so during the first quarter, obviously you had the pulls forward because of the snap benefits of 70 basis points. It sounds you got half of that back, tax refunds looks like we're a little bit lower than people expected. And then weather was pretty bad. So putting that all together, what do you think allowed you to do close to a 4% comp with those three headwinds? Was it macro or was it more about the positive impact of lot of the initiatives that you talked about in this call? Thank you.","Todd Vasos","Yes. I would tell you that our core consumer again has a little bit more money in their pocket. But I would tell you when you look at the performance and as we see it broken down in the categories that we watch very closely here, many of our gains occurred from the initiatives that either we work through in 2018 that are continuing to still payoff, and even some of those early 2019 ones. So it gives us a lot of confidence that we're on the right track and as we move through the rest of this year.","Anthony Chukumba","That's helpful. Thanks a lot.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys. So I know a bunch of people have asked about kind of the comp momentum. But Todd, specifically you talked about how last year which where we generally saw rising average ticket but softer traffic was due to the relative health of your core customer and trip consolidations. I guess what I'm kind of trying to figure out is, what specifically changed this quarter? I mean, you've mentioned cooler expansion earlier in the call, but you've been expanding cooler-doors for years. So I guess what I'm trying to figure out specifically in 1Q, maybe what changed on the traffic front? Thanks.","Todd Vasos","Yes. So I think the best way to look at this is two things; number one, I mentioned earlier, this core consumer started to signal middle of last year that she was feeling a little bit more pressured, not feeling as robust as she did. So I would tell you that this core consumer, her shopping patterns are \u2013 and habits are changing a little bit, we're seeing it. And maybe moving more back to what we are used to seem with maybe not quite as a full basket and coming a little bit more often. Now, one quarter doesn't make a year, so we're going to continue to watch what she does. But in Q1, we saw some start of that normalization back to where this core customer normally is resonating at.","The other thing that I would tell you in Q1 specifically is the actions we took in Q4 promotionally to really solidify that customer in Q4 did exactly what we thought and brought forward that customer in a very sticky manner, if you will, the Q1 and she spent accordingly. So, we feel good about that initiatives in Q4, it did exactly what we thought in Q1. And I believe that was a big piece of why we only gave back half of that snap benefits that we pushed in the Q4 last year from that top line.","Scot Ciccarelli","Interesting. Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line \u2013 our final question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kelly Bania","Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Just wanted to ask another one about tariffs. It sounds like you did a lot of work there to mitigate that and do some substitutions. As I just was wondering if you can help us understand, how much price you expect to pass along? And maybe too early to tell from a competitive standpoint. But how do you think you performed on that mitigation strategy relative to competitors? And how much price do you think really we're going to see being passed through broadly?","Todd Vasos","As \u2013 again, you take a look at Dollar General, and again, we've been all along many, many years now. We re-ensure that we have the right price for our consumer. We watch the prices very, very closely here. But the only thing to keep in mind about Dollar General, I mentioned earlier is we don't have to carry everything, we're a limited skew assorted retailer. And we could make decisions based on a lot of different factors to include a price, meaning cost of goods, and we'll continue to do that, as we move through this \u2013 these tariffs.","I think our teams has done a great job to date. But I would tell you even through the first three lists if you will, we've seen in the marketplace the consumers paying a little bit more money across the board in the marketplace and with four looming out there which is probably the big \u2013 well not probably it is the biggest impact in list, I wouldn't have to assume the consumer is going to bear the brunt of some of this as well.","And so we're doing everything we can here at Dollar General to make sure we soften that blow, but again, the great thing is this model works so well in good times and not so good times. And if this consumer is having to pay more across the board at every retailer because of these tariffs, we\u2019ll stand ready to be able to \u2013 with open arms to take her in when she needs us most. And we're positioning ourselves for that as we move through 2019.","Kelly Bania","Okay, thanks. And maybe just to follow-up on the prior question about the stickiness and the promotional activity that you did last quarter. How do you expect that or do you expect that stickiness to continue to impact your consumer and the traffic patterns for the rest of the year?","Todd Vasos","What we see normally is that, that stickiness does stay with us for a couple of quarters. So we believe that we'll still see some benefit from that, as we move into a Q2, may not be quite as much as Q1, but again, we feel very good about where we are and our start to the fiscal year. So we feel that, that customer resonates very well with a price and value, we know that and we continue to offer that.","So even though that we've normalized the promotional activity, you've got to remember who Dollar General is and that is everyday little price on the shelf that she can count on and she sees that when she is in the store each and every day. So again, we feel very good about our competitiveness on price and we feel good about our both traffic and ticket, as we move into the second quarter and back half of this year.","Kelly Bania","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Todd Vasos","Thank you very much. And we hope to talk to you soon. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up question if necessary.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, Jennifer and welcome to everyone joining our call. I am pleased with our strong fourth quarter performance and the continued momentum we saw in the business. For the full year, we delivered healthy same-store sales growth driven by an increase in average transaction amount and positive traffic all while effectively balancing gross margin and exhibiting good underlying expense control.","During the year, we continued to make progress on the implementation of our key initiatives as we seek to capture growth opportunities over both the short and long-term. Our SG&A investments in 2017 were focused primarily on increased compensation structure and additional training for our store managers as they play a critical role in our customer\u2019s experience and the profitability of each store. We also continue to make proactive and targeted investments in support of key strategic initiatives that we believe will help further differentiate us from the competition over time. I will provide additional details on two of these initiatives pertaining to the digital and non-consumable strategies later in the call.","Now, let\u2019s recap some of the financial results for fiscal 2017. Full year net sales increased 6.8% to $23.5 billion compared to net sales of $22 billion in 2016. As a reminder, net sales for 2016 included $398.7 million from the 53rd week. When comparing our fiscal year net sales on a 52-week basis, the fiscal 2017 full year growth rate will be higher by approximately two percentage points.","Same-store sales for the year increased 2.7% over the prior year marking our 28th consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth. Same-store sales for the fourth quarter increased 3.3% over the prior year fourth quarter driven by positive performance in both our consumables and non-consumable categories with stronger growth in consumables. Our highly consumable market share trends in syndicated data continued to exhibit strength with mid to high single-digits share growth in both units and dollars over the 4-weeek, 12-weeek, 24-weeek and 52-week periods ending January 27, 2018. For the full year diluted EPS was $5.63 and adjusted diluted EPS was $4.49. Fourth quarter diluted EPS was $2.63 with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.48.","In 2017, we generated cash from operations of $1.8 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year while returning $863 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. We continued to deploy capital to invest in new stores, relocations and remodels, while continued to provide compelling returns. We also invested in infrastructure such as new distribution centers to support future growth. During the year, we celebrated the grand opening of our 14,000 store and opened a record 1,315 new stores which includes the acquisition of nearly 300 store sites in 2017. We also remodeled or relocated the combined 764 stores. In total we completed 2,079 real estate projects, exceeding our initial target of 1,900 total projects. We continue to be pleased with the returns and performance of our real estate program as our new stores are overall yielding returns of 20% even prior to the benefit of federal tax reform.","During the fourth quarter we completed the strategic review of our real estate portfolio, as a result we closed an incremental 35 underperforming stores, the majority of which were part of our mature store base or stores that we generally define as having been open 5 years or more. The decision to close stores is always difficult as it impacts our store associates and the communities we serve. Fortunately, we were able to place the majority of impacts in employees and direct customers to nearby locations. These 35 store closures resulted in an incremental pretax expense of approximately $28.3 million in the quarter or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily attributable to the remaining lease liability on these stores. Overall, we believe our real estate portfolio is in excellent shape and that these actions better position us for the future.","Within our distribution network, we completed our 15th distribution center in Jackson, Georgia and began shipping in October of 2017. During 2017, we started construction on both our 16th and 17th distribution centers in Longview, Texas and Amsterdam, New York. We expect to begin shipping from these locations in 2019. These investments are key to driving the efficiency and speed of our network to support our growing store base while reducing our stem miles. In his remarks, John will review our fiscal results for our \u2013 financial results for fiscal 2018 guidance including the benefits of federal tax reform on both. But at a high level, we anticipate a cash benefit of approximately $300 million in 2018 as a result of federal tax reform. Of this amount we expect $75 million in the business this year while returning the balance to shareholders through additional share repurchases and higher anticipated quarterly dividend.","As you know one of our ongoing priorities is to enhance our position as a low cost operator. We have a defined process to address spending that has allowed us to proactively improve our efficiencies and reduce expenses over time. And we are doing this while creating flexibility to reinvest savings to drive growth. We remain committed to this operating priority as well as continuing to make targeted strategic investments in the business for the long-term. In fiscal 2018, we anticipate these investments will primarily be focused on the acceleration of our long-term strategic initiatives as well as new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth.","Similar to 2017, our planned investments in 2018 are strategically aligned with our four ongoing operating priorities. Importantly, we believe we are seeing clear outcomes and benefits from our significant prior year investments, particularly in store manager compensation and training. We also believe that we remain well-positioned from both the wage and everyday low price perspective as we have been thoughtfully and proactively investing in these areas all along. As a result, we do not currently anticipate the need to invest heavily in those areas in 2018, which is reflected in our financial guidance for the coming year.","Regarding capital allocation, we continue to be disciplined and remain focused on financial returns and our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will focus first on investing in high return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividends, all while maintaining our current investment grade credit rating. In 2018, our capital spending is prioritized to new stores, remodels and relocations as well as to our two new distribution centers that are currently under construction. Additionally, we have plans to accelerate capital spending on select infrastructure projects and other key initiatives, which we expect to deliver high returns.","In summary, we have a long track record of investing in the business, including the significant investments we made in 2017. And while we continue to invest in the business for the short and long-term, we expect the majority of the cash benefit from federal tax reform will flow directly through to our earnings and to our shareholders in 2018. We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead.","With that, I will now turn the call over to John.","John Garratt","Thank you, Todd and good morning everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through the highlights of 2017, let me take you through some of the important financial details of the fiscal quarter and year. I will also spend some time discussing our 2018 guidance. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.1% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 43 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to higher initial inventory markets, lower inventory shrink and reduction in markdowns. Partially offsetting these items were a greater proportion of sales and consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than other product categories, sales of lower margin products comprising in higher proportion of consumable sales and increased transportation costs.","SG&A expense increased to 159 basis points over the 2016 fourth quarter to $1.3 billion or 21.9% of sales in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2016 was favorably impacted by higher net sales resulting from the fiscal 2016 53rd week. The 2017 fourth quarter\u2019s results reflect increased occupancy costs, increased retail labor expenses given our previously planned investment in store manager compensation and training and increased incentive compensation costs. We also recorded $28.3 million of additional pre-tax expense related to 35 incremental store closures in the quarter. Most of which were in the form of SG&A expense associated with the remaining lease liability on these stores. Partially offsetting these increased expenses was a reduction in advertising costs.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a benefit of 18.9% as compared to an expense of 36.8% in the fourth quarter last year. The reduction of the federal corporate tax rate due to federal tax reform resulted in a material positive impact on our effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter. This provisional benefit was primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet at the new lower federal corporate tax rate accompanied by benefits associated with a federal corporate tax rate for 2017 of 33.7% compared to 35% prior years. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.63. Excluding the $1.15 provisional benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.48. Both our fourth quarter reported and adjusted diluted EPS results include an approximate $0.09 provisional benefit due to the reduced federal corporate income tax rate for 2017. This $0.09 provisional benefit was largely offset by an approximate $0.07 charge from the 35 incremental store closures in the quarter.","Looking at a few items on our balance sheet and cash flow statement, merchandise inventories were $3.6 billion at fiscal 2017 year end, a slight increase of about 1.5% on a per store base. As we enter 2018, we believe our inventory is in great shape and are comfortable with the quality. Our longer term goal continues to be inventory growth in line with or below our sales growth. In 2017, we generated strong cash flow growth from operations totaling $1.8 billion, an increase of $197 million or 12% compared to the prior fiscal year. Total capital expenditures for the year were $646 million and included the majority of the cost of our Jackson, Georgia distribution center.","During the quarter, we have repurchased 3 million shares of our common stock for $281 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $70 million. For the full year, we returned cash to shareholders totaling $863 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividend. From December 2011 through the end of the 2017 fiscal year, we repurchased $5.1 billion or 81.4 million shares of our common stock. With today\u2019s announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization, we have remaining authorization of approximately $1.4 billion under the repurchase program.","Turning now to our guidance, for fiscal 2018 we anticipate net sales growth of approximately 9% and expect full year comp growth to be in the mid-2% range. As Scott mentioned earlier in 2018 we plan to accelerate investments in our long-term strategic initiatives. Despite these investments as well as headwinds from increasing wage rates and rising transportation costs, we anticipate our operating margin rate to be relatively unchanged as compared to fiscal 2017. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 is forecasted to be in the range of $5.95 to $6.15, our diluted EPS guidance assumes an estimated effective tax rate of 22% to 23% in 2018 which we expect will result in an incremental cash benefit of approximately $300 million for the year. We plan to invest $50 million to $75 million of our tax savings in the business this year, primarily in capital expenditures to accelerate our strategic initiatives such as digital and non-consumables and other high return projects. Overall, our capital spending in 2018 is expected to be in the range of $725 million to $800 million as we continued to invest in the business to drive and support future growth.","In terms of cash distributions to shareholders as we outlined in today\u2019s press release, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share, an increase of 12%. In fiscal 2018, we also plan to repurchase approximately $850 million of our common stock. In total, we expect to return over $1.1 billion to shareholders this year through the combination of share repurchases and anticipated quarterly dividend which represents an increase of more than $250 million compared to the prior year. As you model 2018, please keep in mind the following. Our record 1.315 new store openings in 2017 including acquired stores were weighted for the back half of the year and the ramp-up of the later opened stores is expected to pressure SG&A leverage at the beginning of the year. Additionally our investments in store management compensation training began in March of 2017 and this too is expected to pressure SG&A leverage in Q1 before we anniversary the investment from the prior year. Combined we expect these two items to result in an incremental impact of approximately 20 basis points of SG&A de-leverage as a percentage of sales in the first quarter.","As always we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent strong financial performance while positioning our business for long-term growth. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing operating priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.","With that I will turn the call back over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, John. As I have shared with you over the last several quarters, we are investing in and building momentum behind certain strategic initiatives that we believe will ultimately drive strong sales and profit growth in the years ahead. Today, I will provide an update on our digital and non-consumable initiatives which represents two of our more near-term strategic opportunities.","Starting with our digital initiatives, we are strategically investing in our business to help our customers utilize digital tools and resources for a more personalized and convenient in-store shopping experience, with nearly 75% of the U.S. population currently within 5 miles of a Dollar General, we have unique opportunity to help shape our customer\u2019s digital shopping behavior, all while leveraging our more than 14,500 brick-and-mortar stores to help them save time and money. Our efforts are all about making things easier for customers and further enhancing our strong value proposition providing a unique combination of value and convenience. Our insights indicate that our customers are utilizing digital more to plan their visits and lot more options on how they engage with us in store. These insights have helped to shape our digital strategy which we have accelerated.","Earlier this week, we launched a customer pilot of our new shop and scan mobile app service in select store locations. This mobile app allows customers to scan items while they shop and pay directly with their phones allowing for a faster and easier checkout experience. Not only does shop and scan help customers save time, it also makes staying on budget easier. Customers can see the price of individual items as they scan them along with a running total. In 2018, we have plans to expand this service to additional stores as we continue to enhance our overall value proposition for our consumers. We see continued opportunity to improve engagement and build loyalty to further integration of our traditional and digital media mix. We continue to develop resources to personalize offerings such as digital coupons tailored for individual customers and personalized marketing campaigns, which will enable our customers to save even more time and money. Looking ahead, we plan to add more digital tools and services to provide our customers with even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experiences. With the introduction of shop and scan and over 900 million digital coupons clipped in 2017 by our more than 12 million digital coupon subscriber accounts, we know we have a great foundation on which to build for the future.","Turning to our non-consumable initiative, in 2018, we plan to test a bold, new and expanded assortment in key categories. Our plans include enhancing the treasure hunt experience by Dollar General by first offering a new differentiated and limited assortment that will change throughout the year; second, displaying the new offering in high-traffic areas to enhance the in-store experience and create a sense of purchase urgency; and third, continue to deliver exceptional value by price in the majority of our offerings at $5 or below. While we are expanding our assortment in select categories, the space currently dedicated to non-consumables within our stores is expected to remain the same. We will initially test these changes in approximately 700 store locations as we look to further compliment our strong and growing consumable business. We are excited about our plans and believe we are well-positioned to capture market share in a changing retail landscape.","As we execute these growth initiatives, we remain committed to our ongoing operating priorities: first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. Our first operating priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth with the focus on driving both the top and bottom line. Our goal is to both attract and grow new customers and trips and to capture additional share with existing customers. This includes expanding our merchandising initiatives, which are designed to provide our customers with trusted simple solutions to help them manage their household budgets and provide them with their everyday needs and even more value.","In store for 2018, we plan to redesign our snack and beverage isles to create a best in retail shopping experience. This change should enhance customer awareness and further position us as a destination retailer for media consumption shop through assortment and everyday low prices. Across the select group of stores we will be introducing an expanded assortment of better for you products with a focus on higher protein and lower salt choices at price points that will be attractive to our customers. We will also continue to strategically invest in our mature store base. We are particularly focused on remodeling stores that have fewer than 12 cooler doors, which in relative terms are expected to drive the highest returns upon remodel. By the end of fiscal 2018, we anticipate that across our store base we will have an average of 20 cooler doors up from 10 in 2012. In total, we expect to install over 20,000 additional cooler doors across our mature store base this year as we continue to build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales.","Following the success of our health and beauty expansion of 2017, we are launching Phase 2 of this initiative. In 2018, we plan to drive overall category awareness with our customers through improved and more impactful displays, consistent messaging in-store as well as across print and digital media, enhance quality perception and superior shopability. We see significant runway for this category, particularly given our price advantage relative to some other channels. The expansion of private label offerings with a focus on value, quality and appealing packaging will continue to play a role in our category management process in 2018. We know that private brands resonate with our consumer as we deliver the right combination of price and quality.","Given the significant price gap compared to national brands and other channels, private brands play an important role in helping our customers stretch their budgets. We have additional ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion that includes improvements in strength, global sourcing, distribution and transportation efficiencies as well as private brand and non-consumable sales. Inventory shrink reduction continues to be a large opportunity within gross margin.","In addition to other defensive merchandising tactics, leveraging technology and improving process controls, we plan to expand electronic article surveillance, or EAS, to an incremental 5,000 stores in 2018 bringing the total stores with EAS to about 10,000 locations. This is a proven high return project for us to help further reduce strength and drive sales by improving on-shelf availability. While we have seen carrier rates and fuel cost on the rise, our ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce expenses are expected to help mitigate these costs in 2018. Some of our ongoing initiatives include further reductions in stem miles, better optimization of our loads and the expansion of our private fleet to around 210 tractors by year end up from 80 tractors at the end of 2017. Our goal is to ensure we are highly relevant with our customers through ongoing investments in everyday low prices and targeted promotional activity. Importantly, our pricing surveys continued to indicate Dollar General is well-positioned from a price perspective against all classes of trade and across all geographic regions, where we operate. We are committed to being price right everyday for our customers to drive traffic to our stores.","Our focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities is our second priority. We have a proven high return, low risk model for our real estate growth. Our flexible real estate model allows us the ability to invest in new store growth enter new markets, deliver new formats and reinvest in our mature store base. We constantly monitor new store productivity and returns to ensure new store growth is the best use of our capital focusing on the following five metrics. First, new store productivity as a percent of our comp store sales; second, actual sales performance compared to our pro forma model; third, average returns of 20% to 22%, which is an increase compared to our prior target of 18% to 20% due to the benefit of federal tax reform; fourth, cannibalization of our new stores on our comp store base; and finally, a payback period of less than 2 years.","We continue to be very pleased with the overall returns on our new stores as we remain committed to investing our capital effectively to drive strong financial returns. For 2018, we expect to open 900 new stores, remodel a 1,000 of our mature store locations and relocate approximately 100 stores. That\u2019s about 2,000 projects in total as we continue to deploy capital to these high return investments.","Of the 1,000 planned store remodels for 2018, we expect approximately 400 locations to be in the Dollar General traditional plus format bringing the total traditional plus store count to about 750 by year end. These remodels incorporate a cooler set of 34 doors for increased perishable selection. Our cooler door expansion has proven to drive baskets and trips with our existing customer base, while also attracting new customers with an expanded offering. Additionally, across about a third of these locations, we are including an assortment of fresh produce bringing the total number of Dollar General stores, with produce to around 450 by year end. While it\u2019s still early prior year traditional plus remodels are yielding strong same-store sales results. The ability to offer produce, particularly in areas with limited grocery availability represents an attractive growth opportunity for Dollar General in the years ahead.","Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending. All of our spending is filtered through three criteria: first is a customer-facing; second, those that align with our strategic priorities, and third, how does it impact our risk profile. At the store level, our operational initiatives for 2018 are centered on space optimization and ongoing efforts to simplify our operation by reducing unproductive inventory, operating complexity and product movement within the stores. These actions are designed to control cost and allow our store managers and their teams to invest time savings to provide better customer service as well as fast, clean and in-stock shopping experience.","We also have a continued focus on improving the speed of checkout with the goal of reducing transaction time by an average of 3 seconds. To put this in perspective, a reduction of 3 seconds on each of our nearly 2 billion annual customer transactions would result in over 1.6 million hours in additional time savings for our store teams each year. These time savings can be reinvested by our store managers to deliver a higher level of customer service, which ultimately helps to improve sales. To advance our objective of reducing transaction times, in addition to our shop and scan offering, we are establishing optimal transaction times for each store based on individual store attributes.","We are also tracking customer satisfaction scores at the individual employee level, which increases accountability and creates opportunities for employee recognition. Our ability to drive execution across our large and growing store base is a key strength of Dollar General. At the store support center, work elimination and process improvement are ongoing efforts to take cost out of the business. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, control expenses and always seek to be a low-cost operator.","Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage. We believe the significant investment in store manager compensation and training we made in 2017 is paying off as we experienced our lowest level of store manager turnover in 5 years. And for the first time in several years, we are seeing a reduction in both a system manager and store associate turnover. Importantly, the reduction in store level employee turnover, are accompanied by an increase in both store manager and hourly applicant flow, which is up substantially over the same prior year. These results further support our belief we continue to be well positioned from a wage perspective. And since we have already made wage investments, we can use the vast majority of the benefit from tax reform to invest in other areas of the business and return additional cash to shareholders. We will continue to monitor the environment and invest as needed to ensure we remain competitive in the labor market.","For the seventh consecutive year, Dollar General was named at Training Magazine\u2019s top 125 training list ranking in the overall top five in the highest ranked major retailer on their most recent 2018 list, which represents our highest ranking to-date. We are proud of our 10,000 plus store managers who have been internally promoted and are excited about how engaged our work force is across the business. I believe this has helped to contribute to our improvement in overall customer satisfaction scores, which continued to improve throughout 2017 and ended at their highest level of the year. In 2018, we will continue to invest in our employees and remain committed to providing attractive career growth opportunities. As we announced last week, we are extending paid parental leave benefits and provided adoption assistance for eligible employees throughout the company. Additionally, we plan to create over 7,000 new jobs as a result of our 900 planned new store openings. We are confident that we remain in a leadership position to attract and retain the right talent and we will continue to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage.","In closing, we are cautiously optimistic about economic conditions. It is always challenging for our core customer, so regardless of the economic outlook for our consumer, our goal is to do everything we can to provide her with a great shopping experience and to deliver the value and convenience she expects from Dollar General. I want to thank each of our nearly 130,000 employees across the company for all their hard work and dedication for fulfilling our mission of serving others. As a team, we look forward to 2018 as we build on our strong performance from 2017.","With that Jennifer, we would now like to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Vinny Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Todd Vasos","Hi Vinny.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Michael on for Vinny. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask actually about that reinvestment rate which I think obviously at around 20%, 25%, so that rate is maybe bit on the lower side compared to some of your peers in retail and obviously you guys have been way ahead of the curve with investments in stores and labor, just wondering kind of about the thought process, how you came to that number and then also is that kind of all incremental spending or kind of pull forward of future kind of planned investments?","John Garratt","Yes. So as Todd mentioned, as we come into the year because we have been proactively investing all along, we feel we are in a great spot. When you look at the investment we made last year in store manage \u2013 store manager base performing as we expected, as we see higher applicant flow, higher staffing levels, lower turnover and we are seeing the financial benefits of that with better customer satisfaction, better sales and to start see the lower shrink, we are well positioned also on pricing. So as you look at those areas, we feel we are well positioned. We really saw this as an opportunity to continue to accelerate strategic initiatives in high return projects. So in addition as you look at how we are breaking that down this year in addition to investing in 2000 real estate projects, both the high return new stores as well as the remodels with additional cooler capacity which is driving great sales benefits and the supporting infrastructure, we see an ability to accelerate the strategic initiatives Todd mentioned digital and non-consumables to mention two of them and other high return projects like EAS which is helping us so much with shrink, expanding our private fleet to help mitigate risks around transportation costs and LED lighting which help to save utility costs. So we see lot of opportunities to accelerate these, help the business and feel we are very well positioned and comfortable with the allocation here, real assets to return a considerable amount of money back to the shareholders in the form of competitive dividend and share repurchases.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks. Actually just a quick follow-up on kind of you just mentioned about the kind of increasing transportation cost, one of you can maybe quantify that or if you kind of what you see the cadence of that, had when looking kind of going through 2018?","Todd Vasos","Yes. We didn\u2019t quantify the impact of that, but you know what I would well tell you as you look at our guidance for the year around overall operating margin that is factored in and that is one of the key headwinds that we are overcoming, but still we see ourselves in a position to despite headwinds like that and the invest \u2013 targeted investments we talk about keep our operating margin rates level. We have offset within that and within gross margin overall. The good thing is there is a lot of levers within gross margins. Within transportation costs, as we mentioned we are looking \u2013 we are reducing stem miles, we are optimizing our loads, we are expanding our private fleet to help mitigate that as well as other productivity initiatives in the distribution center. And then of course we have other levels with \u2013 levers within gross margin such as shrink, we are very pleased with shrink performance there five consecutive quarters of shrink improvement as the process improvement, store management pay and the investments we have made to payoff and the team does a phenomenal job on our product category management and see continued opportunity to expand private label penetration or in-sourcing penetration as well as grow our non-consumables. So, we see a lot of opportunities to help offset that pressure.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks so much, very helpful.","Operator","Your next question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Robby Ohmes","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Actually there is two of them, the first was just you guys in the press release called out the traffic comp was slightly negative and if I recall it was \u2013 I think it was accelerating in the third quarter, I was hoping you could maybe tell us was there a change in trend in the fourth quarter or maybe you have discussed that with us a little bit?","Todd Vasos","Sure. As you look at the \u2013 at the fourth quarter, we strategically look year-over-year on a promotional activity. The main driver of the little bit of the slowdown that we saw in traffic was really a little bit of a pullback in our promotional activity. And quite frankly, it was in one big promotion that we ran the year prior in November leading into the banking season before Thanksgiving. So when you factor that in and then our position that will continue to work all levers and deliver profitable sales growth, we saw a little bit of a slowdown there, but again it was intentional and quite frankly not completely unplanned. So we feel good about the long-term prospects of driving traffic. As we look at our 2018 initiatives they are as robust as ever. And I would tell you that I am very excited about our strategic initiatives and with especially the two that I outlined in the call today to help continue to drive that traffic for many years to come.","Robby Ohmes","Thanks. And just the other question was in the fourth quarter maybe \u2013 excuse me, maybe it\u2019s related to the pullback in the promo activity, but I was curious where you are seeing less markdowns in the fourth quarter versus last year?","John Garratt","Yes. It really stems from the promotional activity. We have gotten very targeted on the promotional activity and as particularly as we see the headwinds is and the initiatives performing well it\u2019s been very targeted around our markdown.","Robby Ohmes","Got it. Thanks guys. That\u2019s really helpful.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Todd Vasos","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Mushkin","So wanted to talk about \u2013 good morning, I want to talk about your sales, I think you guys are guiding to the mid-2s in relation to kind of all the initiatives you have going and what looks like probably a little bit stronger inflation backdrop. And I just wanted to see are you kind of being conservative there, I mean just trying to gauge it seems like every company is baking in additional costs related to the tax, but no one is really talking too much about sales, I was wondering if you could give us how are things going and what are your thinking that mid to guide?","Todd Vasos","We are squarely focused on driving the top line. And we believe over the long-term 2% plus is definitely where we can drive. And the 2.5% that we are guiding to is our best estimate at this point as we look for the whole year. Saying that, we always strive, we are retailers, we always strive for more and we will continue to drive that top line and again balance that with profitable sales growth at the same time. So stay tuned, but as I said earlier, I am very encouraged in our 2018 shorter term initiatives as well as those longer term initiatives to sustain a nice comp as we move out into \u2013 into the future quarters and years. So stay tuned, but I can tell you that our merchant team is squarely focused on driving as much comp as we possibly can as we move through 2018.","Scott Mushkin","So my follow-up question along the same lines, I know you guys are expanding health and beauty care as one of the key initiatives and of course treasure hunt, I was wondering if you could actually size a little bit for us the health and beauty care expansion, how many stores this year will be \u2013 have the larger set and then on the treasure hunt, I think you said 700 stores, when does that start, could you size it from an SKU perspective?","Todd Vasos","Sure. I will try to size it up. On the health and beauty front, this is the second year of this initiative. And this initiative really goes across the majority of almost not all of our stores. It will touch pretty much all of them as we move through 2018. We have a unique position here. We have created a very nice niche for ourselves for our consumers in both health and beauty, especially on that health side of the equation. And I can tell you that our prices are very, very favorable compared to other classes of trade there. And our private brand penetration is amongst the strongest in some of those categories that we see across all of our categories that we have private brands in. So it\u2019s going to be an issue that will touch all stores. As we look at our longer term initiative of the non-consumable initiative you mentioned the 700 stores, that initiative will kick off middle of the year and we will continue to put stores in as we move towards Q3 as well. But as we continued to see momentum in that which we anticipate, we will be able to take pieces of that initiative early on and start to implement them in the chain itself as we start to see things start to materialize in a real positive way, again which we anticipate seeing. I could tell you on a SKU basis, there will be hundreds of new SKUs that will be in this is a whole different way of going about our non-consumable business. And I think it\u2019s very smart, because as you look at the how the consumer is shopping today. And you know it\u2019s pretty well, we have always been on the forefront of changing as the consumer changes. She is looking for more of a treasure hunt. She is looking for something new and unique in her shopping experience, especially as it relates to non-consumable. And we believe that this will deliver exactly what she is looking for, so stay tuned more to come. We will tell you as time goes how that initiative is progressing. But we are looking for some big things out of this as we move forward.","Scott Mushkin","Alright. Perfect, you just made \u2013 a bunch of more questions come to my head, but I will yield there is a lot of people on the call. Thanks very much.","Todd Vasos","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson.","Greg Melich","Hi. Thanks guys. I just want to follow-up on gross margins, you mentioned some of the drivers that could help this year going forward of private label foreign sourcing, could you give us an update on where you are right now percentage of volume or sales of this private label and also what the import percentage is and call out China in particular especially what you might do if the there are some of the points [ph]? Thanks.","Todd Vasos","Sure. On our private brands, we continued to see penetration rates between the 22 and 24 percentage points. And that\u2019s overall some category is much higher than that obviously. But we still see it right in that wheelhouse and we feel good about that amount of percentage. We are always looking to increase that. And again I think as we look at 2018 the initiatives around private brands are strong as I have seen them in in the last couple 3 years. So we feel good about mill to add to that. As far as global sourcing is looking at, we still believe we have got somewhere in that $4 billion to $5 billion opportunity on a cost of good basis to bring more goods in through our foreign sourcing efforts. We like most are still predominantly China centric. I wouldn\u2019t say all, but I could tell you that over the last 3 years, our reach into other countries has grown tremendously and we are now in double digits in the amount of countries that we actually export out of. And that will continue to grow over time, because we see the opportunity to move some of the goods out of China into other areas that have a very competitive price and have the infrastructure available to meet our needs and to get the goods over here on a timely basis. So more to come there, but I can tell you that our global sourcing folks are squarely focused on moving the needle on our percentage and on the amount that we bring into the country.","Greg Melich","That\u2019s great thanks a lot.","Todd Vasos","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Todd, can you give us \u2013 can you quantify what you resumed for an average wage rate, maybe an average fuel price into your guidance. I think there is going to be a lot of debate as the year progresses if you see the wage environment speed up and diesel prices start to put more pressure on your transportation costs. Might you have to make some additional investments above and beyond what you have originally planned for, so it would be helpful to kind of help frame that?","Todd Vasos","Yes. As we look in 2018 and our guidance reflects what our current thoughts are and where we think the business is headed, we feel very good about where we are on wages today. When you look at the investments that we made last year in our store managers and by the way the investments we made last year even in our hourly rates, not only the 16 to 18 states and municipalities that mandated a different rate, but also to stay competitive in certain markets, we have off the rates across where we feel that we have been able to manage those very well and we believe we can manage that in 2018 very well. Our applicant flow is at the highest that we have seen in many years and with our turnover being down and the lowest rate that we have seen in last 5 years we feel very, very confident and very competitive in our wage structure and rates and be able to staff our stores appropriately. So right now, we don\u2019t see a large need to invest heavily, but we will always invest where we believe we think we need to continue to stay competitive. As we look at gross margin especially as you indicated with fuel prices on the rise and the carrier rates on the rise. Our team has done a great job in supply chain over the years in anticipating, because let\u2019s admit it, fuel prices overall while up recently they are still not at their highs that they were a few years ago. We know that fuel rates are going to rise and our teams have been always proactive about ways to mitigate those fuel cost rises and the team is really doing a nice job. Now, we are not going to be able to mitigate all of it, but a portion of it. And then again with our private fleet and the expansion of that we feel that taking advantage of the private fleet will also give us a distinct advantage in some of these carrier rate increases that we are seeing. So more to come, but again in our guidance, we feel that we have nailed it pretty good right now, but like we always say, we always reserve the right to invest where we need to whether it be pricing, whether it be wages or others to continue to drive this business.","Michael Lasser","That\u2019s very well. And I have one follow-up on your guidance you are looking for a mid 2% comp this year that would represent a slowdown from what you saw in 2017 on a full year basis, despite the fact that last year you were dragged down by deflation and some of the changes to the SNAP program. Why wouldn\u2019t this year be better than last year, particularly as you see traction with some of your initiatives?","John Garratt","As I mentioned earlier and you look at our comp, we are very happy where comp came in, in Q4. And as we look to 2018, we gave our best estimates to what we have thought full year \u201818 is going to look like, but again where retailers and arguably we are one of the best out there driving that top line and balancing the margin components of that as well. So, we will continue to try to strike that fine balance, but we will always try to drive at a higher comp as we move through the year.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Thank you so much and good luck.","John Garratt","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning. Regarding SG&A overall you highlighted I believe 20 basis points of deleverage in 1Q and you called out occupancy and still needing to lap the store manager compensation increase from last year as the factors driving that. So should we assume more flattish levels of SG&A rate as we move through the balance of the year and specific to 1Q are there enough \u2013 or gross margin tailwinds to more than offset that aforementioned 1Q SG&A headwind?","John Garratt","Yes. So as we mentioned in our call in Q4 and going into Q1 there was some noise putting short-term pressure on our SG&A, but the way we look at our goal remains to leverage SG&A at a sales comp of 2.5% to 3% over time. As we indicated in our guidance, we really look at operating margin overall, looking to manage all the levers within both gross margin and SG&A. Team does a great job of making the right trade-offs there. And as we said in our guidance, we see that overall being even for the year and we do see as we work through some of the noise of Q4 in the first half of Q1 SG&A normalizing.","Paul Trussell","And on the gross margin for 1Q?","John Garratt","Yes. So we didn\u2019t call anything specifically around gross margin, but we will just say again we focus on the long-term and making the right trade-offs. But again in our guidance for the year when we look at the two in total we see our ability to keep that rate even with last year, while making target investments offsetting some headwinds with all the levers at our disposal we feel comfortable with the guidance we provided.","Paul Trussell","Fair enough. And then lastly for me, just circling back to same-store sales, just want to be clear on what drove the strength in ticket in 4Q, it certainly sounds like there is a little bit less of promotions and also had some markups, but it\u2019s still a big number if you can touch on that. And then just going forward as we think about same-store sales in 2018, do you have an expectation that traffic in the home and apparel categories will positively contribute?","Todd Vasos","So as you look at our sales, we were very pleased as you indicated we came out with a very strong comp in Q4 and that was primarily driven by our initiatives. And those initiatives will continue to carry on as we move into the first half of this year when you couple that with our new initiatives in 2018 that\u2019s what gives us the confidence as we move into \u201818 in that 2.5 plus range. So I think it\u2019s really everything that we have always done here and that is having strong initiatives leading into the year and then leveraging those as we move through the fiscal year. I see it no different for 2018. And then as you look at it, it was really comprised of those initiatives. Inflation actually was very flattish if not down a little bit in Q4 for us. So it really wasn\u2019t inflation that drove that. And then when you look at the transactions as well as the traffic, when you look at transactions, we have been doing a lot to move the needle on getting a fuller shop for our consumer. While we are still very convenient base and it\u2019s definitely a fill in shop have been able to pick up an additional item through our offering is starting to payoff. And we are seeing that within our numbers. And she has been able to do a little bit of a fuller shop as she comes to us. You couple that ability with a little bit extra money in her pocket that she has and that\u2019s usually a winning combination.","Paul Trussell","That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you. Best of luck.","Todd Vasos","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question will come from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys. This is [indiscernible] on for John. So the strength in traffic generating categories seems like it\u2019s not really translating into the sale of more discretionary items, so I was just wondering is that a function of merchandise content value or execution and is this something that you guys expect from your strategic initiatives, from a treasure hunt to help drive?","Todd Vasos","As you look at our non-consumable business, we always have said that consumables will drive the traffic and will round out the basket with the non-consumable goods. And that played out in seasonal, but didn\u2019t play out in the couple of the other areas in Q4. And that\u2019s where we are squarely focused both in our short-term initiatives leading into 2018, but also those longer term initiatives that non-consumable initiative that I talked about. It could \u2013 it could really have the juice, it really move the needle long-term as we move through \u201818 and then into \u201819 because of the different type of a shop that we are really moving after in non-consumables. Always remember the consumer changes and her preferences change over time. And we retailers that recognize that quickly as Dollar General does and then moves quickly as we do can take advantage of that and that\u2019s exactly what we are doing over 2018 and then moving into long-term \u201819 and \u201820 we believe we are positioning ourselves well to capitalize.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you. And then as a quick follow-up initial productivity seemed to fall a little bit in the quarter kind of relative to historical levels, can you talk a little about that and then what might be driving I guess the implied step up a little bit in 2018 in terms of the implied productivity? Thanks.","Todd Vasos","Well, we continue \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen material change in the performance of the stores. As we have said before, we follow a basket of metrics. We continue to see the new store productivity in that 80% to 85% range, continue to see the stores sales and returns perform as hoped, continue to see our returns at the high end of the 18% to 20% range and that was the benefit of tax reform that would be more like a 22% continue to see a quick payback, continue to see cannibalization as expected relatively level in less than one would expect just given the proximity of the shop, so we feel great about the performance of the new stores and are very excited about that full pipeline of 900 stores will open this year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great.

Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference.","Mary Pilkington","Thank you, Hope, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Vasos, our COO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions.

You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Last week we had very exciting news announcing that Todd Vasos would be the next CEO of Dollar General. Todd will be an excellent CEO and I believe a great future lies ahead for Dollar General under his leadership.","I have worked side-by-side with Todd for many years, and I know firsthand his ability to be both strategic and tactical to not only visualize success but put together the right team with the right strategy to make account.","At Dollar General, I have loved our spirit of service and our passion for taking care of our customers, helping our employees grow and giving back to our community.","Working this team has been incredibly rewarding and although this will be my last earnings conference call, I am excited to have the opportunity to remain as Chairman until the end of the fiscal year to support Todd as we drive the business.","With that, let's now turn to our results for the first quarter of 2015. This quarter is a very good start to the New Year, as we look to capitalize on the numerous opportunities ahead of us. Let's recap some of the highlights of the first quarter of 2015.","First quarter sales increased 8.8% to $4.9 billion. We delivered same-store sales growth of 3.7% for the quarter. Overall, we were pleased with the sales of cadence for the quarter particularly in the light of the Easter Holiday shift to earlier in the year.","In the quarter same-store sales growth was balanced across both consumables and non-consumables. The non-consumable categories have now had five consecutive quarters of improvement, with seasonal, apparel and home, all comping positive in the first quarter.","I am pleased with the progress we have made in our non-consumable categories. For the 29th consecutive quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket.","Gross margin expanded by 45 basis points to 30.5%, which is our first margin expansion in nine quarters. From a timing perspective, this generally coincides with our launch of tobacco in early of 2013.","Net income for the first quarter increased 14% to $253 million. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $0.84.","In the first quarter the negative financial impact from the West Coast port slow down was not as great as we anticipated. Due to the diligent work across both our supply chain and merchandizing teams, we successfully mitigated the expected drag to sales and gross margin we had projected at the time of the fourth quarter call.","During the quarter, we returned $600 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 7.1 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. Given our performance in the first quarter, we are maintaining our sales and earnings guidance for the year.","We are constantly striving to fill the needs and meet the changing demands of our customers. As we entered the year, I shared with you that we were cautiously optimistic for our core customer, as there appear to be potential for tailwind to outweigh the headwinds for macro trends.","Even as gas prices have moved up from the recent lows year-over-year, gas prices are still off about a dollar a gallon or down nearly 30% from last year's peak. Recent economic news includes unemployment claims falling to their lowest level in 15 years with many economists believing that the U.S. is approaching full employment.","So while this is encouraging news, our core customers are still struggling to stretch their household budget. Historically, our core customer is often a first to feel the negative effects when the economy weakens, and she lags a benefiting from improvements in the economy.","As always, we will continue to look for ways to provide our customers with the everyday low prices that they can count on from Dollar General.","Now I'd like turn the call over to Todd to talk about our operating initiatives for 2015.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, Rick. Let me first say how excited and honored I'm to have the privilege to lead Dollar General. I am grateful that Rick will remain as Chairman as his guidance and counsel will be incredibly valuable to me.","Turning to the first quarter, we have made notable progress against our key initiatives for 2015. We continue to grow transactions and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced consistent mid to high single digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4, 12, 24, and 52 week periods.","As we share with you last quarter, we are on track to make targeted labor investments to grow market share in a competitive environment while providing for positive financial returns. Currently, we are in the midst of rolling out these selective labor investments in phases.","We have three phases within the program. Our Phase 1 source are now receiving the incremental labor investments. The store operations team has specific metrics and time-table for determining the financial return criteria for achieving results based on a similar 2014 test in loan program.","Our 2014 test and loan stores continue to show improvement across performance metric such as sales, shrink, in-stock which are all very encouraging. The great part of this initiative is that we can be nimble in making adjustments to the model as appropriate.","Based on the 2014 test results, and the early results of Phase I, we are very encouraged by our progress. We anticipate rolling this investment to the Phase II and Phase III stores in the second half of the year.","The labor hour investment in this select group of stores is designed to ensure, we deliver on our consumer expectations in more competitive markets with product in stock and a convenient shopping experience. Our goal is to reduce the truck to shelf time for merchandising the stores, further supporting our goal to providing our consumer with the right product at the right time and at the right price.","The second investment in labor comes from the realignment of our store operations management structure to optimize the scale of our divisions, regions and districts to improve accountability and maximize mentorship and teamwork all while driving stronger, more sustainable results.","By reducing the average number of stores per district and optimizing their scale, we have reduced the time, our district managers spend driving, so they can invest more time mentoring and coaching our store managers on developing and strengthening their teams.","These changes have been in place since February while as still early our operational structure is better reliant for our field leaders to focus on store standards and ultimately create a better and more consistent shopping experience for our consumers. Our expectation is that, overtime this should help both our consumer satisfaction and our store manager turnover.","In addition over the last several months, we have been testing a number of inventory management initiatives. For example, a new sky shelf program has been rolled out across the third of the chain to allow for the placement of inventory directly above respective categories. This allows our teams to get product out of the back room to facilitate improve stocking and ultimately drive labor efficiencies.","To-date, we are pleased with the test results and are planning on expanding the sky shelf program chain wide. We expect the roll-out to be completed by the third quarter of 2015.","On a combined basis, we believe these labor investments and inventory management initiatives are significant steps to improving our in-stock position which is critical component of our overall consumer satisfaction and a driver of sales performance.","On the merchandizing front, we had balanced same-store sales growth across all categories in the first quarters. Strength in consumables was driven by tobacco, perishable, healthcare and candy and snacks.","In addition, we had broad based strength across apparel with our ladies, men's and boy's, infants and shoes continuing to exhibit strong performance with all these department comping inline or above the company average.","Seasonal and home comps trends were very encouraging as well. Affordability is playing a key role as we look to expands skews across the store at our sweet spot of $1 to $5. For the first quarter, nearly 50% of our consumer's baskets contained at least one item priced at a dollar.","Our fast way to save digital coupon program is growing, signups are increasing and as we exited the quarter, our redemption rate for digital coupons continue to improve. During the quarter we executed our fast way to save spring in the savings event, which had strong activity for the program, measured on a weekly basis redemptions, trips and signups by consumers all improved during this promotion.","In addition, sales of participating items significantly outpaced respective categories and our overall comp sales. We have embarked on the next phase of our offering by providing personalized coupons for our consumer's based on their purchase behavior. We are able to use data captured from this program like a loyalty card but without the incremental cost.","For instance, we plan to use these insights from a consumer shopping trip to customized individual promotions, which we believe will ultimately drive incremental trips and larger baskets. The data we gather also allows us to target media to these consumers in order to reach them more effectively and efficiently.","Shrink improvement has been and continues to be one of our largest gross margin opportunities. We remain committed to reducing our shrink at store level. For the quarter, we are very pleased with our shrink improvement. The progress is broad based with 19 of our 24 product departments showing improvement.","For store inventories performed so far this year, approximately 70% of our regions also improved year-over-year. Going forward, our teams continue to be focus on leveraging our defensive merchandising tools, technology and training to reduce shrink.","In order to enhance our productivity gains, we are once again elevating the category management process. We are optimizing all areas of the store beyond the planograms to include all-shelf and end cap displays.","Additionally, we are collaborating with our vendor partners through our joint business planning process to develop our merchandising plans and activities even further out on the calendar to enhance our consumer shopping experience.","Over the last several years, we have made significant strides in the productivity of our planograms through skew selection and ongoing refinement. Our affordability philosophy is fully ingrained in our category management process.","As a result, we have established a strong foundation of planograms that we can redefine periodically. We are concentrated on simplifying worker store at the store by reducing the complexity of planogram resets in capturing labor saving that can be reinvested.","At Dollar General, the real estate model is disciplined and focused on financial returns. We continue to see new store productivity at around 85% of our comp based, all while driving strong returns. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2015, as our pipeline is full.","The Dollar General stores in our three new states of Maine, Rhode Island and Oregon are off to a good start and their sales performance continues to accelerate. We have driven down the capital investments required for remodels, while also driving strong sales list of 4% to 5% and an improved return on investment an excess of 200 basis points.","The real estate team is well on its way in building the pipeline for 2016. The planned growth in selling square feet of approximately 7% translates to approximately 900 new store openings. Our development pipeline is nearly 50% complete for planned 2016 store openings.","We have released additional strategic trade areas to our real estate team and our experience increased deal velocity. We have a strong track record of delivering exceptional returns in our new store program and are confident in our model going forward.","In today's environment, we are extremely focused on doing everything we can to provide our customers with the value and convenience, they expect from Dollar General. We continue to be committed as ever to providing our consumers with the everyday low price they know and trust.","Now David will share a more detailed review of our first quarter financial performance and our outlook.","David Tehle","Thank you, Todd, and good morning everyone. Rick and Todd have taken you through the highlights of our first quarter in many of our strategic initiatives. So I\u2019ll share more details on the rest of the financial results starting with gross profit.","Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.5 billion or 30.5% of sales, an increase of 45 basis points from last year's first quarter. As compared to the prior year, the most significant drivers were higher initial inventory markups, better inventory shrink performance and lower transportation cost.","SG&A expense increased by 13 basis points over the 2014 period to $1.1 billion or 21.8% of sales in the first quarter. The majority of the SG&A increase was due primarily to higher incentive compensation, advertising cost and repairs and maintenance. Partially offsetting these items were increased cash back related convenience fees. Our tax rate for the quarter was generally flat to last year at 37.7%.","Moving out to our balance sheet and cash flow, at quarter end merchandised inventories were $2.8 billion up 9% in total and 3% on a per store basis. We generated cash from options of $344 million in the quarter, an increase of $92 million compared to the first quarter of 2014.","During the quarter we repurchased $7.1 million share of our common stock for $535 million. We also paid our first dividend of $0.22 per common share outstanding totaling $66 million.","Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we have repurchased over $2.8 billion of our common stock, we currently have a remaining authorization of approximately $689 million.","We remain committed through our disciplined capital allocation strategy, we aim to create lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases all well maintaining our investment grade ratings and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately three times adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR.","Now turning to guidance, looking forward, we continue to expect top line sales for 2015 to increase 8% to 9%. Overall selling square footage is expected to grow approximately 6% and same-store sales are expected to increase by 3% to 3.5%. We also continue to expect operating profit growth to be in the range of 7% to 9% over adjusted 2014 operating profit.","Our expectation for diluted earnings per share remains $3.85 to $3.95 for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million.","For the year, we plan to open approximately 730 new stores and relocate or remodel 875 stores, further we plan to open approximately 900 stores in 2016, consistent with our plans as we enter the year, we would expect stronger growth rates in the first half of 2015 given that our labs are most challenging in the second half of the year.","As our long-term track record demonstrates, Dollar General is well positioned to serve our customers in a wide variety of economic condition and in turn deliver strong results for our shareholders over time.","With that, I would like to turn the call back to Rick.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you, David. As this is our last earnings call together please accept my many thanks for your friendship and business partnership. What you\u2019ve done over your career at Dollar General has been significant from taking the company private in 2007 to return to the public market in 2009.","You\u2019ve been instrumental in transforming Dollar General and in fuelling and in fuelling our impressive growth. For all of us Dollar General, thank you for all you done for over the last 11 years. Our long-term commitment to growth in shareholder value are unchanged even as the competitive landscape continues to evolve, we had a business model that is proven and resilient.","Our business generate significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and dividends, to all of the 109,000 Dollar General employees that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our customers with continued value and service everyday please accept my appreciation and thanks.","With that, Mary Winn we would now like to open up the call for Todd and David for questions.","Mary Pilkington","Okay we will take the first caller please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning and congrats Todd, and also congrats to you on the successful transition Rick and David. So just want to talk about cadence. Rick, you spoke to being pleased with the sales cadence. Could you please help us understand how you started and ended the period from a same-store sales standpoint? And quantify any impact from any one-off headwinds such as the earlier Easter, whether there was an impact that's notable from weather or West Coast ports? And also on sales, David reiterated the guidance regarding the first half better than the second half. Just any other color as we should be thinking about the second quarter trend to date would be helpful.","Todd Vasos","Paul this is Todd, let me first say that the first quarter sales trajectory and trend were pretty much exactly like we thought they would be. Obviously we knew the calendar, we knew that the Easter shift would play a key factor in how the quarter shaped up and it played out exactly the way we really thought it would and that was benefiting period two of the quarter and then taking away some sales in period three.","So the quarter shaped up pretty much like we thought, there was some headwind, as you indicated with the little weather that we saw just like everyone else I\u2019m sure in that latter part of February, early March timeframe but as that subsided and mitigated, our sales return to more normalized pattern and again where we thought.","And as we look forward Paul, we are pretty satisfied and confident in our guidance of sales that we put out at the beginning of the year. So I think the best way to look at it is that we are well on track to be within that guidance.","Paul Trussell","Thank you for the color. Now on gross margins very good performance there, could you give a little bit more detail on what is driving the higher mark-ups and are there any headwinds that we should be thinking about going forward that could offset some of the improvement and shrink in lower transportation cost?","Todd Vasos","Paul, we are very pleased with our gross margin performance, I think the teams did an outstanding job and they call out a few of the teams in supply chain and merchandising in particular, they did a real good job in mitigating some of that West Coast issue that we were facing and they did it over a course of the long period of time as they saw this chart to materialize, they made some very early changes late last year to move some goods to the East coast and that really helped us.","Then as we looked at the quarter, the mix really did benefit us and as you heard from the prepared remarks, we are very happy with our sales and our sales trajectories in non-consumables. And so as you look at the non-consumable piece, it helped our margins as we looked year-over-year.","DC and trans did a nice job as I indicated not only on the West Coast piece but also they continue working their productivity gains within the DCs, as well as looking at how we mitigate any issues with some of the driver shortages that have been out there, again our teams I think have done a pretty good job with that.","And of course fuel helped a little bit as it is a much lower than last year and then lastly we are very, very encouraged by our shrink results and our trajectory on shrink. We think that the work that\u2019s been done over the last 12 to 18 months has some legs to it and we are seeing it broad based as we indicated across many, many categories.","So we feel pretty good but as you look just to keep in mind, gross margins, the headwinds get a little bit tougher and the lasts get a little tougher as we move through the quarter - through the rest of the year and to the upcoming quarter. So keep that in mind as you take a look at that.","Paul Trussell","Thank you.","Mary Pilkington","All right. Hope, we'll move onto the next question please.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now go to Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question and congrats to everybody on new roles and moving on. I want to talk a little bit more about the labor investment that you\u2019re here making. Can you give us some sense of the economic return that you've seen from the test and how scalable you think that the return will be in what form it will be mostly going to be a sales lift. Thank you.","Todd Vasos","Michael, it's Todd once again. I think the best way to look at it is that our operations teams have a real defined metric goal that they need to reach and as we indicted, it is, it is goals around sales being the number one driver, the whole thought around this is to make sure that our in-store experience for the consumer is half notch as she enters - as she enters our stores.","And as we\u2019ve said for the last couple of calls, this labor investment at store level is about getting product on the shelf, about getting all the backroom and getting the truck work in a more timely manner so that as the consumer enters the store, she has what she needs on the shelf at the time she needs it, she can get out of the store quickly.","So there definitely is metrics involved and we are pretty pleased with what we see so far but again it's early but we are pretty pleased and look forward to rolling out Phases 2 and 3 of the program as we work through the rest of the year.","Michael Lasser","Should we - I appreciate your commentary about the comparison getting tougher but with the labor investment, should we expect that some of the comparison will be mitigated by the sales lift that you anticipate you\u2019ll achieve through this initiative?","Todd Vasos","Yes and I think that\u2019s fair to say but again, we knew going into the year as we laid our guidance, we\u2019ve laid \u2013 layer that in as being a benefit for us but I think Michael you\u2019re exactly right. It\u2019s fair to say that that should help us as we move into the back half of the year.","Michael Lasser","Okay. And then my last question Todd is you mentioned some headwinds that you\u2019re going to be facing aside tough comparison in the gross margin side. What exactly are you referring to in the gross margin headwinds and so we should not expect that the 45 basis points of expansion is necessarily sustainable?","Todd Vasos","Yes, I think the way to look at it is one, we\u2019re fairly confident that we will have expansion for the year but as we continue to move throughout the year, the compares get a little tougher to last year and that rate of growth with gross margin will subside somewhat as we continue to move but we feel pretty confident that we will have expansion as we move through the rest of the year.","Michael Lasser","Okay, super. Thank you so much and good luck to everyone.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Mary Pilkington","Great. Hope, we\u2019ll go to the next caller please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Hi, good morning and congrats on the nice quarter. ","Todd Vasos","Thank you, Matt.","Matthew Boss","On the topline with 3 to 3.5 same-store sales guidance if in a year it appears prudent given the tougher compares as the year progresses. And my question, have you baked in any change in macro back drop with some of wage increases and then from the category perspective, what areas have of the store would you expect to outpace that guidance over the next 12 months?","Todd Vasos","Well, you know, as we look at it, we really haven\u2019t factored anything for the wages and we watch all trends in retail, wages being one of them.","I think we\u2019ve got a pretty strong track record of doing what we need to do at the time we need to do it and the nice thing about Dollar General is we have the flexibility to be able to do that. ","So, we feel pretty confident in that but we will watch it and as we look at sales as we move through the rest of the year, the work that the teams have done in non-consumables, I have to tell you, we feel very good about that and again, that work has been ongoing for years Matt as you know.","And as we\u2019ve always said, as the consumer starts to have a little bit more money, we think that we\u2019ve got the right formula for her on non-consumables. So, we still consider non-consumables as a great rounding of the basket and I think Q1 showed that and I think as we move through the rest of the year, our non-consumable categories will continue to perform very well for us.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the competitive environment? And particularly any changes that you\u2019ve noticed with some of your peers currently under transition today?","Todd Vasos","Yes, I think when you look at the macro environment out there in retail, it\u2019s always very competitive but I think the best way to still characterize it is it\u2019s been rational across all channels of trade, mass grocery and drug.","And we watch, just like everyone, we watch everything everyone is doing and we\u2019ll act accordingly but I have to tell you, at this point we really haven\u2019t seen anything that is out of the ordinary but we\u2019re doing and we\u2019re doing things and we are controlling what we can control and working our plan and where we think the year is going to fall out and that\u2019s where we\u2019re squarely focused and if we keep our head down and do that and then also watch what\u2019s going on around this, I think we\u2019re going to have a pretty good year here.","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of luck.","Mary Pilkington","Great. We\u2019ll go to the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Two questions. First of all, you\u2019ve made a couple comments just regarding in stock levels and one of the reasons you\u2019re increasing the labor investment is to improve the in stock levels make sure the stores are prepared.","I guess the question is, do you think you had an issue with in stock levels first? And then second, just kind of again this is a broader macro question I guess, but a lot of data that suggests that blue collar labor trends continue to improve, we're starting to see some upward pressure on wages, which I would think would create a good environment for Dollar General. I\u2019m wondering how you would characterize the health of your core consumer at this point.","Rick Dreiling","Sure Scott. I think it\u2019s fair to say on the in stock piece that we haven\u2019t been fully satisfied with where our in stocks have been and been trending. In saying that, I think we\u2019ve done some very prudent things and taken some action as you heard in my prepared remarks to offset some of those in stock issues that we\u2019ve seen start to pop-up over the last 12 to 18 months.","Now in saying that we\u2019ve got a lot of things in place to make sure that our in stock levels are appropriate, but as you can tell we do have some opportunities still. So we\u2019re working that plan and stay tuned for more information as we continue to move through the year on it, but we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll be able to rule that in and get our in stocks back to where we think they should be.","As it relates to our core consumer, I think you nailed it. I think that the consumer is feeling a little bit better, but again our core consumer is always a little bit stretched and as you know she is the first usually to start to feel it when the economy starts to grow a little sideways and she is also the last to usually roll out of that when she starts to go back to work and things start to get a little better.","But I think the way to look at it is that she also has to feel confident over a longer period of time and I think as we continue to move through the year and if everything stays where it\u2019s at or gets a little bit better her confidence level is going to build and her spending will probably build with that because again, she doesn\u2019t have a lot of disposable income. ","She doesn\u2019t have bank accounts and credit cards and so she has to see a sustained time where she starts to feel good and once that happens I think you\u2019ll start to see her spend a little bit more.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Thanks a lot guys.","Rick Dreiling","Absolutely, thank you.","Mary Pilkington","Hope, we move on to the next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Dan Binder","Hi, good morning, thank you and congratulations to both of you, Rick and Todd. My question was follow-up on the labor investments. Can you just remind us how many stores were in the tests, how many were in Phase 1, and then considering the investments you\u2019re making where we - ","Operator","Hi Dan did we lose you? I think the line disconnected.","Mary Pilkington","Okay, Dan if you - Hope if Dan is there we will come back to you and where you can bring him back right now?","Operator","One moment.","Mary Pilkington","Thank you. Hope, if its easier to we can just move on to the next question and we\u2019ll get back to Dan.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne Agee.","Charles Grom","Good morning guys. Still Dan's question - sorry Dan. In 2014, labor initiatives I don\u2019t know if it was really his question actually. But on the 2014 test that you did, can you just give us some perspective on how many stores that you tested in and what the degree of improvement was in your in stock levels and also from a sales perspective what the lift was?","Todd Vasos","Yes. When we rolled out the 2014 test, I think it\u2019s fair to say, it was done in a pretty big group of stores and it was done across a lot of different geographic areas of the country to make sure that we felt good about the results that were coming out of it. ","So in our tests and learn program as you know using APT we have the unique ability to be able to really focus in on that and then glean the learnings from it. So it was broad based in a lot of geographic areas, but I think the biggest thing to take away was that we saw significant sales increases that were sustainable and as well as our in stock positions had increased and what we\u2019re waiting for to come through on this as well that will be","a trailer to both the 2014 test and anything we do in 2015, were hoping to get some shrink goodness out of this as we continue to move as well.","But again that will be yet to come and we won't probably recognize that later this year and into early next year.","Charles Grom","Okay, great. And then just to ducktail into that, David when we think about SG&A, dollar growth in the balance of the year 9.5% here on the first quarter. So we think about that rising as we roll-out the labor initiative to more stores?","David Tehle","Yes, I think as we look at it, we still believe it takes approximately a 3.5 comp on an ongoing basis to lever our SG&A. Now having said that, that ebbs and flows and it depends upon what our investments in a particular quarter and obviously we were a little higher in Q1 on incentive comp advertising in repairs and maintenance.","And yes, as we go through the back half of the year we will be making some investments in labor that will reduce the leverage in terms of how much we can lever SG&A. And as Todd said, we think that\u2019s a great investment, but it takes a little bit of time to get that payback as customers - obviously the hope is we\u2019ll get more transactions in a bigger basket as customers come in the store and that will come over time.","So again big expectations for it, but as we're implementing at the back half of the year, it puts a little pressure on SG&A.","Charles Grom","Okay, great. And then one more for you David, just on a cash flow statements. It looks like you had some hop on the payables front, an increase from the end of the year when, it looks like typically over the past few years you guys see a decline. Just wondering why the payable balance rose so much?","David Tehle","Yes, two things there. Last year on payables, we had a little bit of a negative and this year we had a little bit of a positive, the same items. It had to do with the receipts and we talked about the West Coast situation and this year we got a whole slug of receipts in whether late in the quarter that we didn't have to pay for right away. And last year we got receipts a little bit earlier that we paid for it little quicker.","So little bit of hurt last year and a little bit of help this year putting together that was enough you say kind of stick out on the cash flow statement.","Charles Grom","Okay, great. And congrats on your retirement.","David Tehle","Thank you.","Mary Pilkington","Hope, we got the next caller.","Operator","We do have Dan Binder back online with Jefferies.","Rick Dreiling","Welcome Dan.","Dan Binder","I\u2019m not sure what happened, I apologize, we're able to hear you, you couldn\u2019t hear us though. And Chuck is a friend, so I\u2019ll forgive him for taking my question.","But anyway, I did have some other question. So you recently opened 12,000 store, maybe you can give us a little bit of an update based on kind of a wide space and the opportunities competitive environment, what do you think the opportunity is for Dollar General here?","Rick Dreiling","We think the opportunity is very bright. We've stated that we got 13,000 opportunities that exist in the Continental United States. We know we\u2019ll get our very fair share of those, matter of fact as we\u2019ve already announced we\u2019ve accelerated our growth to ensure that we get the very best sites that are out there.","So we feel very good about the wide space it\u2019s there still and we feel good about the new states that we've entered and where those sales trends are moving. So all-in-all, the future is pretty bright when you look at building stores and store expansion and our future expansion plans.","Dan Binder","Okay. And then just one other question, you talked about better in stock levels, I\u2019m not sure if you want to quantify, but what is sort of the ideal economical level of in-stocks that you think you want to be at longer term. And maybe if you could also include in that conversation, how much of the inventory is being pushed to the stores versus pulled, is it all essential replenishment or do they have do still managers have some flexibility there to request product too?","Todd Vasos","Those are good questions and when we look at inventory levels, there is no doubt that we do have specific goals in mind by category and even down to the goods and sales. So in our top 250 items we want 99% plus in-stocks.","And as you go down the food chain if you will on items, that expectation becomes a little less, because we know that we\u2019re not - we wouldn't want to be 99% in stock across the Board.","But in saying that, our consumers expect a very high level of in-stock when they come into the store and we feel that by making sure that we\u2019ve got the product on the shelf. And again implementing the sky shelf program as I indicated will help to keep that those goods out of the backroom and customer facing.","So those are some of the initiatives we\u2019re working onto make sure that those in-stock level stay pretty high. And then, when you look at just overall our inventory, we feel that it\u2019s pretty clean and we feel good about it.","Dan Binder","Okay, thanks.","Mary Pilkington","Hope, we'll go to the next caller.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer","Thanks Todd, I just wanted to ask you about your thoughts on private label opportunity. So when we look at competitors such as Audi, obviously remarkable successful with almost 100% private brand assortment. I\u2019m assuming that family dollars private labels assortment will grow once it becomes part of Dollar Tree.","So when you think about Dollar General, do you see an opportunity to further push your private label penetration higher or do you think just the opposite to differentiate yourself from those competitors perhaps focus more on branded product?","Todd Vasos","Yes, those are good questions. We very much love private brands. We know that they\u2019re definitely a pillar of our inventory that we have. Matter of fact our consumers look to us for a great alternative in private brands.","So to answer to your question specifically, we look to continue to expand our private brands not only the items, but also the quality that we put forward to the consumer. And we also want to make sure that it's an extreme value for our consumers.","The other lever that we have that we continue to expand and you\u2019ll see a further expansion as we go through 2015, will be our smart and simple label, which in fact gets us to even a lower price point for our consumer to really hit that affordability piece that she craves right now especially in a lot of the consumable type area.","So, we're bullish about our private brand program and you\u2019ll continue to see us move forward and expand that as we move into the later part of this year and into next.","Dan Wewer","And just Todd one follow-up question. With the 900 stores opening next year, I don't think our retailers ever opened that many stores in a year, is it your experience that Dollar General finds that first year volumes are greater when you are the first small box value retailer in a market, is that the key reason why you\u2019re pushing the expansion rate higher?","Todd Vasos","The way we look at it is first of all 900 stores is a big number, but our real estate team is very, very good at what they do. We\u2019re confident in the site selection and that\u2019s probably the most important thing around volume is getting the right site and our proprietary tools that we use really hones in those sites for us and enables us to get there.","Now there is no doubt that being first mover does give you some advantage and we\u2019ll continue to capitalize on any dislocation that maybe out there. But 900 stores is aggressive, but we feel very confident in delivering that.","Dan Wewer","Okay, great. Thank you and good luck.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Mary Pilkington","Hope, we'll move to the next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citigroup.","Alvin Concepcion","Hi good morning, thanks for taking my question and congrats Rick and Todd. I think you touched upon personalizing promotions, I\u2019m just curious how far away are you from being able to do that and are you partnering with anyone on the data analytics?","Todd Vasos","To answer your question specifically, we're already doing targeted marketing based on purchase habits from our consumers on that card. Again the beauty of this is, it looks and feels like a loyalty card, but it has no that back stage cost that is very prohibitive out there.","So, we are partnering with many of the CPG companies and quite frankly the majority of them are very, very excited about partnering with us to offer our consumers a real deal on these digital coupon platforms, but with or even more jazzed about if you will is the ability to see them based on their purchase history with coupons at a very relevant to them.","And we\u2019re pretty happy with the early results of it and you\u2019re going to see a lot more from us as we move over the next few quarters.","Alvin Concepcion","Great, thank you. And just another one about operating profits, I think, grew about 13% a quarter, your guidance is 7% to 9% for the year. I know there is some comparisons in the back half of the year. I'm wondering is there some conservatism build into that as well and how much of it is, is from labor investments incrementally stepping up. Just wondering if you could help us through the puts and takes on margins over the course of the year.","Todd Vasos","Well clearly it is early in the year. We\u2019ve only been through one quarter and as you said the comparisons do get a little more difficult as we get in the second half of the year. So I think let's just stay tuned on that one, and we\u2019ll see how it all plays out.","We are making more investment in labor as we go through the year. We talked about that and again, we believe we\u2019ll have a great return on that, it is just going to take a little while for us to get their return.","Alvin Concepcion","And last one from me and just wondering if you talk about direct sourcing as an opportunity in 2015, just an update there.","Rick Dreiling","Again direct sourcing is one of our key pillars of gross margin and gross margin expansion but also offers our consumers a real value and affordability in that sweet spot of $1 to $5.","So we want to continue and we will continue to grow our global sourcing efforts and as we move through 2015 and into next year, we continue to put satellite offices in more countries around the globe to make sure that we have boots on the street and really finding the next best factories that can deliver that promise of the consumer. So, we\u2019re full speed ahead on global sourcing.","Alvin Concepcion","Thank you very much.","Mary Pilkington","Hope, we\u2019ll move on to the next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Nemer","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First I\u2019m wondering if you can give us any read, early read on the repackaging of your private brands. I think the goal was to have most of those in store by mid year and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re getting any sales left from that.","Rick Dreiling","Yes Matt, as we look at, at the private brand repackaging and just the effort in general its way early to give a real solid read on it. But I can tell you that half of the goods we repackaged by about mid-year and then the remainder 90% will be done probably by the end of the second and into the early third quarter.","But the early read has been fairly positive when we look at it, we are looking at by item, by category, and there are a few changes that we've made already based on that but overall the consumer response has been very positive, and again we did a lot which we always do a lot of consumer work before we launch each and every one of those item.","So we had a real good idea of what it would do and its coming very, very close to what we thought but just like anything there is always a little bit of back in forth that we need to do, and a few items that we\u2019re changing as we speak.","Matt Nemer","Got it, okay. And then on a separate topic the digital coupon platform, can you give us a sense for how many of your customers have signed up for that or and maybe the percent of baskets, that are using a digital coupon, just so we can engage the size of that, that effort right now.","Rick Dreiling","We really Matt haven't quantified that but I can tell you that, we've got goals and metrics in place to hit and we are on actually exceeding those signups already through Q1 and now as we go in the Q2 and as you heard we're launching different programs in each quarter to encourage signup and to get people really involved in it.","So stay tune more to come on that because it's in infancy stage but we think it\u2019s a real differentiator for our channel.","Matt Nemer","Okay, that's fair. And then just lastly on the sky shelf initiative, is there more about the flow of inventory through the store or adding safety stock to the store and if it's the ladder, how does that impact inventory dollars per store overtime.","Rick Dreiling","Matt, it really is the first and that is it facilitates getting product out of that backroom and getting it right in front of the customer. Our store teams do a fabulous job. They are taking care of our customers. We want to make it easier for them and the easiest way to stock the goods on the shelf would not to be to go back in the backroom and have to find it, but would be able to look right above the items and build a stock at very effectively and efficiently that way and that was really the impetus behind us doing that was to make it easier on the stores.","Now the byproduct of that is better in-stocks because once again if you see an out and you happen to passing by the aisles, you may not have time in the way we did it in the past to run in the backroom to get the item, but you know what you definitely have time to stop for a few seconds look up and if it\u2019s there pull a few down and put it on the shelf.","So I think it is going to kill two birds in one stone and make things a lot easier for the stores, but also be able to enhance our in stock position.","David Tehle","Anything from a working capital point of view it should reduce working capital because it will be out there, you get it on the shelf quicker, it will sell quicker in it, it should, in no way will add inventory just being more efficient with the inventory and actually hopefully making it turn even quicker.","Matt Nemer","Makes a lot of sense. Todd, congrats in your new role.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, Matt.","Mary Pilkington","Hope, we'll move to next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","Thanks, congratulations everyone. Could you follow-up on corporate brand topic, so how satisfied do you think you\u2019re with corporate brand pricing particularly versus the hard disc counters and then what\u2019s smart and simple, how much do you think - will there be a smart and simple alternative in every category and subcategory and where do you get the shelf space for that. Is that national brand or phasings?","David Tehle","John, couple of good questions. Number one, we look at pricing whether it\u2019s national brand or private brand across the entire spectrum of where we do business every two weeks. So we\u2019re very, very attuned to pricing and we feel pretty confident on both our national brand, but especially our private brand pricing as it relates to mass grocery and drug.","Now in saying that well we continue to watch pricing as national brands may get more aggressive. We also then make sure that we watch our spreads between national brand and private brands and at those times we will reduce our prices if maybe to keep those spreads.","But as you look at our private brands and the way that they we\u2019re looking at them smart and simple does play a key role in that affordability piece. And I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re going to have it in the every single category, but I can tell you that right now the 45 or 50 items that we launched this year, late last year and into this year has been very, very good for us. The consumer has - it has resonated with the consumer.","They like the value and the affordability that smart and simple offers with a pretty good promise on the quality of the item. So stay tuned John I think you\u2019re going to see an acceleration of smart and simple as we go forward. Because we know that it\u2019s a true differentiator for us, but also it really helps the consumer.","John Heinbockel","And then lastly as a follow-up note. If you think about your share is still very small in any of your categories, where is the best opportunity to drive you think beyond 2015 investing in more labor investing in price is there enough elasticity if you invest in price, if you drive some of that share, how do you look at the two versus each other?","David Tehle","Well, we look at both all the time and we look at the marketplace all the time. And I think you know us pretty well if we feel that, that we need to invest in labor we do. If we feel like we need to invest in price we do.","The real key and we\u2019ve said it many, many times is driving unit. If we drive units through the store and those transactions, then comp sales come. So we\u2019re confident in that model and the nice thing is we have the flexibility and we\u2019ve proven that over time to be able to take whatever action we need to take to make sure that we continue to drive market share.","And by the way our market share continues to grow as you heard and we don't see that stopping because we've got a real good strong category management plan out there that will leverage up on a lot of different areas to be able to drive that market share.","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thank you.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Mary Pilkington","Hope, we\u2019ll move to next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. This is actually just a follow-up on an earlier comment on the non-consumables, can you just provide a little more detail on what has changed in a payroll specifically to drive the better results and maybe what are some of the ongoing initiatives that will continually to be benefiting this part of the mix?","Todd Vasos","That's a great question. A few things and we\u2019ve been working on a payroll for many years but Cindy Long and her team have done a phenomenal job in getting us very, very relevant in a payroll.","And when we look at payroll it\u2019s both basics and then fashion basics. We are not out there on the cutting edge of fashion but fashion basics is really where Cindy and her team have brought us and the consumers really resonating.","And then as we took her learnings from it and then put in the affordability pieces that we\u2019ve now engrained within our category management process to include a payroll, the consumers have really, really responded to that.","So we are pretty bullish on a payroll, I don\u2019t think any of us would have probably said that a few years ago but I can tell you that the team has done some real nice work there and we see that only enhancing as we continue to move through the rest of this year.","Stephen Grambling","Great, that's helpful. And then maybe changing gears, I realize often times comment on these specifically, but can you just talk to your thought process more generally about evaluating acquisitions?","Todd Vasos","We've always said and David can also chime in here, we look at anything that maybe out there but the great thing about our model is that and you\u2019ve heard little earlier, we have got 13,000 or so opportunities in the Continental United States alone. So we\u2019re very, very focused on that organic growth right now but never-say-never and we\u2019re always going to look at everything but we feel very confident in our real estate model and where we are headed right now.","Stephen Grambling","Thanks. Best of luck in your new role.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Mary Pilkington","Hope, we are right at top of the hour, maybe we will take one more question.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","Thanks for squeezing me in, and so I guess my question was more as we look out I mean, obviously this year is going - kind of plan and maybe even a little bit better but as we move out to next year and we talk about the labor investments, got another competitor of your is now hopping, starting salaries to $10, so it's going to put some further pressure on that labor line, plus the 900 stores, it just seems like kind of looking '17, it looks a little harder from my perspective but I wanted you to talk me out of that?","Todd Vasos","I think it's fair to say, we\u2019ve got a very, very strong plan that we're executing against for this year. We've already laid plans for 2016, stay tuned, I think you\u2019re going to be pretty happy as we continue to move through this. We\u2019ve proven that we can continue to move comp sales, we have proven that we can continue to balance the P&L pretty strong and still return a lot to the shareholders.","And I think that you\u2019re going to continue to see that from us but as it relates to the wages, we\u2019re continuing to monitor that, we monitor everything out there at retail and wages are no different. But keep in mind, we still have a lot of flexibility and the real hallmark of a great retailer is the ability to drive productivity at store level and we will continue to do that. And if we can continue to do that, it will afford us that flexibility to do whatever we need to do to be competitive.","Scott Mushkin","And then one just follow-up, I just noticed, I think your rent growth is close to 15% last year. As we accelerate the stores and obviously we're at tail end of the - looks like economic cycle which is more at the end, how is rent growth, how should we think about rent growth going forward, is it harder to get prices as you pay more or no?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, I think - and again we don\u2019t give specific guidance on individual line items but we have a extremely sophisticated effective real estate process. As Todd mentioned earlier, we\u2019re very pleased with what we see out of that, we believe we\u2019re getting the lowest rent possible for somebody in our space. We are happy with what we\u2019re driving there.","And again it\u2019s all about productivity in the box. As we look at the individual boxes, we are dealing with little higher rents and we got to figure out how to make that box more productive to pay for that rent and again I think we\u2019ve got a lot of programs to do that also.","So it's just part of the evolution of our model as we move forward and I think we've got a lot of strategies to help offset those higher rents.","Scott Mushkin","That's perfect. Thanks again for squeezing me in and as everyone said congratulations to all of you guys.","Mary Pilkington","Thank you. I know we are leaving some people in the queue, so I apologize about that but Matt Hancock and I will be around to take any calls, so please feel free to give me a call. And thank you for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call.

Thank you for participating in today's conference, which is being recorded by Conference America. No other recordings or rebroadcast of this session are allowed without the company's permission.","It is now my pleasure to turn the conference call over to Ms. Mary Winn Gordon, Dollar General's Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. You may begin.","Mary Winn Gordon","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com, under Investor Information, Press Releases.","Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, objectives, anticipated financial and operating results and other non-historical matters. Some examples of forward-looking statements discussed in this call include our 2013 forecasted financial results and anticipated capital expenditures, our planned operating and merchandising initiatives for fiscal 2013, expected ongoing share repurchases and future consumer economic trends. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in our forward-looking statement are included in our earnings release issued this morning; our 2012 10-K, which we filed on March 25; our first quarter 10-Q, which was filed this morning; and in the comments that are made on this call. We encouraged you to read these. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call.","We will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which I mentioned is posted on dollargeneral.com. This information is not a substitute for any GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.","Richard W. Dreiling","Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. As we shared with you at the time of our fourth quarter conference call, we expected the first quarter of 2013 to be our most difficult quarter, given the well-publicized tough weather comps, payroll tax increases and sales headwinds from the tax refund delays. With the first quarter behind us, we've updated our outlook to reflect the revised sales estimate and gross margin compression. The continued mix shift within consumables to lower-margin items without the benefit of sales of higher-margin non-consumables and higher inventory shrink are the key drivers of our gross margin performance. This revised view of sales and gross margin has tempered the high end of our earnings outlook. I still believe our sales ramp will come later in the year as we look forward to same -- sales growth of 4% to 5% for 2013, and we continue to have long-term opportunities for growth.","David will provide more details on our financial results in a moment, but I wanted to share just a few highlights from the quarter. Our total sales increased 8.5% over last year to a record $4.2 billion. Same-store sales grew 2.6%, with both traffic and average ticket increasing for the 21st consecutive quarter. They characterize the shape of the quarter with a U shape, with February and the back half of April sales much stronger than March as we felt the most significant weather impact, and we were lapping a double-digit comp increase in that month.","Adjusted operating profit increased 3% to $396 million, or 9.4% of sales. And adjusted net income increased 8% to $232 million. Adjusted earnings -- EPS increased 13% to $0.71 per share.","For the quarter, sales growth was healthy across our consumable categories. It's my belief that the best way to judge the health of a retailer for this quarter is based on the strength of his core business. For us, that would be our consumable business, and we delivered a strong same-store sales improvement in this category. However, our non-consumable or discretionary categories were soft during the quarter as sales of seasonal merchandise and apparel were impacted by the weather. Given the positive trends we experienced in non-consumables in 2012, it's noteworthy that every non-consumable category had a negative comp in the first quarter. Even so, we're pleased with the sell-through of our holiday seasonal merchandise, including Valentine's Day and Easter. While we expected spring and summer seasonal sales to be soft given the cooler weather patterns over the quarter compared to a near-perfect weather in the prior year, we had expected total discretionary sales to recover more significantly than they did in April and, quite honestly, at a faster pace. Although our consumable categories did pick up nicely in April, we did not see a similar recovery in our discretionary categories.","Like other retail CEOs you have heard from this quarter, I don't like to talk about the weather, but the impact on our business. However, we believe it was a factor in our discretionary business. Overall, when the weather improved across the region, we saw a positive impact with improved sales. For example, it's been easier to be a district manager in Texas or Florida, where we have had better weather, as compared to the Northeast and the Midwest, where the weather has not been in our favor.","I'll talk more about our operating initiatives in the moment, but now I'd like to turn the call over to David.","David M. Tehle","Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Rick covered the highlights of our first quarter sales performance, so I'll start with gross profit. Gross profit dollars increased 5% for the quarter, with an 89-basis-point decrease in gross profit rate to 30.6% of sales. This decrease was driven by higher markdowns, higher consumable mix, an increase in inventory shrink and lower initial markups. You will recall that we had forecasted a gross margin decline and called it out on our last earnings call.","While our total shrink units per store continued to decrease, our financial shrink increased due to the increased loss of SKUs greater than $5 at retail. While these high-value items are generating greater shrink, they are also driving increased sales and higher-margin dollars. We're now forecasting that this negative shrink trend will not turn around in 2013. These negative margin impacts were partially offset by a benefit from transportation efficiencies driven by lower stem miles and modestly lower fuel rates.","SG&A expense was 21.3% of sales in the 2013 period compared to 21.6% in the 2012 period, an improvement of 37 basis points. Decreases in incentive compensation, workers compensation and general liability expenses contributed to the overall decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales. We were also able to leverage our retail labor expense, partially due to ongoing benefits from our workforce management system and other operating efficiencies. Our mining for cost reduction program also contributed to the overall decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales. Costs that increased at a higher rate than our increase in sales include rent expense, advertising costs, depreciation and amortization and utilities expense. The team did a nice job leveraging SG&A on a sales comp of 2.6%, which is better than our goal of leveraging SG&A on a 3% to 3.5% comp increase.","As of May 3, total inventories were $2.41 billion, up about 14% on a per-store basis. This rate of growth should moderate as we move through the year. Our inventory turns were 5.0x. The quality and aging of our inventory continues to be in good shape.","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $150 million, including $30 million related to new leased stores; $25 million for stores we purchased or built; $74 million for upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $14 million for distribution and transportation; and $6 million for information system upgrades. During the quarter, we opened 165 new stores and relocated or remodeled 207 stores.","At the end of the quarter, we had outstanding long-term obligations of $2.84 billion, essentially in line with the prior year. We continued to improve our capital structure to ensure long-term flexibility, ample liquidity and enhanced financial performance. In March, Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating to Baa3. This upgrade completed our transition to investment grade as our S&P corporate rating was already BBB-.","During the quarter, we successfully issued $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $400 million of 5-year notes at an interest rate of 1.875% and $900 million of 10-year notes at an interest rate of 3.25%. We concurrently entered into a new 5-year senior unsecured credit facility, which includes a $1 billion term loan and an $850 million revolver. Proceeds from the offerings, together with the term loan borrowings under the new credit facility, were used to repay the senior secured credit facilities. This successful refinancing allowed us to extend our average debt maturity and move to an unsecured debt structure at very attractive borrowing rates.","Now to guidance. Based on our first quarter results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we now expect total sales for the year to increase 10% to 11%. Same-store sales are expected to increase 4% to 5%. We are forecasting gross margin contraction for the full year to be in line with the first quarter due to the continued mix shift within consumables to lower-margin items, higher inventory shrink and softer sales in non-consumables.","As you model gross margin, please keep in mind we had our best performance on gross margin in fourth quarter of 2012. This will be our most challenging quarterly overlap on gross margin for the year as you look at the quarterly spread.","Operating profit for 2013 is expected to be in the range of $1.73 billion to $1.77 billion. Given our successful refinancing during the quarter, we now expect interest expense to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million.","Adjusted earnings per share for the year is now forecast to be $3.15 to $3.22 based on about 326 million weighted average diluted shares. This share count assumes about $500 million for total share repurchases. For the second quarter, please keep in mind that we will be lapping a $0.04-per-share impact from a discrete tax item from last year that we do not expect to reoccur this year. The full year 2013 effective tax rate is expected to be about 38%.","For the year, we plan to open approximately 635 new stores and to remodel or relocate a total of approximately 550 stores. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million.","It is still very early in the year, and the outlook for the rest of the year is very hard to call. The new guidance reflects our best estimates given what we know today. Looking at the balance of the year, I believe we have clear operating priorities in place to help us deliver on our goals.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick.","Richard W. Dreiling","Thank you, David. The first quarter was an extremely busy and productive one at Dollar General. I'll give you a few examples of the tremendous work that has been accomplished in just one quarter.","First, store growth. Through the first quarter, we opened 165 stores, including 10 Dollar General Markets and 8 Dollar General Plus formats. Compared to the past couple of years, our store pipeline is very robust, and we are ahead of where we were at this time last year for both new stores opened and store weeks. Our new stores are continuing to deliver strong performance that is exceeding our plans. In addition, we remodeled or relocated 207 stores in the quarter, including 44 Dollar General Plus stores. The DG Plus format is a great tool for relocations, and we were driving higher baskets given the expanded perishable assortment in those stores. At the end of the first quarter, we had 10,662 stores in 40 states, well on our way to our next milestone of 11,000 stores.","Turning to store operations. We made great progress in implementing Phase 5, our initiative aimed at optimizing shelf space in 3,000 legacy stores that have not been remodeled to our customer-centric format. For the quarter, we completed the fixturing and reconfiguration of 2,800 of the 3,000 stores in this legacy group. While it's early, we are pleased with the comp sales lift of about 100 basis points we are seeing as our customers realize we expanded our product assortment.","Additionally, across the rest of the store base, the implementation of new planograms increased over 30% year-over-year as we advance the timing of our planogram changes into the first quarter of this year to better align with our category management plans and new product introductions. Specifically, we made over 600,000 planogram changes across our store base in the first quarter. All in all, this is substantial work at the store level that should provide a real benefit going forward.","We're very pleased with the results of our cooler expansions for perishable items. Most of our new stores are being built with 16 cooler doors, and we plan to increase the number of coolers in approximately 1,700 existing stores. In the first quarter alone, we installed about 6,300 cooler doors in over 1,400 of those stores, or about 80% of our target.","We're also making progress on installing defensive merchandising fixtures to help us reestablish our trend of shrink improvement. In hindsight, over the last year or so, we introduced some new products with a higher dollar value per unit and did not implement the associated defensive fixturing or labeling that we now realize is necessary in select stores. During the quarter, we accelerated the installation of the fixtures, installing them in over 2,600 stores. We also completed additional shrink training workshops for all of our field management.","At the store level, the most significant initiative implemented has been our aggressive roll out of tobacco products. We are on track to have tobacco rolled out to essentially all of our stores before the end of the second quarter. As of today, we have tobacco in about 10,000 stores, which is quite an achievement when you consider the amount of work involved. For each and every store location, we have to get a license, develop a planogram, source fixturing for the product, schedule and complete the installation of the fixture, ship inventory, set the planogram and training employees. In addition, we have reconfigured the front end of the store to facilitate the sale of tobacco, including the addition of more impulse items. Much like raising of the shelf height profile to 78 inches, this effort has been a great example of success -- successful cross-functional execution at Dollar General.","We continue to gain insights into the tobacco category and how we think it will contribute to traffic and sales over time. So far, as we look at tobacco purchases, we are seeing about 1\/3 with tobacco only, and the remaining 2\/3 are tobacco plus one or more items. The average basket with tobacco and additional items is currently above $17, and our sales and traffic are building each week along with our customer awareness. Based on our experience, we expect that the percentage of baskets with tobacco will continue to ramp up over the next several months.","In summary, we accomplished much in the quarter that we believe should pay dividends as the year progresses. While it's still early, the second quarter is off to a solid start, and we are beginning to see a slight improvement in our non-consumable sales. However, the current expected growth rate for total comps and gross margin performance for the year is not where we had projected it when we last spoke. As a result, we have moderated our outlook for the year.","It is definitely clear that as we look at our business, our customers' dependence on Dollar General's Every Day Low Pricing on basic items in our convenient format has never been greater. We are focused on meeting those needs as our customers continue to manage their way through the ongoing financial pressures they face, as they always do and they always have done. At the same time, we are continuing improving our operations across the board and believe we have a long runway for continued success.","Before I open it up for questions, I want to thank over 95,000 Dollar General employees for the hard work that was completed in the first quarter. My sincere thanks go out to all Dollar General employees for their extra -- extra efforts in this quarter.","Now we'll open up for questions, Mary Winn.","Mary Winn Gordon","Okay. Operator, we'll take our first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, our first question will come from Meredith Adler, Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'd like to focus on the gross margin. I think that's probably everybody's concern. And I understand what you've said, but you are -- seem to be making an assumption that the rest of the year stays very similar to the first quarter. And maybe you could just talk more about what you believe is in the consumer's mind. If weather gets better, why wouldn't we see discretionary sales start to pick up? So maybe just talk to -- and then a little bit more about shrink and how quickly can you make improvements.","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. Fair, fair question, Meredith. What I'm looking at right now is, literally, where we stand today, having looked back on the quarter and thinking about how things are going. We have said for a period of time that the non-consumable side of the business is going to need just a little bit of help from the economy, I believe. We made some solid progress in 2012, but as I look across 2000 -- the first quarter of 2013, when we came out of that trough in March, I had anticipated that the non-consumable side would accelerate at a faster pace as we move through April. And we didn't see that, albeit we are seeing it improve as we are moving through May and June, but still not at the rate that I thought it would at this stage of the game. The other thing I want to talk a little bit on the margin side, why there's still opportunities in warehouse and transportation and category management and sourcing, I want to talk a little bit about what I think has happened in our quest to be a little more relevant to the customer out there. As we moved through the back part of last year and into the first part of this year, we began to expand our SKU base to include more and more national brand items, and those national brand items historically carry a little bit lower margin than our private brands, and we began to give the customer more alternatives to our private brand offering. We historically have been about good and best, or good and better when you look at our product assortment. And now, we're a little bit more good, better and best, having given more alternatives to the consumer. And let me give you a perfect example here. Six months ago, we carried the private brand version of Claritin in a 12-count, a 24-count and a 36-count, and we only carried Claritin in the 24. So if you wanted less than 24, you bought our private brands. And if you wanted more, you bought our private brands. Now we have -- the customer has their option across all 6 SKUs. And we inadvertently, in our zest to be a little more relevant, allowed the customer to be able to trade down on the margin on the -- in the consumable side of the business. I think the other thing, in our quest to be a little more relevant, we've added more high-value SKUs. And while they're selling, they're putting a little more pressure on the shrink side of the ledger, and that's this idea that while units are down, our shrink is up. So I think that we've made a lot of progress. I think, as I look at the margin we move through the year, we're going to continue to tweak that, and I think it's going to take us a couple -- 3 quarters to get -- to make that rebound.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe, is there any reason -- as we think about the discretionary part of the business, do you need to cut any orders? Have you done that?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. We actually -- much like a lot of the other major retailers out there, we have been looking down the road on this for 6 or 7 months. And our inventory on the non-consumable side is very healthy. It's not like we have an issue there that's going to sneak up on us.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's good to hear. And the promotional environment, is that contributing in any way?","Richard W. Dreiling","Another very fair question. I think the competitive environment, like the last quarter, is relatively stable. I think very much like the last quarter, I think share of voice, people are competing for. There's more radio out there and more TV out there, more pages and ads, but the pricing in all of those vehicles is very rational right now.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And I just had one more question. You've got obviously aggressive square footage growth plans. Given everything you're seeing, is there any reason to believe that the ROIC on new stores, over more than a couple months, but the long-term ROIC is changing at all?","Richard W. Dreiling","We are as excited about the returns on our new stores. The speed at which they ramp up, Meredith, as I was 5 years ago when I first talked to you about it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Deborah Weinswig, Citigroup.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Rick, is there any reason to think that you're at peak margins?","Richard W. Dreiling","I think that we still have lots of room in lots of different areas. David, I think as we tweak what's going on in the stores in terms of the SKU base, I think that's opportunity. David, I think in terms of private brands and...","David M. Tehle","Yes, I think you look at category management, sourcing, private brands, distribution, transportation and now, ironically, with a bigger opportunity in shrink because it's going a little bit the wrong way. So I think short-term, clearly, as we look at 2013, we don't see ourselves going up in margin, and we've put that into our guidance. But as we look out over the next 5 years, absolutely, we still believe there's opportunity to expand our operating margins.","Richard W. Dreiling","I do think, Deb, the low-hanging fruit is gone. I think as we move through the next few years, it's going to -- we're going to have to be a little more thoughtful, a little more precise on how we get it. But I think the opportunities are still there.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then do you think that there's anything structural here, either with the company, the consumer or the competition?","Richard W. Dreiling","I think the competitive environment is very stable. Like I said, it's not like we're picking up -- coming to work one day and someone's got great big ad. I think there's more pages, more radio as people are trying to make sure that consumers are there. In terms of the macroenvironment, I think the pressure that exists on customers is universe-ed across all of retailing. I think there's -- we talk about -- there's a lot more people who have an income under $50,000 a year than those that have an income of over $100,000. And I think the environment, while the governmental regulation -- there's not as much noise as there was a couple of quarters ago, and I actually feel better about the environment that our customer is in. We went through the Memorial Day weekend without a big spike in gasoline prices. I think that's a very positive thing for us. And I think structurally, in terms of the business, I tell you, I feel as good about Dollar General today as I've felt in a long time. We got a lot of work done in the first quarter. And I think it's fair to say that maybe we might even have bit off a little more than we could have chewed -- should have chewed in the first quarter. But we are -- as my chief merchant is fond of saying, our guns are loaded. And we're looking really, really, really hard at 2, 3 and 4.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe a question you can answer, maybe you can't, but can you talk about what trends are like now?","Richard W. Dreiling","Our -- where we stand as of this morning is smack dab middle of the range that we've given you, the guidance range.","Operator","Next question, Paul Trussell, Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So within -- Rick, within your guidance, has the sales contribution or margin impact from tobacco changed at all from a few months ago? And can you just speak to how satisfied you are with what you've seen to date?","Richard W. Dreiling","Paul, that's a very fair question. It's too soon yet. While I've got the cigarettes installed in 10,000 stores, we haven't really reached the stage of the game where I'm selling them there yet. I'll give you some update on where we are in the margin on cigarettes as we get through the next quarterly call. But right now, there's no reason to think that there's any -- anything out of the ordinary.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then when it comes to apparel and home, is your customer simply not purchasing those goods today because their wallets are tight? Or do you think that the customer has perhaps gone to purchase those goods elsewhere because of the assortment that you have within your stores, or just not wanting to shop your channel anymore for those goods, given that you're their destination for consumables?","Richard W. Dreiling","That's a very fair question. My view on it would be -- is their wallet tight? I think that -- when I look at our home or I look at our apparel, I think it's fair to say we have incredibly good days. And you'll have it for 2 or 3 days, and then it'll swing the other way. And I think what's going on is our consumer is finally realizing that the work that we've done on home and apparel, that we're giving them a pretty quality product at a fabulous everyday low price. And I've said for a period of time, we're going to have to sell them that that's good quality stuff, and it's taking a little bit longer than we thought. And I think you couple that, if we could get a little help from the economy and -- I think we could get that business performing at a little bit better level. I will say this, Paul, and I've said this for a long period of time and people get tired of hearing about it: we need to keep that side of the ledger. We like that side of the ledger. Obviously, there will be tweaks to it down the road, but we really like the non-consumable business, and we think we need it overall for the margin.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So is there -- just to follow-up on that comment, is there any change at all to how you're thinking about space allocation in new stores or remodels when it comes to home and apparel? Or do you feel like the current space allocated is appropriate?","Richard W. Dreiling","Our new stores are actually -- we're still pretty bullish on the home side, but our new stores are rolling out with an adjustment to the commitment in apparel. That is correct. And we have done that through all of 2012 and into '13.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's an adjustment down?","Richard W. Dreiling","Correct. Yes.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just -- with that comment, though, if you are adjusting the allocation of discretionary goods down, wouldn't that perhaps signal continued unfavorable mix shift?","Richard W. Dreiling","Actually, number one, we don't want to confuse adjusting apparel with adjusting all of non-consumables. The apparel -- particularly when I talk of apparel, I'm talking about hanging apparel. We have a solid undergarment business, a solid sock business. And I think as you look at -- what we're working on is not adjusting the sales down, doing a better job of managing our sell-through. That's what we're trying to do, is maximize the margin out of those items.","Mary Winn Gordon","And Paul, that business that Rick is talking about is only about 2% of our total when he talks about hanging apparels. And do keep that in mind.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Heinbockel, Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So when you look at the shrink over $5, is that more discretionary? Or is that HBA, OTC, or other consumables?","Richard W. Dreiling","I would call it discretionary inside the HBA category. So think in terms of a high-dollar eyeliner.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So there should be -- in importing employees, fixturing to curtail that, is there a plan to do that? I would think that's something that could be done relatively quickly.","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. As I've said, we've already got 2,600 stores installed. And you have to install them, then you have to go through the shrink cycle to see what happens. And I'm very pleased with the progress we've made on that particular effort.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So when you think about shrink opportunity, do you think it's more than 50 bps? Or not that much?","Richard W. Dreiling","I would rather not get into that. I will tell you this: as hard as we're working on shrink, the number is still better than it was in 2007 when we started our initiative. So there's -- but I will say there's room for improvement.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. And 2 last things. With tobacco, are you -- as I recall, there was not a lot of incremental labor. And as you put -- put that in the store. Is that right?","Richard W. Dreiling","That is correct.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, do you think discretion -- or you talked about improvement, you think discretionary could be or should be positive for the second quarter? Or it won't improve that much?","Richard W. Dreiling","I don't want to really get into that. But I will tell you, it is improving. All right? And again, you've got to remember, I'm not -- I don't want to -- all I can look at is where I am today. And like I said, it is improving.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. Because you would think that there is pent-up demand here as weather gets better in the northern part of the country, right, that there'd be a 4- or 5-week period where people would buy all of their spring stuff all at once.","Richard W. Dreiling","Absolutely.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And that's yet to come. We haven't seen that yet?","Richard W. Dreiling","That's correct.","Operator","Next question, David Mann, Johnson Rice.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","When you look at your performance of discretionary in some of those markets like Florida and Texas, can you just give us a sense on how it performed by -- in the different markets?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I would tell you, the warmer market that haven't been impacted by the weather, our discretionary sales, particularly spring and summer, are just fine.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And then for David Tehle, would you -- when we're looking at the -- your SG&A assumptions that are implicit within guidance, are they a little bit tighter than what you gave us a couple of months ago? And if so, what's going on there?","David M. Tehle","No. I think we're pretty close to what we had talked about before. We always saw ourselves in our guidance leveraging SG&A to the prior year. I will say, in first quarter, we were very impressed with that 37 basis points on a 2.6 comp, as that was beyond -- generally, we guide to a 3 to 3.5 comp. But we definitely have leverage planned in our guidance on SG&A through the back half of the year. But again, I don't think there's anything too unusual about it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Colin McGranahan, Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Why don't we go back and focus on gross margin for a second. First, I think it's the first time that we've kind of maybe gotten a little more understanding of what you're doing with the assortment toward national brands. How do you rectify that problem? Are you going to be taking SKUs out, or adding additional private-label SKUs to try to get the mix shifting back a little bit?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. Actually, I think the answer to that is yes to both. We are going to further expand our private brand presence again this year as we have in the past. But Colin, to be honest with you, we're going to rationalize some of the SKUs that we've put in. And the merchants have a plan to sell it down versus -- it's good merchandise here, and we feel that we can adjust that assortment and tighten it up as we move through the fourth quarter.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And how do you think that impacts the relevance? Obviously, at the time, the strategy to add it was a sales-relevant strategy. So as you start -- I don't want to use, \"unwind,\" but as you kind of self-correct a little bit here, how does that impact your outlook for relevance and comp sales?","Richard W. Dreiling","That's a very fair question, and I do prefer the word \"adjust\" versus even \"unwind.\" Okay? Just adjusted. You got to remember, what we're talking about here is not eliminating the brand. It's eliminating sizes that give the customer a choice. So you're still going to be irrelevant in that you're going to have the national brands, we just don't want to offer as many alternatives in terms of size. That's all.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And then just trying to get my head around the rest of the year being gross margins down 80, 90 basis points. Can you give us any rank ordering or quantification of the various factors there between mix, tobacco impact, shrink and markdowns?","David M. Tehle","I think if you look at it and you're trying to compare it to where -- last year versus this year on those items, tobacco is the largest one, again, compared to last year. I'm not talking about how we updated our guidance, I'm just talking about raw numbers last year versus this year. Mix would be the second one, and again, that would be the mix within consumables, as we've mentioned, going to some lower sales more in the lower-margin consumables. And then the discretionary, the non-consumable being less, the mix piece that that makes up. And then the last factor would be shrink.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. That's super helpful. And David, while I have you, I'll sneak one last question in. Just in terms of capital returned, obviously, a pretty light quarter from repo. Sounds like you're still committed to $500 million for the year. What drove the decision not to buy back more stock in Q1? And how do you think about a dividend at this point?","David M. Tehle","Yes. We -- again, in terms of our capital allocation, we remain committed to investing in the business. It's our #1 priority, opening stores. And again, we reiterated the 635 store openings as our guidance for 2013. We'll invest in the infrastructure to support that store growth because we are a growth story. And then stock buy back is, of course, our next usage of cash. We became investment grade, as you know, relatively recently with Moody's. We already were with S&P. It takes about a 3.0 debt-to-EBITDAR ratio, somewhere in that vicinity, in terms of maintaining that investment-grade rating. That's very important to us. So really, if you look at the quarter, the $20 million of stock that we brought back was pretty much in line with staying at that 3.0 on the debt to EBITDAR.","Operator","Next question will come from Greg Hessler, Bank of America.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I think you actually answered my question with the last one. But just to confirm, you guys are still committed to the 3x lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR target?","David M. Tehle","Yes. I think as we look at our business long term, clearly, being investment grade is important to us. And that 3.0 is what drives that. Now I will say, on our last call, we mentioned that if there are circumstances in the debt or equity markets, changes that we deem it'd be prudent for us to temporarily increase or decrease our debt levels, we may do so. And I just want to reiterate that. Again, that was in on our last conference call. But clearly, on a long-term basis, we are targeting investment grade and targeting net debt to EBITDAR of 3.0.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And if you temporarily increased it, would the goal still be to maintain the investment-grade rating?","David M. Tehle","Yes.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then last question from me, just in terms of working capital for the quarter, AP was a decent drain. Can you just kind of walk through that and what your expectations are for working capital for the rest of the year?","David M. Tehle","Well, we don't give guidance on working capital. But I can talk a little bit about what happened in the quarter, particularly on accounts payable. A chunk of that was related to tobacco. We had a lot of receipts come in in tobacco, as I'm sure you're aware, as we are stocking stores. And the terms on tobacco are very, very, very, quick in terms of how you have to pay it. And so that was probably the biggest thing. And then we had a few more perishables come in, beer and wine, things of that nature. And again, those tend to be items that have quick payment terms. I think that was probably the biggest issue in the quarter, with tobacco being the biggest single issue.","Operator","Our next question will come from Edward Kelly, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Rick, can we just quickly just go back to the gross margin? I guess, as we think about your initial expectation going into the year of it being up, x tobacco, now it's down, could you just maybe sort of -- I know we could've gone through this a few ways, but just rank what's the biggest issue that has changed your expectation. And then for the rest of the year, why wouldn't the gross margin get better? Because other than tobacco, which I know is an increased headwind, it feels like some of these other items, like discretionary getting a little bit better, easier comparisons, shrinkage should, I would think, be able to work. So why wouldn't Q1 really be the low point and then improve from here?","David M. Tehle","Yes. Let me take a shot at that. Again, as we look at our guidance for the year, the biggest factors -- now we're talking of the change in terms of what changed from the last guidance, different from comparing to last year that we talked about previously, if you talk abut the change, clearly, the mix issue is the biggest issue we're looking at, the mix of sales to consumable and then the mix within the consumables category to the lower-margin items. And it's just the way we're calling it. To answer your question, for the rest of the year in terms of what we're looking at, we're seeing -- we see that skewing differently than when we did our guidance previously in March. And then additionally, we mentioned shrink, and shrink is planned to be worse for the rest of year. And again, that's a new development that we didn't have when we did our guidance in March. We actually thought we'd see improvement in shrink if we got to the end of the year. And we don't see that anymore. And unfortunately, the way shrink works -- a lot of things we're doing that will clearly help us, but the probability of those impacting this year is pretty remote. That's probably going to be more likely to impact 2014.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And as we think about the gross margin beyond a lot of the noise, which is taking place this year with the roll out of tobacco and stuff, is this the line item that you think you can keep fairly stable over the next few years?","Mary Winn Gordon","Ed, you just said margins could be stable?","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. The gross margin. Do think this is an item that, longer term, you can keep relatively stable beyond this year?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I mean, I think -- I mean, you're asking me to look pretty far out here, and you have to take into account the competitive situation, the environment you're in. But, Ed, I do fall back to -- I believe we've got one of the robust -- the most robust category management programs in place here. And the beauty about category management, it's all about puts and takes, and you're constantly moving around, doing what's right for the business and right for the margin. I think in terms of sourcing, I think there's still a tremendous opportunity there, particularly when the non-consumable side of the business starts to gain a little traction again. The private brand business for us, we continue to be amazed at the number of items we can add. Distribution and transportation, I have to say, our sourcing team continues to surprise us on how they can cube out a truck and cut back on stem miles. I see no reason for that to abate. Yes, another distribution center coming online toward the first quarter of next year that I think will do, again, give us opportunity to help on the margin. And shrink, I have to say, I've been doing this for a long period of time. Even before our shrink went a little sideways a couple of quarters ago, I -- we still saw room for improvement there, as good as we've done and as far as we've come. And the thing about shrink, it's just not a straight line to the top. It -- you do really well for a period of time, and then you kind of have to realign everything and get after it. So I will tell you that my view is, as I look out down the road, I feel as good about our ability to manage the margin in the future as I do today.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mark Miller, William Blair.","Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","A question about store manager turnover. I know last quarter you had upbeat comments about that. Can you share with us what you're seeing here in 2013? And I was wondering if you see a risk that turnover could rise as employment opportunities are better in the market? That has happened in the past and might make that -- might that make it tougher to bring shrink down? So I'm speaking about a cyclical headwind here.","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. Hey, Mark, there's no doubt that store manager turnover and shrink, there is a direct correlation. Right? And there's also a direct correlation to store standards and customer service. Our store manager turnover at the conclusion of the first quarter approved yet again and was down from the previous year. Store manager turnover in retail to me usually runs in the mid- to high-20s, and we're rapidly getting into that, getting towards that number. I do think the advantage that we have with our store managers today, as I look at it over the last -- particularly the last 5 years, is -- my view is the quickest way to a store manager's heart is through their wallet. And the company has performed very well, and we're paying out bonuses better, much better than they've been in the past. So I look at the store manager turnover in 2012 as the best it's been in 5 years. It is not -- has not changed. And I think we're going to be able to hold on to them.","Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And I have a question about tobacco. So it does obviously lift the business as that gets rolled out. Can you just talk about longer term? I mean, obviously, if the category is in decline, what do you think your comps can be there, year 2, year 3? Do you think you can increase that?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I think the -- well, by the way, I agree with you. Tobacco is a very different -- difficult category. We have said that -- there is one good thing about tobacco, why usage goes down every year. The manufacturer increases the cost, which we turn around and then tax increases that we pass on to the consumer. So there is a built-in comp there. The comp we're looking at right now, as we've said, will be about the same as beer and wine for 2012.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Zolidis, Marketing and Research.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A question on traffic. You mentioned it was positive, I think, for the 21st consecutive quarter. In that context, can you talk about the customer demographic? Are you seeing a deceleration of higher-income customers coming into the store? How has your customer kind of changed compared to 2 to 3 years ago in terms of income profile? And what do you expect going forward in terms of which new customers you're most likely to attract and you hope to help you drive the business?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, good question. The core customer for us in terms of the amount of our sales that they are generating remains as consistent as it's been the last 3 or 4 years. There is no evidence at this time that there's a change with the trade-down customer or the trade-in customer. I have not seen anything that indicates that. I can tell you -- you do your market research, John, with the customer about every year. The last time we did that, which was probably 3 or 4 months ago, there was no indication from the higher demographic that if the economy got significantly better, that they were going to trade out of the channel. And again, though, it's too soon for me to tell you that as we begin to move through the year. But right now, the fastest-growing customer segment we still have is that customer that's around $7,000 -- $50,000 to $70,000 a year, which is above the income of our core customer.","Operator","Next question, Dutch Fox, FBR Capital Markets.","Dutch Fox - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So moving over to the balance sheet, I was curious. Could you talk to us a little bit about the inventory we built -- build we saw this quarter? What that primarily related to tobacco? And if it was, should we continue to expect 10 plus or so per square foot growth in inventory over the course of the year? And I have a quick follow-up to -- answer to a question you guys gave a little bit earlier.","David M. Tehle","Sure. If we look at our inventories for the quarter, our turns were 5.0 in the quarter. If we look at the increase, as you mentioned, we were up about 14%, which is higher than we'd like to be. We added new items in 2012 that rolled over. And then as Rick mentioned, we did a lot of planogram work in first quarter. We pushed a lot of the things we would have done later in the year into first quarter to get a head start on it. So with those planogram shifts, we brought in more inventory. And then certainly, as you mentioned, we had the tobacco inventory that came in in one fell swoop and hit us. Keep in mind, as we look at our inventory, the vast majority of the increase that we have is in our core inventory, and a large piece of that is in our consumable side of the house overall. As we look at inventory for the year, and we mentioned this last time, we see the inventory staying pretty close to where it is short term. But then as we get to the back half of the year, seeing improvement in terms of the inventory growth versus the sales growth and getting more in line with sales growth, i.e., inventory growing closer to the rate that we see sales growing. So that's how we're calling it right now.","Richard W. Dreiling","And, Dutch, I'd like to throw in -- my personal contribution of the inventory growth is the in-stock initiatives, that we're very committed to being in stock, and that's creating a little bit of growth, too.","Dutch Fox - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And Rick, just to clarify on an answer you gave to a previous question when asked about trends in managing, you said you were smack dab in the middle of guidance. Can you -- are you talking about the 4 to 5 guidance for the year? Quarter-to-date, you're running something better than a 4. Is that what you're trying to say?","Richard W. Dreiling","I'm just saying that I'm really pleased with where sales are so far in this quarter on this day.","Mary Winn Gordon","Well, with it -- Dutch, it's Mary Winn. With the update on our guidance, where we just updated to that 4 to 5, I think you -- we said we had a solid start to the quarter, so you would start to see some acceleration there.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dan Wewer, Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So Rick, as I recall, Buck Holdings has 3 seats on your Board of Directors. But if their ownership drops below 5%, they no longer have that guaranteed representation. Can you tell us how you're thinking about changing the board going forward in light of their ownership change?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. The first thing I'd like to say, Dan -- and by the way, it's very -- another very fair question. First thing I'd like to say is you're talking about Adrian Jones, Mike and Raj. And I would just like to say, the value they've added to that Board of Directors over the last 5 years has just been -- it's been sensational. It's been great working with them. As we move through the course of the year, it's fair to say we'll need to step back and take a look at that. We just recently elected them for another year. And I think as we move through the year, we'll take a look at that. Now I have asked Mike Calbert, who I believe to be one of the best business partners I've had, to stay on as lead director. And he has agreed to that. But then we'll work our way through the other 2 seats as we move through the year.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just to beat the dead horse one more time, I think what's a little puzzling for those of us on the call are, one, why are you lowering the high end of the comp sales guidance from 6% to 5%? I mean, it's a small change to begin with, particularly if you're indicating you're off to a solid start in the second quarter. And then further, and not to talk about the reasons why the margin guidance is dropping, but gosh, it was only March 25 that the company last gave guidance. And we knew at that time there was going to be significant growth in these higher-priced SKUs that are susceptible to shrink and you have a lot of experienced people in your staff. So I'm just -- those are the 2 things I think are really puzzling.","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, Dan. I think that -- and again, I think that's, again, a quality question here. I think that -- I've always prided myself on being incredibly transparent and calling it like I see it when I see it. And we moved into March knowing that it was going to be tough period. And we didn't fare through it as well as we thought we would, but the thing that we did see is when we came out of March -- and by the way, in March, we were up against a double-digit comp from the previous year. We didn't see April catch as fast as we thought it was going to. In fact, we went through a couple of weeks in April before the sales started to accelerate. And what we have noticed over the course of the last few weeks is, no doubt, a shift that's taking place within consumables, as well as the non-consumable side. And while we are better off in non-consumables today than where we were in the first quarter, we're still not where we want to be. And I thought it was prudent since a 4 to 5 comp is still a -- which I think is a pretty healthy comp to stand up to, I thought it was prudent to just tell you what I was thinking. In regards to the margin, while you're seeing that mix, that mix change in non-consumables, you're -- excuse me, you're also seeing a mix change in consumables and the customers gravitating into a lower-margin national brand item. And we haven't seen a lot of that before. And again, that comes back to -- I think we were a little overzealous in adding SKUs in there.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So when you were completing cycle inventories after you cut off the fiscal year 2012, that's when you began to get some bad numbers roll in?","Richard W. Dreiling","No, I had -- I don't want to incur that we're seeing bad numbers. What I'm seeing is as we move through March, we started to see a change in the purchasing pattern of the customer. Our traffic's great, the basket is great, it's just what they're buying is just a little bit different. And we also thought that we would see more progress on the shrink side of the ledger. And it's proving to be a little bit more difficult. And again, that's why we're -- that's how we're -- that's why we're looking at that. So...","Operator","Our next question will come from Peter Keith, Piper Jaffray.","Peter J. Keith - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just want to wrap up with a question on Phase 5 and kind of how you're thinking about that as a sales benefit for the full year. It looks like you're bringing in mostly HBA inventory. And kind of in that context, your main competitor in this space has talked about HBA inventory kind of having a long sales ramp because it turns slower. So could you kind of summarize how Phase 5 has fit into the guidance in terms -- if there is a benefit? Or we should be patient on the ramp that you're going to see from the new inventory?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I think as I look at Phase 5, it's HBA, but it's also some grocery -- consumable items, too. Think in terms of paper, in terms of the chemical side of the business. We do particularly good in candy and snacks. So there is the non -- the consumable as well as the HBA. I will tell you, those stores that have been completed, and it's awfully soon to tell, the consumer has to find the product, realize it's there, but they're already running 1% above what they were trending and continuing to improve on that. So we feel pretty good about that, that group of stores.","Mary Winn Gordon","All right. Operator, I think we're at the top of the hour. So with that, we will conclude our call. Thank you very much for your interest in Dollar General. Emma Jo and I are around all day. I know we're leaving a few people in the queue, and I do apologize on that, but please feel free to give us a call. And we look forward to talking to you soon.

Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As we expected when we gave our first quarter outlook in March, the challenges of weather, the heightened competitive environment and the current economic environment continued to impact our sales. However, as we reported today, our first quarter sales performance proved to even be more challenging than anticipated. As we said in March, as the weather normalized, our sales trends improved. We saw a turn in our business during April, even as we take into account the Easter shift. That momentum has continued quarter-to-date. In quarter two we are seeing strength across both our consumables and the non-consumable categories. ","The impact of the inclement weather across much of the country affected each first of the month in the quarter, typically the strongest sales week. So we essentially lost the opportunity for sales across the first of each month. Although our sales performance was softer than we anticipated for the first quarter, there were several positive highlights. For example, in addition to the favorable impact of the Easter shift on Easter related sales, we saw an improvement in our comp sales trends across the store as we moved through April. Based on our current sales trends, I believe that we are starting to see our initiatives gain traction, albeit a little later than we had anticipated. ","David will provide more details on our financial results in a moment, but I want to share just a few highlights. Our net sales increased 6.8% over last year to over $4.5 billion. Same store sales grew 1.5%. We are pleased to report that both customer traffic and average tickets increased for the 25th consecutive quarter. As expected, April was stronger than February and March for several reasons, including the shift in timing of Easter. We had a very good Easter as we saw our sell through rate increase significantly from prior years Easter sales. Our gross margin as a percentage of sales declined 57 basis points, primarily due to the increase in the sales of lower margin consumables, including tobacco and perishables as a percentage of overall sales. ","SG&A increased by 37 basis points, primarily the results of deleverage on rent and utility cost, resulting in part from our same store sales performance, as well as additional cost incurred due to the extreme winter weather. ","Net income was $222 million. Earnings per diluted share was $0.72 at the low end of our guidance. We returned $800 million in cash to shareholders through the repurchase 14.1million shares of stock, bringing our total cash returned to shareholder since the inception of our store repurchase program in December of 2011 to $2.3 billion. We are maintaining our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year. ","I\u2019ll talk more about our operating initiatives for 2014 in a moment, but now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to David. ","David Tehle","Thank you, Rick, and good morning everyone. Rick covered the highlights of our first quarter sales performance. So I\u2019ll share more details on the rest of the results, starting with gross profit. Gross profit increased 5% for the quarter, with a 57 basis point decrease in gross profit rate of 30.0% of sales. This decrease was primarily driven by the higher mix of lower margin consumables, which include tobacco and perishables. In addition, we incurred higher markdowns, primarily due to promotional activities in consumables, which were partially offset by better initial markups. ","SG&A expense increased 9% to $978 million or 21.6% of sales, an increase of 37 basis points over the 2013 period. The impact of lower sales growth affected our ability to leverage our fixed cost, with rent and utilities having the most significant impact. Adverse weather also contributed to higher utility costs. As we called out in the fourth quarter, SG&A in 2014 is impacted by the sale leaseback transaction, adding about 5 basis points in the first quarter. Decreases in workers compensation and general liability expenses partially offset the overall increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales. ","As of May 2, total merchandise inventories were $2.6 billion, up 1% on a per store basis. Over the last five quarters, we\u2019ve made great progress in managing our inventory growth to be in line with sales growth. We are very pleased with our performance here. ","We generated cash from operations of $251 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $84 million, including $27 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores, $25 million related to new lease stores, $14 million for information systems upgrade and technology related projects, $12 million for distribution and transportations and $6 million for stores we built. ","Regarding our share repurchase program, as Rick mentioned, we repurchased 14.1 million shares for $800 million in the first quarter. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we\u2019ve repurchased 44.5 million shares, with a total return of cash to shareholders of $2.3 billion. We currently have a remaining authorization of $223 million.","Turning now to guidance. At the time of our fourth quarter earnings call in March, we provided a significant amount of detail to help you build your models. Looking forward, we continue to expect top-line sales for 2014 to increase 8% to 9%. Overall square footage is expected to grow about 6% to 7% and same store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%. While there may be some puts and takes in our operating performance, we are managing the business for the long term benefit of the company and its shareholders. ","We continue to expect diluted earnings per share for the year of $3.45 to $3.55. We\u2019re committed to maintaining our investment grade ratings, while managing to a leverage ratio of approximately three times adjusted debt to EBITDA. This quarter, we temporarily increased our debt level based on our share repurchases in the quarter. We are anticipating that we will repurchase $1.1 billion of our common stock this fiscal year. This includes the $800 million of share repurchases completed in the first quarter. For the year, we plan to open approximately 700 new stores and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Rick. ","Richard Dreiling","Thanks, David. I was pleased to see our overall business trends improve as the quarter progressed and we are well positioned to achieve our 2014 objectives as we enter the second quarter. We remain focused on executing our top priorities and top initiatives supporting our operating priorities in 2014. My goal is to share some of the insights into how we are thinking about sales and initiatives that support projected acceleration of comps sales. ","First, as many of you have consistently heard from me, our disciplined category management is the foundation for our limited assortment offering and staying relevant to our customer. Today, more than ever, given the economic environment that has lingered for quite some time, affordability has now become the focus of our core customer. What affordability means to our customer today is a tradeoff between price and quality that best fits their budget. At times, she is showing a greater willingness to compromise on quality or functionality to get a lower price point to stretch her money. We will never lose sight of our core customer and the trust that she places in us to help her stretch her household budget. ","In the first quarter alone, 49 planograms have been changed to provide more affordable items on our shelf across about 90% of our departments, making it easier for our customers not only to see great value, but also to see affordability. We are leveraging the Smart & Simple private brand. Smart & Simple is a great platform that allows us to offer the lowest opening price points in categories on the shelf. The Smart & Simple brand was launched about six years ago to deliver affordability. Our customer recognizes that the brand is just as the name indicates and does not expect the product to be national brand equivalent like our portfolio of other private brands including Clover Valley, DG health and DG home. Smart & Simple allows us to further expand our product offerings and offer a good product at an opening price point that delivers affordability. This year alone, we will add approximately 40 new Smart & Simple products primarily across food, paper and home cleaning, including items from liquid dish soap to macaroni and cheese. ","This is complimented by SKU additions in key consumable categories such as food, home cleaning and paper products that are again focused on affordability. This includes new items that are a combination of national brands and our private brands. Given our customer search for affordability, we have placed a renewed focus on the sweet spot for our customer across these important categories. Also, we expect to comp positive in tobacco for the year based on our customer shopping patterns for this item. ","Pet Food and related products is an important category for our customers. To capitalize on this trend, we implemented a new planogram with a better flow and brand blocking. At the same time we have a soft launch that is a complete rebranding of our private brand pet offerings, again with a focus on opening price points and affordability. The planogram has a completely new look and a new feel. We are already seeing some positive sales results as a result of this chain as it rolls out across the organization. We have also significantly increased the SKU assortment in the $1 to $5 price point across our non- consumable categories including seasonal, home decor, stationary, accessories and shoes. We are not waiting on the economy to improve for our core customer as she continuous to face headwinds in cost increases. Rather we are sharpening our price points and we expect our diligent work across categories to pay off as we move through the year. Our business is about continuous improvement. ","We are also committed as ever to our philosophy of everyday low price to drive traffic and units. Our customers trust our pricing and we are committed to our brand promise of save time, save money every day. In the current promotional environment, we have begun recently and we\u2019ll continue to selectively and strategically invest in price in key product categories that are sensitive to our customers to reinforce our value message. However, in line with the trust placed in us by our customers, these promotional activities will not be at the expense of EDLP. ","Later in the year, we will launch a DG Digital Coupon platform to accept digital manufacture coupons and capitalize on this growing trend in retail. We have partnered with coupons.com, the leader in digital promotions. Using this platform we will be able to deliver individualized context such as national manufactured coupons and DG exclusive offers to participating customers with the goal to drive trips and basket size. For our customers, the DG Digital Coupon program is flexible, personal, and most importantly incredibly easy to use. Our pilot to 1,000 stores rolls out in the next few weeks with a national launch scheduled for completion by October. Over time, we believe this exciting program will drive shopper engagement. ","Turing to expense control, we are eliminating work that is non-value added across every function in Dollar General, with a concentration on our retail operations. Improving efficiencies in our stores has been and will continue to be a significant priority for Dollar General. This is a two pronged cross functional initiative to create time savings that we can reinvest to better manage our stores and service our customers. First, we are removing non-value added work. And second, we are continuing to eliminate and streamline processes and activities in our stores. We expect these changes to allow our store managers and their teams to enhance their customer service efforts. For example, we have utilized technology to approve our tobacco ordering process and to better facilitate various personnel actions performed by our store managers, both of which provide time savings and improve our visibility to and control around these processes. ","The most significant ongoing work simplification effort relates to our store stocking process. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we rolled out the sorting of our rolltainers in the distribution centers by planogram to eliminate resorting at the stores and to reduce the number of steps or moves required to stock the shelves. We are now rolling out a rolltainer sort that separates promotional merchandise from core merchandise to produce efficiencies in setting promotional planograms and end caps. Throughout the year, we will have several incremental technology improvements that will help our store managers and their teams close the store faster each evening and streamline store reporting of key financial and operational information. ","As I mentioned earlier, we are focused on continuous improvement. As such, we are steadfastly committed to improving strength and to utilizing the store by store optimize shrink level targets developed using applied predictive technology. We know we have a significant room to reduce our inventory strength on a store by store basis, utilizing specific data for each store. This granular approach to controlling and reducing shrink provide us with the ability to prioritize areas for improvement. ","Enhancing our customer satisfaction program is another great example of Dollar General\u2019s dedication to continuous improvement. Earlier this year, we revamped our program with more actionable items directly correlated to store standards, in stock and the checkout experience. These new metrics give us a better view on what our customers want and value in our stores. We expect this program to benefit our customers shopping experience and help drive sales. ","A true hallmark of the strength of Dollar General is our real estate processes for new stores, relocations and remodels. We are highly analytical with a focus on driving returns. We are very pleased with the results of our new stores, remodels and relocations over the past several years. We continue to evolve our traditional Dollar General store and make this small box model even more relevant. In 2015 we\u2019ll enter three new States as we introduce the traditional Dollar General store concept into Oregon, Maine and Rhode Island. These States and many communities with the Dollar General brand will resonate over time. ","We currently have approximately 1,400 of our traditional stores in the new DG 13 format which is a more convenient layout, improved store signage and refreshed yellow and black color steam. This design is delivering a comp lift above what we\u2019ve seen with our previous remodels. Importantly, our customers are excited about the fresh look and shopability of this new layout. We continue to refine our Dollar General Plus model, which is similar to our traditional store, but with wider isles, increased shelf holding power and significantly expanded coolers. The Dollar General Plus format works very well as a replacement for an existing traditional store where customers already know and trust Dollar General and where there\u2019s also a demand for expanded refrigerated food offerings. We will add about 100 Dollar General Plus stores to our fleet this year primarily as a tool for relocations, as the returns are in line with returns on a traditional Dollar General store. ","And finally we are continuing to test new ideas in our Dollar General Market concept. 2014 will be another year of test and learn for this concept for the existing base, with five to six new stores being added as we focus on driving sales, operating profit and returns. At the end of the first quarter, we had 11,338 stores with 83.6 million square feet of selling space in 40 States. Last year, we upgraded our site selection technology in order to fine tune the way we look at opportunities for growth and to help us better understand the long term potential of our small box store. Our new model estimated more than 14,000 additional opportunities for the industry, 40% higher than our previous estimate of 10,000. Importantly, while our new model estimates our opportunities across all urbanicities, the model identified the highest improvement in opportunities in small town and rural markets. This allows us to capitalize on our strong heritage of serving others in these types of high return markets. ","We\u2019ve expanded our test of our Life Cycle remodel program to build our brand position in the marketplace as there\u2019s an opportunity to maximize sales with significantly lower capital expenditures. The Life Cycle remodel test focuses on our Legacy stores that are smaller footprint stores under 6,500 square feet that have not been updated in more than seven years. The Life Cycle remodel improves adjacencies and planogram layouts, allowing for a store that\u2019s closer to the format of our traditional Dollar General that we are building today. Additionally, the number of coolers in these stores is also being increased by four to five cooler doors each or 1,600 to 2,000 incremental cooler doors in total this year. ","We plan to complete 400 of these Life Cycle remodels in 2014, of which we\u2019ve already completed more than 160 since January. These stores are already driving comparable sales with their lower capital spending requirements than a traditional remodel. Over time, we believe we have a significant base of 2,000 stores to 3,000 stores eligible for a Life Cycle remodel. The sales and returns on our new stores, relocations and remodels are strong and we believe that reinvesting our business through growth remains the best use of our capital. In 2014 we are ahead of schedule to open approximately 700 new stores and to relocate or remodel approximately 500 stores in addition to the 400 Life Cycle remodels, resulting in square footage growth of 6% to 7%. ","To wrap up, we\u2019ve started the second quarter with momentum. Our inventories are in good shape. Our balance sheet and cash flows are strong. And we are on track to distribute over $1 billion to our shareholders through the share repurchases in 2014. We have significant organic new store growth opportunities ahead that are high return and play to our strength as we have built organizational capacities in our real Estate function over time. I remain excited about the long term opportunities ahead for Dollar General. My gratitude goes out to more than 103,000 Dollar General employees for all they do to fulfill our mission of serving others. ","With that Mary Winn, I\u2019d be glad to open up the lines for questions. ","Mary Winn Pilkington ","All right. Brandy, if you\u2019ll poll for questions please.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator"," (Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC capital.","Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC capital","Can you help provide some more color around the price investment, across what percent of the store, maybe number of SKUs? Obviously Rick, you've been talking about for a while how it's become a much more competitive environment. So just trying to get an idea around those price investments that we're talking about, especially given the fact that your biggest direct competitor is also talking about more price investments.","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. Scot, here\u2019s how we are looking at this. First off as I look at the competitive environment, while the competitive environment is intense, it is no more intense than it was when we were in the fourth quarter. It just remains more at an elevated level. It\u2019s not like people are doing silly things out there. The second thing in regards to our major competitor out there, I think it\u2019s fair to say they are moving down towards us. I don\u2019t think there should be any worries that they are attempting to get under us. I haven\u2019t seen anything to indicate that at this time. And then in regards to the investments we are making, and I want to reiterate our commitment to EDLP; as we moved into April and into May, some of the high traffic, high penetration items that we\u2019ve seen in the ad, we made a decision to place them in our ad also. And by the way when I say that a handful of items. And you can\u2019t \u2013 our environment you can operate where a competitor has a better price in an ad when you are in the ad with the same item. So, a handful of selective items across consumable categories and again no major change in the competitive environment, and not seeing many changes at all in our price as it relates to where we are against drug, mass or grocery.","Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Got it. And then Rick, you did talk about kind of private label and private label food. Historically you guys talked about there is a lot of brand sensitivity around anything that customers were going to put in or on their bodies, I think is the phrase. Are the customers now at the point where they're becoming more interested in private label food products? Thanks.","Richard Dreiling","Absolutely and that falls to the affordability thing. The private brand, the gap we have in private brand against national brand is pretty significant. And I think, Scot, that provides a wonderful trade down opportunity for our customer. Then you couple that with the work we are doing on SKUs that are between $1 and $5 across the store and you\u2019re getting a pretty powerful 1, 2 punch directed at affordability. ","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss \u2013 JPMorgan","So as we think about EBIT dollars, guidance this year is low to mid-single digit growth. That includes the incentive in healthcare expense build. As we think multi-year, do you think this is a mid-teens bottom line algorithm model, or what's the best way to think about the P&L going forward?","David Tehle","Yeah. This is David. We are not giving long term guidance at this point. But when we gave our guidance back in March, we felt it was important to point out certain specific items that were hitting the P&L that we believe were more temporary in nature. And you called out some of those and obviously we put them in our press release back March. So clearly once you get by those items you get into a more normalized growth rate as you look at the bottom line of Dollar General. So I think getting by those items is important in terms of understanding our story as we move forward to the future. ","Matthew Boss \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then as a follow-up, sales per square foot are approaching about $200 here. How would you rank the productivity opportunities going forward and how do you see your ability to continue to march this metric higher over time?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah, Matt, I\u2019ll take that one. One of the metrics that I\u2019m most proud off is where we are in square footage, sales per square foot. We started about 163 blocks in January of \u201908. We are actually at 220 now and I believe there\u2019s still opportunity there. I can\u2019t look at you and say, \u201cHey is it going to be 250 or 270?\u201d As we continue to refine our mix, maximize category management, believe it or not it\u2019s one of the metrics we look at the hardest and we still think we\u2019ve got room to grow it. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder of Jefferies.","Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","My question was around your initiative with regard to taking price points down. I'm just curious based on what you've seen in April and May if you can talk a little bit about what's happening with AUR, UPT frequency, maybe break it down a little bit for us? And also if you could just comment on whether these are similar type margin items as you had before or is that changing as well?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. First of all I don\u2019t want anybody to think we are out there lowering a lot of prices. Our EDLP position has got us incredibly strong as it relates to our competition out there. What we have done Dan is taken some items in the ad and threw them up with what\u2019s going on around us. And again I think it\u2019s really important that I don\u2019t want anyone to think the competitive environment has changed radically in the course of the last quarter and half. Our average unit retail is slightly down and it\u2019s driven primarily probably by a little bit of deflation that we are seeing in cereals, grain items, sugar, oils and we don\u2019t have offsetting categories because of our limited amount of SKUs in the stored offsets ad. So and in regards to these new items $1 to $5, I would say quite frankly they probably carry margin rates that very similar to what we normally deal with. And in some cases sometimes the lower value rarer SKU, that should actually carry a little more margin. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse.","Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse","A quick question for you just maybe to start on the commentary around the comp performance. You obviously mentioned that things improved in April or May. Is there any more color you can give us there? I was just curious as to whether you're at this point in line with the full-year guidance, or do you need to still drive a continued improvement from here in order to get to that number, particularly as we think about cycling tobacco?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. Let me answer it this way. If I looked how I felt where I\u2019m sitting right now in quarter four or quarter one where I was sitting in the quarter, I feel a whole lot better today. So I think we have seen improving trends the minute the weather changed. So I think we are on track. ","Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse","And Rick, if I remember correctly last quarter you talked about expecting some improvement in the promotional environment I guess throughout the year and how that was sort of factored into how you were thinking about things. Is that still the case or are you now relying more on internal initiatives?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. Very fair question, Ed. I actually thought as the weather would improve that the promotional environment would level off and that hasn\u2019t happened. And we\u2019ve made a decision on a handful of select items where we need to do the right thing for our customer. We\u2019ve done that. But the key takeaway is we have not abandoned our commitments to EDLP. I want to make sure everybody understands we are managing this thing. And I did think the promotional activity would slow down. It\u2019s not any worse, but on the same token we\u2019re not going to wait around until it does. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. One quick follow-up to Ed's question on the guidance there. I guess just to be clear, is the expectation that some of the price investments that you're making on gross margin were basically balanced by some of the cost control initiatives you have put in place? It sounds like they're incremental to what we discussed in the fourth quarter.","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we are working on cost and working on our margin like we always have. And right now our number priority is same store sales growth and we started seeing the momentum shift in April. And we are intent Steve, on keeping that moving. ","Stephen Grambling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then I guess a separate question, which is one of your competitors who -- Family Dollar announced some store closings going on and also slower store growth openings. How do you think about the opportunity there from a market share standpoint and even real estate selection going forward?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah, really solid question. We look at our real estate return every week, look at our projects. We are opening our stores in that 85% to 90% of our same store sales base. As I look at our pro forma and how we are actually performing, we\u2019re at about 101% I believe, actually doing just a little bit better. I actually think that the slowing down of growth in our competitor will lead to better real estate value for us hopefully down the road because there\u2019ll be less people fighting over a site.","Stephen Grambling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And in terms of the closings, do you have any sense for the market share opportunity there?","Richard Dreiling","I think that they are scattered all over and I think we are going to have \u2013 it\u2019s like CBS abandoning cigarettes. I think that\u2019s one of those things we are going to have to let it play out.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Wewer of Raymond James.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Hi, Rick. So Rick, when you joined the Company Dollar General store averaged about $170,000 of inventory. And over the following 3 or 4 years you grew that to about $200,000 per store and your GM ROI increased every year as well. But since 2011 another $30,000 of inventory has been added, but generally has dropped for eight consecutive quarters. So I guess my question is how important is inventory productivity when you're looking at strategic plans, and then particularly when you're looking at the changes in your private label mix, pricing? How will that impact generally going forward?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. I think Dan, as I look this, I think that\u2019s again a really solid observation. And I think if you look over the last couple of years in our desire to become more and more relevant, we added more and more SKUs that quite frankly weren\u2019t turning as fast as we thought they were going to. And I think it was about this time this last year I actually admitted not only were they not turning it fast, but they were actually creating incremental shrink. And we have begun the process now of \u2013 we\u2019ve taken out over 600 of those slower term items that were creating shrink. In fact I think we are just about complete with that process. And we did it without getting incremental markdowns involved with it. I tongue tied for there a minute. ","So to answer your question, I think if you go back to when I first got here, the fruit was much lower on the ground and it was easier to say we needed this and we needed this and we needed this. Now what happens as we fine tune our mix, we are going to have to be a little more select going forward. And I think what we should say as we add more SKUs in the $1 to $5 range, if the affordability strategy works, we should see our inventory turns increased. ","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. And just also one follow-up, maybe for David. We normally don't give too much attention to Company guidance, but I did notice that you're not providing a second quarter guidance, which is -- in past quarters you did provide upcoming guidance. Is there a reason for the omission?","David Tehle","Yeah. That\u2019s really not a change from the past, Dan. In first quarter \u2013 in fourth quarter when we were laying out plans for the year, we did give some first quarter guidance because there were a lot of ins and outs and it was very complicated. But if you go back since we went public in 2009, our goal was to give guidance for the full year and try to steer people to that full year guidance and on a quarterly basis update the full year guidance. And there may have been select time periods over the last five years where we\u2019ll comment on a particular quarter. And certainly as we get to the third quarter and we are talking about the rest of the year, there\u2019s only one quarter left. So by definition we are giving quarterly guidance. But in general we have not given quarterly guidance and that\u2019s not our intent. Again we\u2019d like to have our investors focus more in the long term opportunity with our general than the individual quarters. ","Operator","Your next question comes from David Mann of Johnson Rice.","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice & Company","Good morning Rick and David. In terms of gross margin, I think you had talked about second quarter perhaps getting a little bit better. The first quarter would have been the worst of the year. Given the environment, what you're doing with some pricing, do you still expect that to be the case? And any other puts and takes that you could call out would be appreciated.","David Tehle","Yeah. David, we are not giving specific guidance on gross margin, but let me try to help you a little bit with it. And we tried to spell this out in the fourth quarter when we were talking about the full year and we gave a little more color on some line items. I think we still think that as we get into the back half of the year and we lap tobacco because the rollout last year ended in the June, July time frame, that we should see the comparisons get a little bit easier on the gross margin. To your point, we still haven\u2019t reached that in the second quarter. So there still is pressure, more pressure on the margin in the second quarter than what we\u2019ll see the back half of the year is as we get to the third quarter and the fourth quarter. ","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice & Company","Great. And then as a follow-up, in terms of Family Dollar, when you look at what they've done in the past quarter in terms of taking some price -- or putting through some price investments, how have your stores performed that are near the Family Dollar stores versus the other stores that you have that are not in direct competition with them?","Richard Dreiling","David, I\u2019m not seeing anything different anywhere across the chains.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Just a question regarding the food and consumable categories. Your sales growth was just under 8% this quarter. So you're clearly continuing to gain market share. But that was also the third consecutive quarter of a sequential slowdown in that growth line. I'm just hoping you can speak a little bit more about overall demand of those goods, those basic household goods, and contrast that to all the meaningful additional shelf space that's being allocated across the industry to those products.","Richard Dreiling","I think Paul, as you look at the Nielsen numbers they would actually tell you that the pie is contracting a little bit. And it\u2019s hard to believe that people are eating less or using less detergent, but apparently they are at the end of the day. In fact we actually have market research that talks about how people are trying to stretch one meal into two by adding more starch to the product. I think and I literary looked at this information last night, they literary looked at this last night. The new Nielsen numbers are out and on a four week basis and a 12 week basis, our unit share growth and share growth are accelerating. And I take that as a sign that we are -- the mix we have in the stores, the allocation of product based on how it is in the store is still the right thing to do.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Paul, does that help you?","Paul Trussell \u2013 Deutsche Bank","No, that's helpful. Thank you very much. And then just to follow up, in terms of the color you're giving on gross margin, just to reiterate, in the second half of the year as you cycle tobacco, are you comfortable giving your initiatives that gross margins will be flat to up in the second half?","David Tehle","Yeah. Again we are not giving specific guidance on where we are seeing gross margin, but we do see it getting better than what we saw in the first half of the year, in particular as we get to third and fourth quarter better than what we\u2019ll see in first and second quarter. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin \u2013 Wolfe Research","So I was wondering, Rick, your take on Walmart's Dollar General strategy as they're talking about it, which is to basically open up some of these express stores next to DGs and how the stores perform when you're seeing that activity. And is there anything that you think that they go from a test to a full out roll here -- they're going to do 100 stores this year, that you're going to need to do.","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. I think Walmart is an outstanding competitor. They\u2019re largest retailer in the United States. We have experienced express stores where our stores they\u2019ve been opened up against us. I can tell you in every incidence where that has happened, after one year the stores are comping positive. So it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a major knockout frontier. I do think that when we take the hit, when a Walmart express opens up it\u2019s no different than with another competitor would open up. So I could actually make an argument, if I got them all and did give you an average, it might even be less. I do think that it\u2019s -- the small box is -- I think it\u2019s a different animal to operate in terms of the supply chain. We ship in eaches and rolltainers versus pallets and truckloads. And I think there\u2019s a lot more work there that needs to be done. Albeit Scot, we do have a nice head start too, if you look at 11,000 stores out there. So I think they\u2019re a great competitor. I think they\u2019ve done a lot of fantastic things, but I also think we are going to open up 700 new stores this year. We are going to enter some new markets next year. So I think that we feel pretty good about where we are. ","Scott Mushkin \u2013 Wolfe Research","So on the same -- thanks for that answer. I actually agree with some of your comments about Walmart. Fresh and Dollar General, a lot of our research suggests that fresh trends are fairly significant and that some of these packaged foods, you were talking about the Nielsen data earlier, that that maybe some people switching to fresh. How does Dollar General deal with the trend for -- it looks like all consumers, even low end consumers, to buy more fresh?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. I think one of the things we are wrestling at is and why use fresh to mean also more organic as well as just fresh produce and fresh meat. I do think that our customer is becoming a little more receptive to the organic and the fat free. I can tell you Scott, when I got here four, five years ago, they actually thought that product cost more. And it probably did now and now it\u2019s actually coming down on the retail. I do know Todd and his team are looking at that. As far as moving into true fresh, true produce, true meat, that\u2019s a little more difficult animal to manage. And the key to us has always been that 7,500 to 10,000 SKUs that are core everyday use and I think will continue to fit well with the people who are really pushing the fresh stuff. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Meredith Adler of Barclays.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to start by just talking about stock buybacks, and I don't know whether you'll add anymore. But you did borrow a bit in the first quarter to buy back stock. And as you said it ended up with leverage. it was a little bit higher. If the stock were to stay depressed, would you be willing to go beyond 1.1 billion of stock repurchases? Would you be willing to stay somewhat leverage or push leverage up a little bit? It seems like the $800 million that you spent so far you probably you did well in terms of where you bought the stock. Would you take advantage of that later in the year?","David Tehle","Yeah. Meredith, this is David. Our target right now today is still to buy back about $1.1 billion of stock. And we have said many times that given conditions in the debt and equity markets, we can temporarily change our thoughts on that, change our debt levels. And we did so in Q1, accelerating our purchases due to what we saw in the stock price. And we believe on a long term basis, this is very positive for all our shareholders, particularly our longer term shareholders. But Rick and I continuously discuss this with our board, but as of right now the $1.1 billion is where we are locked and loaded on. ","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, great, thank you. And then sort of changing gears, these $1 to $5 items and some of the other things that you've been doing to provide a better value, an opening price point in many categories, to what extent would you say that you're getting support from vendors? To what extent are they actually coming up with ideas or being very supportive on developing products and helping to manufacture them? Or is this something you guys are mostly doing on your own?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. Actually Meredith, to be honest it\u2019s a combination of both. I think the affordability idea which we will probably start hearing more about, initiated from our market research and the work that\u2019s being done here. While those are manufacture items, they\u2019re more also what I would quantify as in and out items, like a different brand, an old brand that we are now resurrecting. So it\u2019s really a combination of both. But I will tell you if Todd was sitting here in the room with me he would say that the vendor community is much more receptive to this kind of thinking than they ever have been in the past. ","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. And then I just had one final question about real estate. Somebody already asked you about not having as much competition for real estate from your most similar competitor. But in just more generally, what are you seeing in the real estate environment? Any pressure on rate, rents and any shortages anywhere or do you just still have tons of choice?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. I think the single here that\u2019s the most obvious is we were ahead the 2014 pipeline. We\u2019ve already moved into the 2015 pipeline, which would tell you the availability of the real estate is as strong as it\u2019s been the last couple of years. I would say right now there might be some minor upward pressure in specific pieces of the country, but overall I would tell you the rates that we are negotiating for are very consistent with what we\u2019ve gotten in the last couple of years. In fact I look at you and say we are actually doing better in California.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital","That's great. I hear good things about the real estate you're picking in California, so congratulations."," Richard Dreiling","Yeah. We\u2019ve come a long way on the California thing. We are starting to get really, really excited. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning, everyone. My first question is actually on the apparel business. It looked like there was a nice sequential improvement from Q4. It's still down per foot, but I'm just wondering if you are getting traction from merchandising changes there or if some of that's driven by markdowns?","Richard Dreiling","It\u2019s absolutely driven by merchandising. We are Matt very -- like I said in my script, we are very pleased with what we are seeing on a non-consumable side. You haven\u2019t heard me say that in a long time. ","Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Anything in particular in apparel that's causing that change? It\u2019s like a 9 point change from Q4 to \u2026","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. I\u2019ll tell you and again I never thought I\u2019d say this. It\u2019s women\u2019s hanging apparel and shoes are both doing very well. And what\u2019s happening is it\u2019s starting to drag, the halo affect is starting to drag men to it. There\u2019s been a lot of hard work done on men too. We are pleased with what we are seeing. ","Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, thanks. And then just secondly, the digital coupon strategy that you mentioned, how does that impact the P&L and does it replace any circular marketing expense? If you could just explain how that might play out over time.","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. Matt, it\u2019s all \u2013 it\u2019s driven by manufacturer expense. It\u2019s all the FFI coupons that you historically see in the Sunday newspaper. We are going to take all of that digital and then of course sooner or later we\u2019ll probably add some DG offers along with it but there\u2019ll be no P&L hit with the implementation of the program. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Chuck Grom at Sterne, Agee & Leach.","Chuck Grom \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach","Good morning guys. How are you? Just looking back, Rick, part of your success since you became CEO has been the price lead and kind of adopting the Costco philosophy on everyday low price. And I think we'd all agree that's been the right formula. And I believe some of our price work and others would show that the lead relative [FDO] got pretty wide the past few years, and some studies say 3% to 7%. And as you look forward and as that gap begins to narrow and they get to par with you, which I think they're starting to do on some categories, how do you respond to keep that customer coming back to Dollar General, that customer that you've earned over the past few years? Just how do you guys react?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. I think by the way your call out is right on. It\u2019s about what the gap is. Now were the gap narrowing? We still significantly have some lead here yet but I think at the end of the day Chuck if that were to happen, if there were to be parity down the road, if that were to happen it would turn into an execution thing. And that would be the ability for us to conceptually take what we got and make sure it translates its way into the store which I think most people will tell you that we are very good at. And I never, never want to sell short our ability in category managing and the fact that we have one of the best category management program around. And that\u2019s how you stay relevant it\u2019s not just having the right products, you have to have the right items at the right time at the right price. And I happen to think we are very good at that. ","Chuck Grom \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, I'd agree. And then the follow-up with that, one for David, just when you went through the components of the guidance in March you guided EBITDA growth of I believe 2% to 5%. With presumably more buybacks front end loaded, and I think probably most people have in their malls. it would be appear that maybe the [guided] -- the EBITDA growth would be at the lower end of that range. is that kind of how the math plays out this year for you guys or is it still at the midpoint of that range for the year?","David Tehle","Yeah, I think as we look at it, Chuck, and again we\u2019re not giving specific numbers there, but the impact -- if you put in the impact of the share buyback and you put it all together, I think the range on the operating profit growth is still -- if you look at that, it doesn\u2019t change it all that much from what we had said previously in terms of the high end of the guidance there. so it doesn\u2019t have a significant impact on that overall.","Chuck Grom \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, thanks, David. And then just one more just if I could on new store productivity. it was on our math around 74% which is a little bit lower than what you guys have been running. I didn\u2019t know if there were some late in the quarter openings that maybe pushed that number down or if you were seeing something else that led it to be only 74%.","Richard Dreiling","No. As I said, it\u2019s in the 85% to 90% range and I\u2019m pretty comfortable with that number, Chuck.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenhiem Securities.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenhiem Partners","Let me ask you about discretionary sales trend here. So in the sequential improvement you\u2019ve seen, how broad based is that and have we turned positive yet in discretionary comps? And do you think that -- can you consistently grow that business with the low end consumer stressed the way they are?","Richard Dreiling","The improvement that we started seeing in April and into May is broad-based across all the categories and it\u2019s fair to say that non-consumables are running positive. now there\u2019s puts and takes in there, but we are running positive in non-consumables.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenhiem Partners","As a group?","Richard Dreiling","yeah, but I would say if you looked at all the categories within there, it\u2019s probably as closest as it\u2019s been in a long time in terms of the boat is floating pretty easily. and more importantly John, it\u2019s been -- we\u2019ve got a great team that\u2019s working really hard on it. It\u2019s taking us a while. I still believe the non-consumable side of the business is incredibly important to us, and I actually believe that\u2019s how we\u2019ll grow the basket long term. And I think the trouble with non-consumable stuff -- with your extensive retail background, it takes a while for your initiative to gain traction where the consumer comes in and actually sees something different, something new. and that I think is actually what\u2019s starting to happen.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenhiem Partners","So can we actually -- when you think about -- it's not too early to think about the holiday. You think about the setup it would be easy to compare weather to the calendar, et cetera. Are you more optimistic about going into holidays than you\u2019ve been in a while, a couple of years?","Richard Dreiling","I think -- again if I had Vasos with me, he would tell you the offering we have for Christmas is pretty doggone strong and it\u2019s built around affordability. It is going to be a very interesting holiday for us. Having said that, we\u2019ll talk more about that probably as we get a little bit closer to it.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenhiem Partners","And then you didn\u2019t really talk about the tobacco attachment metrics. have they continued to improve sequentially?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. I\u2019ll give you the latest cut I\u2019ve got on it, John. 31% of our cigarette purchases are cigarettes only. 27% are tobacco plus one or two items, but the big number now is 42% of tobacco purchases have three or more items. So it\u2019s continuing to move exactly as we projected. And I was going to say the basket is growing with it.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenhiem Partners","I was going to say, based on that, is there any clever way to get more than your fair share of the CDS customers or -- not really just got to -- they\u2019ll come in if you\u2019re close to their store.","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. I think the trouble when someone gives us something like that, it\u2019s going to go a little bit everywhere. And I think what we have to do, John is just let that play out and see what actually happens.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anthony Chukumba of BB&T Capital Markets.","Anthony Chukumba \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Just had a question on inventory strength. This is the first quarter in a while that you haven\u2019t specifically called out inventory strength as a headwind to your gross margin. So I just wanted to make sure that you are seeing inventory strength improvements. And to the extent that you are, what is driving that? Thank you.","David Tehle","We didn\u2019t call it out because it wasn\u2019t significant enough to be called out, but it\u2019s still a little bit of a headwind for us as we look at strength and where we\u2019d like to be versus where we had planned us to be. But again not enough to be called out as it was in some previous quarters overall. We continue to have quite an effort going on in terms of things that we\u2019re doing with our defensive merchandizing, our corkscrew pegs, our anti-screw pegs, a lot of new thoughts in terms of additional things we\u2019ll be doing, particularly when it comes to DSD and some of the more high shrinkage items that we have there. So stay tuned there. So again still not ready to declare victory there, but making progress. a little bit negative, but not enough to call out like it was in prior quarters.","Richard Dreiling","Probably from a headwind to a breeze, right?","Anthony Chukumba \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Got it. And just to clarify then, so it\u2019s still a headwind, not as much of a headwind as it\u2019s been in the past. is that a fair assessment?","David Tehle","Yeah. Again we didn\u2019t feel the need to call it out and in the past it was significant enough that we felt like we needed to call it out.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisor Group.","Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisor Group","Thanks for taking me at the end here. I appreciate you including that. I guess two quick questions. One was more kind of functional. Was wondering, the digital couponing that you\u2019re going to be doing, can you give a little more color? I guess I\u2019m not clear exactly what you\u2019re doing and how that customer is going to access that. Is it just via their phones or I guess computer. How is that going to work functionally?","Richard Dreiling","Yes. so what happens Joe, you can either go into the store or you can go into our website on your laptop and all you do is you sign with a reference number. Most people probably put their phone number in there. And once you sign in, you opt in. you can look at the assortment of coupons and say gees, I want this. Or you could just check the all box and then what we will do is we\u2019ll download all those onto your smartphone. You\u2019ll go in, check out, key in your number and then those coupons will be subtracted from your purchases. It is pretty slick. It\u2019s kind of a loyalty program without all the expense.","Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisor Group","Right. And do you guys have -- and you have enough of a database or I guess it will build as you start the program?","Richard Dreiling","Absolutely. So what will happen is we\u2019ll begin to be able to link purchases to a phone number or groups or phone numbers and be able to market against those. ","Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisor Group","Got it. and then one last question I had sort of bigger picture, but as you guys look at your 11,000 plus stores, can you see any differences based on I guess the -- for lack of, a better equality of the store, the demographic? like the stores that are in better markets or better demographic areas versus those that are in the weaker ones, like do you see a range of -- are people buying different things? Are there just any subtle differences that you can share with us just to get a better sense of where the customer is at?","Richard Dreiling","Joe, this is one of the most interesting businesses I have ever dealt with in that the SKU base is so limited and so narrow and so relevant that it pretty much --- it\u2019s pretty even just about everywhere, regardless of the demographic. and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been so successful with every region in the United States historically trends positive because the model is so basic.","Joe Feldman \u2013 Telsey Advisor Group","Got it. That\u2019s good to hear. Thank you. Appreciate that.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Great. Brandy, that will conclude our call at this point. Thank you everyone for joining us. I know we left a few people in the queue so please feel free to give me a call today or Emma Jo a call and we look forward to updating you as we move through the year. ","Operator","Thank you.

All lines have been place on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded and instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the Company\u2019s earnings press release issued this morning.","Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Thank you, Hope, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Todd Vasos, our CEO and John Garratt, our CFO. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call up for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, News & Events.","Let me caution you that today\u2019s comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, future estimates and other non-historical matters including, but not limited to, our fiscal 2017 financial guidance and store growth plan; investments and initiatives; capital allocation strategy and related expectations; future economic trends or conditions and the pending acquisition of store locations.","Forward-looking statements can be identified because they are not statements of historical fact or use words such as outlook, will, believe, anticipate, expect, forecast, estimate, plan, opportunity, continue, pending, focused on, looking ahead, or goal and similar expressions that concern our strategy, plans, intentions or beliefs about future matters.

We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements which speak only as of today\u2019s date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call, except as may be otherwise required by law.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, Mary Winn and welcome to everyone joining our call. I\u2019m pleased with the way the team managed through the ongoing tough environment across retail during the first quarter, successfully controlling what we can control. Even as we lapped our most challenging sales and earnings results from last year, our earnings per share reflected solid management of the business. In the first quarter, we made progress on the implementation of our key initiatives for the year as we seek to capture growth opportunities over both, the long and short-term.","As we shared with you last quarter, our SG&A investments in 2017 are primarily focused on an increased compensation structure and additional training for our store managers as they play a critical role in our customer experience and the profitability of each store. The team is working to refine and execute our long-term strategy framework that we believe will help to differentiate us from the competition over time.","Let us recap some of the financial results for the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the 2016 quarter.","First quarter net sales increased 6.5% to $5.6 billion; same-store sales grew 0.7% for the quarter; our same-store sales improved as we moved past the combined the effect of the delay in the income tax refunds and the timing shift of the later Easter holiday. Both factors we mentioned on our last call. Same-store sales growth was driven by consumables and apparel, offset by declines in seasonal and home categories. Operating profit was $474 million. For the quarter diluted earnings per share was a $1.02 including approximately $0.01 charge for the early retirement of debt. We continue to increase our overall market share in highly consumables, growing mid single digits, based on the most recent syndicated data over 4, 12, 24, and 52-week periods ending May 6, 2017.","We continue to believe, many of the headwinds we faced in 2016 and are continuing to face are transitory in nature such as the impact of average unit retail price deflation as well as customer behavior that we believe to be associated with changes to the federal SNAP benefits program. Average unit retail price deflation from the combination of lower commodity costs and promotional activity along with the reduction of SNAP benefits continue to weigh on our same-store sales performance in the quarter. As we look ahead, we anticipate lapping some of these effects in the second half of the year.","As John will discuss later on the call, we\u2019re confirming our 2017 diluted EPS guidance of $4.25 to $4.50. Our objective remains to provide our customers with affordability, value and convenience at a time when they need us most.","The team is focused on moving the business forward. During the quarter, we entered into an agreement to purchase 322 store sites located across 36 states from a small box multi price point retailer. The transaction, which was approved by the Federal Trade Commission in April of 2017 is expected to close this month with conversions to the Dollar General banner completed by the end of November. Most of these stores are located in metro areas where we had anticipated future growth for Dollar General, and this pending transaction will allow us to expand in some of these markets at an accelerated pace.","After John reviews additional financial highlights for the quarter and our full year guidance, I will update you on our operating priorities and anticipated integration plans for the store sites that we expect to purchase in June.","Now, let me turn the call over to John","John Garratt","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone.","As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our first quarter, I\u2019ll share more details on the rest of the financial results, starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.7 billion or 30.3% sales, a decrease of 34 basis points from last year\u2019s first quarter. The most significant drivers were higher markdowns, primarily for inventory clearance and promotional activities and greater proportion of sales of consumables which have a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories and the mix within consumables. These factors were partially offset by higher initial markups on inventory purchases.","SG&A expense increased by 34 basis points over the 2016 quarter to $1.2 billion or 21.8% of sales in the first quarter. The majority of the SG&A increase was due to retail labor, primarily our investment in store manager pay and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales; partially offsetting these items were reduction in advertising costs including improvements in our advertising efficiencies and lower waste management costs related to our recycling efforts. Even if we made strategic SG&A investments in our business, we exhibited good underlying expense control discipline.","Moving down the income statement, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.2% as compared to 35.4% in the first quarter last year. Our effective income tax rate was higher this quarter due primarily to the recognition of a tax benefit of approximately $9 million or $0.03 per diluted share in the 2016 first quarter associated with stock-based compensation that did not reoccur in this quarter.","Now, to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter-end, merchandise inventories were $3.3 billion, an increase of 0.5% on a per store basis from the 2016 first quarter. We believe our inventory is in good shape and we\u2019re comfortable with its quality. We generated cash from operations of $510 million in the quarter, an increase of 26% or $107 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. While just over half this increase is due to the timing of income tax payment shifting from the first quarter to the second quarter as compared to 2016, we continue to have strong underlying performance in our cash from operations.","We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through our share repurchases and dividend programs while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation and our investment grade rating. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock for $89 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per common share outstanding, totaling $71 million. Since December 2011 through the end of the first quarter of 2017, we repurchased $4.7 billion or 75.6 million shares of our common stock. As of the end of the first quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $845 million.","Looking ahead, I thought it would be helpful to share with you some key highlights of our anticipated store site purchase that Todd mentioned earlier.","The transaction is forecasted to be modestly accretive to net sales and earnings in fiscal 2017. We expect to incur charges and related expenses associated with the converging of acquired store locations to the Dollar General banner, which we anticipate will be completed by November 2017. These expenses will be primarily related to lease termination costs for a smaller number of overlapping store locations, as well as additional costs related to the pending store locations. We currently anticipate the charge will be approximately $0.02 per share in the 2017 second quarter. Based on our expectations regarding the timing of both the closing of the transaction and the conversion of the site to the Dollar General banner, we estimate that the acquired sites will add about a 100 basis points to our fiscal 2017 net sales growth. Please keep in mind the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions.","Let\u2019s now turn to guidance, which includes the anticipated impact of the pending transaction that I just discussed.","Net sales are forecasted to increase by approximately 5% to 7% as compared with our prior guidance range of 4% to 6%. Our forecast for growth in same-store sales is consistent with our prior guidance range of slightly positive to up 2%. We continue to forecast GAAP diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.50 including modest net accretion from the pending store site acquisition I discussed a moment ago.","Capital spending is forecast to be in the range of $715 million to $765 million, an increase of $65 million from our previous outlook. This increase is related primarily to the conversion of the pending acquisition site. Taking into account the pending acquisitions site for 2017, we now plan to open about 1,290 new stores and to reduce our total fiscal 2017 remodels and relocations by about 140 sites to a total of 760 stores to allow for organizational capacity to execute the incremental new store growth anticipated to result from this transaction. In total, the team expects to execute about 2,050 real estate projects in 2017. Our share repurchase guidance for fiscal 2017 remains unchanged at approximately $450 million.","As you model the balance of 2017, please keep in mind the following. While the sales environment for retail continues to be choppy, we are working aggressively to improve our customer traffic and we believe that we will see positive traffic in the second quarter. We anticipate the mix shift of sales to consumables and the negative mix within consumables that we experienced in the first quarter to continue and modestly accelerate in the 2017 second quarter. We believe that our customer will require sustained improvement and our economic outlook before she is going to increase her spending on discretionary non-consumable items. As you look at the quarterly cadence, both our margin and EPS comparisons to the prior year\u2019s comparable periods begin to ease in the 2017 third quarter.","In closing, we will continue to focus on the things that are within our control, including managing our working capital and always striving to be a low-cost operator. We will also be financially disciplined in our capital allocation.","Now, I would like to turn the call back to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you. As John mentioned, we remain focused on capturing long-term opportunities ahead. In March, I went into some detail on the work that we did to advance our business through a comprehensive strategic review. We\u2019re refining and executing on the plans that resulted from our strategic review of the business, focusing on the actions that we anticipate will have the greatest potential to drive shareholder value over the longer term.","We are well into the process of staffing the strategy group along with the dedicated business leaders and teams that will execute on the initiatives. These plans are a very exciting part of evolving our business, and we believe they will help us remain well-positioned to capture market share in a changing retail landscape. We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. Our ongoing operating priorities remain, first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage.","Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth. In spite of the challenging retail environment, we look to attract and grow new customers and trips and capture share with existing customers. This includes expanding the merchandising initiatives in our existing stores, to drive traffic into those stores, and improve same-store sales. Merchandising initiatives across all four product categories are being executed in a select group of stores to provide consumers with more of the products and brands they want and need to save time and money, every day. The vast majority of this initiative for fiscal 2017 are either completed or expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter. For those that we have completed, the initiatives are performing at or above our expectations. One of the most exciting merchandising changes that we have made is in health and beauty where we have a significant opportunity to increase our share of wallet with our customers through trial and conversion. In beauty, we have redesigned the cosmetic area in the vast majority of our stores to showcase the breadth of on-trend products that we offer at compelling price points.","While this reset has recently been executed across nearly 12,000 sites, we\u2019re seeing improvement in our same-store sales. More planogram changes and visual excitement will be coming to our health categories as well as we look to increase our offering of value-added differentiated products with a focus on health and wellness; nutrition and personal care.","Across merchandising categories, we believe that our planogram changes should continue to build momentum as we move through the year. The remodeling of about 300 traditional stores based on lessons learned from the conversion of acquired sites last year is on track as well. The remodels include increasing the cooler set to 34 doors, an increase of about a 160% on average from the existing cooler footprint for these locations. This allows for a greater perishable assortment which helps drive trips and basket size. Additionally, across about a third of these locations, we are testing an assortment of fresh produce. While it\u2019s still very early, initial remodels are yielding strong same-store sales improvements.","We are strategically investing in the portion of the existing store base that has been open for five years or more that we often refer to as our mature store base. We\u2019re particularly focused on stores that have fewer than 10 cooler doors which in relative terms are expected to drive the highest returns. By the end of 2017, we anticipate that across our store base we will have an average of 17 cooler doors, up from 10 in 2012. Year-to-date, more than 11,500 cooler doors have been installed across the chain to these locations. We are seeing an improvement in transactions.","On the customer side, we are seeing continued opportunities to improve engagement and build loyalty through further integration of our traditional and digital media mix. Our plan is to reach our consumers where, when and how they decide to engage with us. We are also leveraging in-store operational initiatives such as improving our customer experience and our in-stock position. The store operations team has an ongoing intensive effort to improve our in-stocks through training and technology, as product availability is an important driver of our customer satisfaction.","We have ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion through improvements in shrink, global sourcing, private brands, distribution and transportation efficiencies and non-consumable sales. As always, we will continue to work to ensure that our value preposition resonates with our customers. We are committed to providing them with everyday low prices that they know and trust from us. Our goal is to ensure, we are highly relevant for our customers through our ongoing price investment in everyday low price and targeted promotional activity.","We have consistently shared with you one of the keys to our business is growing transactions and units. Our pricing surveys continue to indicate that Dollar General is very well-positioned against all classes of trade and across all geographic regions. We are committed to being priced right for our customers to drive traffic to our stores.","Our focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities is a second priority. We have a proven, high-return, low-risk model that our real estate -- which is our real estate growth. We believe that we can extend this model to opportunistic purchases of the 322 sites. These sites are highly complementary to our long-term, new store growth plans with about 85% located in metro areas. The majority of these sites are in strategic trade areas that we would have anticipated for new store site selection over time. This transaction would allow us to reach certain of these areas faster and potentially more economically with organic growth. We will look to build out these sites, the range of different DG store formats is the strength that we can leverage based on the marketplace along with the opportunity to test new ideas.","Our existing plans for 2017 new store growth remains on track with the goal to make the pending sites as accretive as possible to our new store locations. So, 1,000 new stores anticipated when we announced 2016 year-end earnings are in the pipeline for fiscal 2017.","As John discussed, we expect the transaction to bring our new store count for 2017 to 1,290. We believe we continue to have first mover advantage to secure our best sites, while driving compelling new store average returns of approximately 20%. New store productivity and returns are metrics we constantly monitor to ensure our new store growth is best use of our capital. I continue to be very pleased with our new store returns.","The metrics we use to evaluate our real estate portfolio of new stores include, one, new store productivity as a percent of our comp store sales; second, actual sales performance compared to our pro forma model; third, returns of about 18% to 20%; fourth, cannibalization of our new stores on our comp store base; and finally, a payback period of less than two years. Regardless of the metric, over time, we have seen very consistent performance from our new stores. Given the softness across retail, I\u2019m pleased with how our new stores are performing. We\u2019re committed to ensuring we\u2019re deploying our capital effectively to drive strong financial returns for the long term.","Third, we\u2019ll leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending. All of our spending is filtered through three criteria, first is the customer facing; second, does it align with our strategic priorities; and finally, third, how does it impact our risk profile.","In our stores, we\u2019re focused on simplifying our operations by reducing inventory, product movement within the stores and operating complexity, so our store managers and their teams can reinvest time savings to provide better customer service and a clean in-stock shopping experience for our customers. At the store support center, work elimination and process improvement are ongoing efforts to take cost out of the business. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always seek to be a low-cost operator.","Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people, as we believe that they\u2019re a competitive advantage. As we entered 2017, we made significant investments in compensation and training for our store managers. Our data-driven approach to store manager compensation segments our stores based on the labor market data and store level complexity. Across our existing store, managers, internal promotions and external hires, we\u2019re targeting our investments to drive results.","Overall, while still very early, the strategy for putting the investments to work in the marketplace is off to a good start. For existing store managers, we have seen an improvement of more than 400 basis points of voluntary turnover since the compensation investment. While internal promotions continue to be a great source of store managers who know our culture and processes, we\u2019ve been able to attract experienced retail individuals from sectors of retail that assimilate well to our model and culture. The stores with these new external hires are seeing improved results in associate turnover and positive impacts to same-store sales.","Our organization\u2019s capacity to focus on talent selection, store manager development through great onboarding and training, and open communication are critical to this investment paying off over time.","As I have travelled to our store locations with our field leadership, the feedback and interaction with our store managers on our investment has been extremely positive. The customer experience and the profitability of our stores should benefit over time from this investment, giving how important the leadership of store manager is to these metrics. Our early progress is encouraging.","This year, we are on track to create more than 10,000 new jobs as a result of our planned new store openings and two new state-of-the-art distribution centers. These new jobs help provide our employees with great career growth. We expect to invest more than 1.5 million trainee hours in employees in 2017 to promote education and development, as we look to use our robust and best-in-class training programs to support our commitment to investing in our people and our employees as a competitive advantage.","As for our customers, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions but acknowledge that for our core customer, it is always challenging, given the pressures on her income and spending. Regardless of the economic outlook for our customers, we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General.","We are committed to the long-term growth and to the creation of shareholder value. Our business generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program and anticipated dividends. To the more than 122,000 employees of Dollar General, I want to thank you for your efforts to put our customers at the center of all we do.","With that, Mary Winn, we would like to now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi","Hey, good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question here. I just wanted to ask about the traffic. I know you said that you are expecting it to turn positive in 2Q. But just wanted to see if you could give us maybe a little bit more color on kind of the thoughts behind it and some of those headwinds like you had mentioned being more transitory in nature, particularly as you\u2019re kind of lapping SNAP, and more so if you are seeing any changes on the promotional environment, in particular to some of your traffic driving items that have been inflationary, that would be great?","Todd Vasos","Sure. First of all, we are very, very confident in what we see coming out of our initiatives for 2017. The early results of the initiatives that we put in place in Q1 that have also being put in place so far in Q2 have been very positive. Health and beauty, we called it out in the prepared remarks, I\u2019m very encouraged in seeing that. And I\u2019m very encouraged as well in the big traffic driving areas of our coolers and our perishable type items. We\u2019ve added more than 11,000 cooler doors so far and we\u2019ve got a lot more yet to do as we work through this quarter and even into Q3 on many of those initiatives. So, we are very, very confident in what we see so far that it should help us continue to drive traffic as we move to the back half of the year.","As far as what we\u2019re seeing in some of those transitory type items, we\u2019re seeing deflation start to moderate. As we move through Q1, deflationary pressures from a cost input standpoint, we did see some moderation; we\u2019re not seeing a lot of inflation but we are not seeing a lot of further deflation either. So, it gives us confidence as we move through Q2. And keep in mind, Q3, we saw pretty big deflationary time but as we get passed Q3, those should really start to roll off, at least based on what we see today. And as we look at our SNAP piece that really we start to cycle here in the next month or so, we\u2019re already seeing some effects of that cycling, since the waivers sort of waived in, if you will, by state. And right now, we\u2019ve actually seen where we\u2019ve been running about a 100 basis-point difference in our comp sales performance in those SNAP affected states versus our other states that we operate in; that has now been cut in half; we\u2019re now seeing about 50 basis points of difference. So, we\u2019ve already started to see that moderation and I believe we\u2019ll continue to see that as we move through Q2.","And then lastly, your question on the promotional environment. Promotionally, we\u2019re really seeing about the same that we saw coming out of Q4. Q1 has been about the same. We\u2019re really not seeing a big difference. There\u2019s some pockets here and there of activity. But overall, we feel very confident about our promotional activity. But as you know, we\u2019re more squarely focused on our everyday low prices here. And there, we really feel good about where we are. Our everyday low prices are in the best shape that I think I\u2019ve seen it in the close to nine years that I\u2019ve been here across all geographic areas. So, we feel very good about that as well as we move through and into the second part of the year.","Vincent Sinisi","And just a fast follow-up. We on the phone I\u2019m sure get asked this all the time, when we get asked, you guys had set out some longer term financial growth metrics, I guess it was earlier last year. We know obviously macro changes this year, investing in store manager comp and all that stuff. Do you still though feel good in a more kind of normalized operating environment of the metrics that you did lay out last year?","John Garratt","We still feel good about the fundamentals of the business in a long term growth potential; it\u2019s still our goal to be at 10% growth over the long term. As we look at the business, we still see a tremendous amount of organic growth opportunity, great store level economics, still getting the 20% returns on new store openings, and we\u2019re excited about the additional acquired stores this year that gets us into places we wanted to go, continue to generate a tremendous amount of cash. We mentioned 26% cash growth, even when you strip out some timing with taxes, it was still double-digit cash flow growth this quarter. So, we continue to see a tremendous runway for growth; we\u2019re excited about the initiatives we have in place. We feel we\u2019re in a good position from a pricing standpoint. We believe that combination of value and convenience really resonate with our customer and allows us to continue to grow share. And we continue to have a lot of levers within gross margin and SG&A as the team does a phenomenal job managing and has a great track record of making the right trade off but with an eye on long term and investing where we need to as we have this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Can you give us a little more flavor for how trends unfolded over the course of the quarter? Will we see a drag from the tax refunds? Our sense is you\u2019re probably negative. And then, by the end of the quarter, you were obviously positive, given where the full quarter ended up. Was that solely due to the tax refund drag going away and then the SNAP drag becoming less of an issue or were you able to definitively tie some performance results to the initiatives that took place?","Todd Vasos","Yes. That\u2019s a great question. We saw the quarter unfolding this way, as we said in our prepared remarks, once we got past that delay in the income tax piece and remember also, Easter shift is from March to April this year. Once we got past that combined Easter shift and the tax refund delay, we did see a nice uptick as we got into April, even beyond the Easter shift, we saw that occur. And I think it is a combination of many things. But, I again feel very confident in our initiatives. We could really tie directly a lot of what we saw coming into April because that\u2019s when some of our initiatives really started to take hold. We can really tie directly some of our performance into that. While we\u2019re not happy or satisfied with 70 basis points of comp, we know that we could grow that a lot more over time here. I think in this environment, I think we laid a comp on the table that was very competitive, but with an eye on growing that a lot more as we move to the back half of the year.","Michael Lasser","And then, Todd, my follow-up question is on the merchandise mix that you sold. Do you think you are seeing an economic drag, maybe a pro cyclical drag on some of those discretionary categories where consumers might trade into other retailers as a result of stable or benign economic period and the potential for those to get better in a more challenging environment or is there some influence you can have over the discretionary categories such as those areas can improve independent of macro?","Todd Vasos","As you look at our discretionary categories, prior to Q2 of last year, we had some very nice growth over about six to eight quarters. We believe it\u2019s transitory in nature right now. We believe for a lot of reasons, the customer has been pulling back, been holding back a little bit. Matter of fact, we don\u2019t believe she\u2019s been trading out at all. What we see from our customer data is some of our stronger comps and stronger sales are coming from not only our very strong customers but that next level up, which would have a tendency and propensity to trade out over time, but actually have been our strongest in Q1, our strongest sales driver category of consumer. So, I don\u2019t believe she has been trading out. I just believe that she is in a economic cycle right now where there is a little bit of uncertainty and a little bit of a hold back on these discretionary items. And I believe and feel very confident in what the team has built here on the category management side to take advantage as soon as she starts to loosen the purse strings up a little bit on that non-consumable side of the business.","But to really look at it the proper way, we had a very strong Easter. Matter of fact, Easer was as strong as we\u2019ve seen the last couple, three years. So, it gives us a lot of solace that our non-consumable businesses as well as many of our consumables businesses that we have are trending in the right direction.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Keith","Just a follow-up on that last answer, regarding challenging environment. I guess, Todd, what do you think you need to see with the economy at this point, in order for your customer to loosen up the purse strings?","Todd Vasos","What I think we need to see is a little bit more confidence in what the consumer is seeing today from job growth and wage growth, will it be sustainable? I think that\u2019s the big ticket right now that we\u2019re waiting to happen, I think that they\u2019re waiting to see happen. Our core customer, as you know, doesn\u2019t have large bank accounts to fall back on. And so, during times like these where she\u2019s starting to feel little bit more comfortable because she\u2019s back to work and seeing a little bit of wage growth, she wants to make sure it\u2019s sustainable. The huge downturn that we all experienced in 2008-2009 hit our consumer extremely hard, probably the hardest of any group that was out there. And I think that\u2019s still very fresh in her mind. So, she is making sure that what she\u2019s seeing now is sustainable and can grow over time. And I believe once that happens, we\u2019ll start to see that purse string loosen.","Peter Keith","Maybe on a similar note then. We talk about the discretionary business being a little bit weak starting with Q2 last year. I would think discretionary within your mix would be the area that\u2019s most at risk to losing share to ecom, certainly more so than the consumables. Do you have a perspective on your positioning with ecom today and if there\u2019s potential encroachment?","Todd Vasos","Yes. We see ecommerce about where we had seen it coming out of Q4. Our core customer is the fast follower, there is no doubt. Only about 70% of them today have cell phones -- excuse me smartphones. And I believe that over time, she will probably start to gravitate a little bit more toward online purchasing. But today, all of our work shows that she is still lagging there compared to the rest of the customers and the economy that\u2019s out there. In saying that, we\u2019re working very diligently here as well. Part of our strategic review, as we mentioned, was digital. And we\u2019re working hard to ensure that as our customer starts to gravitate more and more to digital that we\u2019re going to be able to take her along the journey with us and she\u2019ll look to us for her future digital needs like many others do -- other retailers, both online as well as brick and mortar retailers today. So, I don\u2019t see that today though that our core customer is spending a lot more of her disposable income online than she did before. We just don\u2019t see that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JP Morgan.","Matthew Boss","So, on category drivers, I guess how much do you believe tax refunds drove the mix shift towards consumables in the first quarter? And I guess, to go back to some of the comments you had earlier, what\u2019s driving the mix shift acceleration into the second quarter? And within the consumables, I think there was some talk about more micro category -- intra category shift between food and non-food, just if you can parse through some of the 1Q versus what\u2019s continuing in the 2Q and what you\u2019re seeing in that category?","Todd Vasos","As we look at the tax refunds, and I think others have said the same thing, once you don\u2019t have that same refunds, at the same time you never seem to get back all those sales that seem to not be there, right. Now, we got our fair share I think of what came, but it just wasn\u2019t to the extent I believe that it would have been, if they came on time. Now, when saying that, the majority of those sales normally because it\u2019s tax refunds in nature, usually does come in our discretionary categories. So, it did slow our discretionary little bit more than we had anticipated in Q1. What we\u2019re seeing though as we move into Q2 is the continuation of what we saw really in Q1 and that\u2019s the consumer really holding on to our money, spending where her need is the most and that\u2019s been on the consumables side of the businesses. And then, even within that we\u2019re seeing some mix shift inside of the categories where driving the mix to some less profitable areas as well within categories. So that continues to be there. The great thing is we have a great category management team that\u2019s able to watch and see what\u2019s happening and then be able to react to that, so that as we continue to move through Q2 then into the back half of the year, make adjustments. And those adjustments and we\u2019re used to doing this, we do it very well, make those adjustments to work that margin, depending on the way the consumer is shopping. This isn\u2019t anything new. We\u2019ve been doing this for many, many years, and we know how to do it pretty well.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then, just a follow-up. Can you touch on the productivity and return metrics that you are seeing from some of your more recent classes of new stores? I guess just more so, any perspective on what you are seeing from the latest classes versus historically, some of the metrics that you had seen in the past?","John Garratt","We continue the consistent results. We walk you through the key metrics that we look at in terms of new store productivity with that goal as percent of our comp store base being in that 80% to 85%, we remain within there. We continue to see our actual sales performance compared to pro forma very close, ebbs and flows from time to time but hitting those pro formas pretty consistently overt time. We continue to see track returns. We target 18% to 20%. We continue to see our returns tracking towards the high end of that range. We\u2019ve not seen cannibalization move on and this has been pretty consistent, what we expected, and we continue to see a payback period of about two years. We continue to see the same great results that we expect, consistent with performance. And with that in mind, we are very bullish about the future of this. But, obviously, we diligently track these, monitor them very closely and our nimble company that can make adjustments as needed down the road, but right now what we\u2019re seeing we like.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning. This is Actually John [ph] on for Chuck. So, I guess first, I mean, what is the annualized lift that you guys expect to see to both sales and earnings from these stores that you are acquiring?","John Garratt","In terms of lift, what we said there was we expected to drive a point of total sales growth. So, as we had said in our guidance, we upped it from 4%-6% to 5%-7% and then it doesn\u2019t show up in our comp base until next year, so what we know impacts sales comp.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. But there is no kind of guidance on what that does on an annual basis?","John Garratt","So, on a annual basis from a dollar amount, it\u2019s little over $0.5 billion.","Unidentified Analyst","And then, just switching gears a little bit. It seems like the new store productivity kind of spiked up a bit here in the quarter. I mean, are you guys doing anything different around your new store openings, kind of speak to that or\u2026?","John Garratt","I think it just speaks to we have a tremendous real estate team that continues to hone that model. They do a phenomenal job of finding the best dice and they continue to hone that algorithm, find the best dice, continue to optimize that box. We see ourselves as the innovator in different formats. And what we\u2019re finding is the right format to fit the occasion and seeing the success in the smaller box for instance, which opens up areas that weren\u2019t open to us in the past. So, I think it\u2019s just a testament to the rigor and the capability of the team here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.","Karen Short","Just a question to clarify, is traffic -- did traffic end in a positive note in the quarter and is it positive into the second quarter? Just wanted to clarify that, and then I have another question.","Todd Vasos","Sure. Traffic did spike up obviously in April. Combination of the Easter shift as well as our initiatives, I believe drove that to positive. And we\u2019re not really talking too much about Q2 right now, but we saw some positive momentum coming into Q2 but it\u2019s still very early. So, we don\u2019t want to comment on where we believe that\u2019s going to end up. But again, we\u2019re very, very confident in our initiatives to drive the top line. And we\u2019re looking forward in future quarters to see that traffic move to positive.","Karen Short","And then, you commented I guess the doors testing produce are seeing strong same-store sales. I\u2019m just wondering if you could get a little more granular on what kind of comp lift you\u2019re seeing from this. And then, maybe you could give a little color on how shrink is looking at those doors in particular?","Todd Vasos","When you look at stores that we put produce and again just keep in mind, it\u2019s a very few stores. But, we have seen nice comp lifts in these stores. Now, these same-stores have been remodeled as well. So, we\u2019re watching the comp across all categories within those stores. Produce is helping that comp but even without that those stores are comping very, very well. And it\u2019s really attributable to the amount of cooler doors we\u2019re putting in on the refrigerators and frozen side of that equation, has been well received by the consumers. And we\u2019re starting to really see traffic start to pick up in those stores as word of mouth continues to get out and we\u2019ve got a broader selection of things they need to include better for you type products within those coolers.","So, we\u2019re pretty excited about what we see there but there\u2019s still a lot more yet to figure out on these new stores as it relates to produce. As you know, we\u2019ve been in the produce business for only a short period of time in these stores but we\u2019ve got a lot of experience with them in our market stores. And we\u2019ve taken the learning\u2019s from those and applying them there. And then, as far as the shrink in these stores, a little too early to tell yet. As you know, shrink has a pretty long tail to it. And since we\u2019re just been remodeling these stores recently, a real shrink indication probably won\u2019t be evident until probably latter part of this year in those stores to see exactly how they\u2019re starting to trend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Tanal","So, I just wanted to spend a sec just to understand kind of the analyses that you guys run around traffic to understand whether it\u2019s sort of exogenous or macro or competition. Specifically, I think I get it on the get it on the trade up piece but I wonder about replacement. How do you sort of analyze the idea that while maybe some low end consumers are shopping at discount growth or is there something like that more and maybe that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing less strips? How do you head around that and get comfortable with what\u2019s going on there?","Todd Vasos","The great thing about Dollar General is we do a tremendous amount of work with our customer. I mean, each and every quarter, we reach out and touch our consumer to understand exactly what she is feeling, what she is seeing and what she is doing. We do it on a personal level, then we do it on a macro level as well. And what we see and what we\u2019ve been seeing for the past three quarters including Q1, has been a continued consolidation of her shopping patterns. Shopping less and shopping fewer retailers as she shops, on both sides of that equation. So, she is making decisions on where she shops. And as she does that she is also making decisions that I\u2019m going to shop a little less as well, maybe more less frequently. So, we watch that very carefully. While we have seen the same phenomenon in our business as others have seen based on all the work that we see, we actually have seen the rate of that consolidation quicken in other channels of trade versus ours, while we have still seen a decrease in the amount of time that or amount of shops that she does in a month\u2019s period, we are not seeing the contraction as deep as other classes of trade. But there is still concerns that she is contracting across the board. So that means that while she is shopping, we have to have the right items at the right time at the right price to attract her and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on to make sure that happens.","Stephen Tanal","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I was wondering as well if you would quantify or comment on the uplift from the remodels to sort of like-for-like box?","John Garratt","Yes. We continue to see great performance from the remodels. What we\u2019ve said in the past is in terms of the sales lift we get about 4% to 5%, we continue to get that. And on some of the remodeling, we\u2019re placing more coolers in, we\u2019re seeing a considerably higher lift on that. So, we\u2019ve been very pleased with what we\u2019ve seen as we add coolers to the stores.","Todd Vasos","Yes. When you take a look at our Dollar General traditional plus stores that we are putting as these ones that we are remodeling, we\u2019re seeing three times the comp sales lift in those stores than we\u2019ve seen from a traditional remodel. Remember, we\u2019ve always said, a traditional remodel runs between 4% and 5%, we\u2019re seeing three times that lift from these. So, we\u2019re very encouraged early on in what we\u2019re seeing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Fletcher with Bernstein.","Brandon Fletcher","Our only concern is this, what we like best about you guys is how defensibly you are geographically; we love the more rural locations, especially because that\u2019s hard to replicate and with new distribution centers letting you run efficiencies further out. We think those stores are protected for a long run. Help us understand why you guys like the metro stores as much, especially if we imagine, let\u2019s say produce goes in there? And I don\u2019t know what\u2019s your strategy is for produce, and I know it\u2019s evolving. But we just get nervous that if you have more metro stores and they are doing the same thing that [indiscernible] will do, that competition gets really intense. So, if you could add any color on your strategy around that that would be very useful.","Todd Vasos","Absolutely. Those are great questions and the things that we look at internally here all the time. One thing I think is important to keep in mind is not all metro locations are created equal. There are certain metro areas that actually feel and look more like our rural locations, let me explain, both from a customer standpoint, as far as the demographic is concerned as well as from lack of competition. There\u2019s a lot of metro areas out there that we\u2019re looking at that we\u2019re actually opening, as well as part of the 292 stores that we\u2019re going to be opening from our recent acquisition, many of them are in these areas that have little competition in them as well, because not every metro area has a great amount of competition. So, we\u2019re very selective and we\u2019ve been watching this very carefully over time and feel confident that there\u2019s thousands of opportunities out there metro that meet the criteria we need to be successful. So, stay tuned, continue to watch, but we\u2019re watching it very carefully and we\u2019re very happy what we see early on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenhiem Securities.","John Heinbockel","So, first thing on the acquired stores. So, the productivity is obviously very good because they\u2019re metro stores. How large is the gap in profitability with maybe your overall base or your metro stores? Do you think you need to invest in price and labor in those stores, because maybe that has not happened? And then, what does this do to your expansion profile after 2017, does it come down because you\u2019ve front loaded it somewhat here?","Todd Vasos","As we look at it, John, these stores that we\u2019re acquiring, again top line, as you indicated is pretty good. What I think they\u2019ve been suffering from is really a lack of scale as it related to the profitability and watching it drop to the bottom, as well as a lot of the knowhow that we have on how to run stores from a shrink perspective. So, we believe that the opportunity gap is very large on the profitability side. As we look at price, what we\u2019ve modeled in as we look to purchases is to get them more aligned with where Dollar General pricing is. So, yes, the prices will come down in those areas, but they should because again, we\u2019re all about making sure we drive traffic and units in there. And we believe that the $0.5 billion in sales that these stores are throwing off could also increase very profitably. So, we think we\u2019ve got opportunities both on top line as well as letting it fall right to the bottom line.","John Heinbockel","And then just unrelated, I actually thought the discretionary performance in the fourth quarter was pretty good and one of your better ones in the last year, year and a half, in light of the macro environment. So, maybe touch on that a little bit. And in particular, I was surprised, apparel was as good as it was.","Todd Vasos","As you said, John, while we\u2019re never happy with where we ended up there and we always think there\u2019s more, the team has done a great job in non-consumables. And as you continue to look forward, I believe we\u2019ve got the right product at the right price for what the consumer is looking for in non-consumables. And saying that apparel did do pretty well as we move through Q1. I believe the line-up that we have for spring and summer is one of the best that we\u2019ve seen. But also, the transition out of Q4, which is more of a winter and fall type goods, we were able to take advantage of that as well on a top line with a little bit of the cooler weather start to the quarter one, helped propel little more of that and elongated out a little bit more of the winter goods as well. So, we saw apparel benefit on both sides of that equation. And then, lastly, I mentioned earlier, our seasonal business continues to do very well, and Easter was again one of our best in a couple of three years and not only on consumable candy but also on our non-consumable sides of seasonal. So, we feel we are well-positioned but we are not going to rest until we see comps accelerate a lot more from where they are today in non-consumables.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","I just wanted to get a little bit of handholding around the guidance, and I know you don\u2019t provide quarterly detail. But, as we think about your first quarter metrics from a comp and margin standpoint, how should we think about the puts and takes and the opportunity for improvement in 2Q versus the second half? In particular, on SG&A and gross margins, if you can give just a little bit more detail on how you\u2019re thinking about, again, merchandise mix, markdowns, need for further price investments. And then, we haven\u2019t really touched so much on the expense front around ZBB and what you were able to execute in the first quarter, so some details on that front will be great. Thank you.","John Garratt","Okay. Starting with the overall guidance, that remained unchanged with GAAP EPS guidance remaining at $4.25 to $4.50 that is inclusive of the acquired stores. The thing we mentioned there was that that would be modestly accretive for the year as we have expense on the front end of that, about $0.02 in Q2 and then the backend loaded nature of the openings, we won\u2019t get a full-year benefit; that\u2019ll be towards the end of the year. The other thing we did mention as we continue to see the headwinds we saw in Q1 and the team did a phenomenal job working through that, we continue to see those headwinds coming into Q2. And the other one we mentioned was mix. But as Todd said, we are comfortable with our ability to category management to improve that. And as we get through Q2, we\u2019ll have all our initiatives in place getting into the back half of the year as well as the thing we noted was in Q3 that\u2019s where you see the comps, both from a top line and a bottom line ease. So, we feel good as we get into the back half of the year with those initiatives in place with headwinds starting to subside and the comps easing, we feel good as we get into the back half of the year.","But, we\u2019ve stuck with the same guidance; there are still a lot of year left. Q1 came in about where we expected; so, we thought we would keep the guidance where it\u2019s at for now, but very excited about the acquisition opportunity here and see -- over time that\u2019s going to be accretive to us.","Mary Winn Pilkington","I think that\u2019ll wrap up our call.

Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Thank you, Hope, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Todd Vasos, CEO and John Garratt, our CFO. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call up for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, News & Events.","Let me caution you that today\u2019s comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, future estimates and other non-historical matters including, but not limited to, our fiscal 2017 financial guidance and store growth plan, investments and initiatives, capital allocation strategy and related expectations, future economic trends or conditions and conversion of acquired store locations.","Forward-looking statements can be identified because they are not statements of historical fact or use words such as outlook, will, believe, anticipate, expect, forecast, estimate, plan, opportunity, continue, focused on, intend, looking ahead, or goal and similar expressions that concern our strategy, plans, intentions or beliefs about future matters including factors that can cause actual results or events to differ materially from those projected by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning under Risk Factors in our 2016 Form 10-K filed on March 24, 2017 and in the comments that are made on this call.

Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call, except as may be otherwise required by law.","At the end of our prepared remarks we'll open the call up for your questions. Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up question if necessary. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, Mary Winn and welcome to everyone joining our call.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, our thoughts are with our employees, customers and the local communities impacted by the devastating damage caused by Hurricane Harvey and the record flooding across the region. Our primary concern continues to be the safety of our teams and helping our team members that have been displaced.","Across Dollar General, it has been heartwarming to see the outpouring of support for the Gulf Coast region from our store support center, store operations and distribution and transportation networks.","Turning now to our results, I'm pleased with the strong same-store sales growth during the second quarter, which was driven by both customer basket and positive traffic. As we shared with you last quarter, we anticipated that our traffic will be positive for the second quarter. Our team's execution was strong and I anticipate we will be able to capitalize on the momentum in the business.","In today's dynamic retail and consumer landscape, we continue to make targeted investments in our business to support our focus, strategic and operating initiatives. We believe these investments will contribute to sustainable improvements over time.","As we have shared with you over the last several quarters, we continue to believe that the sales impact of certain headwinds we have been confronting our transitory such as average unit price deflation and customer behavior that we believe to be associated with changes to the federal SNAP benefits program.","Although these macroeconomic headwinds continue to impact our same-store sales performance in the quarter, we believe that macroeconomic factors as a whole have less of an impact on our same-store sales than in recent quarters.","Given the improved performance in our mature store base during the quarter, we also believe that our traffic driving, merchandising and store operation initiatives are beginning to take hold.","Highlights for the second quarter of 2017 include; net sales increased 8.1% to $5.8 billion and same-store sales grew 2.6% as compared to the prior year second quarter. Same-store sales growth was positive for both consumable and combined non-consumable categories with stronger growth in consumables.","Net income was $295 million. Diluted earnings per share of $1.08 included an approximate $2 per share charge associated with acquired stores, primarily for lease termination costs. Year-to-date through the 2017 second quarter, we have returned over $306 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.3 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend.","During the quarter, we closed on the previously announced purchase from a small box, multi price point retailer that resulted in approximately 285 net new sites located across 35 states. Also, we have strengthened the management team with the addition of Jason Reiser as our EVP and Chief Merchandising Officer and Carman Wenkoff as our EVP and Chief Information Officer. I believe both of these innovative and seasoned executives will help us execute our strategic vision and capture future growth opportunities.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to John to go through more details of the quarter and our outlook.","John Garratt","Thank you, Todd and good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our second quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the quarterly financial results starting with gross profit.","Gross profit for the 2017 quarter was $1.8 million or 30.7% of sales, a decline of 47 basis points from last year's second quarter. As compared to the prior year second quarter, higher markdowns, primarily for promotional activities and a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories and the sales mix within consumable, each reduced the gross profit rate.","These factors were partially offset by higher initial markups on inventory purchases and an improvement in our inventory shrink rate. SG&A expense increased by 51 basis points over the 2016 quarter to $1.3 billion or 22.3% of sales in the second quarter.","This quarter's results reflected increased retail labor expenses, primarily as a result of our investment in store manager compensation implemented earlier this year and occupancy cost, both of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales.","In addition, we incurred expenses related to our acquired store location, primarily for lease termination cost. Partially offsetting these items were lower waste management cost, primarily resulting from our recycling efforts, reductions and advertising cost and a reduction in Workers Compensation cost.","Moving down the income statement, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.2% as compared to 36.8% in the second quarter last year. The effective income tax rate was higher in the 2017 second quarter, due primarily to the recognition of a tax benefit in the 2016 period, associated with stock-based compensation that did not reoccur to the same extent in this quarter.","Looking at a few items on our balance sheet and cash flow statement, merchandised inventories in the second quarter were $3.46 billion for the quarter. Total inventory increased 6% while declining 1% on a per store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape and we're comfortable with the quality. Our longer-term goal continues to be inventory growth in line with or below our sales growth.","Year-to-date second quarter, we generated cash from operations of $786 million a 1% decrease from the prior year, primarily due to increased income tax payments, compared to the same period last year as a result of timing of income recognition for tax purposes due to changes in federal income tax regulations. We continue to have solid underlying performance in our cash from operations.","During the quarter, we repurchased one million shares of our common stock for $75 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $71 million. Year-to-date through the end of the second quarter, we've returned cash to shareholders totaling $306 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividends.","From December 2011 through the second quarter of 2017, we repurchased $4.7 billion or 76.7 million shares of our common stock. We have a remaining authorization of approximately $770 million under the repurchase program. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores where we continue to see great returns and the necessary infrastructure to support our store growth.","Our second priority is to returning cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately three times adjusted debt-to-EBITDA.","Looking ahead, please keep a couple of points in mind. Comparisons to 2016 quarterly results are less challenging in the third quarter and more challenging in the fourth quarter. Recall, fiscal 2017 is a 52-week year versus the 2016 53-week year. We estimated that the 53rd week in 2016 contributed about $0.09 per share to earnings that will not occur this year.","We are pleased with our performance at this point in the year. We now forecast GAAP diluted EPS to be $4.35 to $4.50 compared to previous guidance range of $4.25 to $4.50. Our prior same-store sales growth guidance range of slightly positive to an increase of 2% is unchanged. We also continue to expect 2017 net sales to increase by approximately 5% to 7%.","Given our performance in the first half and expectations for the back half of 2017, annual same-store sales is currently anticipated to be closer to the upper end of the range. 2017 capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $715 million to $765 million. Share repurchases for fiscal 2017 continue to be forecasted to be approximately $450 million.","Please keep in mind that our fiscal 2017 financial outlook does not reflect any potential impact from disaster-related expenses including fixed asset and inventory impairment losses related to Hurricane Harvey, given the assessment of damage is still in process.","We remain committed to focusing on the long-term profitable growth and reinvesting in our business and capturing cost savings. We are investing in initiatives and tend to drive same-store sales and build loyalty across our consumer base, with prices that our customers need and trust from us.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thanks John. We are executing our plans which overall are delivering our anticipated results. We are doing what we said we would do. We believe that over time our merchandising initiatives, coupled with our store manager pay and training investments will continue to contribute to our same-store sales growth.","Our real estate model remains healthy and our 2018 new store pipeline is strong and growing. For fiscal 2017 we plan to add about 1,285 new stores including the net acquired sites. Our model of value and convenience is relevant to a broad cross-section of shoppers. I believe the much-reported demise of retail is an inaccurate narrative. Retailer is just changing and we believe that we are very well positioned.","As I listen to the commentary about retail by others, I'm reminded of the many advantages we have at Dollar General and how uniquely positioned we are. I believe it is important for us to keep in mind how Dollar General is different. As we think about our many strengths, a common threat is the combination of value and convenience. I view this combination as a differentiator for us across retail shopping occasions and our customers trip missions.","Our convenient small box stores with strong economics allow us to serve an underserved customer. Our shopping occasions tends to be in a convenient fill-in trip versus a stock-up trip. Our average basket contains about five items with an average ticket of about $12.","Our stores and product mix are designed with convenience in mind, making it easy for our customers to get in, find what they need and beyond their way. We have a range of formats from 3,500 square feet to 16,000 square feet to capture growth opportunities in areas ranging from rural to metro locations.","Our unique geographic footprint of 14,000 brick-and-mortar stores allow us to serve customers in areas where other retailers simply have not been as successful. Our customer is price-sensitive and we're committed to leveraging our buying power to deliver greater value and help her save money.","We believe that we are able to serve our customers so well because we work hard to understand her needs. We continue to look for ways to improve our affordability and value for our customer all while helping her save time. Our everyday low-price positions us well across all classes of trade. We have the ability to capitalize on our track record of innovation in the channel.","We recognize that retail is changing rapidly. At the same time, we believe that we're uniquely positioned to get ahead of these changes with our customers. As with other shopping patterns, behaviors and attitudes, our core customers are later adopters than other segments of the U.S.","This holds true with their digital shopping experience in the categories that are relevant to Dollar General with approximately 75% of the U.S. population within five miles of a Dollar General by the end of fiscal 2017, our opportunity is to help shape our customer's behavior and shopping habits on their digital shopping journey, all while capitalizing on our 14,000 brick-and-mortar stores and our geographic footprint to help them save time and money.","We are executing our comprehensive strategic plans, focusing on the actions that we believe have the greatest potential to drive shareholder value over the longer term. We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. We remain committed to our long-term operating priorities; first driving profitable sales growth, second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage.","Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth. Our goal is to attract and grow new customers and trips and capture share with existing customers. This includes expanding the merchandising initiatives in our existing store base to drive traffic into those stores and improve same-store sales.","Merchandising initiatives within all four product categories are being executed across a range of stores to provide customers with more of the products and brands they want and need to save time and money every day. The vast majority of these initiatives for fiscal 2017 have been implemented.","While it's still early, overall these initiatives are performing at or above our expectations. One of the most exciting merchandising opportunities is across health and beauty, where we have a significant opportunity to increase our share of wallet with our customers through trial and conversion.","In beauty, we redesigned the cosmetic area in a large portion of our stores to highlight the breath of on-trend products that we offer at compelling price points. Within the health departments, we increased our offering of value-added, differentiated products with a focus on health and wellness, nutrition and personal care. In the stores with these resets we are seeing improvements in same-store sales.","We're also on track with remodeling about 300 traditional stores based on conversion of larger square footage sites acquired last year. To date we have completed about 165 of these remodels, which include increasing the cooler set by about 160% on average from the existing cooler footprint for these locations. This allows for a greater perishable assortment that helps drive trips and basket size.","Additionally, across about a third of these locations we are testing assortment of fresh produce. While it's too early, initial remodels are yielding strong same-store sales improvement. Over time we believe that the lessons learned from these 300 or so remodels have the potential for broader application across significant portions of our store base as we refine our criteria to remodel with this new cooler expansion.","We are also strategically investing in a portion of our existing store base that has been open for five years or more, what we often refer to as our mature store base. We are particularly focused on stores that have fewer than 10 cooler doors, which in relative terms are expected to drive the highest returns.","By the end of 2017, we anticipate that across our store base, we will have an average of 17 cooler doors up from 10 in 2012. Year-to-date through the second quarter, approximately 16,000 cooler doors have been installed across the chain. For these locations we are seeing an improvement in transactions.","On the customer side, we are seeing continued opportunity to improve engagement and build loyalty through the expansion of our digital footprint and the further integration of our traditional and digital media mix. Our plan is to reach our customers where, when and how they decide to engage with us.","We are also leveraging in-store operational initiatives such as improving our in-stock position through training and technology and our customer experience. The focus of our store operations is paying off as we have seen sequential improvements over the last six months in our customer satisfaction scores.","We have ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion through improvements and shrink, global sourcing, private brands, distribution transportation efficiencies and non-consumable sales. As always, we will continue to work to ensure that our value proposition resonates with our customers.","We are committed to providing them with everyday low prices that they know and trust. Our goal is to ensure we are highly relevant with our customers through our ongoing investments in everyday low prices and targeted promotional activity.","As we have consistently shared with you, one of the keys to our business is growing transactions in units. Our pricing surveys continue to indicate that Dollar General is very well-positioned from a pricing perspective against all classes of trade and across all geographic regions where we operate. We are committed to being priced right for our customers to drive traffic to our stores.","Our focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities is our second priority. We have a proven high return, low risk model for our real estate growth. Our recently acquired sites are highly complementary to our long-term, new store growth plans with about 85% located in metro areas.","The majority of these sites are in strategic trade areas that we would have anticipated for new store site selection over time and allow us to reach certain of these areas faster and potentially more economically than with organic growth. As we look to build out these sites, the range of different DG store formats is a strength that we can leverage, based on the marketplace along with the opportunity to test new ideas.","Our plans for 2017 new store growth remain on track. I believe we continue to have first mover advantage to secure the best sites while driving compelling new store average returns of approximately 20%. We constantly monitor new store productivity and returns to ensure our new store growth is best use of our capital, focusing on the following five metrics.","New store productivity as a percent of our comp store sales, actual sales performance compared to our pro forma model, returns of 18% to 20%, cannibalization of our new stores on our comp store base and finally a payback period of less than two years.","Regardless of the metric, we have seen consistent performance over time from our new stores which are at or above our targets. I continue to be very pleased with our new store returns. We are committed to deploying our capital effectively to drive strong financial returns for the long-term and we continue to monitor these metrics very closely.","Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending. We are committed to simplifying operations in our stores by reducing inventory, operating complexity and product movement within the stores so that our store managers and their teams can reinvest time savings to provide better customer service and a clean in-stock shopping experience.","At the store support center, work elimination and process improvement also are ongoing efforts to take cost out of the business. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always seek to be a low-cost operator.","Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe that they are a competitive advantage. As we enter 2017, we made significant investments in compensation and training for our store managers. Our data-driven approach to store manager compensation, segments are stores based on labor market data and store level complexity.","Overall while it's still very early, the strategy for putting the investments to work in the marketplace is off to a good start. For existing store managers, we continue to experience a significant improvement in voluntary turnover since making the compensation investment.","While internal promotions continue to be a great source of store managers who know our culture and processes, we have been able to attract experienced leaders from sectors of retail that assimilate well to our model and culture. The stores with these new external hires are seen improve results and associate turnover and positive impacts to same-store sales.","Our organizations, core competencies of talent selection, store manager development through great onboarding and training and open communication will help us ensure that this investment pays off. The customer experience and the profitability of our store should benefit over time from this investment giving how important the leadership of the store manager is to these metrics. Our initial progress is encouraging.","This month I had the opportunity to spend time with more than 1500 leaders of our organization at our Annual Leadership Meeting. I am always energized by their passion and commitment to serving others. This culture is critical part of our success.","Additionally, just two weeks ago, I had the pleasure to attend the opening of our 14,000 store in Dalton, Pennsylvania and to engage with our local store teams and customers. With 14,000 stores and growing, I remain very excited about the opportunities we have as a company.","Although our strategic -- through our strategic plan, the team is continuing to focus on growth that creates value while laying the foundation for future initiatives. As for our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions, but acknowledge that for our core customer it is always challenging given the pressures on her income and spending.","Regardless of the economic outlook for consumers, we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they need and expect from Dollar General. We are committed to our long-term growth and to the creation of shareholder value. Our business generates a significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program and anticipated dividends.","In closing, we are confident that our strategy positions as well for the future. I am very proud of the more than 127,000 employees of Dollar General across our 14,000-store location, 15 distribution centers and here at the store support center. To each employee of Dollar General thank you for your efforts to put our customers first.","With that Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenhiem Securities.","Todd Vasos","Hi John.","John Heinbockel","Hey Todd. So, two questions, one tactical, one strategic. On the tactical side, the markdowns you had in the quarter related generally to what categories and are we through those as we head into the second half?","Todd Vasos","The markdowns John, they were a combination of a few things. Obviously, we had some markdowns as we continue to be very aggressive in our ability to deliver price to the consumer and that was our biggest source of markdowns. So, both promotionally and everyday price lies.","As I said, we're committed to driving traffic in the store and delivering that everyday low price our consumers know and trust from us. There was some other markdowns on some of the seasonal and non-consumable categories, but overall, they were much smaller in nature than the overall promotional activity to drive that topline.","John Heinbockel","All right. And then secondly, more bigger picture when you think about e-commerce, is the nature of the Dollar store customer and box, does it not lend itself operationally to things like focus, a home delivery maybe using an Insta card to ship from store.","Is it just in the case of trying to be simple and low cost? Does it just not work and does your customer not want it?","Todd Vasos","We engage with our customers all the time John to understand where she's at in any given piece of her shopping business, including the digital side and where she's at. I can tell you today that while she is on a digital journey, she is definitely lagging somewhat behind where the total U.S. population is.","I would never say never on any of those points that you bring up, but I can tell you that we're squarely focused on driving our customers into our 14,000 location through any means that she wants to engage with us to include digital.","We're up to nearly 10 million subscribers now on our Digital Coupon platform, which is growing each and every week and that is a great source for her and she gets on our Dollar General App to understand what we offer her long-term.","Now stay tuned, as I mentioned on our last call, one of our strategic initiatives that we launched earlier this year is around digital and how digital will play with our Dollar General consumer as we go forward. So longer term it is initiative, but we'll have some milestones that we'll be to share with you as more comes available John.","John Heinbockel","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett","Todd Vasos","Hi Chuck.","Chuck Grom","Hi. Good morning, everybody. Just on the gross profit margin softens in the quarter you called out several pluses and minus, but curious how you're thinking about the back half of the year and the complexion on the gross margin line?","John Garratt","Yeah. So, as we said, we're very focused on driving traffic and pleased with the results that we got there. As we look long-term, we continue to see opportunities to increase margins or strategically invest back as needed to drive traffic and grow sales.","We're not only commenting specifically on the mix between gross margin SG&A but rest assured we're going to be focused on all the levers within both to deliver that and we continue to the opportunity to improve shrink, pleased with three straight quarters of improvement there.","The team continues to do a very good job of category management while making sure what we have what the customer wants. We continue to see opportunity over time to increase sales of private label, direct foreign sourcing and continue to drive efficiencies on supply chain;","So, we see an opportunity to enhance gross margin over time, but we're going to do what's right for the business for the long-term and making sure we drive that traffic.","Chuck Grom","Okay. That's helpful. And then second question would be you called out traffic as positive in the second quarter. Could you shed some light on the improvement and also how the quarter trended month by month and then perspective on the quarter to date trends and then just geographically any major differences that have more recently and particularly down at Texas, thanks?","Todd Vasos","Chuck, first of all when you take a look, we're very pleased with those traffic numbers turning positive and actually gaining strength as we move through the quarter. The great thing that we've seen is that in the quarter all of our peers were positive and they shaped up very nicely as we expected it would.","And as we look at geographically, I'd tell you that it was very, very balanced throughout the country and obviously we're experienced a little bit of turmoil right now. My heart goes out to those folks down in the Gulf Coast region because they're suffering through a real tough time.","The great thing is that we've got some fabulous people down in that area that are really taking care of our customers. We've had upwards of 300 stores closed at any given time. We're down to probably 100 or less at this point. And I could tell you our teams are working diligently to build a service to that customer down there, but more to come.","Things are pretty fluid still down there. So, we're not able yet to get to a few of our stores just because of the floodwaters and the blockage down there.","Chuck Grom","Okay. Thanks, and good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robbie Ohmes","Oh! Thanks guys for taking my question. I was hoping you could remind us or give us some color on the Dollar Express impact on your results. It look like because of the timing the closing it makes the sort of a simple calculation a new store productivity look a little light for the second quarter, but could you let me know if that's true and how the core new store productivity looked in the second quarter?","And then is there anything that we should anticipate for the back half as those Dollar Express stores come and maybe remind us are they starting with much slower gross margins than chain average? Is there further expense pressure we should think about? Thanks.","John Garratt","So, a couple theses there. in terms of the impact of dollar on Q2 as we head and open these stores yet during that period, we had no revenue, but did have cost associated with that. We had called that out as $0.02 in total and if you look at the SG&A line, if not for the reason we deleverage on SG&A was really a function of that, coupled with the investment we made earlier this year in store manager pay.","Now we're opening these stores, as we get into the back half of the year, we'll have revenue associated with that. We're very excited about these units. They're highly complementary. They're in places that we wanted to go. We feel very confident in our ability to open these and deliver great results with these.","And as we've said before, it would be modestly accretive to the year just given the back loaded nature of getting these stores open and these running costs associated with that.","Robbie Ohmes","Got it. That's helpful and just a separate question, any update on the DGX format and how that did in the second quarter?","John Garratt","As you know, we only have -- we actually have three opened now. We opened our third one just recently in Philadelphia and we're happy with the progress that we've seen there. So obviously with only three stores it really doesn't have a material impact on the total with 14,000.","But the great thing about that format is it allows us to get into highly dense areas, vertical living type areas where in the past, we have not been able to go into and many of those areas as you know houses a lot of that millennial customer that will continue to be a great source of revenue for us and others as they continue to mature in their age curve.","So, we're pretty happy so far, but again with only three, we're just cautiously optimistic about what that could do, but we're also learning at the same time and I'm sure what the box looks like today, will change over time as we learn more and more what the customer wants out of that format.","Robbie Ohmes","Got it. Thanks very much.","John Garratt","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Fletcher with Bernstein.","Brandon Fletcher","Hey guys. Pretty good quarter. My follow-up is actually and I appreciate this strategic outlay it's just a third point, I spent most of my career harvesting expenses and then was amazed at how many more hands were out to invest that money than were out to find similar savings and what I worry about is the discipline you have on real estate is truly fantastic.","Do you feel confident that the same discipline is being applied in other investments? So, when you find an efficiency in freight, when you find something else, do you feel confident that if you don't hand that money back to shareholders, you really are using the same investment rigor to make sure that you're getting a meaningful return in that.","And it's not people just kind of going well, if we didn't do, the sales would be lower, so you have to let me raise the marketing spend or whatever it is. Just love some approach that you guys have on that topic, think you.","Todd Vasos","Yeah, so I would say as with real estate, we're disciplined in all capital and we look at everything through the lens the touch the customer. Does it align with our strategic priorities? Does it put the business at risk and if it doesn't, we don't spend that money?","We have teams dedicated above the expense and capital side. We're moving all those costs to make sure that we're tied on that and the way we look at it, everything has to have a return here and referring back to the new store that I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to see productivity in that 80% to 85% range.","So, seeing great returns still north of the 20% and we target 18% to 20%, still that 20% range. So, we're getting great returns there and feel very good about the targeted investments. I think the other thing I would stress is the investments we've made have been very targeted and we're pleased with the results we're seeing there whether it be the store manager compensation where we see a return there and are pleased with what we're seeing there.","Whether it be what we've done to drive traffic and pleased with the results we've seen in traffic. Whether it be the investments in new stores or required stores, where we see the same compelling returns and great unit level economics.","Brandon Fletcher","Okay. Great. Thanks. And just directionally just as a follow-up that could mean that as you go through this process, you could find that all of the rational investments have been made, some other efficiency comes out and it's still possible for margin to go up in a particular scenario.","I am not saying you're committing to that obviously, but it's still possible, you would still consider that your profit margin might go up if you found all this extra money.","John Garratt","Yeah, we still see opportunity managing all the levers within gross margin and SG&A to enhance our operating margins over time. At times like this year we're make investments, but we see opportunity to enhance that over time given all the levers we have and the team's track record of working these levers very effectively.","Brandon Fletcher","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Todd Vasos","Vincent, how are you?","Vincent Sinisi","Hey guys, good morning. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Doing okay here. Thanks. Wanted to just kind of get your view of the launch, I know you said you continue to see constrained consumer what not, but obviously during the second quarter, it was encouraging to see the positive ticket as well as traffic.","How would you kind of parse that out to you were going up against some of the onset of the heavier promos last year, the snap reduction, but knowing that you're expecting to be toward the upper end of the range for the full year.","So what are you seeing out of that consumer? What's in the basket and maybe any commentary on more discretionary categories as well as we get into the second half here?","Todd Vasos","Vinnie, when we took a look at the quarter, the consumer it was behaving about where we thought that she was at in her economic cycle and that is she's feeling a little bit better, but always keep in mind this consumer is always stretched because of her economic condition as well as the expenses that she has in front of her.","In saying that, I think the company did a great job; our merchants, our operators in delivering a real good product to that consumer. Our consumable business, definitely outpaced out non-consumable business, but it was very good to see both were positive albeit consumables being a little bit more positive. So, as you looked at that basket, there was more consumables in that basket than none.","The great thing I believe that we had to look forward to is I look to the back half of the year and I look at what we have for fourth quarter Christmas holiday selling season, we have a great lineup ahead of us and we're fairly bullish on what that should return as far as what the consumer will gravitate to.","The product looks great. It's great value and with our 14,000 store convenient locations, I believe that we're set up pretty well for the back half of the year.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay. That's helpful. And just for the follow-up if I could go back to store growth for a second, so we know obviously that you have only three at the moment. Also, the smaller kind of fixed housing foot stores. Are you guys seeing pretty consistent performance within those specific smaller formats?","And as you're looking at some of your real estate possible sites going forward, within kind of that normalized 6% to 8% annual growth, you think is it safe to say that the smaller format as a class will become more a part of that going forward? Thanks very much.","Todd Vasos","Sure Vinnie, I would tell you that you we're very happy with all the different formats and we're seeing a very consistent return based on each and every format that we have. In saying that the small format continues to do very well to your point. It's a great format to have in the arsenal both for very rural crossroads type areas in rural locations and then in more of our metro and satellite city areas.","It gives us the flexibility and opportunity to get into some of those. I still have to say though that are workforce our 7200-square foot to 7400 square foot sales floor box is definitely the most productive and you'll see the majority of our stores in the near future still built under that format.","But we'll be opportunistic in using the other format where that 7200-square foot to 7400 square foot store may not fit just right in there. We just won't turn down a site that we believe is very good over the long-term just because it doesn't fit into one prototype or the other. We'll make sure that we're able to get into those with our great array of formats that we have available today.","Vincent Sinisi","Very helpful. Thanks very much. Best of luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.","Todd Vasos","Good morning, Karen.","Karen Short","Hey, how are you? I would agree with you that demise in retail is inaccurate, but not everyone believes that, but I guess the question I would have is that it does seem from your results, the concern would be that to generate a comp that's going to take a lot more investing I guess, whether it be margin on labor whatever, I mean both in this case in this quarter.","So, I guess the question I have is maybe can you give a little color on that? Do you think the first half is just maybe the trough or I guess the peak in terms of the investments and then it tends to abate in the back half?","And then I guess the second question I just had is looking at your guidance, employee guidance for the second half obviously consensus is at the high end of your range for the second half and maybe a little color on where you think people are off whether in the third quarter versus fourth quarter in terms of being too higher or is it pretty evenly distributed, thanks?","John Garratt","Sure. So, starting with in terms of the investments, what I would say is that the investments we made this year, we don't see anything on the horizon this time of that magnitude. We felt this was the right investment for the long-term of the business.","As we look out, we don't think of that magnitude. In terms of the store openings, we continue to see great results there. As I mentioned, we continue to see the stores performing right around that 100% compared pro forma within the 80% to 85% productivity returns of 20%, short payback and haven't seen cannibalization continues to be consistent with where we've been and what we expect.","So, seeing great results there. We made these investments with the long-term in mind and are seeing great results from that and are pleased with the results, but we feel very confident in the long-term growth of the business and the strength of the business unit, the business fundamentals and what we're seeing in the cash we're generating too from these stores.","So, feel very good about that. If you look at the guidance, yes, we thought as we look halfway through the year and the back-half expectation that if it's appropriate to point toward the high end, the upper end of the comp range and appropriate to narrow the range of EPS.","In terms of the cadence, I think the same we try to stress here is that yes from a performance standpoint, the glass is more challenging in Q4 than Q3 and in Q4 you have that 53rd week. So, as we look at the cadence between the two, we'll look for a much stronger Q3 compared to Q4 and it think that's something to consideration model out the back half.","Karen Short","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","Guys, thanks for taking my question. So just wanted to poke a little bit again on the margins, particularly on the gross margin side of things. I know you guys said that you had some higher markups in the consumable area. Just trying to understand as we look out at the competitive landscape over the next 12 to 18 months, how that won't be an ongoing theme, that's my first question.","Todd Vasos","Yeah sure, as I consistently talk about and not I, but many years in the past, it is our intent here at Dollar General to drive units through this -- our boxes here at Dollar General and delivering that value to the consumer. And we did exactly what we said we were going to do and we did that and invested in some price to do that through promotional price as well as some of the everyday low prices.","I can tell you though that most of it is done through everyday low price and as you look at our pricing position today, we are as good if not better than any point in time in the nine years that I've been here across all geographic regions, which we do business in as well as against any class of trade.","So, I think we're in a great, great position as we go forward to be able to attract the consumer in a Dollar General and if you take a look at our share as well overall, our share is as strong as it's been in many years and growing and gaining traction as we move through the quarter.","So, our prices and where we are today is definitely resonating with our consumer and we feel that right now we're in a real great position to offer her that convenience and that value as we move through the back half.","Scott Mushkin","But as far as expecting gross margin investment, on a go-forward basis as you look at the competitive environment, is that something we should expect? We obviously have a lot going on particularly in some of your core markets?","Todd Vasos","Again we're very competitively priced today. I would tell you as we look out that we're well priced today and I don't see us having to do anything that's very dramatic, but the great thing that I believe that we have here is the ability to continue to get our margins in other areas such as global sourcing, such as our private brands, such as our areas of transportation and distribution.","We've got some real opportunities in that and as I mentioned earlier, we're very bullish on what we see coming in the fourth quarter with our non-consumable sales in our business there with the lineup that we have coming into the fourth quarter.","So, we see opportunities to grow margin over time and we don't believe that we're in any long-term strong investment periods. We just don't see that as we go forward right now.","Scott Mushkin","All right. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it.","Todd Vasos","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Michael Lasser with UBS.","Todd Vasos","Hi Michael.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, you said, you feel good about where your prices are. I know they haven\u2019t been this good in nine years. So, does that mean that you're just not seeing others invest in price or you're matching the price investments that others are making and you're able to navigate it through only modest decreases in your gross margin?","Todd Vasos","As we look out, we obviously monitor price across all geographic regions that we do business in and again I would say that we are as good a priced if not better than we've been in many years including the nine years that I've been here.","And as we look at that, we did not have to take any large price decreases to get there. So, they were very modest in nature. I think they were very well-balanced, but they were definitely targeted in areas of our consumable businesses to drive traffic and to give the consumer that value that she knows and trusts from Dollar General.","But I think that's the way to look at it and it's probably the way to look at it as we go through the back half of this year.","Michael Lasser","And giving some of the commentary you've made, did you pull forward some markdowns that you were going to otherwise make in the back half of the year into the second quarter such that the gross margin pressure will get less bad moving forward?","Todd Vasos","We really didn't pull any markdowns forward, but in saying that, I would tell you that we have gross margin opportunities ahead of us that will hopefully start to see some moderation of the year-over-year declines as we move through the back half of the year.","Michael Lasser","That's very helpful. Thank you so much and good luck.","Todd Vasos","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi.","Alvin Concepcion","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to dive into the store resets a little bit, sounds like some of the things you're doing are driving a comp left even with produce. I am just curious what kind of uplift you're seeing?","I think remodeled you've mentioned in the past were 4% to 5% uplift, but it sounds like some of these things might be driving growth higher than that. So, wondering if you could shed some color on that?","Todd Vasos","We're very happy with our new stores as well as our remodel and relocation program. As it relates to the remodels, we're right on track to where we thought we would be on the remodels both the number of remodels as well as the returns that we expected to see.","The great thing about that 300 that we called out which we've done just over 185 or so of them to date with about a third and with the produce they are producing three to four times what a normal remodel produces.","So, we're very excited about that and we believe that it has broader application across many of our areas where we'll need to remodel stores over the next few years. So, we believe that overall this could be a real win for Dollar General and for our consumers because what it does is it offers our consumers items such as produce, expanded fresh frozen and dairy type products as well as expanded areas of dry grocery as well as some of our non-consumable areas.","So, when you look at the complete package of these remodels, we feel very comfortable and confident that we have a blueprint to go forward with into next year.","Alvin Concepcion","Great. And if I could squeeze one in, I'm just curious if you have any updated thoughts on what comp level you can lever SG&A at? I'm wondering if there is opportunities to bring that lower since it sounds like you have a lot of tools under your belt and levers to pull?","John Garratt","Yeah, so I think if you just look at this quarter, as I mentioned the reason we didn't lever was because of those two items, those two investments. So, if you think of it that way coming in at 2%, 6% comp, we set our goal with 2.5% to 3% and you're right there.","So, I think that's the way to look at it. Last year we were able to leverage at a lower point. The team really was able to flex down a difficult environment, but we want to have that right balance, when needed pulling back, but making investments as needed for the long term as well.","So, I still think that 2.5% to 3% over time is the right way to look at it and again it's not just diving been there.","Alvin Concepcion","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Todd Vasos","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Trussell","Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked. So just one more quick clarification and follow-up, one the gross margins, you did make a comment a little while ago about expectations or opportunities for the moderation of the year-over-year declines we've seen in the first half.","I just wanted to go maybe go in just a little bit more detail on the puts and takes there because obviously specifically, you did face a number of headwinds beginning in the third quarter last year where you had markdowns and promotions and inventory clearance in 3Q last year.","And so, I just want to ensure that it is fair for us to assume that on that easy compare we will see nice sequential improvement on gross margins as we think about the third quarter?","John Garratt","I think that's a fair statement. As you look to the third quarter, it's a fair statement to expect improvement there. That's what we're expecting and you're right, I think with the investments we made last year, we're in a good spot and won't need year-over-year in that level. So, should see improvement.","Paul Trussell","Okay. Fair enough. And then as we think about the 2.6% comp obviously driven by strong traffic, your guidance obviously for the balance of the year implies comps on average probably something a little bit lighter than that. Just help us kind of with the thought process of how you're thinking about DG's ability to consistently put up this level of comp performance and again just kind of the puts and takes on your ability to sustain the current level of comps that you just reported?","Todd Vasos","Paul, I think the thing to point to here is we feel very good about our initiatives both our short term and long-term initiatives that we have moving through and our short-term ones are really starting to just take hold now and are really starting to benefit the comp.","So, whether it's the health and beauty initiative, whether it's the cooler expansion initiative and we have a plethora of other ones through due course of business. I would tell you that we feel good about where we're headed on the comp side.","But keep in mind they're still half a year to go still and be in the fourth quarter our largest sales quarter we thought it prudent to sit back and at least let everyone know we anticipate being at the top end of the guidance range for sales and I think that's a good place to pinpoint it right now.","If that changes as we move out of the third quarter we'll definitely make sure everyone understands where we are coming out of Q3 and into Q4.","Paul Trussell","Fair enough. Best of luck. Thank you.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs.","Todd Vasos","Hi Stephen.","Stephen Tanal","Hi Todd. How are you?","Todd Vasos","Good. Thanks.","Stephen Tanal","All right. So, at the risk of beating a dead horse, so my first question is just on the margins here and I got the gross I down I think but if we think about SG&A for a moment, I guess the acquisition related cost I guess about 15 basis points, I think salary hikes are said to be worth about 30.","So those two pieces get me to 45 if I think about what's nonrecurring which still leaves us about six bps of deleveraging and I know I'm not getting the Georgia DC in that number. So, I was wondering if you can quantify that investment and if that's in excess of 6 like you probably would have levered on this comp.","John Garratt","Yeah, so I would say your numbers are a little low and for that reason if you add up those two numbers, that would have got us to a point where we didn't de-lever. So, you're in ballpark, but a little low there and again these are onetime items that we wouldn't see as we go forward next year.","Stephen Tanal","Got it. Okay. And so, the idea as you probably would've levered in a more normal environment on the 2%, 6% yeah. ","John Garratt","That's correct.","Stephen Tanal","Okay. And then I guess just lastly lots been discussed already but as you think about the improvement in consumables, despite what I guess many of us are thinking about is a pretty intense competitive environment, what will work better here or did the backdrop get a little bit less tough? How would just talk through that?","Todd Vasos","Yeah, I think the way to look at it is two different ways. One, the lap to get a leisure because some of the transitory issues that we brought out last year in unit price deflation as well as the snap benefit reductions that took place started to moderate in Q2 and will continue to moderate as we move through the back half of the year.","The other piece though I think to really think about is our initiatives and how well they're performing and taking hold. That was a big piece of our comp driver in the quarter and a lot of those initiatives were centered around our consumable areas.","Remember health and beauty for us falls in our consumable numbers and are reported through that as well as our cooler expansions are in there. So, we've got a lot of initiatives centered around consumables, not only just the food side, but health and beauty and other areas. So, I believe that's the way to look at it and also the way to look at it as we move through the back half of the year.","Stephen Tanal","Perfect. That's helpful. Thanks guys.","Todd Vasos","Sure.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Hope, I've let the call run over a little bit and so I think we've taken our last question. So, everyone that we've left in the queue, I apologize. I am available for any questions and as always, we appreciate your interest in Dollar General.","Operator","Thank you.

Today is Thursday, December 1, 2016. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available on the Company's earnings press release issued this morning.","Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Thank you, Keyla and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and John Garratt, our CFO. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, News and Events.","Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, future estimates and other non-historical matters, including but not limited to, our fiscal 2016 diluted EPS guidance, fiscal 2016 and 2017 store growth initiatives, capital allocation strategy, and related expectations, our long-term financial growth models and future economic trends or conditions.

Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call except as maybe otherwise required by law or as described under the heading Financial Outlook set forth in our earnings press release issued today.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. On today's call, I would first like to share our perspectives on the third quarter and review some of its highlights, then turn it over to John to take you through a more detailed review of the quarter and our outlook for fiscal year. I will then provide insights into our strategic action plans going forward.","Since we last spoke on our earnings call at the end of August, the retail environment has continued to be challenging, although we are pleased to see some of our traffic and sales driving actions beginning to take hold as we exited the third quarter. As I shared with you last quarter, we have taken a number of actions across merchandising and store operations to drive same-store sales all while being very disciplined in our SG&A spending. Although our sales and earnings fell short of our expectations, I believe we made progress on our initiatives in the quarter. Together, the team has spent a tremendous amount of time and resources on the analytics of our business and the targeted actions going forward.","As the deflation cycle continues in the quarter, we have re-evaluated how we're looking at the impact ultimately taking a more broad based view. Rather than limiting our view to commodity cost of milk and eggs, we expanded our analysis to the average unit retail price deflation. Applying this broader view of deflation to both our second and third quarters, we experienced a greater impact in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. We estimate that the combined headwinds from the average unit retail price deflation and reduction in SNAP benefits negatively impacted our same-store sales for the third quarter by approximately 150 to 175 basis points and for our second quarter by approximately 100 to 115 basis points. We believe many of these issues are transitory in nature.","Now let's turn the some of the highlights for the third quarter of 2016 as we compare to the prior year quarter. Third quarter sales increased 5% to $5.3 billion; year-to-date through the third quarter, net sales were $16 billion, an increase of 5.9% over the comparable prior year period. Same-store sales declined 0.1% for the quarter as an increase in average transaction size was offset by softer customer traffic. Same-store sales growth was positive for consumables, offset by decline in non-consumable category. In terms of the sales cadence for the quarter, August and October were both positive with October being the strongest period of the quarter. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, same-store sales increased 0.9% over the comparable prior year period.","For the quarter, diluted EPS was $0.84, including approximately $0.05 for store relocation cost, and disaster related expenses. During the quarter, we returned $295 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.9 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. We successfully converted 42 Walmart Express locations to the Dollar General banner. These locations are performing well ahead of our expectations and provide us with great insights to apply to our existing store formats and future opportunities. The store operation team continues to aggressively work towards improving our on-shelf availability. We are seeing progress as our third-party audits indicate that our stores have reduced their out-of-stocks on core items by 13% over prior year third quarter.","Our real estate model is the foundation of driving strong returns. We continue to see our new store productivity at around 80% to 85% of our comp base, all while driving returns over 20%. For 2016, we are on-track to open 900 new stores and relocate or remodel a combined 900 stores. The real estate and store operations team have done a tremendous job in executing our store growth plans. We continue to grow transactions and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced low single digit to mid-single digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4, 12, 24 and 52 week periods. I'm especially encouraged that we experienced a notable [sheer] [ph] change trend improvement in the most recent 8-week data.","During the third quarter, we invested gross margin dollars in a number of strategies designed to draw traffic. Some of these initiatives performed better than others but I believe we learned important lessons that will guide us in being more effective with the spending going forward. Based on the recent work we've done to analyze the business and to test various initiatives, we believe that we have identified those actions and strategies that provide the best opportunity to drive traffic and ultimately profitable sales growth. We are moving fast to aggressively pursue the actions that we believe will drive our same-store sales performance improvement. During the quarter, we made pricing, labor and marketing investments in designated market areas where we saw opportunities to be proactive as we look to improve same-store sales and market share with the objective to provide our customers with affordability of value and convenience at a time when they need us most.","Our proactive pricing actions were implemented selectively across about 17% of our store base or on about -- and on about 450 items targeting high household penetration, fast turning categories. While these investments take time to deliver the full impact, we are seeing the expected improvements in transaction, units, and weekly same-store sales across the vast majority of stores where we have made these investments. We believe we are on the right track with these selective price investments which are noticeable to our consumers. As I mentioned, while some of the third quarter investments resulted in the desired performance, others did not. For instance, we invested in incremental promotional activities that drive traffic although results were mixed and did not meet our overall expectations. As such this is an area we look to be more effective in deploying gross profit dollars going forward.","Additionally, as we move through the quarter, it became apparent to our incremental actions would not be able to overcome the decline in traffic in our stores. Both, traffic driving consumables and basket building non-consumables were impacted requiring greater than anticipated markdowns to move through the inventory and keep our merchandize in the stores fresh. Based on our learnings, we have focused our efforts on the most efficient and impactful activities and we will continue to monitor these traffic driving initiatives and continue to optimize these investments to achieve the best returns. I have confidence in this retail management team that has successfully navigated other challenging sales environment. We remain committed to controlling the factors that we can control and season the opportunities we have identified to improve our performance.","With that, let me now turn the call over to John.","John Garratt","Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. For the 2016 third quarter and year-to-date, I will share more insights on some of the important financial details and our outlook.","Gross profit for the 2016 third quarter was $1.6 billion or 29.8% of sales, a decrease of 49 basis points from last year's third quarter. As compared to the prior year third quarter, the most significant drivers were higher mark-downs, primarily for inventory clearance and promotion, a greater proportion of sales of lower margin consumables and increased inventory shrink, partially offset by higher initial inventory mark-ups.","SG&A expense in the quarter increased by 48 basis points over the comparable 2015 period to $1.2 billion or 22.5% of sales. The SG&A increase was due in part to increased retail labor and occupancy cost. In addition, we incurred charges related expenses of $13 million or 25 basis points associated with the acquisition of the former Walmart Express store location. These expenses were primarily related to lease termination cost for existing stores and costs related to the conversion of acquired stores to DG stores.","We also incurred an increase of $7.7 million or 14 basis points of disaster related expenses in the 2016 period, most of which were hurricane related. Partially offsetting these items were reductions in administrative payroll costs, instead of compensation expenses and advertising costs. For comparability, please keep in mind the 2015 third quarter SG&A results reflect expenses of $6.1 million or 12 basis points, while severance related benefit cost associated with the corporate restructuring of certain support functions.","In light of our same-store sales performance for the quarter, I'm pleased with the way the team managed our SG&A expenses. Year-to-date for the third quarter, we would have successfully leveraged SG&A expenses on our same-store sales performance of 0.9% had it not been for the store relocation cost and disaster related expenses mentioned earlier. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.2%. As in the first half of the year, our effective tax rate was lower this quarter as compared to the 2015 quarter, primarily due to the recognition of the work opportunity tax credit in the quarter in which it is earned given changes by Congress in December 2015.","Moving now to our balance sheet and cash flow statements; at quarter end, merchandized inventories were $3.49 billion, up 5.6% on a per store basis. Key factors impacting this increase were our on-shelf availability initiative and the timing of receipts coupled with our sales performance with the actions we have in place designed to help get inventory growth in line with our sales growth. Even with this increase, we believe our inventory is in good shape and we are comfortable with the quality as the increase was mainly in our everyday planned [ph] categories or what we think of as core items.","Year-to-date for the third quarter, we generated cash from operations of $1.12 billion, an increase of 39% or $315 million, compared to the 2015 third quarter, primarily as a result of working capital improvements and higher net income. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our common stock for $225 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding totaling $70 million. Year-to-date to the end of the third quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $892 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividends. From December 2011 to the third quarter of 2016, we've repurchased $4.3 billion or 70.2 million shares of our common stock.","At the end of the third quarter, our remaining repurchase authorization was approximately $1.2 billion. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store base, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases.","Underlying our capital allocation strategy, is our goal to maintain our investment grade ratings by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately three times adjusted debt-to-EBITDA. Looking ahead, we are realistic about the environment in which we are operating. We now expect that our fiscal 2016 diluted EPS growth will be at the low end of our long-term growth mile range of 10% to 15%. This outlook includes the impact of the charge for the store relocation cost and disaster related expenses in the third quarter, and the benefit from the 53rd week this year of approximately $0.09 per diluted share.","Because of the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Fair Labor Standards Act and new salary requirements, it does not include any incremental expense related to the potential implementation of that regulation. In the event that the new salary requirement under the Fair Labor Standards Act is implemented, we anticipate that this would be as incremental annualized expense of approximately $60 million to $70 million or $0.03 for the 2016 fourth quarter.","Please keep in mind that we had an incremental $0.04 per diluted share benefit from the preannouncement of the Federal Work opportunity tax credit in Q4 2015. We anticipate providing further details on our 2017 initiative when we release our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results in March 2017.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, John. Well, while we are still on our planning process for fiscal 2017, we remain focused on our four operating priorities for growth. First, driving profitable sales growth. Second, capturing growth opportunities. Third, enhancing our position at the low cost operator. And fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage.","Our first priority is to drive profitable sales growth. Our goal is to attract and grow new consumers and trips, and capture share with existing customers, utilizing our customer segmentation work and our disciplined approach to category management. To enhance our value proposition, we are committed to providing our customers with every deal or [ph] prices that they know and trust from us. Clearly, our consumers budgets are pinched, the cumulative effect of macroeconomic factors such as the reduction of SNAP participation and benefit levels and increased housing and healthcare expenses appear to have taken a noticeable toll on their spending. Our goal is to be there for our customers when they need us the most.","We remain committed to refreshing our price investments across items and categories, as well as incremental markets. Our changes would be made as needed in a very rational manner as we move through the coming quarters with the goal to drive traffic and units and capture market share. To further enhance our value proposition, we are also focused on refiling our advertising effectiveness to drive product or sales growth with a continued focus on everyday low prices that resonate with our customers. For 2017, we plan to further integrate our traditional and digital media mix to work together to ensure we are reaching our target consumers where, when, how they decide to engage with us. Through applied predictive technology, we are conducting a test to learn to gain further insights into our ability to achieve a higher return on investments, on our advertising media mix.","A key area of focus for 2017 is to build on our 2016 progress to expand the merchandising initiatives that focus on our mature store base to drive our same-store sales. For a select group of these stores, we anticipate a more extensive four walled remodeling effort that we believe will provide compelling returns. The recent acquisition of the former Walmart Express stores gives us great insights as we develop the remodeled program for these stores. Merchandising initiatives across all departments have been deployed to provide consumers with more of the products and brands they want and need to save time and money every day across this group of stores.","Second, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. In 2017, we plan to accelerate our square footage growth to about 7.5%. Our 2017 pipeline is essentially complete as we continue to plan for about 1,000 new store openings. The primary format will be our traditional DG Box which is about 7,300 square feet of selling space and provides us with strong new store economics and returns. This format consistently proves to be our highest return format against which we benchmark the performance of all other formats. We expect that these traditional stores will utilize our successful Dollar General 16 layout to expand high growth traffic building categories in a more customer-friendly format all while providing consumers with a faster checkout.","We are planning for the future as we segment our store opportunities that we believe can have a greater impact on sales and productivities, all while continue to drive compelling returns. We view this as more of an evolution of our existing, highly productive traditional store format rather than a wholesale change. We are in the unique position to leverage knowledge across our multiple format given that Dollar General has always been a leader in store format innovation. I view our store format along a continuum of selling square footage. On one end we apply lessons from the best-selling items in our 16,000 square foot Dollar General market stores, to our newly acquired 10,000 square foot box. Both of these formats give us great experience with fresh produce and meats.","From there we move along the continuum to the 9,000 square foot Dollar General Plus with about 30 or so cooler doors and more holding power on the shelf. Next, we've held assortment to our 7,300 square foot traditional box. With over 12,500 traditional stores, this box will always be core to our model. Finally, we have been pleased with the test results of our smaller box, that is less than 6,000 square feet for certain metro and relocations. Across the format, we constantly are editing the assortments and taking our best selling items from one format to the next to satisfy our customers changing needs while driving -- while continuing to drive productivity.","Key consumer trends going forward that are becoming more important to our core consumers include healthier, better for you options, and a greater fresh assortment. Our range of formats positions us well to seek opportunities to capture this growing customer sentiment. Given that we are still in the planning process, I look forward to sharing more with you over the coming months. To support our new store growth and productivity, we continue to make investments in our distribution center network. Our Jamesville, Wisconsin distribution center is nearing completion with a goal to begin shipping from this facility in early 2017. Our 15th distribution center in Jackson, Georgia is also under construction with a goal to begin shipping from this facility in late 2017.","Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low cost operator. The team has embraced the spirit and process of zero-based budgeting that we implemented last year as part of the 2016 budget. We have had great success in leveraging our culture and heritage of cost management with our zero-based budgeting program across our cost structure. As we enter year two of our zero-based budgeting process, the team is actively working on a pipeline of additional future savings opportunities across the company, leveraging process improvements, procurements and prioritization to remove costs the don't effect the customer experience.","Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are our competitive advantage. In the third quarter, we redesigned our store manager training program and while it's still early, we are seeing almost a 20% improvement in satisfaction scores from the store managers who have gone through the program. We have exciting opportunities ahead of us. Our tested learned program is a foundation of our continued improvement. We believe our positioning Dollar General to be even more relevant to help our customers save time and money now and in the future. We remain confident in our long-term growth prospects of the company and are moving quickly and deliberately to restore traffic to our stores.","Our stores are prepared for the holidays and we have strong plans in place for the remainder of the holiday selling season with exciting gifts the core choice and other holiday necessities, and multiple avenues to save in-store and online. Our customers can take advantage of our holiday offerings and stretch their holiday budget even further. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value is unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. We have strong new store economics with returns above 20% and a payback under two years. Our team is energized to seize growth opportunities. Our business generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in accelerated store growth as well as mature store base while continue to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and anticipated dividends. We remain very excited about our business overtime.","In closing, I want to recognize more than -- the more than 120,000 Dollar General employees who serve our customers every day. We are in the midst of our busiest season in retail, and our customers are depending on us for convenience and everyday low prices. I want to thank all of our employees for their contributions to our mission of serving others.","With that Mary Winn we would now like to open the lines for questions.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Thank you. Keyla, we'll look to take the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good morning, thanks a lot. Good morning, Todd. Thanks for taking my question. Based on the initiatives that you deployed and what you saw in October, Todd, do you think you're at the point where you can start to see some more consistent gains in your traffic or is your expectation that traffic is just going to be lumpy from here for at least the near-term?","Todd Vasos","Mike, that's a great question, as we came out of October and then into November, we saw continued traction from those initiatives. It was great to see that our pricing initiative started to really take hold, as well as all the initiatives that we really launched in early '16 around our merchandising pieces, those continue to gain traction throughout the year and especially in the third quarter, and now into the fourth. But keep in mind that we are still seeing those headwinds from the SNAP participation rates being down, as well as deflation. So a little choppiness is probably the right way to look at it but we're very encouraged on how we see our initiatives taking hold and taking shape. And again, as we saw our comp sales improving throughout the quarter and especially in October, and now moving into November, we feel good about a lot of the initiatives that we put in place.","Michael Lasser","My follow-up question is, can you mention the performance of those stores that you -- the 70% of the stores that you made those price investments, are those outperforming the chain average? And are you seeing a lift to the entire stores, so is the customer coming in and buying the discretionary goods as well to offset some of the gross margin pressure that you've probably seen from those investments?","Todd Vasos","Yes, that's another great question. As we stated earlier on, it takes a little time for these price investments to take hold with the consumer but the great thing is as we move through Q3, we saw units, transactions and sales starting to build momentum and actually as we exited Q3 and enter Q4, we even saw a further acceleration of that whereas we have actually crossed over where we're now returning pretty nicely on our investment. So again, in the quarter -- quarter three, we spend a little bit to get it moving but now it's really starting to pick up. So we feel good about where it's headed.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Alan Rifkin with BTIG.","Alan Rifkin","Good morning, how are you?","Todd Vasos","Good.","Alan Rifkin","I'm just looking at your revenue as it relates to funds category\u2026","Mary Winn Pilkington","Alan, it's Mary Winn. Alan, I'm sorry to interrupt but we're having a real hard time hearing you.","Alan Rifkin","Can you hear me better now?","Mary Winn Pilkington","Yes. Thanks.","Alan Rifkin","Okay, thank you for taking my question. And looking at your comp gains with respect to categories, it seems as if the categories like consumables where arguably the deflation is greater they are actually outperforming some of the more discretionary categories, like apparel and home; there is actually less deflation. Can you help explain that apparent anomaly? And then I do have a follow-up.","Todd Vasos","Yes, the real thing to look at there is that a lot of our initiatives coming into the year 2016 were around those traffic driving areas, so again, around perishables in the food areas and immediate consumption. So while we're facing great headwinds on deflation there, what we're starting to see is that those -- those initiatives are overtaking even some of those deflationary pressures but make no mistake, those headwinds are pretty strong and that's why we said we feel pretty good about where we're headed because those initiatives are really taking hold in those category and as we look at this pretty transitory and as those deflationary pressures hopefully start to ease mid-next year, when we prop out of the other side, we should be in very good shape because the initiatives that we deployed to include some of the traffic driving initiatives around our pricing that we've recently implemented are in a lot of those consumable high discretionary categories or that are out there for the consumer. So I think -- I think all in all, we made the right decisions and as we come out of this we should be in a much better shape.","Alan Rifkin","Okay, thank you. And Todd, if I may, I mean you said that while most of your leases or 2017 you\u2019re committed to, did you give any considerations to possibly slowing down the 1,000 new stores that are now earmarked for 2017 just in case things not as transitory as what you hope they will be. And in that regard if in fact the environment continues to be difficult for longer then what do you foresee, what incremental efforts with respect to zero-based budgeting could possibly be implemented to help rein in the cost structure? Thank you.","John Garratt","Good questions. To start with the question around real estate, you know, the way we see it now, this is stuff we watch very closely, we monitor the sales performance and the returns, and we continue, you know, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks we continue to see the stores opened as expected at the 80% to 85% sales productivity. We continue to see the returns above 20% of our target. We continue to see paybacks of less than two years and given the low risk, low cost, high return opportunity we see here, we're proceeding but watching it very carefully and understand that this is something that we could dial back quickly if needed, but based on the great results we continue to see and the belief that the pressure is on the comps are largely transitory in nature, we don't need to do that thus far but we'll closely manage that.","And in terms of second question around zero-based budgeting, our ability to dial back that even more, we're very pleased with the performance that we've seen with zero-based budgeting when you consider in the difficult environment, we've been operating; the team has done a phenomenal job managing costs. Looking at everything through the lens, does it touch the customer, is it aligned with our strategic priorities, does not doing this puts the business at risk, and so we're going to, we have and are going to continue to go after all the cost we can continually but thoughtfully and making sure that over time we're also -- as we manage the business for the long-term investing in those initiatives that will drive long-term growth. But rest assured, the team is hard at work on zero-based budgeting, it's performing better than expected this year. When you consider it, you exclude the impact of the relocations of the acquired stores and disaster related costs, we would be leveraging our SG&A at 0.9% comp versus the stated target at the beginning of the year where we lowered it from 3.5% to -- and creeping up towards 4% to 2.5% to 3%. So we're ahead of schedule, we feel great about what we've done but we will be very balanced going forward and doing the right things for the business for the right long-term.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","Good morning, Todd. So a couple of things on pricing, it sounded to me like, right now there is no plan to expand the scope of those price cuts. Is that right? Is the average cut still about 10% on those items? And then what kind of competitive response if any have you seen?","Todd Vasos","John, we're continuing to monitoring the investments that we did make in pricing. Remember, it's really only a quarter old right now and while we're very pleased and we're gaining traction, we're going to continue to monitor it to ensure that we've got the right items and is driving the proper returns that we expect to get from that. So I think it's fair to say that we'll continue to monitor that for a bit longer. And as you look at it, yes, we see that when you look at the competitive environment for Q2, it's been -- it's been about -- oh, I'm sorry, in Q3, it's been about the same as Q2. So overall, I would tell you that it's aggressive out there but not anymore than we've seen in Q2.","And I'm sure, when we monitor prices, everyone monitors prices, and we look at what everyone else is doing but I can tell you that what we're surely [ph] focused on is what we can control and driving traffic into our stores and being there for our consumer. So we're pretty pleased on what we've seen so far.","John Heinbockel","Well, let me follow-up to that. If you think about -- and there is really two things; one more sort of theoretical and one more real. If you look at the items where you've cut pricing on, are you getting a better response where there is -- where there is or is not cost deflation? And then just theoretically, from high level, do you think price investments work better? You know, when we started to reflate, is it better to hold back the pricing then when all the competition is raising price rather than cut now and everybody has the potential right to take pricing down because their costs are falling?","Todd Vasos","So when we look at the 450 or so items that we've taken price on, I can tell you that in face of deflation, we're still seeing the entire store -- it really starts to react in a real positive manner on the sales side. Some of those items are not -- are not reacting the way we thought, we'll roll some off, we'll roll some new ones on. And as you could imagine, some that has heavy deflationary pressures, the top line may not be as robust but again, it's not always about the sales piece right off hand; eventually it is but it's about driving traffic and units to the store and we've always said that we're going to do everything we have to do to drive traffic, John. And we continue to do that because we believe through any economic cycle, whether it be deflationary or inflation, that if you're there for the consumer when she needs you the most -- that when you come out the other side of those economic times, she's going to stick with you. We've proven that time and time again, and I believe this will be no different.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.","Karen Short","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I actually just wanted to clarify on the 17% on the store base; are your comps in those stores positive currently?","Todd Vasos","Again, when you look at in aggregate, you know, we look at it by geographic area and of course in aggregate; and again -- we're pretty happy with what we're seeing there. And the great thing about the comps in those stores, that it's lifting both consumables and non-consumables. It's started with more of the consumable areas as you can imagine but as we've started to build not only units going through the register because of the better prices. When we started to see traffic start to increase because we're at a mouth [ph] getting out there plus our advertising; we're now starting to see transaction start to move through and more sales. So we're pretty happy with where it is right now, it's still early but it's doing exactly what we thought it would do and actually on the sales side, maybe even a little bit better than we thought it would do this early on.","Karen Short","Okay, that's helpful. So I guess I'm just wondering it with all that success why you wouldn't consider rolling this out to a greater percent of the store base or potentially broadening it to greater number SKUs?","Todd Vasos","You know, we're very much a real disciplined company. And we want to make sure that we're doing exactly what's right for the profitability of the company at the end of the day. So we're -- this is the real test-and-learn for us, right. But it's a pretty big one, 17% of the store base today has these prices in it. So I think it's prudent to given a little bit more time to percolate, if you will, and to continue to grow. And as that happens, and we see it performing the way we think it's going to perform, then as we get into next year I think we'll continue to look at ways to expand that and to be there for our customer to continue to give her that everyday low price that she needs.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs.","Alison Levens","Good morning. This is Alison for Stephen, thanks for taking our questions. Can you provide more detail around gross margin in the quarter; specifically can you quantify the impact of price investment versus inventory clearance?","John Garratt","Sure. So after driving six straight quarters of expansion, in Q3 we did have contraction of 49 basis points in Q3. The key drivers there were markdowns mix and inventory shrink; markdowns being the most significant driver and that was listed first. And that was both in consumables and non-consumables. First, as we move through inventory with clearance of markdowns to keep the inventory fresh. The good news here is that the quality of the inventory is in great shape. And then also with the tougher sales environment in Q3, we had additional promotional activity as we mentioned with the goal of driving the top line are pleased with the results we're seeing, and the learnings we've captured from that to be more targeted, more focused on targeted pricing in EDLP [ph] and optimizing the spend for maximum results going forward. And again, pleased with the momentum we saw coming out of the quarter and then to this quarter.","So those were the key drivers there. We feel like you know, with the actions we've taken here; it's the best actions in the long-term, and I think with the learnings going forward, we'll be able to be more targeted with it. And we continue to see opportunity over the long-term, managing the very flows. We continue to see opportunity to reduce shrink overtime, supply chain efficiencies, strong category management and opportunities around increased foreign sourcing and private label penetration as we look at the long-term.","Alison Levens","Great, thanks, very helpful. And then just as a follow-up, can you provide more detail regarding what changed with respect to the SNAP headwinds in 3Q versus 2Q?","Todd Vasos","Yes, you know, when we look at it -- it was about the same. When we look at our SNAP affected states, I'll give you a little color; really what's interesting here is a lot like Q2, Q3 was pretty close to about the same but if you look at it, it affects about 56% of our store base in the states that have reduced or eliminated the SNAP benefit and those states that have -- that have had the reduction or elimination, they are approximately a 100 basis points worse than comp. That gives you a real good idea of how impactful those SNAP benefits -- reductions have been. Again, we feel it's transitory, we'll move through that as we move through 2017 but right now that's why we've really taken a real hard look at reducing prices for those core consumers, especially given around those states because they need this right now based on what we see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Keith","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. When you look at the deflation and SNAP headwinds of 150 to 175 basis points, if we were to add that back in -- you'd still be below your long-term guide of two to four. Just looking forward, do you think as these headwinds abate [ph] that -- that you would see some acceleration in traffic to get you back up into that range and what might be driving that?","Todd Vasos","You know, when you look at it though, we feel pretty good about a lot of the initiatives that we've got in play. We feel good about early on the initiatives for 2017 as we start to really shape those up. We had a little bit of a Halloween drag in Q3 that was moved into Q4 for us. And not to make any excuses, but there is -- there is definitely some headwinds there but I think what we're really focused on here is a lot of the great things that we have moving that we believe are going to be real positive to our same-store sales as we move into 2017 and some of these transitory affects start to abate and we start to see that -- the consumer starts to come back in the store, as well as the deflationary pressure starting to ease. Over the long-term, we believe that we could have comps in that two to four range over the long-term.","Peter Keith","Okay. Thank you, Todd. And maybe now for John, just two unrelated quick follow-ups. Number one, could you quantify the Halloween impact on the Q3 comp? And then secondly, I was unclear on how you're managing the overtime real change announcement from last week with the injunction that was placed. Are you going forward with the changes or are you putting a pause on it to see how that transpires.","Todd Vasos","This is Todd, let me -- I'll take the second one first and have John quantify the Halloween impact for you. Right now with thing stay that is out there, we have communicated to our stores that we're in a holding pattern for right now to see exactly what happens in the courts and see exactly what transpire? So we are on hold, and operating group has done a fabulous job in communicating that our folks, and we're going to wait and see. So we like you will wait and see what happens. But at the other day we always do what's for our employees, right, and again that's one of our core operating parties, he is really taking care of our people. So we'll do what's right by then as we continue to move into '17.","In terms of the Halloween shift, the impact we believe it to be about 20 basis points impact on comps, and the Halloween shift had to do with two fewer selling days this quarter as the quarter ended on October 28 this year versus October 30 of last year by 20 basis points.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis","Hi, good morning. You mentioned that you're very focused on doing what it took -- takes rather too to drive traffic. And so my question is related to the long-term earnings growth target that you provided back earlier in this year of 10% to 15%. But I believe they assumed relatively flat or slightly up EBIT margins. So my question is, can you make this price investment to drive traffic and still hold EBIT flat or would you be willing to sacrifice on EBIT margin to get incremental people through the door? Thanks.","Todd Vasos","Yes, so bear in mind that the model is a long-term growth model, naturally where our focus is over the long-term and we've said that from time to time we will -- as needed, make investments to do what's right to drive traffic and to drive that long-term growth, so we'll do what we need to in that regard. But you know, as I step back and just look at the fundamentals of the business, I still feel great about this business as you look at the organic growth opportunity, great returns we continue to see from the new stores, the actions we're taking to reinvigorate the comp sales growth. And with all the levers we have in gross margin and SG&A, with the addition of zero-based budgeting and with the tremendous amount of cash this business throws off that we can reinvest in new stores, in the business while comparing -- providing a very compelling total shareholder return with the addition of dividend and share repurchases. It feels great about the model and the long-term prospects, but if the long-term model will do what we need to and best where we need to along the way.","John Zolidis","Okay, great. And just a second question on a different topic. You mentioned that the traditional DG format is your highest return format. You've got about a 1,000 openings for next year. Can you give us a rough breakdown of openings by format? Thanks.","Todd Vasos","Yes, again, overwhelmingly the -- the Dollar General traditional store, that 7,300 square foot store that we talk about will be the dominant -- by far the dominant player there. I believe we're going to have about 150 to 160 of the smaller format stores next year in key metro and rural areas to augment that but overall it will be that 7,300 square foot store.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi","Hey guys, good morning, thanks very much for taking my question. I appreciate the incremental color on the current headwinds, deflation, SNAP, you said competition about the same as last quarter. We just wanted to see if you could give any further color around the low and consumer health was one of the other things that you kind of more specifically called out last quarter. You know, versus then kind of what you're seeing now either by basket geography etcetera, that would be great.","Todd Vasos","Yes, interestingly, we talk to our consumers each and every quarter through panel data, as well as we bring them in and talk to them in general. And I can tell you as late as mid-third quarter, they were telling us that their sentiment -- feeling is even more dire than it was in previous quarters in early 2016. And what they are siding and continue to say is the rise in healthcare costs that they are facing. I don't believe any of our core customers realized what they were up against on those rising cost. And then rental cost continue and they called that out second on paying rent because most of our -- again, core customers rent don't own and those rents are going up across the nation at a pretty high rate. And they have to continue to allocate their spending, so anywhere they are saving, they are doing something's little differently than they've done before.","For instance, they are investing in smartphone technology at a greater rate than we've ever seen, and those come with an expense, as we all know, a monthly expense. And so the little bit of money that she does may have -- from maybe lower gas prices and some other tailwinds, she is moving into a little bit of the technology world herself, very slowly, albeit but she is moving there. So we're hearing a lot of the same things we've heard over the last couple of quarters, but what was interesting to us was that she was feeling worse off today, middle of that third quarter than she was earlier in the year.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay, all right, that's helpful Todd, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up; just going back to your initiatives; kind of like you said, it seems like a pretty similar scope at least going forward. But if we try to just reconcile kind of what maybe working better or worse than you thought? And even going back to Alan's question on kind of consumables, non-consumables performance; as you're taking a broader view, do you think that there could be any change to -- kind of the focus of consumables versus non-consumables or you know maybe some greater or less than that kind of 10% pricing that you had cited last quarter?","Todd Vasos","You know, as we look at the entire box, and we've got one of the most robust category management processes and teams and considering the retailing today -- they do a great job in evaluating each and every year what should be inside of our stores and what those initiatives should be. And we've always said that the consumable initiatives and the consumable products will drive traffic and our non-consumable businesses will drive the basket, we see that no differently. And actually we've seen our -- we've seen our non-consumable business tail up along with our consumable business as the customer pull back and especially in these SNAP affected states. In saying that, a lot of our initiatives for this year and next year are both in consumables and in non-consumables because we believe that you have to have a fine balance between the two to really round up the shopping experience for the consumer. And so we're looking at it really no differently.","Now in consumables, there may be some differences in some of the products that we bring in because again, our consumers start to look for better-for-you, more healthy, little bit more fresh products. And the great thing about having the market stores -- a 150 or 160 market stores that we have, as well as our plus stores, we're able to infuse the best learnings and products into our traditional store from those formats. So there isn't any testing learn periods, we know what works, and we continue to bring those type of products to market in our 7,300 square foot store and you'll see even more of that, maybe even on the low accelerated rate as we move into 2017 because again, our consumer preferences are changing.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Fletcher with Bernstein.","Brandon Fletcher","Hey guys, as a retail veteran who has done this in dozens of countries, I just want to say you guys are doing it right, you're doing it carefully, testing control and the willingness to refine it is rare among leadership and so just hang in there, you guys are getting it right. And our question is actually related to HBA, one of the things that the merchants were kind of excited about the Investor Day was -- that was a place where a little more skew, a little more brand, a little more focus could give you something your customers need; and also places where you have an enormous price advantage to your kind of convenient pharmacist. How are those initiatives going? Just wanted to get some color on that. Thanks.","Todd Vasos","Yes, the health and beauty initiatives, especially around health has been one of our really shining stars of 2016 so far. Those initiatives have been doing very well. Remember, they fall into our consumable world as it relates to how we report, how you see those numbers. And they've been doing well, but we still believe we have a lot of opportunity there and a lot of it really revolves around awareness. And while we've made great strides over the last five to six years on building loyalty in our HBA areas, we believe we still have a lot to go, not only in SKU proliferation there, probably more awareness and the ability for our consumers to know we have the projects that you need. And the great thing is, it's got a fabulous price, especially to our competition in the drug side and the grocery side of the equation. So as she learns and sees that those products are there and she sees the great price, and she \u2013 we've got her for life and I think it's about awareness for her and that's what we're going to work on into 2017.","Brandon Fletcher","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JP Morgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. So Todd, on learnings from this pricing initiative, I know we've had a number of questions around it but I guess you've done something like this in the past. How would you compare what you're seeing today from this metrics to the 2013 road map? And what was the timeline back then that it took to see the traffic return?","Todd Vasos","Yes, a little bit different time and date but I can tell you that it's a lot like 2013. I could tell you though that what we saw in '13 versus '16 is transactions actually start to get more traction this time around than even in 2013, which has probably translated into a little bit better over sales and we thought we're going to get by now and just moving into profitable ROI on that. So it's actually ramped up a little faster and I think a lot of that also has to do with -- we were a little bit more aggressive this time on how we communicated that to the consumer, as well as our operating group did a fabulous job executing signing packages, as well as our other in-store communication. So while I love to build it compare, this is a little different but I could tell you that we're happy with what we've seen so far.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just on the gross margin front, as we think about some of the headwinds this quarter that hit yield. As we think about going forward, should we consider similar gross margin pressure through the front half of '17? Just any color on the puts and takes there would be helpful.","Todd Vasos","Yes, so in terms of 2017, we're still in the budgeting process and we aren't going to provide any update on -- at this stage we will in the next call. But again, with gross margin, our focus is on the long-term, here we continue to see a lot of opportunities managing the various levers and we look to balance gross margin on SG&A [ph]. And certainly in a challenging environment you do have the pressure of delivering that everyday low price but we have a lot of other levers that we will look to manage effectively as we have in the past to balance that out, to drive that growth while delivering results.","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of luck.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Markets.","Bradley Thomas","Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. You've done a lot of interesting work on customer segmentation, that you shared with us back in March. I was wondering as you reflect on the traffic trends that you've seen over the last couple of quarters if there are any interesting insights that you're able to share about the segmentations of your customer?","Todd Vasos","Again, we -- as I mentioned earlier, we go out and talk to the customer each and every quarter and again, I believe that the majority of what we communicated to everyone earlier in the year pretty well, it's still well intact as far as the consumer is concerned, except for the notion that she maybe a little worse off today economically than she was even earlier in the year, at least her sentiment is a little less positive. But in saying that, we're still seeing our -- but we are affectionately call our BFS which is our core of best customers, continue to really resonate with our everyday low price. And through Q3 with all the traffic driver initiatives we did, what really stuck and resonated the most was everyday low price, and that really goes to show you that the segmentation work that we do is right on and key, and that is our best customers look to deliver everyday low price first because you need to count on those each and every day.","But beyond that we're still seeing a healthy customer base outside of our core and some of our reach customers were still seeing trade-in and trade down type customers coming in; and we're still seeing a decent millennial type customer that really just started to emerge. And that's some of the reasons we're looking at even more better for you and healthier, as well as maybe some fresh options as we go forward because that consumer is really starting to emerge as a real player here at Dollar General.","Bradley Thomas","Great, very helpful Todd, thank you so much.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Operator, I think we've hit the top of the hour that's probably go into our call now. But I want to thank everybody for being on the call and if you have any questions, Matt and I are both around, so feel free to give me or Matt a call.","Operator","Okay, thank you, Ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines now."],"7186":["Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call December  7, 2017 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Mary Winn Pilkington - SVP, IR and Public Relations","Todd Vasos - CEO","John Garratt - CFO","Analysts","Alan Rifkin - BTIG","Karen Short - Barclays Capital","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","Peter Keith - Piper Jaffray","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Michael Lasser - UBS","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett","Operator","Good morning.

I'm pleased with our third quarter performance as the Dollar General team delivered strong same-store sales growth, driven by an increase in average transaction amount and positive traffic, all while expanding gross profit margin and exhibiting good underlying expense control. We are excited about our plans for the fourth quarter and into the New Year.","Our third quarter results were achieved even in the midst of the hurricanes that impacted our business during the quarter. We estimate that the negative impact of these storms in the quarter, including loss of inventory and incremental repairs for damages and other expenses offset by increased sales was approximately $0.05 per diluted share. I would like to thank and also recognize all of the Dollar General teams that worked extensively to be there in advance of the storms and afterwards to support our communities during the recovery process. When our employees, customers, and communities needed us, team members from across the organization were there providing support for our impacted stores and coworkers. To all the teams that worked so hard to ensure our coworker safety, to secure and staff our stores, and to meet the needs of our customers, thank you. This dedication to our mission of serving others is what makes us and our company so special.","Turning now to the highlights of the third quarter of 2017; net sales increased 11% to $5.9 billion and same-store sales grew 4.3% as compared to the prior year third quarter. Same-store sales for the quarter benefited by an estimated 30 to 35 basis points from incremental sales due to the hurricanes. Same-store sales growth was positive for both consumables and combined non-consumable categories with stronger growth in consumables.","Our highly consumable market share trends in syndicated data continue to exhibit strength with high single-digit share growth in both units and dollars over the 12, 24, and 52-week periods ending November 4. Our mature store base, which are stores that are over five years old and have not been remodeled or relocated, continues to deliver the best same-store sales growth that we have seen in four years.","In addition, the contribution of same-store sales growth from our real estate maturation curve, including new stores, relocations, and remodels was at the high-end of our expectations. We executed 634 real estate projects in the quarter, including 470 new store openings. Net income was $253 million and diluted earnings per share grew 11% to $0.93, which includes $0.05 per share for the estimated net negative impact associated with the hurricanes.","Year-to-date through the 2017 third quarter, we have returned $512 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 4 million shares of common stock and the payment of quarterly dividends. Given our year-to-date performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our reported EPS guidance for the full-year. John will provide more details on our outlook.","The fundamentals of our business remain strong. Our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver strong top line growth as we deliver the best same-store sales growth in 11 quarters.","Now, I'll turn the call over to John to go through more details of the quarter and our outlook. Then I'll share some highlights of our initiatives for fiscal 2018.","John Garratt","Thank you, Todd, and good morning everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our third quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the quarterly financial results starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the 2017 quarter was $1.8 billion or 29.9% of sales, an improvement of eight basis points from last year's third quarter.","As compared to the prior year third quarter, the gross profit rate increase was primarily attributable to higher initial inventory mark-ups and lower inventory shrink, partially offsetting these items were a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than other product categories, sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumable sales, and increased transportation costs.","SG&A expense increased by 40 basis points over the 2016 quarter to $1.3 billion or 22.9% of sales in the third quarter. This quarter's SG&A increase was primarily attributable to increased retail labor expenses, given our previously planned investments in store manager compensation, and increased incentive compensation and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales.","The increased occupancy costs were primarily attributable to a record number of 470 new store openings in the quarter, over half of which were related to acquired stores and which represents an 82% increase in openings over the prior year third quarter. We also recorded $24.8 million of incremental expenses related to the impact of the hurricanes, which occurred during the quarter as Todd discussed earlier.","Partially offsetting these increased expenses were lower utilities costs and a reduction in advertising costs. Please keep in mind, in the 2016 third quarter we incurred charges of $13 million associated with store sites acquired from a large box retailer and the related closure of existing stores plus an estimated $7.7 million of incremental disaster-related expenses. In the press release issued this morning, we have provided tables detailing the estimated impact of the 2017 hurricanes on our third quarter results.","Moving down the income statement, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.8%, as compared to 36.2% in the third quarter last year. The effective income tax rate was lower in the 2017 third quarter, due primarily to the recognition of greater federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit this quarter, as compared to the prior year quarter.","Looking at a few items on our balance sheet and cash flow statement merchandise inventories at third quarter end were $3.6 billion. For the quarter, total inventory increased 3.1%, while declining 4.9% on a per store basis. This marks our second consecutive quarter of inventory decline on a per store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape, and are comfortable with the quality. Our longer term goal continues to be inventory growth in line with or below our sales growth.","Year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated strong cash flow from operations totaling $1.14 billion an $18 million increase compared to the same period last year. This year's increase was primarily due to an improvement in our same-store inventory levels partially offset by increased income tax payments as a result of timing of income recognition for tax purposes. It is also important to note that we're lapping significant working capital improvements from 2016. We continue to be pleased with our solid cash flow generation.","During the quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our common stock for $135 million, and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.26 from the common share outstanding at a total cost of $71 million. Year-to-date through the end of the third quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $512 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividend. From December 2011 [ph] through the third quarter of 2017, we repurchased $4.9 billion or 78.4 million shares of our common stock. We have remaining authorization of approximately $635 million under the repurchase program. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders.","Our first priority remains investing in new stores where we continue to see great returns and the necessary infrastructure to support our store growth, our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases.","Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment grade rating by managing to leverage ratio of approximately three times adjusted debt-to-EBITDA.","Looking ahead, please keep a couple of points in mind, recall our fiscal 2017 is a 52 week year versus the 2016 53 week year, we estimated that the 53rd week in 2016 contribute about $0.09 per share to earnings that will not recur this year.","As Todd mentioned, we are pleased with our performance at this point in the year. We are narrowing our forecast for GAAP diluted EPS to range of $4.37 to $4.47 compared to our previous guidance range of $4.35 to $4.50. Given that our guidance is on a reported GAAP basis. We are absorbing the $0.05 per diluted share for the net negative impact associated with the hurricane. However we are only reducing the high-end of our guidance range by $0.03.","For the fiscal year, this guidance includes the debt extinguishment charge of $0.01 per share recorded in the first quarter and absorbed two items that were not contemplated when either we provided our initial fiscal 2017 EPS guidance or our most recent update.","Number one the $0.02 per share charge reported in the second quarter primarily for lease termination cost and number two the estimated $0.05 per share net negative impact of the hurricanes during the quarter.","Our guidance does not contemplate any potential impact from U.S. Corporate Tax Legislation Reform. We are raising our 217 same store sales growth forecast to approximately 2.5% and updating our 2017 net sales growth forecast to approximately 7% which is at the high end of our prior outlook of 5% to 7% growth. We are also updating our 2017 capital expenditures forecast to be in the range of $700 million to $750 million as compared to our private previous guidance of $750 million to $765 million. Share repurchases for the fiscal 2017 continue to be forecasted at approximately $450 million.","We have been very disciplined and how we manage expenses in capital with the gold to deliver consistent, strong financial performance while positioning our business for a long term growth and we planned to continue with this strategy in the future. We are investing in initiatives and tended to drive same store sales and the loyalty across our consumer base with the value and convenience that our customers need and trust from us.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thanks, John. As we have shared with you over the course of the last several quarters. Our expectations with that overtime the transitory headwinds we were facing with moderate and our merchandizing initiatives coupled with our store manager pay in training investments will continue to contribute to our same store sales growth. I believe we saw this continue to play out in our results for the third quarter, and that we are well-positioned to continue to benefit from our model of value and convenience that is relevant to a broad cross section of shoppers.","Dollar General is differentiated by many strength; all of which are focused on the combination of value and convenience for our customers. We are executing our comprehensive strategic plans focusing on the actions that we believe have the greatest potential to drive shareholder value over the longer term. We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. Our unique strengths include more than 14,000 convenient small box stores with strong economics that allow us to serve and unreserved customers to shop our stores differently than other sectors of retail. With an average basket of about five items and an average ticket of approximately $12, our stores and product mix are streamlined to help make the shopping trip convenient for our customers. They can easily shop our stores, find what they need and beyond the link.","With our strong stores growth we anticipate that 75% of the U.S. population will be within 5 miles of a Dollar General by the end of fiscal 2017. Our range of formats from 3,500 square feet to 16,000 square feet allows Dollar General to capture growth opportunities in the areas ranging from rural to metro location. Once we find an attractive side, we can be flexible to optimize the stores square footage that can best fit the opportunity.","We are strategically investing our business to help our customers utilize digital tools and resources for our personalized shopping experience at Dollar General. We have the unique opportunity to help, shape our customers behavior and habit has their digital shopping journey all while leveraging are more than 14,000 brick-and-mortar stores and our geographic footprint to help them save time and money. We remain committed to our long term operating priorities first driving profitable sales growth. Second capturing growth opportunities, third enhancing our position as a low-cost operator, and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage.","Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth with a focus on driving both the top line and bottom-line. Our goal is to both attract and grow new customers and trips and to capture share with existing customers. This includes expanding the merchandising initiatives in our existing store base to drive traffic into those stores and improve same-store sales.","For 2018 our merchandising initiatives are designed to provide our customers with trusted simple solutions to help to manage their household budget and provide them with even more value. We know that our customer looks to us to fill an immediate need, while also providing the opportunity to make purchasing decisions in the aisle that fit within the budget.","Our research indicates that our customers, not only like but also have a need to make purchasing decisions they can see and touch, while making isle tradeoffs between shopping consideration such as opening price points affordability compared to value and\/or pack size to name just a few examples.","Based on our customer insights, we know that among the most important drivers of our customers to Dollar General is the ease of shopping our stores with the value and quality they expect from us in an enjoyable shopping experience.","Our 2018 merchandising initiatives are designed to provide easy, identifiable, everyday low prices with a focus on opening price points including the one dollar price point complement with compelling promotions. Our goals are for assortment to be differentiated and on trend and to continue to elevate the in-store experience through our store layout and then stock reliability in an easy and fun shopping environment.","In-store for 2018, we plan to redesign our snack and beverages aisle to create a best in retail shopping experience. This change in enhanced customer awareness and further position us a destination retailer for the media consumption shop through assortment and everyday low prices. Across a select group of stores, we also will be introducing and expand the assortment of better for you products with a focus on higher protein, lower salt and healthier food choices at price points that will be attracted to our customers.","The Dollar General customer looks to us to be part of her solutions for her day-to-day shopping needs. Over the last several years our expansion of coolers has helped drive trips in basket size. The affinity between perishables and other categories is evident in our customer shopping habits. We continue to believe, we have an opportunity to selectively expand cooler doors to allow a great assortment of perishable foods, ice-cream, single serve drinks and cold beer. By the end of 2017, we anticipate at across our store base. We will have an average of 18 cooler doors up from 10 in 2012.","Year-to-date through the third quarter, approximately 18,000 cooler doors have been installed across our existing stores. For the locations received an incremental coolers we continue to see an improvement in transactions. Our initiatives for 2018 will continue to build on a multi-year track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales. Given our success this year, expanding health and beauty aid products, we will be launching Phase II of this initiative. The great news is that we have a substantial opportunity to capture share in health and beauty.","Importantly, while we are making progress in our syndicated share trends this year, our health and beauty aid share is still below our customers and household needs categories. Our 2018 plans are targeted to invest in driving overall category awareness with our customers to improved and impactful displays, consistent messaging and stores and across print and digital media enhanced quality perception and superior shop ability.","We see significant runway for this category given our price advantage relative to some other channels. The expansion of private brand offerings with a focus on quality and appealing packaging will play a role in our category management process while helping our customers stretch their budgets. For instance, in just seven years, we have built a proprietary brand Rexall to nearly $200 million in sales through our commitment to quality price and assortment. We know that private brands resonate with our customer when we deliver the right combination of price and quality. Given the significant price gap as compared to national brand and to other channels such as drug stores, private brands play a significant role in helping our customers manage their budget.","Across the non-consumable categories, our 2018 merchandizing initiatives will continue to be relevant to our customers. While positioning Dollar General as a fun place to shop. We plan to introduce new and expanded categories with improved value across non-consumables. Our customer loves the in-store treasure hunt at Dollar General for unique items to delight her family. We believe our product offering will be a price points to see us comfortable with as the vast majority of our production offering will continue to be priced below $10.","Moving to our marketing initiatives, we see a continued opportunity to improve engagement and build loyalty through expansion of our digital footprint and further integration of our traditional and digital media mix. Our plan is to reach our customers, where, when and how they decide to engaged with us? We intend to continue to innovate in the channel in this area. To assist with these efforts, we have hired our first Chief Digital and Customer Engagement Officer, a newly created position that will help lead the strategy for customer engagement including digital experience and tools.","This position should help accelerate our digital strategy as we continue to develop resources to personalized offerings for our customers to save time and money. With more than 10 billion subscribers to the DG Digital Coupon Program, we have a great foundation to build on for the future. We have ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion that includes improvements in strength, global sourcing, private brands, distribution and transportation efficiency and non-consumable sales.","Inventory shrink reduction continues to be a large opportunity in gross margin. In 2018, we plan to expand electronic article surveillance to an incremental 5,000 stores, bringing the total stores with EAS to about 10,000 locations. This is a proven, high return project for us to help further reduce shrink and drive sales to improve product availability.","While we have seen carrier rates and fuel cost on the rise, we are working to mitigate this cost through stem mile reductions and optimization of loads. Our Jackson, Georgia distribution facility began shipping in October of this year. Given our experience in opening six distribution centers since 2012, the team is getting better and more efficient with each opening. The Jackson, Georgia location has come out of the gate strong as well. Additionally, across our distribution centers, we have implemented paper performance, which is a win-win for our employees and for our company.","As always we continue to work to ensure that our value proposition resonates with our customers. We are committed to providing them with everyday low prices that they know and trust. Our goal is to ensure, we are high relevant with our customers through our ongoing investments in everyday low prices and targeted promotional activity. We have consistently shared with you one of the keys to our business is growing transaction and item units.","Our pricing surveys continue to indicate that Dollar General is well positioned from a price perspective again to all classes of trade and across all geographic regions where we operate. We are committed to be in price rights for our customers to drive traffic to our stores. Our focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities is our second priority. We have a proven, high return low risk model for our real estate growth.","We constantly monitor new store productivity and returns to ensure our store's growth is the best use of our capital focusing on the following five metrics. First, new store productivity as a percent of our comp store sales, actual sales performance compared with our pro forma model. Average returns of 18% to 20%, cannibalization of our new stores on our comp store base and finally a payback period of less than two years.","Our 2017 new store growth is right on track with strong sales and returns to nearly 300 store sites we acquired earlier in 2017 continued to be an exciting opportunity for us as gain more exposure in metro locations. We are seeing that our brand is resonating in geographic areas that are new to us as some of our highest sales performance is coming from areas, where we historically have not [indiscernible]. Overall, the performance of this group of stores continues to gain traction as we build our brand in these locations.","For 2018, we expect to open 900 new stores, remodel 1,000 of our mature store locations, and relocate about 100 stores. That's about 2,000 projects in total. With solid new store productivity, we have the opportunity to significantly increase our mature store remodel program with the gold to touch each location approximately every seven to ten years. Our experience gives us confidence in the incremental sales list and returns from our remodel program as we look to enhance and consistently deliver on our brand promise to help our customer save time and money every day.","Of the 1,000 plan store remodels for 2018, we currently expect approximately 400 locations to be in the Dollar General traditional plus format with 34 cooler doors for increased perishable selection. Our cooler door expansion has proven to drive baskets and trips with our customer base, while also attractive new customers with the expanded offering. Our strong real-estate model allows us the ability to invest the new store growth and our new markets deliver new formats and reinvest in our mature store base.","Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and the fine process to control spending. At the store level, we are always focused on our process to drive productivity inside the four walls of our stores.","For 2018, our store operation initiatives are centered on space optimization and ongoing efforts to simplify operations in our stores by reducing inventory, operating complexity and product movement within the stores. These actions are designed to allow our store managers and their teams to reinvest time savings to provide better customer service and a clean in stock shopping experience.","Additionally, we have a focus on improving the speed of checkout. We look for opportunities to capture the benefits of reducing transaction time at checkout. For example, consider the significant opportunity we have to drive cost out of the system by reducing as little as three seconds in each of our approximately 2 billion customer transactions. These time savings can be reinvested by the store teams to deliver a higher level for customer service, which ultimately helps improve sales. Our ability to drive execution across our large and growing store base is a key strength to Dollar General. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always seek to be a low-cost operator.","Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage. A significant investment in-store manager compensation and training we made this year is paying off as our store management turnover for 2017 is on track to be at the lowest level in the recorded history of the company. For the seventh consecutive year, Dollar General was remained to trainee magazines, top 125 training list, moving up every year in the rankings of companies that are recognized for excellence and employ training and development.","For 2018 list to be released in February, we ranked now in the top five. Collectively the team and I are very proud of these results. The leadership of our store manager is key to help and improve the customer experience and profitability of our stores. Our investment in store manager compensation is anticipated to continue to positive impact our results next year. We are excited about how engaged our workforce is across our business. I believe that this has helped to contribute to improvement and our overall customer satisfactions scores, which are currently at the highest level of the year.","Turning now to our customer, we operate with the assumption that in challenging times, she needs us more than ever and in good times she has a little bit more money to spend with us. Regardless of the economic outlook for our consumers, our goal is to do everything we can to provide them with a great shopping experience to deliver value and convenience they need and expect from Dollar General.","We are committed to our long-term growth and to the creation of shareholder value. Our business generates significant cash flow. And we are in a position to invest in store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program and anticipated dividend. We are excited about our plans for the future. The team is making thoughtful investments that ensure our strategy resonates with our customers and positions us for the long term. I look forward to sharing more details with you in the future.","As we are in the busiest time at retail, I want to thank each of our approximately 130,000 employees across the company for their tremendous efforts to help our customers save time and money every day. The team did an amazing job during the third quarter of 2017 executing a record 634 real estate projects in just a single quarter. I appreciate all the hard work of our employees across the store operations, distribution centers, and at the store support center to support the approximately 2 billion customer transactions we execute annually.","Before we open the lines for questions, I want to let you all know that after eight years, Mary Winn, our SVP of Investor Relations, will be leaving Dollar General. Her last day will be December 15. I would like to take this opportunity to personally acknowledge Mary Winn in the significant role she has played not only in building and leading a first-class communication team but also a trusted advisor to me and the rest of the team.","On behalf of everyone here at Dollar General, we thank Mary Winn for all her insights and commitment to our organization. We wish her all the best in her next chapter. Donny Lau, Vice President of Strategy along with Kevin Walker, Director of Investor Relations, will oversee our IR function in the interim. As we search for replacement, we are fortunate to have people like Donny and Kevin on our team who have deep knowledge of the business.","I am confident you will enjoy working with them. With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Go ahead please with first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your question comes from the line of Alan Rifkin with BTIG.","Alan Rifkin","Thank you very much. Mary Winn, you are certainly going to be missed, thank you for everything over - all of these years. Todd, maybe just give us an update of [technical difficulty], one would have thought that perhaps it's a very strong comp even including the hurricane expenses we would have [saw] [ph] maybe a little bit more leverage on the SG&A line? Thank you.","Todd Vasos","Yes. I'll start, then I'll turn it over to John for a little bit more color, but we continue to be very focused on expense control here at Dollar General. And I can tell you that the team has generated a tremendous amount of savings and value this year in 2017. And what I am happy to report is that we have identified a lot of also savings for the upcoming 2018 timeframe that we will discuss with you on our next call, but I think as you look out, this team has proven over time that we are very cost conscious as well as reinvesting where appropriate to continue to drive sales. John, you might want to add something?","John Garratt","Yes, adding little more color to that, as you alluded to while SG&A was up 40 basis points, the hurricane impact of nearly $25 million was 42 basis points. While we did have some headwinds last year, I think it's important to note that there is two key headwinds this quarter with the ongoing impact of the store manager investment which again we continue to see as a great investment that will pay off for us. As we get into next year, it will no longer be a headwind.","And then the other key point is the ramp up of acquired stores. Again as we mentioned, we opened a record number of stores this quarter, up 82% over the previous year. Over half -- this 470 stores, over half of those were new stores. Many of which had expenses throughout the quarter as we were opening those up. So those put pressures on that. When you strip that out, we are still in the place we want to be from a leverage standpoint.","And as Todd said that with zero based budgeting that's really becoming [grand] [ph] in everything we do here. And I can assure you, the team is laser-focused on driving out any and all spending that don't touch our customer, support our strategic initiatives, or change our risk profile. So, we continue to be very focused on that as well as gross margin, making the right tradeoffs there while investing in the business and still see ourselves in that same leverage point that we targeted.","Alan Rifkin","Okay. Thank you very much. And just a follow-up if I may, with respect to wages, certainly the pressures on wages are well documented, but maybe Todd, if you could maybe share with us as you look to 2018, what incremental wage pressure do you see on at the store level? And also considering your core customer with higher wages being implemented in more and more states via increases in minimum wages, what benefits do you see from that consumer to your business? Thank you.","Todd Vasos","Sure. We - the one thing about what we've seen on the wage front is we continue to be right now as stand today at our highest level of participation inside of our stores. Meaning open positions are some of the lowest levels we've seen. So, we feel very good about where we are as it relates to the wages that we pay. There is no doubt that in certain states and municipalities, we've seen additional wage pressures. But we continue to operate in those environments just like we do everywhere else. As we go into 2018, we believe that some of the increase in wages whether it would be with our core consumer or others should help continue to benefit the economy in totality, which I believe that with our initiatives that we have in place, we should get more than our fair share of that participation. So, we feel good about where the consumer is right now. But as I always say, we work under the premise that she is always tight because her expenses continue to rise on the other side of expense -- excuse me, of her income rising. So we continue to make sure we're laser focused on offering value and convenience everyday for our consumer.","Alan Rifkin","Thank you. Thank you very much. And best of luck over the holiday season.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.","Shaun Cross","Hi guys. This is Shaun Cross on for Karen. And Mary Winn, you'll certainly be missed.","Mary Winn","Thanks.","Shaun Cross","Did the comp slowdown over the course of the quarter just trying to get a sense of maybe why the implied fourth quarter guidance is for slowdown on a one and two year basis?","John Garratt","Yes, if you look at the cadence across the periods in the third quarter, every period was positive. But September was the most positive of the quarter\u2019s period [Indiscernible]. I think it's also worth that noting the balance between both consumables and non-consumables being positive overall.","Shaun Cross","Okay. And then, on the gross margin, can you give us a sense what that number would have been excluding the acquired stores?","Mary Winn Pilkington","I don't [Indiscernible] meaningful impact to that at all\u2026","Todd Vasos","Yes, it wasn't a meaningful impact, yes. But we are pleased with the balance of delivering a strong top line and 8 basis points of expansion. But there wasn't a meaningful impact from that on the margin.","John Garratt","It was a couple basis points at most.","Shaun Cross","Okay. Thanks guys, appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.","Todd Vasos","Hi, Ed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning guys. This is actually Anthony [indiscernible] on for Ed. Thanks for taking my question. Just back on gross margin again. Guidance seems to imply a little compression in Q4 similar to earlier in the year. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes here? How should we be thinking about that?","Todd Vasos","Yes, well, as in the past, we don't guide on gross margin. We really like to make sure making the right tradeoff between gross margin, SG&A. But what I will say is that as you look at quarter, Q3 we are pleased to see the gross margin expansion driven by higher initial markups and shrink improvement. That was the fourth consecutive quarter of shrink improvement. What you didn't see in there is any issues around promos or clearance, that being a non-impact. And what I would say is as we look over the long term, we continue to see opportunities to enhance margins or strategically invest back as needed to drive traffic. But, continue to see opportunities around shrink. Even though we had four consecutive quarters, we continue to see opportunity to further improve that.","Team continues to do a great job around category management with more opportunity there. We see opportunity to enhance private label and foreign direct sourcing penetration and continue to see operations - opportunities around supply chain efficiencies despite some pressure from -- in the near-term from fuel rate and carrier rate. So over the long term, we continue to see opportunity there. But then also look to strike a right balance between that and managing the levers between gross margin and SG&A to deliver strong operating margin.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks guys. And congrats on a solid quarter.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Todd Vasos","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Boss","Hey, Todd. Congrats on a nice quarter.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Matthew Boss","So, Todd, can you speak to some of the learnings from your remodel program to date and just touch on maybe some of the more recent performance that you are seeing in your mature store base?","Todd Vasos","Sure. We continue to be very, very encouraged on the remodeled program, both our traditional remodels and our remodels that incorporate the additional coolers. And some of those, the entrance of producing some of those locations, those locations in particular continue to outpace our normal remodel program almost 3x. And that's what gives us great confidence as we expand the remodel program next year up to 400 stores -- 1,000 stores, excuse me, but 400 of them will be under that banner of the large coolers.","And in some cases not all 400, but some additional produce. So we continue to do very well. The customers are resonating well. We continue to see that we get about one additional trip in those stores than normal from our core customer because of that expansion of coolers. And by the way, we see expansion in those remodels in health and beauty as well, and in some of our non-consumable category. So all ships in the harbor, if you will, rise within those remodels.","Matthew Boss","That's great. And then just a follow-up, I guess larger picture, as we think about the 10 to 15% earnings growth algorithm, I think you had laid out last March, if same-store sales remains in the 2 to 4 target range that they are today, are there any headwind to achieving the 10 to 15% bottom line as we think the next year and beyond? Is that still the algorithm you think that fits with 2 to 4% comp?","Todd Vasos","Yes. We still see that 2 to 4% helps deliver the 10% plus growth algorithm. And really we will be commenting on 2018 when we will get into the March timeframe. But still see ourselves as double digit growers. And we don't see any meaningful headwinds to that in the near future.","Matthew Boss","That's great. Best of luck.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Todd Vasos","Good morning, Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning guys. How are you?","Todd Vasos","Good.","Scot Ciccarelli","Excellent. So I guess as a bit of a follow-up maybe to Alan's question from earlier. Given -- on the wages, given the success that you have seen with the increased training and the increased payroll, does it make sense in your view to actually accelerate those investments as you look out to 2018 and 2019? Just given the benefits that they have yielded or do you think you are pretty happy with kind of the performance that you have seen and there is not going to be incremental investments on that side?","Todd Vasos","Yes, we are very happy with the investments that we made here in early 2017. As I indicated, our store manager investments in both compensation and training are really paying off. What we are very proud about here is that we are seeing lowest turnover rates in recorded history from our store managers. And being an old operator and I use the term old myself, there is nothing more important than the store manager to the key of any company's success in retail.","So I think we made the exact right move in the investment in both the compensation and training. And we don't see -- we think we're in great spot based on everything we have seen and heard and continue to see out in the marketplace as far as compensation is concerned. So we don't see another round of large investments there. And we'll continue to monitor it. And we'll continue ensure that our store manager and all of our employees are taken care of on a compensation basis where appropriate.","Scot Ciccarelli","All right. That's super helpful, Todd. And just a quick follow-up because John had talked about the comp contribution from new store maturity curve, can you guys just update us in kind of where we are today in terms of the comp contribution from that new store maturity?","Todd Vasos","Yes. What we have said in the past is when you look at the net impact netted against the cannibalization, it's about 150 - 200 basis points and we are at high end of that. So we are very pleased with what we are seeing from that, from sales contribution as well as rate return.","John Garratt","Yes. Our new store program is hitting on all cylinders right now.","Scot Ciccarelli","Roger that. All right, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Keith","Hey, thanks. Good morning.","Todd Vasos","Good morning.","Peter Keith","Good morning team, nice quarter. So there has been a couple of questions around the Q4 guidance, I guess maybe I'll rephrase it as have you changed your outlook for Q4 within the context of the overall full-year guidance, because it certainly looks like there's a deceleration of fundamentals based on the implied guide.","John Garratt","We continue to see same strong business fundamentals and feel great about the business top line, bottom line. If you look at EPS based on year-to-date performance, we did narrow the guidance on that raising the bottom end of it $0.02. We only lowered the top end of that $0.03 after taking into account the $0.05 net negative impact from the hurricanes. If you strip out the hurricane impact, we really see as a raise on both the top end and the bottom end. And recall, we had indicated previously that Q3 would be the strongest quarter of the year with Q4 having a more difficult lap and included in that overlap and estimated $0.09 benefit last year from the 53rd week. So we continue to see things in a similar light.","Peter Keith","Okay, thank you, John. A follow-up that's unrelated, but there seems to be a growing drumbeat around potential welfare reform as we look out to 2018, I was wondering if you could provide a historical perspective on when there's been past welfare reform how that's impacted your business and if there are specific pockets of government subsidy programs that you'd be most concerned about getting cut?","Todd Vasos","Obviously, our core customer does rely on assistance in many areas but the one thing that we see is that if we continue to show our core customer quality and value, give her a reason to shop with Dollar General, she'll shop with us no matter what kind of economic condition is out there. And as we've always said when times are tough and they could be tougher if certain things happen along government assistance then she needs us more, because we offer that great value. So we feel that that over time she figures that out, you know, figures her budget out and over time we can continue to deliver a real benefit to her through our everyday low prices and convenience.","Peter Keith","Okay, thank you very much, and my best wishes to Mary Winn, you are one of the best.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Thank you, Pete.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Todd Vasos","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Trussell","Good morning. You guys touched on this a little bit in the call, but I just want to circle back to the acceleration that we saw this quarter on both comps and gross margins. It was a really nice acceleration, but certainly we also recognized that it came against easy compares from a year ago. And so, just help us with some additional details, the puts and takes on the sustainability of some of the drivers of comps and gross margins, particularly I'd like to hear about some of the initiatives on both the consumable but also the discretionary side of the store. And also just your outlook around the macro environment and what you're seeing that might be different in terms of just the way the consumer is acting and shopping?","Todd Vasos","Yes, Paul, when you look at our top line sales, we delivered exactly what we said we were going to deliver, and we knew that the transitory headwinds that we had called out would start to subside as we move through third quarter and into the fourth quarter as well. We saw that, but what we also saw was our initiatives really starting to take hold and really make a difference both on the consumable side and the non-consumable side of the ledger. So it was great to see the teams - the category management teams have done a great job working in tandem with our store teams and our marketing teams to get the message out.","Our core customer continues to rely on Dollar General very heavily to offer that value, that convenience, and what we continue to do is we continue to be a leader in that, in the channel. And as you look at our initiatives for the balance of '17 and into '18, it really capitalizes I believe on what our core strengths are, and exactly it is all put together, and executed against what the customer is telling us that she needs. And I think that's the important part of what has made Dollar General successful over the many, many years is that we really work hand-in-hand with our consumer, and we make the trade-offs inside the store, and sometimes it could be consumables versus non-consumables depending where she is at in her economic cycle.","What we see moving into 2018 as I talked about in my prepared remarks, I think we have a real opportunity to accelerate our non-consumable businesses, especially in areas that the consumer gives us credit for, and where she'd like to see enhancements, and stay-tuned as we get into March, we'll talk a little bit more about what those are, but I could tell you that the treasure hunt is what she's looking for and that's what we're going to be delivering to her as we continue to move forward. So we feel good about that. We feel good about our margins. Our margins, as you continue to look into the back-half of this year and into early next year, we have, as John indicated, a lot of levers to continue to work, but we always make sure that we balance that with driving traffic. And I think we've exhibited in Q3 here that we can do both of those.","Paul Trussell","Thanks for the color. And then, just looking at the cash and the balance sheet, just remind us, you guys - I think outlined a plan for $450 million or so, I believe in share repurchase this year, which is again materially below some prior year levels. Just remind us was that very specifically related to kind of the real estate acquisition and projects that you guys took on and just want to better understand how you guys think about contribution or earnings from buyback going forward?","And then also, well, I know it's pretty early and hypothetical, given that we are having conversations around tax reform, you know, if that was to flow through in terms of a lower corporate tax rate, how would you think about your investment strategy, your capital plans, and your cash usage? Thank you.","Todd Vasos","Sure. In terms of this year, it was lower than previous years because of the investments, you know, the two key investments being the investment we made in store manager pay, which again we think was the exact right decision to make; w are seeing the benefits of that, as well as the increased development. Now, as I look forward, and as we consider tax reform, obviously we're watching this very closely. As it's currently drafted, the bills are expected to have a material favorable impact to us. Obviously, the likelihood timing and details of that are uncertain, so I can't comment specifically what we would do here, but what I can tell you is we don't fundamentally see this changing our capital allocation priorities. They worked very well for us, and we see them working well for us in the future. And just to [indiscernible] what those are, it's first and foremost investing in the business, as long as we continue to see great returns in new store growth like we have, that's the best use of our capital. We will continue to do that - evaluating other high return investments in the business. The good news is this business generates tremendous amount of cash as is. So we do well under any tax code, but with the excess cash, what we do want to do is strike the right balance, pay a competitive dividend, and continue to repurchase shares with the excess cash flow up to while protecting our investment grade rating. So I don't see that's fundamentally changing as things solidify around the tax changes we can comment at that further in the future.","Paul Trussell","Thank you very much, and best of luck during the holidays, and especially best of luck to you, Mary Winn.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Thank you very much.","Todd Vasos","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Todd Vasos","Good morning.","Michael Lasser","Good morning, Todd. Thanks for taking my question. Good luck and best wish, Marry Winn. Todd, you had a range between your initiative may be more favorable environment, and it's easier to compare, how would you bring those in terms of driving the acceleration in your comps\u2026","Todd Vasos","Yes. So when you look at it, I would tell you that our initiatives are really paying off. I would tell you that would be first and foremost. And I think as you look at it, you see those initiatives paying off both in our mature stores, some of the best comp we seen in our mature store base as many years. Also in our new stores, you see that, because remember our new stores get the best and the brightest if you will of all of our initiatives, all at one time. So I think here I think that would be first and foremost. And then obviously some of those headwinds we've been talking about abating would be second on the list. So that's why we feel very good about the positioning, we are in right now for Q4 and as we move into 2018.","Michael Lasser","And then John, you talked a little bit about what you do from a capital perspective, you said that if there is tax reform, your tax rate goes down, how would you think about your - in that sort of environment, would you take that as an opportunity to invest for your margin, lower your margin, and either lower prices or best more in your stores or below the line through your profitability?","John Garratt","Again, we will have to wait and see exactly how that comes up. What I would say is as we see it now, we see ourselves continuing to operate, run the business same way we have this worked quite well obviously evaluating situations as we go, but feel pretty happy about the way we are managing all the levers now.","Michael Lasser","And I guess, piece of that would depend on what happened - what your competitors do? So with that being said, are you seeing any changes in the promotional environment, the pricing environment that would suggest maybe getting better or worse right now?","John Garratt","Yes, I would tell you that as far as the competitive environment, it's always competitive to retail, but as you look at it, we really haven't seen a change in the competitor environment in the last few quarters. So we're - it's about where it was. And the great thing is that Dollar General is positioned very well price-wise both every day price and the promotional activity that we have to offer for the consumer. And the other thing that we offer her is a great compelling offering on our digital side. More and more digital engagement is starting to happen here at Dollar General with our core consumer. And if that continues to resonate with our core, you'll continue to see more of that, and I believe that overall our core customer is responding pretty well to all of the initiatives that we put together here in 2017. And again, that's what gives us a great solace as we move into 2018 that we can continue to keep that momentum moving.","Michael Lasser","Thank you, and have a good holiday.","John Garratt","Sure.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Operator, I think we have time for one more question. Flip one in.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.","Todd Vasos","Hi, Chuck.","Chuck Grom","Good Morning. Most of my questions have been asked, but it's just first on the fourth quarter implied comp; it doesn't sound like [indiscernible] anything with your consumer that's given you guys pause here in the first five or six weeks of 4Q? And then second, to follow-up on Matt's question earlier on the remodel cadence, you doing a 1,000 total projects, 400 are the traditional plus, and as you alluded to, the comp is usually 3X a traditional remodel, so just my question is why not accelerate that pace, what's the potential to - what's the store potential to roll that traditional plus out, and then could you shed some light on how many are going to receive produce this year?","Todd Vasos","Sure. So, as you look at so far in the quarter, yes, we don't see anything that shows us that anything is really changing in the quarter. We feel good about where the comp is. But keep in mind, we have a lot of quarter ahead of us, some of our biggest weeks leading up to Christmas here the next three weeks, and January traditionally in our channel is a very good month for us as well. So, we'll continue to watch that, stay-tuned, but we feel good about where that comp is headed.","As it relates, Chuck, to the remodel program, you're right, 1,000 remodels is on the books for next year as we indicated. I think that's a very aggressive plan. It really touches a lot of our mature store base. And with 400 of them being in the traditional plus model, we feel very good about where those comps can head. But one thing to keep in mind, on the traditional plus model is that like our real estate program in general, we are very disciplined on where we put the certain stores and what format we put them in, because we've got a proven track record of where they are most successful. And I can tell you that of the - of thousands that we are doing, the 400 that we fit, we feel very good about the success rate that we should see from those 400. We probably have another 2,000 to 3,000 of those opportunities as they exist today, but you know what, as we continue to learn more about what the consumer is buying out of those traditional plus stores, and what they continue to ask us for, that actually could expand; we could see that opportunity could be as high as 5,000, and we are watching that as we speak, and we will continue to monitor it as we move forward.","And then, produce, we continue to work the produce side, because it is a competitive advantage for us in many areas when we offer produce. I could tell you that out of the 400, probably 25% of them or so will probably have produce as we look at it, but as we continue to learn the produce business, our stores learn more about it, I think there is going to be more and more opportunity for that as well in the upcoming years ahead of us.","Chuck Grom","Great. Thanks a lot. Mary Winn, you are going to be missed. Take care.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Thank you very much.","Mary Winn Pilkington","With that, I will conclude our call for today. Kevin, Donnie, and I will be around today to do calls, and I look forward to speaking to you. Thank you for your continued support at Dollar General.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"7008":["Dollar General Corp.

Today is Thursday, March 12, 2015. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Investor Relations","Thank you, Lauridale, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are: Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Vasos, our Chief Operating Officer; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call for questions.

At the end of our prepared remarks, we'll open the call up to your questions on those subjects. Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up question, if necessary.","Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Today, we reported results for the fourth quarter 2014 and the full-year. 2014 was a unique year for Dollar General as we generated record operating results, but our strategic actions to acquire Family Dollar were unsuccessful. However, as our results and outlook indicate, Dollar General has a very promising future.","Today's accelerated store growth plans for 2016 and expanded capital return plan for shareholders, reaffirm our continued confidence in our long-term growth prospects. Returning cash to shareholders remains a top priority and we plan to return approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders during 2015 through both share repurchases and the initiation of the regular cash quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share.","I'm excited about another great year in 2015 as we look to capitalize on the numerous opportunities ahead of us. We have been and remain focused on Dollar General's core business, and we are confident that Dollar General is well positioned for sustainable growth, creating shareholder value going forward.","Let's recap some of the highlights for 2014. Full-year sales increased 8% to a record $18.9 billion, and sales per square foot increased to $223. 2014 marked our 25th consecutive year of same-store sales growth, as we delivered same-store sales growth of 2.8% for the year. Importantly, our trends improved as we move through the year.","Our same-store sales for the fourth quarter increased 4.9%, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of acceleration. In the quarter, same-store sales growth was balanced across both consumables and non-consumables. The non-consumable categories have now had four consecutive quarters of improvement, with notable strength in apparel and home.","For the year, GAAP earnings per share increased 10%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 9%. Net income in the fourth quarter increased 10%. Earnings per share improved 16% to $1.17 per share. For the quarter, the recent West Coast port slowdown negatively impacted our earnings per share by approximately $0.02 as higher-margin merchandise coming through the West Coast port was delayed. This estimate includes incremental costs for shipments that had to be diverted to alternative facilities on the East Coast.","For the 28th consecutive quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket. We generated significant cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion, an increase of more than 8%. During the year, we returned $800 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 14.1 million shares of common stock.","As our results indicate, we continued to make great progress in 2014. We opened 700 new stores and exceeded our combined remodels and relocation targets with 915 stores, increasing our selling square footage by 6.3%. We broke ground on our 13th distribution center in San Antonio, Texas, to help us serve our growing store base in the Southwest and generate efficiencies.","On the merchandising front, we continue to innovate and improve the sales productivity of our stores. We successfully completed our first full-year of tobacco sales and saw positive year-over-year performance after the anniversary. Our renewed focus on $1 to $5 items continue to gain traction with our customers. Now, more than 75% of our SKUs or 76% of our sales in the fourth quarter were items priced at $5 or less.","I'm pleased to say that we continue to increase our overall market share of consumables in both units and dollars across all markets over the four-week, 12-week, 24-week, and 52-week periods ending January 31, 2015. As we experienced last quarter, our emphasis on affordability continues to pay off, as our unit share growth continues to outpace our dollar share growth over any period measured in the last 52 weeks.","In 2014, we successfully stabilized our shrink performance in the second quarter. Shrink had a modest positive contribution year-over-year to our gross margin performance in the second half of the year. This should bode well for 2015.","We re-launched our customer satisfaction survey at the beginning of 2014 to reevaluate those aspects of the store experience that have the greatest impact on satisfaction and customer spending. We have seen the response from our customers improved consistently over the last six months as we measure what is important to them.","We are constantly striving to fill the needs and meet the changing demands of our customers. Looking ahead to 2015, we are cautiously optimistic for our core customer. For the first time in a number of years, there appears to be the potential for tailwinds to outweigh the headwinds for macro trends. And the consumer is more positive as indicated by the recent consumer sentiment levels and consumer confidence having recently been at the highest level since August of 2007.","It is my belief that these consumer confidence ratings are impacted by a headlines job number that has improved and by lower energy prices. Offset to these positives are the elevated under-employment rate along with the continuing low labor participation rate. And we are watching these factors closely.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Todd to talk about our initiatives for 2015.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Rick. Moving on to 2015, our four operating priorities remain clear: driving productive sales growth; enhancing gross margin; leveraging process improvement and IT to reduce costs; and strengthening and expanding our culture of serving others. The team is focused and we are excited about our initiatives for 2015.","We continue to be committed as ever to providing our customers with everyday low prices they know and trust at Dollar General. Affordability will play a key role as we look to expand SKUs across the store at the sweet spot of $1 to $5. Growing transactions and item units will continue to be key to our market share performance as we build upon our track record of success.","In anticipation of changes to the competitive landscape, we've been testing several different labor models to determine the potential impact on sales growth. The goal of the test was to strategically target labor investments to grow market share in competitive environment, while providing for positive financial returns.","Our experience in this test and learn has been positive and we are selectively investing in store labor this year. The store operations team has specific metrics and time tables for achieving results. The great part of this is that we can be nimble in making adjustments to the model as appropriate. While I won't go into more detail today, I look forward to sharing more specifics and results as we roll through the program in 2015.","In addition, we have realigned our store operations management structure to optimize the scale of our divisions, regions and districts to improve accountability and maximize mentorship and teamwork, all while driving stronger more sustainable results. We made the alignment changes based on feedback we received from our field teams and a strategic evaluation of our operational structures and store growth plans. The result is an operational structure that allows our field leaders to focus on store standards and ultimately create a better and more consistent shopping experience for our consumers.","For 2015 on average, we have reduced the number of stores per district. By optimizing the scale of our districts, we will reduce the time our district managers spend driving, so they can invest more time mentoring and coaching our store managers on developing and strengthening their team. This should result in improved store standards, and drive incremental sales.","On the merchandising front, we're in the midst of repackaging our private brands across both select consumable and non-consumable categories. The goal of the repackaging is to enhance our customers' perception of our private brand quality and value for the price. We had a test launch of the new packaging in select products with very encouraging results. And the majority of these repackaged items are expected to be on the shelf by mid-year. We continue to grow our private brands, with SKU count up 6% over 2013 and penetration of about 24%.","We are continuously looking for ways to leverage technology and engage our customers. We completed the initial rollout of our digital coupon capabilities in August and began to aggressively launch the program at the end of September and throughout the fourth quarter with our Fast Way to Save promotion. To date, signups have significantly exceeded our expectations, with about one million customers having register for the program. With more than 35 million digital coupons downloaded already, activations and redemptions are having a strong impact on sales of coupon specific items.","In 2015, we'll be able to use the data captured from this program like a loyalty card, but without the incremental cost. For instance, we plan to use these insights from a customer shopping trip to customize individual promotions, and ultimately drive incremental trips and larger baskets.","Shrink improvement has been and continues to be one of our largest gross margin opportunities as we remained committed to reducing our shrink levels on a store-by-store basis. At Dollar General, every function is involved in driving shrink improvement. The store format and layout, SKU rationalization of high shrink items, defensive merchandising, and exception-based reporting all play a role as we look for shrink improvement going forward.","Driving productivity at the store level is as important as ever. Our overarching goal is to create time savings that we can reinvest to better manage our stores and serve our customers. In order to enhance our productivity gains, we are elevating the category management processes to optimize all areas of the stores beyond the planograms to include all-shelf and end cap displays.","Over the last several years, we have made significant strides in the productivity of our planograms through SKU selection and ongoing refinement. We feel we have established a strong foundation on our planograms that we can refine periodically. We are concentrating on simplifying work at the store level by reducing the complexity of planogram resets.","At Dollar General, real estate is a core strength. Our real estate model is disciplined and focused on financial returns. We're very optimistic about our new store outlet for 2015 as our pipeline is full and the real estate team is already working on the pipeline for accelerated growth in selling square feet of approximately 7% in 2016. This translates to approximately 900 new store openings for 2016. We have a strong track record of delivering exceptional returns in our new store program, and we are confident in our model going forward.","In total, growth in selling square footage in 2015 is expected to be about 6%. Just to put this growth in perspective, this equates to about seven projects a day for our real estate team across new stores, relocations and remodels. We plan to open approximately 730 new stores. We have already expanded our footprint into three new states in 2015; Maine, Rhode Island and Oregon, as we use our real estate model to identify winning sites for our traditional Dollar General format.","Our new stores' productivity continues to be 85% of our comp base, and we're looking forward to successful new store openings in 2015. In addition, about 875 stores will be relocated or remodeled in 2015. In 2014, we concentrated our remodel program on our legacy smaller footprint stores. This approach allowed us to improve adjacencies and planogram layouts.","These stores are getting closer to the same sales lift as we get in our full remodels with a much lower investment, resulting in returns on lifecycle remodels that are over 200 basis points higher than our full remodels. As a result of the success of our lifecycle remodels in 2014, we are applying these learnings to all remodels in 2015.","During the first quarter of 2015, we are utilizing our merchandising predictive technology capabilities in select lifecycle remodels to optimize our space and SKU productivity, so we can expect these remodels to drive even higher sales.","Also in 2015, we will open our 13th distribution center as we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our growth. We plan on shipping from this distribution center in late fiscal 2015. We are excited about our plans, and I'm confident that we'll meet our operating goals.","We continue to be cautiously optimistic regarding the economic outlook for our customers, but we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General.","Now, David will share a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance and our 2015 guidance.","David M. Tehle - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Rick and Todd have taken you through the highlights and strategies. Let me now take you through some of the important financial detail of the quarter and year as well as our outlook for fiscal 2015.","Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 31.7% of sales, a decrease of 23 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. As compared to the prior-year, the two most significant factors were the negative impact from the West Coast port slowdown and the LIFO provision that was made in the fourth quarter.","Specifically, the West Coast port disruption led to an estimated $8.5 million or $0.02 per share negative impact due to the higher margin inventory receipts not being received and incremental transportation costs. In addition, we recorded a LIFO provision of about $1.1 million in the 2014 fourth quarter compared to a LIFO benefit of $4.5 million in the 2013 fourth quarter.","Total SG&A increased by 27 basis points in the fourth quarter as we were lapping last year's significant leverage in SG&A due to the reversal of incentive compensation in the fourth quarter of 2013. This alone contributed 34 basis points to the SG&A increase. In addition, we incurred $6.1 million in expense during the fourth quarter of 2014 or 12 basis points related to the attempted acquisition of Family Dollar.","We had good underlying expense performance that was favorable for both retail and admin functions. Our tax rate for the quarter was 34.8% compared to 37.5% in the 2013 quarter. This included a $9 million or $0.03 per share benefit from the reenactment retroactive to January 1, 2014 of the Federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit. This was in line with the outlook we provided on our third quarter call. The fourth quarter of 2014 also benefited from the deductibility of expenses incurred in prior quarters associated with our attempted acquisition of Family Dollar.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents at year-end totaled nearly $580 million as we did not buy back shares in the second half of the year, because of the attempted acquisition. At year-end, merchandise inventories were $2.78 billion, up 9% in total or 2.9% on a per store basis.","Total capital expenditures were $374 million, including $127 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $102 million for new leased stores; $38 million for stores built by us; $64 million for distribution center and transportation-related items; and $35 million for information system upgrades and technology-related projects.","Now, for an overview of our guidance for 2015; we expect topline sales for 2015 to increase 8% to 9%. Overall selling square footage is expected to grow approximately 6% and same-store sales are expected to increase by 3% to 3.5%. Operating profit is forecasted to be in the range of 7% to 9% over adjusted operating profit for 2014.","We expect our full-year tax rate to be approximately 37% to 38%. Similar to 2014, we expect the WOTC legislation to be reenacted by the end of 2015. This benefit is included in our tax rate. As a result, our effective tax rate will be higher early in the year and lower later in the year.","We expect diluted earnings per share of $3.85 to $3.95, representing growth of 10% to 13% over the 2014 adjusted EPS of $3.50. We remained committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment grade rating.","Demonstrating this commitment, we announced today, we have initiated a regular, quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock. The board also approved an additional $1 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. We are assuming approximately 295 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year, which assumes the anticipated repurchase of approximately $1.3 billion of our common stock. All-in, this repurchase activity represents approximately 6% of our current market capitalization.","Also to put this in context, since December of 2011, we have repurchased $2.3 billion of our common stock. By the end of fiscal 2015, we are forecasting total share repurchases since inception to be about $3.6 billion with 2015 repurchases representing about 36% of the total.","In total, as Rick mentioned, we plan to return about $1.6 billion to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends in 2015. 2015 capital expenditures are forecasted to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Approximately 35% will be for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; 30% for new leased stores or stores built by us; 25% for distribution center and transportation-related items; and 10% for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects.","As we mentioned, we're closely monitoring the residual effect of the West Coast port slowdown and the impact on our seasonal merchandise receipts. The good news is that a tentative agreement has been reached, but it will take months to clear the backlog. Right now, based on the current status of shipments and the uncertainties surrounding the situation, we anticipate a possible drag to earnings of about $0.01 to $0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter and we'll continue to monitor the impact to the timing of receipts and any potential sales and markdown risks as we work through the backlog.","As our long-term track record demonstrates, Dollar General is well-positioned to serve our customers regardless of how the economy plays out.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rick.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, David. Before we wrap up, I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude to David upon his announced retirement. David has served for nearly 11 years as our CFO. He has been a trusted advisor, business partner, and more importantly, a good friend to me. His financial acumen, partnership and steady hand at the helm of our financial strategy have been instrumental in transforming Dollar General and in fueling our impressive growth.","While I will truly miss David's leadership and working with him on a daily basis, I am incredibly happy for him, and I want to wish David, his wife, Mona, and his two sons, Nick and Tony, much happiness as they embark on this exciting new journey.","Dollar General is a strong and growing business with a tremendous high store return growth opportunities that we intend to capture. Our long-term commitment to growth in shareholder value are unchanged. Even as the competitive landscape continues to evolve, we have a business model that is proven and resilient.","Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and dividends. More importantly, I remain excited by the countless opportunities in front of Dollar General and convinced of its ability to capture them.","My appreciation and thanks goes out to more than the 105,000 Dollar General employees that executed nearly 1.7 billion customer transactions in 2014, while fulfilling our mission of serving others.","With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines up for questions.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Investor Relations","Operator, we'll go for questions. But you might repeat the instructions, if you would, please, for getting in the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And your first question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Hi.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Chuck.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Congrats, David, on your retirement. Just the first question, on the 4.9% comp, could you share with us how it trended during the quarter and any thoughts on quarter-to-date trends? And also, just curious, given your roughly 11% exposure to Texas, how the Texas market's holding in for you?","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The comps, Chuck, accelerated through the quarter. Every period is getting progressively better. The weather the last couple weeks has been a little funky again, but I would say the first part of the current quarter is performing as expected. And Texas continues to be one of the strongest markets we have.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just bigger picture, with the FDO deal now in the past, can you give us a sense for what you think the company's longer-term store potential could be? And as a follow-up to that, where you think the DG Market concept fits into the equation?","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Like we do every year, Chuck, in January, we evaluate the number of opportunities that are out there. We still see over 13,000 opportunities for Dollar Stores in the continental United States. As we committed, we're going to accelerate our store growth in 2016. We still believe store growth is the best use of our funds right now based on the returns we generate and how they comp after that first year.","Dollar General Market is very much still, I would say, in the testing stage for us. As I've said before, I have grown up selling produce and meat, but teaching somebody to sell produce and meat are two entirely different things. And we continue to work on that concept.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Okay. Great. Best of luck.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Investor Relations","Operator, we'll go to the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Paul.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning and congrats on a good quarter and congrats, David, on the retirement.","David M. Tehle - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Staying on that, Rick, David, you've been quite a duo here for some time. Can you just discuss the timing of your departures a bit more in detail? 2015 is becoming quite a big transitional year for Dollar General. Just why should we be extremely confident in DG's ability to continue to perform in what's an ever-changing competitive and consolidating marketplace? And also, why has the board not yet announced a successor for you, Rick, and what are the qualities that are being sought out?","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think, Paul, it's very fair, and I'll let David weigh in here. Quite honestly, one of the things that we worked incredibly hard on in this company over the last few years has been the depth of our bench. And I think what should give all of you \u2013 make you feel all really good is while David and I might be departing, there's a tremendous amount of strength behind us that manages this company on a day-in and day-out basis and actually has been advising David and I for a very long period of time.","If you think about \u2013 there has been change over the last few years and the bulk of that change has been satisfied by the bench that we had developed that we've been able to promote from within.","In regards to myself, I can tell you the board is actively engaged in the search and the board is making solid progress. And I would anticipate that my successor over the course of the next short period of time will probably be identified.","David, did you have any...","David M. Tehle - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Just briefly, obviously, retirement is a personal decision. I'm at the age where most people start to think seriously about it. This gives me a rare opportunity to spend lots of valuable time with my two teenage sons as they finish their last years of high school, and now I'll be able to make all of their events, which is something most fathers don't get to do.","Over the past 11 years, particularly over the past eight years, I've lived every CFO's dream. I was part of the team that took this company private in 2007, took it public in 2009 and have been able to participate in one of the most spectacular retail growth stories of this decade and it's continuing. As we announced today, with our square footage growth for 2016 and opening 900 new stores; again, that's nothing short of spectacular.","I believe I'm leaving one of the finest finance and accounting teams in retail today. So, the company is in good hands in that respect and I wouldn't be leaving if I didn't feel that way. So, the experience has been great for me. I believe it'll continue to be great for our shareholders and our employees as the Dollar General story keeps moving on.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I appreciate the color. Just to follow up on a remaining bigger picture, maybe just a bit more detail on how you came up with the capital return plan, some of the discussions you all had to decide to initiate the dividend, and just how we should think about you guys managing the leverage ratio going forward. Or is the plan to maintain this three times kind of adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio on a go-forward basis? Are you willing to be more aggressive at times and go above that? Just how should we think about the balance of capital returns going forward?","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","David?","David M. Tehle - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. I'll jump in here and please, Rick or Todd, anything else you want to add here. I think probably the better question is, why didn't we do a dividend earlier? 85% of companies in the S&P 500 pay a dividend. And until today, we were the largest retailer not paying one. So, we clearly were an outlier on the dividend.","As we look at this decision, in this low interest rate environment, the dividend is highly valued by investors that are trying to find yield, and obviously, it's hard to find yield in the debt markets. I think this also sends a positive signal to the market of our confidence in future profitability and cash flow of the company.","As we look at the share buyback, again, and we went through some of these statistics, we've already returned $2.1 billion through the share repurchases since we went public in 2009, and we're guiding another $1.3 billion in 2015. That's 62% of what we bought back over the last five years, all being bought back in one year in 2015. So, we are consistent in our share repurchases over time, and that investment grade rating is important to us. We've talked about that in the prepared comments.","We believe from our research that that's our optimal capital structure, is to be at that lower rung of investment grade, and it provides us with flexibility for growth and ultimately shareholder returns.","At the same time, and I'd said this for many years, our number one priority in terms of investing is investing in our stores, store growth and then having the infrastructure in place to support that. And as I just mentioned, we're growing stores at a greater rate now than we have probably any time in the history of the company as we move forward into 2016, at least in the modern history of the company. So, we'll continue to make that a priority.","In terms of the leverage ratio; again, right now, because of our view that the optimal capital structure is going to be at that lowest-rung of investment grade, our intent is to stay somewhere in that range. Clearly, the management team and the board will continually review this on an ongoing basis, and so stay tuned on that; but right now, we're very happy with where we are and what we're doing.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Congrats and thank you.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Paul.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Investor Relations","All right. Operator, we'll move on to the next question, please?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, John.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning, Rick. So, two things just on the long-term. How many stores can the organization handle annually? When you think about that 7% number, obviously, it gets bigger as the base gets bigger. When do you get to a point where you worry about execution? And then you're basically assuming for this year, if I look at your guidance, roughly flat EBIT margin. Is that the right long-term algorithm or do you think there is room for margin improvement maybe as shrink goes down and you leverage G&A and things like that?","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd tell you what, John. I'll let Todd handle the first part; and David, you can take the second part of that one.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Rick. John, and we've stated many times, we look at our store openings and the projects that we can do. We look at it from the respect of capacity and the capacity of our folks to be able to deliver the high-quality sites that we've been come to known to deliver over the many years. So, we continue to reevaluate that. And as you've heard and you've seen, we've stepped it up to 730 stores this year and then into 900 stores the following year. So, we'll continue to look at ways to continue to do more projects as we move forward, but we're committed to square footage growth in that 6% to 7%.","David M. Tehle - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think as we look at our operating margin, clearly, we do expect better performance than we saw in 2013 and 2014, given some of the product category headwinds we had from tobacco in those years.","As we look forward, I think as we look at shrink and category management and foreign sourcing, again, we still think we have room to expand the operating margins. Now, we've got to make a decision, and I've said this many times, in terms of how much of that to let fall to the bottom line and how much to invest back in our pricing, because ultimately, our number one goal remains selling units through the box and making sure that we continue to grow our transactions.","But again, there's still room there, particularly when you look at shrink category management and foreign sourcing.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And then, Rick, just as a follow-up on DG Market, when you look at what Aldi is doing, Lidl coming. Does that format hold greater importance to you strategically than it might have a couple years ago? Before you leave, can you kind of get it on the right track? And then is it \u2013 do you see more of the impact will be more in \u2013 if you do go forward with it, more in the format itself or learnings that you take back into the core Dollar Stores be it produce, expanded food, or we're not really going to see that?","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think as I look at what we do best, and probably, I would say, John, right now, the best format we have when you mentioned competitors like Aldi, is our 7,500 square foot box. Yeah, there's some \u2013 Aldi has some more consumables in it. But, you've got to remember, we're a convenient shop. We're not a destination shop. And I think that 7,500 box, when you look at that producing $223 a foot, you look at where it has come from, we believe that is the best piece we've got.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","When I think about Dollar General Market, I think you hit the nail on the head. I think that learnings are what we're extracting from that. And the fact that some of those learnings eventually are going to work their way into that 7,500 highly productive box.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Investor Relations","All right. Operator, we'll move on to the next question, please?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Dan.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. David, we'll be sorry to see you go, but congratulations on your retirement.","David M. Tehle - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC","My question was related to expansion this coming year and then as you step it up to 7% square footage growth next year, is there a particular regional focus that you'll have?","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Dan, that's a great question. The store base is going to expand pretty much uniformly, all the way through United States. Obviously, we've just entered Oregon, Rhode Island and Maine. So, probably a little bit more emphasis there, but the idea is that to spread it out across United States.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC","And you cited the focus on price investment. Just curious, if you could comment on what you're seeing in the competitive landscape this past quarter and early this quarter?","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good. Todd, do you want to take that one?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Sure, Dan. What we've seen is, in our channels and really across retail, it's always competitive. But, what we've seen is a pretty rational competitive set, if you will, when you look at it, definitely much more rational than it was in fourth quarter of 2013. But, there's pockets here and there, we see depending on the formats that we see out there that \u2013 there are some competitors that may get a little hotter than others.","But, we are committed to ensuring that we drive units and that we look at our share very, very intently each and every week to ensure that we're staying very competitive. But, I think the biggest thing to take away is, we are squarely EDLP-focused. So, everyday-low-price-focused in everything we do.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Investor Relations","Okay. Operator, we'll move on to the next question, please?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Meredith.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, and lots of luck to you, David.","David M. Tehle - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Meredith.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I've got a couple of questions. When David was talking about the things that would drive the operating margin, he didn't specifically mention higher sales of discretionary items, even though, I know that your apparel and home business is doing well. But, do you see as the customer feels better that there is the potential to drive more high-margin sales?","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the answer to that is, yes. We've worked really, really hard on the non-consumable side, Meredith. And I have to be honest it took us a little longer to get there than we wanted. But, I'd tell you what, the team that Todd and David assembled down there are really clicking now. And what's really encouraging about the non-consumable side is the rate of sell-through and we're seeing a much larger, a much higher sell-through on those goods which, to your point, brings up the incremental margin, helps us with the incremental margin.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then I guess my other question is maybe just a little more technical for David. But, you continue to invest capital in stores that you're building yourselves and I'm sure the economics of that are attractive. But, I'm wondering whether there is an opportunity to do sale leasebacks, rates are low. And then, if you were to do that, first, I don't know, maybe you could tell us how many stores you own at this point and whether you could generate incremental capital that could be invested or given back to shareholders?","David M. Tehle - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And, of course, last year, we did do sale leaseback and we use those proceeds to buy back stock. So, it is something we'll definitely take a look at, it's always on. We don't have any plans right now to do it. It's always on the radar screen and, certainly, it's something that we'll take a hard look at. And then how many owned stores we have? Yeah, we have between 500 and 600 owned stores right now.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Investor Relations","5%.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's not that many, okay. Thank you very much.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Investor Relations","All right. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice print. Can you help break down the components of your 3% to 3.5% same-store sales guide? Particularly, I know you guys benefit on the real estate side from the new store waterfall. It sounds like you have a lot of traffic driving initiatives. And then just maybe touch on the expectation for non-food given the recent acceleration.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think Todd wants to take that one.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. When you take a look at it, we definitely \u2013 from our new store maturation, we see 1.5 to 2 percentage points of comp. Of course, category management plays a big piece in our comp as well. So, between category management and execution at store level, we really make up the balance piece of that. But, affordability continues to be a key focus of ours to continue to drive the sales, as well as our focus on private brands.","And then, lastly, you heard we're doing a lot of remodels. We did a lot last year and we continue to do those in 2015 and updating that base out there of existing stores really makes a difference as we start to look at these remodels and adding to the comp. So, when you put it all together, we feel pretty good about that 3% to 3.5% comp range.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would piggyback on that, Matt. And Todd did a great job of talking about it, but his work on the affordability issue, the fact that over 75% of our SKUs in sales now are targeted between $1 and $5 that has a lot of broad appeal across a lot of income strategies. And, we are continuing to work on that very hard and see upside on that initiative in 2015 and beyond, to be honest about it.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then on the stores front, Rick, can you just elaborate on the return profile and the payback period on new stores? And any changes you guys have seen in productivity levels at some of your more recent openings?","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I will. Our stores still open up at about 85% of our average store volume. 99% of our stores continue to be four-wall EBITDA positive. And the payback is roughly a year, year-and-a-half in that window.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Wow. Nice quarter. Best of luck.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take the next call.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Dan.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning. Well, we hate to see all you young guys retiring from the company.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Actually, I was waiting for someone to say I've been carrying David Tehle for 11 years.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I just wanted to ask on the stepped up expansion rate in 2016, if you could talk about the type of real estate projects, particularly in terms of geography, that you'll be pursuing that you would have perhaps passed on a year ago. And thinking specifically when you think about suburban, urban and rural markets, if we're going to see a change in the pace that you open in those three type of geographies.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think Todd has got a thought on that, Dan.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Dan. As Rick said earlier, it is going to be broad-based across everywhere we're actually already operating stores in. We continue to look at all areas that we operate in. California continues to be an opportunity for us. We know that someday there will be over 1,100, 1,200 stores in California. So, that continues to be an opportunity.","But, when you look at it in 2016, our balance between metro and rural is going to be about where it's been over the course of the last few years. And then as we go into outer years, we'll continue to leverage our learnings that we've got moving through on our metro stores and be able to open up more of those as we move into 2017, 2018 and 2019. And...","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Todd, how would you \u2013 go ahead, I'm sorry.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","If I could piggyback that on, Dan, as we move further and further deeper into the 13,000, we're going to produce more and more metro stores. And the team is looking at lots of different alternatives there in terms of the size of the box. We've actually been \u2013 I think, we've really done a great job on the mix that's in the stores. I do think that we have figured something out that we're going to test in 2015 that could really guide us, really help generate incremental returns in the metro.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","When you say metro stores, I'm assuming you're including suburban with urban. I was curious -- how would you characterize Dollar General's success in suburban markets which might have higher income levels than the company has targeted historically?","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Go ahead, Todd.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Operating Officer","I'm sorry...","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. You go ahead, Todd.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So, when you look at it, our suburban stores -- we're happy with the performance of those stores. But, as Rick indicated, we're testing some things both in suburban and metro that we really feel can benefit us as we move through 2015 and beyond, both from a labor perspective and a merchandising perspective, with our technology that we've got moving in merch, to ensure we have the right mix of products, as well as the right gross margin that is generated from that. So, we feel pretty good about where we are, but there's always more learnings yet.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's fair to say that we're getting sophisticated enough now, we're able to alter the mix.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Operating Officer","That's right.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Investor Relations","Okay. Operator, we'll move to the next call.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Scott.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody. And, David, everyone saying congratulations. I've got to say maybe I'm just a little envious. I have teenage kids at home, so congrat. I guess it's going to be nice to spend a lot more time with them.","David M. Tehle - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you very much.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know, Scott. I raised two kids. I don't know if being home when they're teenagers is a good thing or not.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Anyway. So, I guess, I wanted to get to labor costs, what you're thinking as we look through the year. Obviously, a competitor raised their labor rates, but with labor markets getting pretty tight and how that affects your business \u2013 what you're seeing in store manager turnover?","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'll take that one. And then, Todd, if you want to lay any color on it, that'd be fine. I know we're talking a lot about the minimum wage thing and what has happened with one of the larger big box operators out there.","A couple of things I'd like to lay out, Scott; number one is, we don't have a single time full-time employee that's making minimum wage, not one. About 12% of our employees, all part time, are at the minimum wage rate. But, the fascinating thing is the way our structure is in the store, after about five months, they are in a position to be promoted to what we call as a key carrier. And our average key carrier makes $9 an hour, approximately $9 an hour.","So, it's pretty safe to say that we -- our whole workforce is not making minimum wage and there is some sort of grand or fearful expense that's going to be there. And, when I'm talking about minimum wage, I'm obviously talking about the federal minimum wage.","What we are going to do, though, I think it's fair to say the labor market conceivably is tightening up. We're going to keep our eyes, we're going to continue to monitor the landscape and we'll assess or make any adjustments that we need to make. But, right now, in terms of what we're paying our people, we feel pretty comfortable that we're there.","Our store manager turnover, quite frankly, is operating where it has been for a period of time. We look at it in terms of voluntary turnover and involuntary turnover. And obviously, there's a big difference between the two. And when you add those two up, our turnover is around approximately 30%, which is a little high, quite frankly, for retail. I'd like to see that number down in the mid- to low-20%s. But also I would tell you that our turnover has been improving over the course of last six months or seven months. And it's continuing to move in a solid direction, so...","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. That's perfect. And if I could just follow-up one, and maybe \u2013 I know this transition going on with the leadership and everything, so maybe it's too strategic. But, obviously, you went for Family Dollar; it didn't work out. When you think about acquisitions or you think about capital deployment, is acquisitions part of what you consider or is it really not? Is it kind of one unique situation and not something we'd look at.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","A very fair question. And I will tell you, Scott, David and I have always looked at everything. So, the answer is nothing is ever off the table. We want to look. We want to (53:39) understand what we can do to maximize value for our shareholders. And if that opportunity raises itself down the road, I'm sure that the management team is going to want to look at it.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Perfect. Thanks.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Investor Relations","All right. Operator, we'll move on to the next question, please?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Matt.","Matt R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone. David, I'll add my congrats as well. I've actually got one question on the quarter, which is, I would love a little bit of color on the seasonal business. It looks like sales per foot were down about 1%, the two-year stack was down about 6%. Is some of that related to the port or are there some other issues there?","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Todd, go ahead.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Matt, this is Todd. So, when you look at our seasonal business, first I want to say it's very healthy. Now when you back down and take a look at the components, the majority of the components are doing very well. The one structural piece that we as well as probably other retailers are fighting and battling every day is the toy business.","The toy business is embedded in our seasonal business; and structurally, as we all know, that business has been very, very tough over the past few years with electronics and computers and video games and everything else being much more prominent to kids these days than the toys.","But, we're very happy when you look at seasonal. The team has done a tremendous amount of work on affordability within seasonal. We had about 26% last year more $1 items than we had the year before. I could tell you they were squarely focused on the buy this year, which is now complete for holiday of 2015. And that number has been stepped up even more. But, our sweet spot, as we said before, is really $1 to $5, but in seasonal $1 to $3 is really where we play and we do very well in.","Matt R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. That's helpful. And then secondly, I was looking to see if we could get some more color on the labor model that Todd mentioned, the new labor model. Is the primary goal to speed up checkout or is it more about maintaining the store? Love to get some more color on that and also whether that would be baked in the guidance if you decide to roll it out more broadly this year? Thanks.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Matt, thanks for letting me answer that one. I could tell you that the labor model that we have currently existing in our stores, we look at it each and every day to make sure that, in fact, it's the right model. Now what we've seen is that in certain geographic areas, we can spend a little bit more time inside of our stores stocking and ensuring the customer experience is at the highest level that it possibly can.","So, what we've done is strategically have taken a group of stores on a test and tested that theory. It tested out very well. And we are in the process as we roll through 2015 to roll that test broadly out to a large group of our stores over 2015. Once again, it's very targeted to certain stores, but it is a large group of our stores.","Matt R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks and congrats.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Investor Relations","Thank you. Operator, we'll move on to the next question, please. It looks we might have time for one more question.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys, thanks for the clean up here. During the conference call, I think it was you, Rick, that mentioned you do anticipate changes in the competitive landscape. And, obviously, Todd, just talked about some of the changes on the labor model. Can you provide some color regarding what kind of changes you're expecting? And is this just on the pending \u2013 any pending changes with Family Dollar now that it is going to be in new hands or are there other elements that you were referencing?","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Fair question, Scot. I think that obviously the number one thing on our radar screen is the change that has taken place between Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Once again, the big box guys are now announcing more initiatives and what we're trying to do is just stay focused on absolutely everything that's out there.","Now, while we can only control what we can control, we have a \u2013 the beauty of our model is it takes a little bit from a lot of different spots rather than having to grab everything from one spot. So, consequently, we stay focused on what absolutely everybody is doing.","And, yeah, I didn't mean to send any unjust or unneeded fear or anything. But, we're staying very focused on what everybody is doing. There's a lot of moving parts out there right now.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, just the general expectation that it's going to be a dynamic competitive environment?","Richard W. Dreiling - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Just the fact that there is a lot of new faces managing new assets, right?","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. And then my follow-up is, I guess, David, you talked a little bit about the EBIT margin opportunity down the road. Can you provide a little bit more color why you are expecting EBIT margins then to be flat to down this year versus what frankly seems to be a bit of an easy comparison following four straight years of kind of 10% plus EBIT margins? Is it some of it that's labor investment or is it just the continued mix shift on impact on the gross margin, et cetera? Thanks.","David M. Tehle - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The biggest piece is clearly the labor investment that we're making in our SG&A line and that really is the bulk of the story there. Again, we expect better performance than we saw in 2013 and 2014 on the gross margins, given some of the product category headwinds we had from tobacco in those years cycling over that.","And then I mentioned we continue to, like what we're seeing in shrink, getting some improvement there and then category management and foreign sourcing helping us. But, it's the investment in labor that we're making.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Investor Relations","All right.

On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO.","We will first go through our prepared remarks and then we will open up the call up for questions. Our earnings release for the quarter can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under investor relation press releases. ","Let me caution that today\u2019s comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, objectives, anticipated financial and operating results and other non-historical matters.

This information is not a substitute for the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.","Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Dreiling","","Thank you Mary Winn and good morning and thank you all for joining us today. We had another record second quarter and we are on track for a great year at Dollar General as we once again raised our earnings outlook for 2012. David will provide more details on our financial results in a moment. ","First, I want to share few highlights from the second quarter. Our total sales increased 10.4% over last year to $3.95 billion. Same store sales grew 5.1%. Both customer traffic and average ticket in our comp stores increased for the 18th consecutive quarter. ","Operating profit excluding secondary operating expenses in the 2012 quarter increased 11% to $388 million or 9.8% of sales up slightly from last year due to 17 basis points of SG&A leverage offset by a 13 basis point decrease in gross margin. ","Interest expense was down $25 million. Our adjusted net income increased 27% to $231 million. And adjusted earnings per share increased 33% to $0.69 which includes a benefit of approximately $0.04 from the cash settlement of an income tax audit. Same store sales in all four major categories, consumables, seasonal, home and apparel were positive in the second quarter with consumables once again leading the way. This was the first time in 12 quarters, that all categories comp positive which we believe in part is attributable to the changes in our apparel merchandising and pricing strategy. ","As we mentioned in our first quarter earnings release, there was some benefit in the first quarter that may have been a pull forward from the second quarter due to the early spring weather. With the quarters behind us, we now believe that that pull forward was about 40 basis points to the first quarter coming out of the second quarter. On a two year stack, we were up a 11% for quarter two which is essentially on part with quarter one two year stack of 12.1% and for the first half of the year, our same store sales were up 5.9%. ","As we discussed at our investor day in June, our core customers are depending on us more than ever and our base is run to include many more faithful customers with higher incomes than we've seen in the past. We continue to be excited about the progress we have made in attracting and retaining these customers as we built our brand across new geographies. For example, back in 2008, 23% of our customers view Dollar General as \"not for me quality or image\". Today that number is only 7%. Our customer centric business model drives our strategy. Knowing our customers helps us serve us better as she looks to stretch her household budget and the most recent syndicated Nielsen data suggests that we are achieving success in this effort. Dollar General continues to yet again make impressive market share gains and consumables with high single digit growth in unit sales and dollar market share on a four week, 12 week, 24 week and 52 week basis. ","I'd like to turn the call over to David to discuss the details of our second quarter performance and our outlook for the rest of the year. I'll talk more about our operating initiatives when he's finished. ","David Tehle","","Thank you Rick and good morning everyone. We're pleased with our second quarter results. Across the board, it was a strong quarter for Dollar General. As Rick said, all four merchandise categories had positive comps. Consumables were strong, Home continued the favorable trends we've seen for the past few quarters, seasonal sales were up as well even with the early weather shift and finally Apparel was positive primarily as the result of very strong performance and accessories and (inaudible) other garments. Our gross profit rate was 32% for the quarter down 13 basis points from last year's second quarter rate. Our mix of sales in the quarter continued to trend more towards consumables which generally have a lower gross profit rate than non-consumables. Our price increases year-over-year were lower and mark-downs were modestly higher. Factors partially offsetting these margin pressures include higher initial markup, leverage on transportation expense in part due to lower fuel costs and the impact of LIFO which resulted in a $0.5 million benefit in the 2012 quarter compared to a $10.7 million provision in the 2011 quarter. ","SG&A excluding secondary operating expenses improved by 17 basis point to 22.2% of sales. Leverage was primarily due to additional labor efficiencies enabled by our workforce management program and engineered labor standards as well as the impact of our strong sales performance. Favorable results and benefits cost and workers compensation and general liability expenses, in addition to various other cost reduction efforts also contributed to the improvement. Cost of increase at our rate higher than our increase in sales include fees associated with the increased use of debit cards and higher advertising costs. ","We're pleased with our ability to effectively balance sales, gross margin and SG&A to drive a 11% increase in operating profit. For the quarter, operating profit excluding secondary operating expenses were $388 million or 9.8% of sales. Interest expense was down $25 million from the prior year to $36 million. We made tremendous strides in reducing our debt over the past few years and further reduced our high interest rate debt in the second quarter. On July 15th, we redeemed the entire $450.7 million outstanding principal amount of our 11 7\/8% senior subordinated notes funding the redemption with proceeds from the issuance of new 4 1\/8% senior note. The redemption resulted in a pre-tax non-operating loss of $29 million.","Our effective income tax rate was 34.1% in the 2012 quarter compared to 36.8% in the 2011 quarter. This year's effective tax rate was lower due to a $14.5 million adjustment or approximately $0.04 per share resulting from the favorable cash settlement of income tax audits partially offset by the exploration of the work opportunity tax credit and the favorable impact of the higher credits in 2011. ","Finally, our second quarter adjusted net income increased 27% to $231 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 33% to $0.69 per share including the $0.04 impact of the tax settlement. The reconciliation of adjusted net income and earnings per share to GAAP can be found in the morning's press release.","Our strong operating performance resulted in cash flow from operating activities of $373 million year-to-date. Capital expenditures through the second quarter were $304 million with a focus on store growth, relocations and remodels. As of August 3, total inventories across were $2.15 up from the prior year by 9% in total and 3% on a per store basis. ","Our inventory growth rate was lower than recent trends primarily due to a shift of receipt into the third quarter. Inventory turns were 5.2 times. Total outstanding debt at the end of the quarter was $2.89 billion. Net of cash, our ratio of long term obligations, adjusted EBITDA was 1.4 times at the end of the 2012 second quarter compared to 1.6 times a year ago. ","Finally before I go over our guidance for the rest of the year, today we announced the new $500 million share repurchase authorization. This authorization is on top of the $500 million authorization approved in December of 2011. That's a total of $1 billion of what is authorized in the a year. We executed $485 million of the original authorization for the purchase of 11.7 million shares so we currently have $515 million authorized for additional purchases. ","We believe share buybacks continue to be the best way for us to return cash to our shareholders and further strengthen our capital structure. For modeling purposes, our guidance does not assume any additional buybacks in the current year. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect our first half performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year. As a remainder, last year was a 53 week year with 14 weeks in the fourth quarter. This year's fourth quarter only includes 13 weeks and as a result, will affect our ability to leverage fixed costs to the same extent as in the prior year. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, we estimate that SG&A excluding expenses resulting from the secondary offering in the prior year will increase approximately 4% over last year's quarter which will result in a notable deleverage of SG&A due to the 53rd week comparison in 2011. Excluding this impact, my expectation is that the underlying fourth quarter SG&A trend would be in line with the prior quarters of 2012. ","We are raising our earnings per share guidance. We currently expected adjusted diluted earnings per share for the 52 week fiscal year to be in the range of $2.77 to $2.85 including the $0.04 benefit from the favorable tax audit settlement in the second quarter. Our previous adjusted earnings per share guidance was $2.68 to $2.78 which did not include the second quarter tax settlement. We are assuming approximately $330 million weighted average diluted shares and a full year effective tax rate in the range of 37 to 38% including the tax settlement. ","We currently expect total sales to increase between 8% and 9% over the 53 week 2011 fiscal year or between 10 and 11% on a comparable 52 week basis. (Inaudible) sales, based on the comparable 52 week period are expected to increase 4 to 5%. We continue to expect gross margin expansion in the second half of the year from modest improvement for the full year. Operating profit excluding this year's secondary operating expenses is now expected to be in the range of $1.64 billion to $1.66 billion compared to previous guidance of $1.62 billion to $1.66 billion. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million, a decrease of $15 million from our previous guidance due to our effective refinancing. ","Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 600 million to $650 million. For the year, we plan to open approximately 625 new stores and to remodel or relocate a total of approximately 575 stores which is an increase from our earlier remodel and relocate plans of 550 stores. ","The new store openings and relocations, we expect to have approximately 110 Dollar General Market stores and a 125 Dollar General plus by the end of the fiscal year. ","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick. ","Rick Dreiling","Thanks David. We had a strong quarter and we have an exciting second half of the year planned to build upon the momentum. We are pleased with the strong to the third quarter including a very solid back to school performance. Through the second quarter, we opened 295 new stores including 21 Dollar general markets and 18 Dollar General plus stores, our new larger format is expanded coolers and water aisles. We also remodeled or relocated 416 stores in the first half of the year including 25 Dollar General markets and 46 stores converted to our Dollar General plus format. These formats could be a test for us and while it is still early in the process, we are evolving the concepts and getting more experience in order to improve sales productivity and profitability. I like the top line results we are seeing and I remain excited about the potential role that these formats have in our store growth opportunities. ","At the end of the second quarter, we had a total of 10,203 stores in 40 states including 90 Dollar General markets and 70 plus stores. Our 27 stores in California at the end of the quarter are off to a great start. Our entry into California so far consists of four traditional stores, 14 Dollar General plus stores and 9 Dollar General markets. These stores are turning in strong sales performance consistent with our projections. We are on track for a total of 50 stores by the end of the year in California. Our new distribution centers, investment in Alabama and Lebec California are ramping up and in June we announced plans to build the 12th distribution center in Pennsylvania to support our store growth in the northeast. We expect this new DC to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2013. ","We're making great progress on implementing phase five, our initiative aimed at optimizing shelf space to reflect demand in the stores based on geography, demographics and actual store experience. We believe this initiative will have a meaningful impact on our square foot productivity over the next two to three years. Year-to-date, we have touched approximately 570 stores or about 6,500 different set to ensure that they have the right planograms that fit their demographic profile. Results have been very favorable in this stores we've impacted. As you know, we've increased our emphasis on the $1 price point over the past year or so. We now have our $1 value in over 8000 stores and the nice thing about these offerings is that they are completely different from what's already in store and sales from this section are incremental to the basket. We will continue to add new merchandise and new categories for this section of our store to keep our customer engaged. ","During this second quarter, we had strong performance in many of our non-consumable departments such as hardware, stationery home d\u00e9cor and domestic. There were several positives in apparel as well including accessories and everyday basic apparel such as men's work wear and lady sleep wear and undergarments. While ladies hanging apparel was disappointing, we do see some bright spots and we are optimistic that our fresh approach to apparel merchandising and pricing will gain further traction in the second half of the year. ","We continue to make progress and improving our in stock levels. Out of stock for the second quarter were down 25% from a year ago and 45% from 2009. This improvement is contributing to positive results in our customer service scores as we believe that our focus in this area can continue to drive additional sales growth. ","We are also moving forward with the implementation of our new supply chain system which we expect to complete over a multi-year time frame with a goal of reducing cost and increasing efficiency. As we are in the process of installing the new modules of our supply chain solution, we are running both the new and legacy systems in parallel to help prevent inventory disruptions or service level disruptions. This investment in our supply chain will enhance our ability to ensure that we have the right product at the right time in the right quantity and at the right cost to meet our customers' need.","So to wrap it up, we're very pleased with our second quarter and the first half of 2012 and we believe that we are well positioned for the second half of the year. at Dollar General, we remain focused on controlling what we can control and delivering strong financial results for our shareholders. I am confident that we have significant opportunities for sustainable growth at the heart of which is our commitment through convenient and our everyday low price strategy which continues to resonate strongly with our customers. ","Before I close, I would like to give my sincere thanks to over 90,000 Dollar General employees who are responsible for serving our customers and delivered yet another great quarter. So with that Mary Winn, I will turn it over to you for questions.","Mary Winn Gordon","Okay, Lindsay we can go ahead and get started with the questions please. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","","Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. (Operator Instructions). our first question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. ","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","","I wanted to start with pricing. So, how stable do you think the environment is right now? And then as you look out to '13 and inflation coming, how do you think that's going to play out? Do you think that will be a rerun of 1Q'11 in terms of how quickly it gets passed through?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, let`s address pricing first. I think as I look at the price jacks in the ad activity, I think pricing is relatively stable much like the second quarter. I do think John you're seeing people value proposition more in print and more in radio and more on television. So I think while pricing is relatively stable, people are really touting their message much harder in the various types of media that are out there to do that. In regards to inflation, I would look at you and say, I anticipate we'll probably be very much the same thing you say in the first quarter. If that happened, but at Dollar General, once again we're committed to unit growth. And we're going to do everything we can to protect unit growth which ultimately is share growth. ","","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","","Because you know, if you look back to 1Q11, you guys made a conscious effort to delay, postpone some of those price increases which served you well in the long-term. So I assumed that would be the MO again and I don't think we're going to see as much inflation as we did in '11 but that would be the approach you would take, correct?","","Rick Dreiling","","Yes, we believe the story at Dollar General, John, is unit and we have merchandising organization that's committed to that as I am. And we believe we drive units, everything else will take care of itself eventually. ","","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","","If someone accuses you of saying to advertise market, their price differential as opposed to lowering price, so how do you combat that? For a lot of guys, I guess it wouldn\u2019t make sense to lower price. I guess you'd fight fire with fire and do your own marketing but how do you attack that versus actual price cuts by somebody?","","Rick Dreiling","","Yes, I could take a basket of items and give you a great comparison against anybody any day. What I will tell you is, we do a very good job of tracking where the big box operators are. We're very, very comfortable where we are. So it's kind of one of the things you can say what you want to say. We're very comfortable where we are and I'm very pleased that we continue to maintain a very large GAAP with drug and grocery. ","","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","","All right and then finally, just thinking about California. So where is Lebec now in terms of how many stores are coming out of the facility and generally speaking, as you build these new facilities and supply chain economics improve over time, do you think those pricing generally come down in those new areas over time as your economics improve or was it more your pricing is where you want it to be when your margins get better?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, couple of questions there. First of all, approximately 120 stores are coming out of Lebec right now. Remember we'll have 50 stores in California at the end of the year. we're servicing New Mexico, Phoenix and Arizona out of there. In regards to pricing, obviously the advantage on the margin comes from reduced distribution and transportation costs and that obviously puts us in a position to be more competitive if need be or translate into higher margin improvement. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt boss with JPMorgan.","Matt boss - JPMorgan","","So your gross margin forecast assumes modest improvement for the year which implies improvement in the second half. How should we think about some of the embedded components such as LIFO, mix, markdowns, any color there would be great.","","Rick Dreiling","Yes, I think as we look at the back half of the year, we definitely see a positive win back from LIFO. If you remember last year in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we had fairly sizable LIFO hits in the third quarter at around $11 million and in the first quarter, it was $22 million and right now, for the full year, our best guestimate on LIFO for the full year is it will be around $2 million. We also see some potential favorability out of our transportation and distribution and stem mile reductions and some efficiencies in cartons per load. Although we do watch diesel prices pretty carefully, diesel has been increasing over the last six to eight weeks and it's actually above where it was a year ago at this time. We'll see what happens now that Labor Day is behind us. And then on the DC side, we do see some efficiencies coming out of those new DCs as we get over the learning curve for those two DC. So that's really how it plays out. ","Matt boss - JPMorgan","Okay, great. And your topline performance, more on the discretionary side was really encouraging. Can you speak to some of the in store initiatives under way to keep this momentum going and also was this performance maintained in August as well on the discretionary side of that?","Rick Dreiling","Yes Matt, I have to tell you, I think the merchant over the last year have done a wonderful job of improving the quality of the product and maintaining the retail price and the cost for that matter. And I think what's happening is that people are recognizing that we are offering up values now that are pretty consistent on a day in and day out basis. I will tell you how it's translating into August. I mean our back to school was at high single digits and we're very pleased with what we're seeing and the interesting thing as you recall and as I talked to you about back to school last year, I talked about it being more needs based. People were buying pencils and papers and notebooks. This year, they are breaking down and buying the backpack and they are buying the things that kids hang on the backpack. And again, I attribute that to, I think we've done a much better job on being more relevant. ","Operator","","Next question comes from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","","I thought, on the phase five that you're working on, the targeted assortment of the source, is really very interesting. Can you talk a little bit about and how you're going about it and what you're observing as you roll it, as you test it in some places, what are the learning's from it. ","","Rick Dreiling","","The obvious thing is, what we're doing is, we're looking at categories that should be good, that are less productive in some stores. And naturally what led us to the fact and it's not a very good example, but I like to use it all the time is, the diapers versus the incontinence product. We're doing well in diapers. So the question is why are these 1,500 stores aren't don't which leads you to go to those stores, take a look at that stores and go, oh my god, they are built in an area where the customer base is a little more mature. And that is the process that the merchants are applying across the organization. Why does beer do better here than wine. And that's the process that's taking place. Some of its driven obviously by demographics. Some of its driven by the economic environment that the store's in. I don't know if that's helpful or not Meredith. ","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","","Well you had mentioned like 570 stores but a much larger number of set. Is that the 6,500 set I think you mentioned, that means for specific parts of the store?","","Rick Dreiling","","That's correct. I mean eventually you'll touch every store in the chain, but in some stores you might touch two or three sets, in some stores you might touch nine or ten. And that's why we are trying to equate this, not to just doing the stores, we're trying to equate to the number of categories that we'll touch long term. And Meredith, that's why we're so bullish like phase one, two, three, four that this has runway because it's going to get take us time to get through it. ","","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","","And are there downsides to this? I don't know whether it changes you're buying or makes it more complicated for the distribution centers or is that, those costs just not meaningful?","Rick Dreiling","Now that's a very good question and when we talk about doing this, we're not talking about adding a bunch of incremental SKUs. What we're talking about is adjusting the phasings that guarantee an in stock position. So this is an invisible transition to the distribution center. ","","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","","And just my final question would be about the plus stores you see sort of have enough of them to have a judgment. What sells differently? What works differently in the plus stores and a regular store?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, I would tell your number one, the perishable side of the business is much better because of the incremental cooler space, but I think what we're seeing at this stage of the game is the wider aisle is increasing the shopability in the store and the additional square footage is helping us with the in-stock. So you're seeing a nice lift basically overall and I can\u2019t safe enough the incremental footage gives us more seasonal presence which helps us with the margin in the store.","Mary Winn Gordon","","Lincy can we take the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Bernstein","Two quick ones for you, just looking at the non-consumables categories, the home category especially any apparel categories, you know the growth there was solid but a little bit deceleration from the first quarter. Was that the pull forward effect and then how do you get positive comps in apparel when total category growth is 4.2% relative to square foot growth around 7 and store growth of 5.8%, it's just that new stores don\u2019t do much apparel business.","Mary Winn Gordon","Yes that\u2019s a really good question and you hit the number right on the head of back off. It takes a while for that presence to ramp up and people get comfortable with the quality of the products you have got. When I look at the non-consumables and particularly apparel you know accessories, I think that merchants have done a great job of lining us with Foster Grant, how Foster Grant, Sun Glasses and readers which is by the name recognition again, great for the trade down customer because we have got a great price on those and they relate to that quality. We saw improvement in men particularly in work wear. We had a great quarter in underwear, when I look at ladies undergarments we did very well there and even to be Frank, while we had some drag in women\u2019s hanging apparel there still was improvement there the drag wasn\u2019t as bad as it has been and as I look at, I don\u2019t want to forget about kids excuse me, the work that we have done on positioning kids and creating a center, what we are trying to do very hard Colin on the non-consumable side is what we have done on the consumable side.","We are trying to lift all the boats and we start to see that more even lift and while I am no way trying to imply that we have crossed the finish line but I feel for once we can see it from here.","Colin McGranahan - Bernstein","Okay that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, and then just second question. New store productivity is as we calculated it came in about 75% which is a little lower than where it's been and what thought about it might be higher given the impact of DG Plus and DG Markets in a mix, is there anything going on in that number?","Rick Dreiling","Yes that\u2019s another excellent question, to be honest with you, we got behind on the number of new stores, we opened in the quarter and we didn\u2019t get as many store weeks as we have historically seen in the quarter.","Colin McGranahan - Bernstein","Yes opened a little late in the quarter.","Rick Dreiling","Exactly rather than a store getting 7 or 8 weeks in the quarter, it got 2 or 3.","Mary Winn Gordon","All right Lincy we will take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","First question is, can you size the incremental expense impact from running the dual supply chain system as well as the incremental cost associated with the move, or really the growth in California, more expense to market to obviously kind of make headway in.","Rick Dreiling","Yes and regards to the running the two platforms simultaneously, I would look at you and say very little incremental cost. I mean I would say it's negligible. We are doing that mainly as a safety valve Scot, what you don\u2019t want to do is commit to a new program until you are a 100% convinced that\u2019s going to be fully functional. While we are making a lot of great progress there we are been very cautious because what we don\u2019t want a supply chain disruption and regards to California you know obviously it's going to be a little more expensive to operate. However, we are going in there with much higher volumes than we historically see in traditional markets. So in terms of the overall profitability of those, long term we think we are going to be just as solid in California as Alabama, Mississippi or Georgia.","David Tehle","","Well that was the reason of course for opening the distribution center in Lubbock was to cut down the stem miles so we didn\u2019t have to make those shipments out of our Ardmore facility in Oklahoma.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","Got it and that\u2019s helpful and then you talked about with the reset, some stores down the road might have two or three touch, some will have nine or 10. How many store sets are there and how many sets are there in a storage so we know that what kind of what percentage.","David Tehle","Yes you know off the top of my head if I was guessing, anywhere from maybe 310 to 343 somewhere in there depending on the size of the store.","Mary Winn Gordon","All right, Lincy we will move on to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","The follow-up on your comments about pricing and the growing divergence between your everyday low pricing and everyday value pricing that some of your competitors are using. Are you finding that your customers will actually cherry pick between the two formats and perhaps go to one store and they have a hotter price on carbonated beverage for that weekend and shop dollar general for the other items?","David Tehle","Yes we have there is no doubt and I think every competitor will tell you have a subset of your customer that will always cherry pick right and we have that in our space as well the interesting stat for us and is that we tend to trade more customers with the dollar, the pure dollar segment than we do with people that would be more traditional for us and hence that we put the focus on the value valley over the last year and half. I know I would also like to throw out you too you know when you think about this you know I was actually talking to someone about this the other day, Dan there is a lot of white space out there, this really isn\u2019t about that the deep small box discount channel which is just 5% of all of consumable retailing out there. We are trading customers across an over $800 billion world out there and that\u2019s the exciting thing that we have discovered at Dollar General over the last 4.5 years is we can effectively compete not only with our light competitors but with drug and grocery and mass as well.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","That was my follow-up question when you look at the market share capture between drug and supermarket which one is proving to be the most vulnerable to Dollar General.","David Tehle","Our share gains are coming from drugs first, grocery second and mass third.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","Okay and then just a final, real quick question on page five, are you able to implement that in all of your new stores or do you need to have some operating history for new store before you have the data to start customizing inventory for that location.","David Tehle","Yes that\u2019s another outstanding question, we have enough in all age, when we go into a market area, the store kit is set properly when we go in.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","So all these stores have Phase IV.","David Tehle","That\u2019s correct.","Mary Winn Gordon","Lincy we will move to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi","","So in terms of a the apparel if I go the last quarter you talked about been much more promotional in terms of the approached to pricing, how key do you think that was in the success in the quarter.","David Tehle","I think quite frankly it was very successful, I think Deb I told everybody we arrived at the conclusion that the consumers is more used to seeing apparel promoted rather than everyday low price they are used to seeing it 20% off or 50% or buy one get one free and we really believe that we are moving in the right direction with that and what we will see more in the back half of the year.","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi","And I thought there was something really interesting, you gave your prepared remarks where you talked about I think it was back in LA that there are 23% of your people said that it was not for me and its quality in the percent goes down to 7% or 8%, can you talk about how does that change where you put your stores in terms of locations and how that changes you know your product. I mean how does that just change to potential future success of Dollar General.","Rick Dreiling","I think quite frankly Deb it opens up the potential for Dollar General in a lot of markets or even trade areas that we would probably been afraid to go into the past. I mean there has been a radical change in the mix of products inside our stores over the last 4.5 years. I had to say we signed Foster Grant. I mean think about Foster Grant, that\u2019s a name you all know and we have a fabulous retail on it. I mean very excited, we designed a dryers, ice-cream contract where we will dryers or Eddy's ice cream. Yes, you know through Nestle and those that brand recognition is making us relevant and it puts us in a position where we can demand maybe a little higher initials opening store sales when we build a new store which gives us the ability to go into a little more upscale market than we have dealt within the past.","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi","Okay and then final one in terms of looking at the SG&A improvement in the quarter, how do we think about what inning we are in with regards workforce management and is how much more opportunity is there going forward?","Rick Dreiling","I think if you look at the quarter Deb, we definitely had favorable from workforce management that came forward in retail salaries and I think we probably have a couple more quarters in terms of favorability, they are obviously it's been going on for a while now and at some point it will start to diminish. We also had favorability in the quarter from our lower benefit cost as well as lower workers compensation cost. If we look at our mining targets over this year and next year, I mean there are a lot of things on our agenda in addition workforce management which has been a tremendous opportunity for us. We have opportunities other ways in labor to reduce cost. We have damages that we are looking at, supplies, rent, maintenance in the stores and then all kinds of things going on in transportation and efficient SKU movement. So again I want to stress how important our mining per cost reduction effort is at Dollar General and it's definitely has a lot of legs yet in terms of the future.","Mary Winn Gordon","Great Lincy we will move on to the next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Charles Grom - Deutsche Bank","I will point to you a thing that discretionary could begin help you guys on the margin front and with regards to your second half gross profit margin outlook for a mass improvement, if (inaudible) over the years is going to be 2 million and that alone is going to give you about 30 to 40 bips in the second quarter per quarter, I am just wondering what are the head wins you guys are going to face because that guidance for a modest improvement looks pretty conservative.","Rick Dreiling","","Yes I will take the first half, because the back half is a little harder, I will leave that for Tehle. In terms of I think that I am short getting very bullish on the non-consumable side, however it's too early yet and I think it will play out as we move through the second half. I think our strategy you know in terms of how we are pricing the product, we have done a much better job of buying the product and there is a little more margin there. So as I looked down the road I think as we moved through the back half of the year we are going to see some improvement.","David Tehle ","Yes I think as we look at the pieces of the margin, definitely you know there is some mix issues continuing to go on, we watched that very carefully particularly to get into the fourth quarter as we get into the holiday season that\u2019s a little called in terms of what the holiday is going to look like. We also believe we are going to have marks up than we had last year. You know some of that is an offset from LIFO obviously, the best something that we track carefully and then we are watching the diesel cost I mentioned earlier in terms of the impact they will have on transportation cost and right now diesel cost are above where they were last year. So you know we put it all together and that\u2019s where we came out on it Chuck.","Charles Grom - Deutsche Bank","Okay and then you know just a follow-up on Matt\u2019s question early, was the high single digit strength in just to back to school categories.","Rick Dreiling","","We are pleased with what are we are seeing in non-consumables.","Charles Grom - Deutsche Bank","Okay so just across but it's not a (inaudible) side.","Rick Dreiling","Yes that\u2019s exactly right, I wasn\u2019t trying to send a message but that was the comp where we are at, I was just talking about the back to school.","Charles Grom - Deutsche Bank","Okay good and the other three formats you rolled down in California which are the three formats are you most happy with so far?","Rick Dreiling","That\u2019s another really good question, I am a big proponent of the Dollar General, the traditional store. I think it's our bread and butter, it will always be our bread and butter and those stores are performing exceptionally well. I am very happy with what we are seeing in the Dollar General. We have entered the stock end market with three stores and with our Dollar General market Chuck and we are very pleased with what we are seeing there and the Dollar General plus, again the higher volume stores particularly in California with the density, we think it's going to be a good play too but again I want to reinforce, it's all about the Dollar General traditional store and that\u2019s our bread and butter.","Mary Winn Gordon ","Lincy, we will take the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis - Buckingham Research","","Two quick questions, one on the SG&A growth in the quarter, it was a little bit lower on a percentage basis year-over-year than 1Q and you didn\u2019t call out expenses related to the new distribution centers. So can you just talk about whether or to what extent those are adding incremental expenses and my second question is on transfer payments. I believe the latest data shows that the snap benefit payments have kind of flattened out relative to couple of years ago and certainly unemployment payments are down dramatically. Does that impact your business and your customer? Thanks ","Rick Dreiling","","Yes on the first part of the question, the we definitely had as the DCs came up that didn\u2019t hit SG&A anymore in the second quarter but again when we prioritize the items and give what the biggest hitters were, the workers comp, the benefits and the retail salaries workforce management were larger than the impact of the DC, so that\u2019s why it specifically didn\u2019t get called out. On the San piece I will say a little bit and I will let Rick comment too, it stays pretty steady at 5% of our business and it's been that way for a while.","David Tehle ","Yes that\u2019s just basically, our customer tends to go somewhere else first and use us as a fill in.","Mary Winn Gordon ","Lincy we will go on to the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Parkhill with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley","A lot of my questions have been asked but I figured I would ask all about inventories, I think you mentioned something about some timing issues but if I look at a category perspective it looks like the biggest change in categories is home is up about 16%, so I was wondering if that\u2019s just a timing difference or anything to do with some newer merchandize initiatives that you have.","Rick Dreiling ","I mean our home business continues to do well as we mentioned, the timing difference we were talking about was we had, it was mainly payroll that we thought we were going to get in the quarter that didn\u2019t come in the quarter and it was third quarter and that made that per store amount a little bit lower than we had been running traditionally. Again we are pretty happy with our turns that we have 5.2 turn versus a 5.1 that we had a year ago on the inventories, so we continued to be pleased and as always we try to balance our inventory turns we are in stock again the customer experience what we are trying to do for the customer in the stores.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley","Okay and then just quickly, I mean wondering if you have any contingency plans in case there is a strike on the East-Coast port and if that were to happen how should we think about how that would impact your overall business.","David Tehle ","Yes what we will do is we have a consolidation center on the East-Coast as well as the West and what we will do is move that product there and then ship it into the stores. So we feel pretty good that we got it covered.","Mary Winn Gordon","","Lincy will we have the next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from David Mann with Johnson Rice.","David Mann - Johnson Rice","Going back to hanging apparel, given the struggle you have been there. Can you talk about in the back half and into \u201913 some tactics that you might use to try and jump start that or should we continue to expect that to struggle.","Rick Dreiling","","Like we are, like I said while we had some drag on hanging apparel in the second quarter. It was not as bad as we have seen the previous couple three quarters and we think two things are going to happen, number one our pricing strategy which we have seen some positive movement on across the apparel in general and now what\u2019s happening is the fall and winter product is starting to finally come in and that\u2019s our Lucinda Long, our Vice President, that\u2019s our first real buy and I have to tell you we showed the Board the product at our Board meeting last week and they were encouraged in the quality of the product we are going to have out there.","So it's soon, it's very soon David, but I do think we are making, we are taking the right steps.","David Mann - Johnson Rice","Great and then an earlier comment I think David you made about mark-up perhaps been a little bit more modest in the second half, can you just clarify why that might be and they will soon update on what you are achieving on global sourcing. Thank you.","Rick Dreiling ","On the mark-up comment a lot of that has to do with the LIFO and again I threw out some fairly large numbers last year that we took on LIFO in the third and fourth quarter and that had to do with cost increases that we were taking from vendors and as we have mentioned we selectively did have to take some prices up because of the cost increases that we got, so that really is why we had the mark-ups and the mark-up comment and with LIFO being lower obviously we don\u2019t have as many of those mark-ups. On the foreign sourcing right now on a year-to-date basis, foreign sourcing is about 9.7% versus 8.5% last year. We have added new items in stationary back to school, home, domestics and toys. We now have a very small satellite offices and by satellite office I mean computer or phone and one or two people, so it's minimal capital investment but still doing us a lot of good. Satellite offices in Vietnam, Istanbul, Monterrey, Mexico and West Central, China.","We did in terms of the, if you look at the quarter the receipts were a little bit higher on foreign sourcing about a 11.4% versus 8.4% last year. We did have some early receipts in toys and stationary and again I think the year-to-date number is more representative of where we see the foreign sourcing. So again a lot of effort going on there and seeing impact in the current year because of it.","Mary Winn Gordon ","","All right Lincy, we will take the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Montagna with Avondale Partners.","Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners","Can you give us an update as to what percentage of consumable sales are now private brand?","Rick Dreiling ","You know our penetration hit an all-time high, its 24.3 or 24.2?","David Tehle "," Yes.","Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners","","Okay and then what about the dollar items, where is that penetration now?","David Tehle","","About 26%.","Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners","Okay and then higher mark-downs you had, was that all related to Apparel or were there higher mark-downs elsewhere.","Rick Dreiling ","Some of that was in the consumable area, also some consumables and then the apparel too.","Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners","But what drove the higher mark-downs in the consumables area.","Rick Dreiling","It's a little more promotional in terms of what we are doing.","Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners","Okay and then are those promotions shared with vendors through some co-op advertising or is that.","Rick Dreiling ","Well if you look at we always try to partner with our vendors appropriately on these types of things and sometimes we are success with that and sometimes we are not.","David Tehle ","And Mark this falls back to our commitment to unit growth right, we are going to keep the units moving and we really believe that that\u2019s foundation of our success last year and going into this year.","Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners","And then coming back to some of the questions where you had mentioned that drug and grocery customers that\u2019s where you have seen a lot of market share gains, are you seeing anything specific were drugs for customers come in more looking for HBA and the grocery customers are more looking for the food items.","Rick Dreiling","You know here is what I would say, it's a really good question as I sit here and reflect on it what I would say is we were underpenetrated in HBA and we made a conscious decision a year ago to go in and expand those categories. So I can\u2019t specifically say to you yes I am getting that from the drug customer or my consumable that\u2019s coming from the grocery channel. But I think if you look at the power of what we have done with Rexall particularly on the HBA side, that brand recognition. I think we have just elevated the quality of the product at a great price and it's coming a little bit from everywhere Mark if that makes any sense.","Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners","Sure and just lastly, accessories within apparel did well, is that a new initiative that you expanded the assortment in that little category.","Rick Dreiling ","Yes we have expanded the assortment and I also don\u2019t want to sell short this commitment what we have with Foster Grant now. Again that\u2019s what we don\u2019t give then we brought tied in that\u2019s a big deal.","Mary Winn Gordon","","Lincy let\u2019s take the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aram Rubinson with Nomura Securities.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities","Can you tell us a little bit about the composition of the comp specifically about how much ticket was up roughly?","Rick Dreiling","","You know we don\u2019t break that out separately, they both contributed to the comp and transaction was higher than ticket but really they were both favorable and we are happy to see that.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities","Okay and so maybe let me kind of try and just ask it more holistically, it seems that you have cited a lot of initiatives to drive your average ticket. You didn\u2019t quantify a lot of them at your analyst date but there is still not a lot of movement I guess generically in the channel and in your business as well. Can you weigh in on how fixed you think the average ticket is in your channel overtime and even if you looked out five years, are we still in the $10 range or what do you think that involves too.","Rick Dreiling","","Yes I think we can never lose focus of the site that we are the fill in shop or a bigger shop that takes some place else. And you know as I think about it. The importance of driving traffic I think is the number one thing for us right. Our customer goes and spends their money somewhere than they only have so much left and I think they will continue to spend more with us when there is less economic pressure on them. So as I think about the basket I think we will see modest growth through the years but we are committed to driving footsteps which we think ultimately will be the win for us and David do you have anything to add on that?","David Tehle","Yes the only thing I would add is that we do use the non-consumable driving basket as we said before and we are pretty happy with some of the new trends we are seeing in non-consumables.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities","So you think five years from now, we are still on a $10 range?","Rick Dreiling","","I don\u2019t want to answer that one, I wish, I hope it's bigger than that but we will have to wait and see I think you are dealing with a channel that\u2019s becoming more relevant and I think the one that we are demonstrating is we are broadening the appeal to a much different client base we have had in the past. Now I certainly could take you somewhere you could see some growth.","Mary Winn Gordon ","","Lincy we can cover another question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with BB&T Capital Markets.","Anthony Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets","Just had a quick question on California. I know it's early but it seems like you had a lot more the DG market, the DG Plus, your traditional stores then you also have more traditional stores and things like you know really kind of the ones that are performing the best. I mean how do you think about five years down the line, what is the break out of stores between the three formats in California.","Rick Dreiling ","I think Anthony as you look at it, it has to do right now with the availability of real estate when we rolled into that market and it was slated more toward a bigger footprint and we made a conscious decision since we had that bigger footprint to put in DG Plus and the DG markets, long term in California like the rest of the chain our commitment to the Dollar General, the traditional store and we do believe like other areas of the countries there will be opportunities surgically to drop a plus store or a Dollar General market. But long term our commitment in California is to the DG traditional store.","Mary Winn Gordon ","","Then Lincy, there is time for another question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Denise Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Denise Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","You seem to be increasing the number of DG Plus stores that you are going to be opening this year. So if you could just comment a bit on the early performance that you are seeing on these plus stores in terms of maybe sales per square foot, basket size, basket components on this kind of thing compared to traditional DG or a DG market that will be really helpful.","Rick Dreiling","Yes on regards to the number of them opening, we said about almost a year ago we would have a 100 open by the end of year and I believe we got approximately 70 open now. In fact I actually might have said 100 to 125 somewhere in there. Right now it's a little soon for me to be talking about you know basket size and all of that but I will tell you Denise the preliminary indications are, we feel good. It's a bigger box it's going to require a little more effort in regards to mix, the cost of the facility and we are working on all those issues now and what I have said is after we get them open and then we have a little run-way with them and then we will give you some updates on where we are at.","Unidentified Analyst ","And just one thing I want to clarify on August Back to School, do you say that you comp up by high single digits?","Rick Dreiling ","That is correct and I was just talking about Back to School I am not talking about the entire quarter, just Back to School, we are really pleased with what we are seeing.","Mary Winn Gordon ","Lincy I see two more people in the queue so let\u2019s try to get through both of those and then we will get off given time constraint.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners","Question on e-commerce, I think you have had your e-commerce business before up and running for about a year now. What does the I mean I guess maybe if you can just give us some broad idea as to how big a business it is, what does the mix of sales look like, are you doing, are you selling more individual items or you are selling a fair amount of bulk merchandize and then I guess is this an incremental customer to you?","Rick Dreiling ","Yes I think I kind of started the back rather than the front, what\u2019s been best thing about the e-commerce site it's a customer that\u2019s coming from states, we are not even in which we find fascinating and I think what\u2019s going on here is Patrick that people are trying us out through the e-commerce site. What it has done by the way we are selling more unit items and bulk items, it's used more towards our electronic promotions, more towards HBA those sorts of things and I think what it has done is its forced us to do a much better job of upgrading the site.","We now a store locator program on there that I think it's very robust and again maybe even items like baby diapers, bulk items right, it's in terms of the amount of business it's going to do long term for us. I don\u2019t want you to think it's going to be a $200 million business because it's never going to be that but it's an opportunity for us to expose ourselves, continue to refine it and hopefully use it as a communication vehicle to the customer.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners","And just a quick one on the Back to School merchandize or Back to School categories, I mean what percent of your business let\u2019s say in August would you consider to be Back to School related?","Rick Dreiling","","Patrick I don\u2019t have that kind of granular information in front of me other than to say that we were very pleased with it, very pleased.","Mary Winn Gordon ","","Lincy I think we have got time for the last person in the queue please.","Operator","Our final question will come from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.","Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group","The one thing just more forward thinking that I did wanted to ask you about was, have you guys given any thought to what the impact of the different outcomes of the presidential election might mean on your customer. If the Republican win versus the Democrats and how that might impact social funding and I know you said Snap still only 5% but what does that do to your core customer, you know just in general if anything at all.","","Rick Dreiling ","Yes I think as I reflect on it here. When I think about our core customer, I think no matter who wins the Presidential election in the course of the next 60 days. I think there is going to be continued pressure on that customer for a very long period of time, whether it be you know these programs are going to come, what programs come, how much they are. I think at the end of the day, regardless of who is President people still need jobs and we all know that the pressure on the economy is going to keep that front center for everybody for a long period of time.","So what I will tell you Joe is, we started this journey as a team here by focusing on what we can control and while I can\u2019t control the political environment I certainly can control what we sell, how much we sell it for and when we sell it for and that\u2019s why we will stay focused and hopefully that will pay the same fruits 4.5 years from now like it's last.","David Tehle ","One final comment Rick that I want to make it was pointed out in my opening comments so I might have said the wrong number on the weighted average diluted shares and the right numbers in the press release, our revised guidance is based on approximately 337 million weighted average diluted shares, just to avoid any confusion there.","Mary Winn Gordon ","With that concludes our call, I am around all day and if anybody has any questions please don\u2019t hesitate to call me and thank you for your interest in Dollar General.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s teleconference call.

My name is Hope and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, August 25, 2016. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the Company's earnings press release issued this morning.","Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference.","Mary Winn Pilkington ","Thank you, Hope, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and John Garratt, our CFO. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases.","Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, and other non-historical matters, including but not limited to, our fiscal 2016 diluted EPS guidance, fiscal 2016 and 2017 store growth initiatives, capital allocation strategy and related expectations, our long-term financial growth models and future economic trends or conditions.","Forward-looking statements can be identified because they are not statements of historical facts, and use words such as outlook, may, believe, anticipate, expect, looking ahead, estimate, forecast, goal or intent and similar expressions that concern our strategy, plans, intentions or beliefs about future matters.","Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those projected by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2015 10-K filed on March 22, 2016, and our most recent 10-Q filed today and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents.","You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call except as maybe otherwise required by law or as described under the heading Financial Outlook set forth in our earnings press release issued today.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Vasos ","Thank you, Mary Winn, and welcome to everyone joining our call. For the second quarter, we are pleased with our double-digit earnings per share growth even as our same-store sales performance fell short of our expectations.","I am particularly proud of the team\u2019s ability to effectively manage our gross profit margin and leveraging our selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of sales in what proved to be a difficult sales environment.","Key factors that negatively impacted our expected same-store sales performance included, a greater than anticipated headwind from price deflation across key perishable items with retail prices down about 8% for milk and over 50% for eggs, our two largest products within perishables.","Second a reduction in both SNAP participation rates and benefit levels, third an unseasonably mild spring and lastly an intensified promotional environment in select regions of the country.","We estimate that the headwinds from price deflation and the reduction in SNAP benefits negatively impacted our same-store sales for the second quarter by approximately 60 to 70 basis points.","As I will discuss in more detail later in the call, we are taking aggressive action across merchandizing and store operations to address these factors and help drive same-store sales. And we will continue to be very disciplined in our SG&A spending.","I am pleased with our overall financial performance and the team\u2019s ongoing focus on our long-term strategy despite the challenging retail environment. Highlights of the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter include, net sales increased 5.8% to $5.4 billion and same-store sales grew at 0.7%.","Same-store sales growth was positive for consumables, offset by decline in non-consumable category. Gross margin was 31.2%, an increase of two basis points. We leveraged selling, general and administrative expenses by eight basis points as our zero-based budget initiatives continue to contribute to our results.","Operating profit increased 7% with operating profit margin expansion of ten basis points. Net income in the second quarter increased 9% to $307 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.08; year-to-date through the second quarter diluted earnings per share was 18%.","Cash from operations increased 36% year-to-date through the second quarter. During the quarter we returned over $294 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.5 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend.","We continued to grow market share as reported in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced relatively consistent low single-digit to mid single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4, 12, 24 and 52 week periods.","Now I will turn the call over to John to go through more details of the quarter.","John Garratt ","Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our second quarter, I\u2019ll share more details on the rest of the quarterly financial results starting with gross profit.","Gross profit for the 2016 second quarter was $1.7 billion or 31.2% of sales, an increase of two basis points from last year\u2019s second quarter as compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter, higher initial mark-ups on inventory purchases and lower transportation costs contributed to the gross profit rate increase offset by higher mark-downs, a greater proportion of sales growth in consumables which carries a lower margin in the non-consumables and higher inventory shrink.","SG&A expense decreased by eight basis points over the 2015 quarter to $1.2 billion or 21.7% of sales in the second quarter. The majority of the SG&A percentage decrease was due to reductions in administrative payroll cost, advertising cost and incentive compensation expenses. Partially offsetting these items were our retail, labor and occupancy cost, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales.","Similar to last quarter, our zero-based budgeting initiatives were a key driver of our SG&A performance. The team continues to actively work on a pipeline of additional future savings opportunities across the company leveraging process improvement, procurement, and prioritization to remove cost that don\u2019t affect the customer experience.","Moving down the income statement, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.8% as compared to 38% from the second quarter last year. As in the first quarter, our effective tax rate was lower this quarter as compared to the 2015 quarter, primarily due to the recognition of the work opportunity tax credit in the quarter in which it is earned given changes by Congress in December 2015.","Looking at a few items on our balance sheet and cash flow statement, merchandize inventories at second quarter end were $3.27 billion. For the quarter, total inventory was up 8% and 1.6% on a per store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape and we are comfortable with the quality.","Our longer-term goal continues to be inventory growth in line with our sales growth. Year-to-date for the second quarter, we generated cash from operations of $793 million, an increase of 36% or $208 million, compared to the 2015 second quarter as a result of both higher net income and working capital improvements.","During the quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of our common stock for $224 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding totaling $71 million. Year-to-date to the end of the second quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $597 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividends.","From December 2011 to the second quarter of 2016, we\u2019ve repurchased $4 billion or 67.3 million shares of our common stock. With today\u2019s announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization of $1 billion we currently have a remaining authorization of approximately $1.4 billion under the repurchase program.","We are pleased to note that during the second quarter, Moody\u2019s upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to BAA2. In mid-August, we implemented a commercial paper program with the goal to reduce our short-term borrowing rate as commercial paper rates are typically lower than rates under a revolver facility.","We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases.","Underlying [audio gap] our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately three times adjusted debt-to-EBITDA.","Looking ahead, items to keep in mind that will impact our results during the second half of the year includes, the purchase of 42 former Walmart Express locations, the implementation of the Department of Labor changes to the overtime exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the calendar shift between the third and fourth quarters of this year.","As we look to relocate 40 Dollar General locations into these purchase sites, we anticipate taking a charge in the 2016 third quarter of approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share primarily related to closed store lease obligations.","For the FLSA implementation, we continue to prepare for the changes which are effective December 1 of this year by gaining experience with various tests and learn scenarios.","We anticipate the incremental expense will be about $0.03 to $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of this year. Please keep in mind, this is a higher run rate in fiscal 2016 than we would expect next year due to the 53rd week in the fourth quarter of this year and because certain initiatives intended to offset the incremental impact will not be in place until next year.","Due to the calendar shifts year-over-year between the third and fourth quarter, our third quarter 2016 will be negatively impacted by the shift of two selling days prior to Halloween along with the timing of a key pay day into the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to being included in the third quarter of last year.","Turning to our outlook, recall that we stated that we intend to update our diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2016 only if we no longer reasonably expect diluted EPS to fall within the 10% to 15% range outlined in the model included in our press release issued on March 10, 2016.","We continue to forecast diluted EPS for fiscal 2016 within this range of 10% to 15%. Please keep in mind that the investments we are making across merchandizing and store operations will take time to gain traction with our consumers. We remain committed to focusing on long-term profitable growth reinvesting in our business in capturing cost savings through our zero-based budgeting program.","We are investing in initiatives intends to drive same-store sales and build loyalty across our consumer base with prices that they trust from us.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd.","Todd Vasos ","Thank you, John. We have a track record of strong financial results as the team is taking steps designed to improve our sales performance, but it will take time to our initiatives to resonate with our consumer.","As we have said consistently, we are committed to increasing market share by growing both item units and traffic and we will invest as we deem appropriate to meet this objective.","To that end, we are making aggressive pricing, labor and marketing investments in designated market areas that we see as opportunities to be proactive as we look to improve same-store sales and market share all while providing our consumers with affordability, value and convenience at a time when they need us most.","Our focus is on the consumables categories to drive traffic in units. For example, we have taken retail price reduction on average of 10% on about 450 of our best selling SKUs across 2200 stores representing nearly 17% of our store base. We believe that these price reductions are meaningful and recognizable to our consumers. We are committed to further price moves as appropriate over time.","We are being strategic as we look to proactively address our pricing actions across our store base. These targeted price investments are in high household penetration, fast turning categories. At the same time, we are investing to communicating these price breaks to our consumers through incremental store signage, ad circulars, digital coupons, email and digital media.","While it\u2019s still very early in making these investments, the results are on track with where we would like for the performance to be on increasing units and traffic. We will continue to monitor our pricing actions and assess the opportunity for ongoing preemptive moves to enhance our competitive positioning.","We anticipate refreshing these price investments across items and categories, as well as incremental markets as needed as we move through the coming quarters with the goal to drive traffic in units and capture additional market share.","As for our core consumer, we operate with the reality that it is always challenging for her to stretch her budget given the pressures on her income and spending. We have seen an ongoing contraction in core consumer all out with retail spending as reflected in the Nielsen Panel data.","Given that our core consumer SKUs toward a lower income household, I believe the cumulative effect of macroeconomic factors such as reduction of staff participation and benefit levels, and increased housing and healthcare expenses are taking a noticeable toll on her spending.","Our goal is to be there for our customers when they need us the most. We will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. We remain committed to our long-term operating priorities. First, driving profitable sales growth, second, capturing growth opportunities, third, enhancing our position as a low cost operator and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage.","Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth. Over the long-term, we believe our pricing, labor and marketing investments will pay off in trips and units through increased customer loyalty as we work through our category management process for 2016, we assess the expansion of product groups that were most likely to drive traffic in our stores.","Through the first half of 2016, we have made great progress on expanding space allocation for perishables, health and beauty care and party and stationery. These 2016 sales driving initiatives are being implemented across not just new stores, relocations and remodels, but also in our mature store base to a greater degree than in the last several years.","Implementation of these initiatives will be completed in the third quarter. Year-to-date, through the second quarter, we have added nearly 21,000 cooler doors to our mature stores to allow for an expanded offering of cold beers, more immediate consumption items and greater product selection.","Additionally, more than 7,000 existing stores have seen planogram expansions across health and beauty care, party and\/or stationery, with many of these stores receiving expansions in each of these product areas. This initiative was completed in the second quarter of this year.","Our ongoing affordability initiative is front and center with an expanded $1 offering including a greater selection of national brands. Increased penetration of national brands at the $1 price point gives us the opportunity to increase trial with our consumers which leads to brand acceptance.","Acceptance drives loyalty which tends to encourage trade-up and packet size and brands over time. Currently, nearly 49% of our baskets contain a $1 item. In our new DG 16 format, these baskets are nearly $3 higher than our average basket indicating these are incremental purchases.","Our private brand portfolio plays a key role in driving profitable sales growth as these items contribute to sales and enhanced gross margins. Our consumers rely on the quality, value and affordability of our private brands. Our private brands offer exceptional value to our core consumers and they offer lower opening price points, which is especially important to our consumers.","We continue to have private brand opportunity as our customer penetration is below the average in the mass merchant and grocery segments. We are actively engaging our store associates as private brand ambassadors. In addition, we will continue to communicate with our consumers, the unparalleled value our private brands offer.","In the first quarter, we launched a new private line named Heartland Harvest to expand our better for you offerings which really resonate with our millennials. By next month, we anticipate offering over 15 new SKUs under this better for you brand.","This year, we have also expanded our private brand offerings in health and beauty care. In select Dollar General Plus locations, we initiated a test of limited assortments of the industry\u2019s best selling fresh fruits and vegetables as we look to gain more experience with these products and capitalize on our consumers\u2019 continued desire for fresh options.","So far, we are pleased with the early results. Our FAST WAY TO SAVE digital coupon offering continues to gain traction since we first brought this innovation to the channel in September of 2014. We are on track to more than double enrollment of the program by the end of this fiscal year allowing for greater shopper analytics and targeting of coupons.","The program provides consumers\u2019 exclusive savings available only as DG Digital Coupons. The compelling offerings, which include national brands, private brands and instant savings are helping to drive enrollment. Importantly, we are seeing a higher average basket when the DG digital coupons are utilized.","The store operations team is aggressively improving our on-shelf availability. Across the board, we are seeing progress as our third-party audits indicate that our stores have reduced their core out of stocks by more than 20%. Throughout the chain, our consumers are taking note of our improved in-stock position with recent customer satisfaction scores for our in-stock position at the highest level in two years based on comparable quarters.","In addition, we continue to optimize our labor investments in our more competitive markets and are pleased with the comp sales performance, operating profit gains and customer satisfaction scores.","Second, we are focused on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth with a proven high return low risk model. As we previously announced, we are on track to accelerate our square footage growth in 2016 to about 7% with 900 new stores and increase this growth to 7.5% in 2017 with about a 1000 new stores.","We continue to be very pleased with the strong results that we have gained through this program. Our new store productivity remains in the range of 80% to 85% of our comp store base, all while driving returns of 20% plus. Our new DG 16 store layout is being used for all new stores, relocations and remodels.","Through the second quarter, the team has already completed nearly 1100 real estate projects in this new layout. The layout is designed to expand high growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout.","We believe this layout can drive both existing and new consumer trips to Dollar General as we place an even greater emphasis in the store on value, affordability and convenience.","The early results of this DG 16 layout are encouraging. For instance, we are seeing stronger perishable sales and a double-digit lift in our new front-end items.","Overall, sales performance in stores using the DG 16 layout is exceeding our expectations. Even more importantly, our customers are telling us they like it as our customer satisfaction scores are significantly higher for the DG 16 layout.","In addition, we are utilizing a smaller footprint store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. To-date, we are currently operating more than 80 of these new stores with selling space of less than 6000 square feet, about 20% smaller than our traditional stores.","Based on the early results, sales productivity and returns of the small format stores are very encouraging. This store footprint incorporates all of our strategic initiatives, but with additive assortments.","By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our metro market consumers, we believe the smaller, more flexible format store will allow us to have a higher capture rate for site selection.","We anticipate that this smaller format will work in rural locations with lower household count as well. With this format, we have even greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower household rural sites.","In total, we anticipate we will have approximately 120 of the smaller format stores including remodels open as we exit the 2016 fiscal year. In July, we announced the purchase of former Walmart Express locations that we intend to have operating as Dollar General Stores by the end of October.","40 of the 42 sites will be considered relocations of existing stores. Each of these locations will have fresh meat and produce and 38 will have fueling stations. The team is moving very fast to get these locations up and running to better serve these communities with the everyday low prices and convenience our customers count on from us.","We have an active remodel and relocation program designed to keep our brands relevant as we utilize our most current store layout and in-store communication value to drive same-store sales and returns. About 900 locations are expected to be relocated or remodeled in fiscal 2016 with a similar level of projects slated for fiscal 2017.","We anticipate expanding our footprint in 2017 into North Dakota representing our 44th state of operations. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2017 as our 1000 store pipeline is already over 80% complete. We remain disciplined and focused as our new store program continues to drive compelling returns with a low cost to build and a low cost to operate.","Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low cost operator. As evidenced by our second quarter performance, our zero-based budgeting process is working. As we successfully leveraged our SG&A expenses on same-store sales growth significantly below our 2.5% to 3% SG&A leverage target.","Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low cost operator.","Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are our competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great onboarding and training and open communications. We continue to make improvements in our store manager turnover and are on track to have our best retention rate in several years.","To build on these improvements going forward, we have been focused on aligning our talent with the skill set required for success based on store characteristics in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time but the pay-off is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate retention.","As I\u2019ve mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are clearly focused on providing our customers with value and convenience in the current environment. As our customers need us more than ever they held stretch for household spending.","Earlier this month, we had over 1000 field leaders together in national that have discussed our plans for the future as I engage with the team, it was clear to me, they are energized and excited about our plans. We are acting with a sense of urgency across merchandizing, store operations and supply chain.","Our long-term commitment to growth in shareholder value is unchanged. I believe we are well positioned for the future and are focused on capturing the long-term opportunities ahead of us. Our business generates significant cash flows and we are in a position to invest in new store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and a competitive dividend.","To the more than 119,000 Dollar General employees across our 1300 store locations, distribution centers and store support center that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our consumers with convenience, value and service everyday, please accept my thanks and appreciation for all that you do as we gear up for the holiday selling season.","With that, Mary Winn, we\u2019d now like to turn the call open for questions.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Sounds great. Hope, we will take the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.","Todd Vasos","Hi, John.","John Heinbockel ","Hey, how are you doing? So, how did you come up with the 10% cut in price, as well as the number of items? How do you think about elasticity at that level, right, in terms of kind of getting a payback? And then, are there other items, when you think about funding that, are there other items be it consumable or discretionary where maybe they are less visible and prices go up and that\u2019s partly a way to fund it?","Todd Vasos","John, as you know, we are very focused on price here at Dollar General. For our core consumer, price is everything along with the convenient factor that we offer. And you also know from us that, we don\u2019t do anything without fully testing it first. We\u2019ve had tests in place in a couple of 100 stores for a very long time with a subset of these 450 items and in some cases as much as 500 items depending on the stores.","So we will test at these and know that these are the items that will actually drive additional traffic into our stores, but more importantly, we will give the value to our consumer that she needs in a very tough time.","And then lastly, what we see by these items, it helps round out that basket with the non-consumables once she gets in the store and we get her to pick up the consumables, that basket rounds up pretty nicely because of our compelling non-consumable offering.","John Heinbockel ","Okay, and then secondly, as you talked about the Walmart Expresses and having a fresh meat and produce, so, where does that take you going forward? You are already testing produce in some of the DGs and do the DGs more into DG market? Is DG market kind of dead as a growth vehicle? Or does that come \u2013 that back at some point where you could actually expand that more aggressively?","Todd Vasos","Yes, as you look at retail in general it\u2019s dynamic, right and the great thing here at Dollar General is that, we are very flexible and we look at every way we can to maximize our opportunities that lie out there. At the same time, in making sure that we service our consumers the way they need to be serviced in certain demographics and areas of the country.","In saying that, we see an opportunity especially with our millennial group, but even our core customer on some more fresh opportunities and offerings for her, not only in fruits and vegetables, some fresh meats that makes sense, but also as I indicated, in some of our better for you lines that we are now starting to put out.","Our core consumer is starting to gravitate to that and our next level up are best friends forever group in that millennial segment really resonate with it. So, I think, this is a springboard, quite frankly in the more to come as we look to what Dollar General store \u2013 or a basic Dollar General Store looks like in the future.","John Heinbockel ","Okay, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Todd Vasos","Hi, Scott.","Scott Mushkin ","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, I mean, the elephant in the room obviously, Walmart is investing in price, we were down in North Carolina and we actually didn't see your price investments that you are referencing. We saw about a 13% gap in price between DG and Walmart.","So I guess the question is what\u2019s the appropriate gap for you guys? And if Walmart continues on their path, and now we\u2019ve seen Delhaize follow suit and obviously up their consumable aggressiveness in consumables; Target\u2019s referenced it, we have Albertsons, Safeway being pretty aggressive in certain markets.","I guess, take me forward in how you see this rolling through DG's numbers, how it ends well for most people that are selling consumables? Because everyone is saying the same thing, we've got to get aggressive, we've got to drive the traffic, but it seems like we are just descending into a price war. Thanks.","Todd Vasos","Yes, the way we look at this is, we look at it a little differently in that, first of all, the retail landscape is very aggressive right now. There is no doubt about it. But you know what, retail is always aggressive and there is always folks doing different things and we compete and have competed for many, many years with many retailers.","In saying that, the way we look at this is being proactive. So, what we are looking at in our 2200 stores that we\u2019ve reduced prices on average of 10% what we have done is a proactive approach to it, not necessarily chasing anybody, but actually putting price where we believe will best serve our consumer and best build to capture market share.","And as we continue to move forward and expand that, whether it be other markets and\/or other items, we will take that same tact on being proactive and not reactive, because you are right, if everyone is reactive, then, in fact, sometimes it doesn\u2019t end well. Lastly, the great thing about Dollar General is that we have the wherewithal to do this.","We have the wherewithal to do it within our P&L and others may or may not have that same luxury. So, we see it as a real advantage for Dollar General but we see it mostly as being there for our core consumer, because she needs us the most right now.","Scott Mushkin ","All right guys. That was all I had. Thanks for the answer.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Todd Vasos","Hi, Paul.","Paul Trussell ","Hey, good morning. Good morning. So, I believe a quarter ago, as we thought about the full year guidance, it was indicated to be towards the higher end of the range, whereas today I think it\u2019s just more kind of within the range.","Is it just the adjustments from the labor expense being added into the fourth quarter and the kind of [Indiscernible] and expenses associated with the stores that you acquired or maybe you can just walk us through other puts and takes as we think about the full year, in particular what is the comp guidance for the second half?","John Garratt","Sure, Paul. And I\u2019ll reiterate what we said at the beginning of the call is that, and we stated this previously it was in our earnings release that, we were talking to the 10% to 15% range and are still forecasting to be within that range for full year EPS, but not otherwise updating any specific aspects of the guidance today.","But - and I also want to reiterate is that, this team has a strong track record of managing all the business levers to deliver profit and cash growth and feel good about the first half performance it\u2019s 14 \u2013 18% year-to-date EPS growth and 14% in Q2 as well as the strong cash growth.","But what I will tell you is that, we have headwinds in the second half. We mentioned the charge associated with the 42 newly acquired stores, that will be about $0.02 to $0.03 earnings per share impact, we also have the implementation of FLSA which is about $0.03 to $0.04 impact in Q4.","I think it\u2019s important to note there that, even though that\u2019s only over two months, you can extrapolate that over the course of next year, given that we have a 53rd week at the end of the year as well as many of the actions that help mitigate that cost next year won't be fully implemented until next year.","But those two will have impacts on the balance of the year and then, again bear in mind, we are focused in the long-term here making the right decisions to be there for our customers when she needs us the most and with an eye in the long-term are making investments that we talked about earlier in the call.","But again the business fundamentals I will stress remain unchanged with we are very excited about opening 900 new units this year, on track for 1000 next year as Todd mentioned, pipeline is 80% full and we are still seeing the same compelling great unit level economics as we open the stores with the same productivity and the same great returns over 20%.","Paul Trussell ","Okay, I guess, just going back to the comp, just wanted to - so no guidance in terms of the comp over the balance of the year. Could you maybe just speak to the cadence of comps during the second quarter and the impact that you mentioned of 60 to 70 basis points from deflation in SNAP, do you expect that a similar impact to be ongoing?","Todd Vasos","Yes, Paul, I would tell you that all theories in the second quarter were positive. So we are very happy to have seen that. As I look forward to the back half of the year, I believe many if not most all of the same headwinds we saw on the sales line continue to be there in the back half of the year.","Deflation as well as SNAP that 60 to 70 basis points is a headwind that is not going to go away. Now, trying to counter that obviously will be our price investments. Now as you know though, price investments they kind of resonate with the consumer and while we are very confident that it will drive units and traffic it will take a little time for that initiative to take hold.","So, we are doing everything possible here to ensure that we are giving the consumer the deal that she needs so that we can continue to have her come into our store and for us to continue to capture market share.","Paul Trussell ","Appreciate it. Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James & Associates.","Dan Wewer ","Thanks. Todd, I wanted to ask about the payback from the 21,000 coolers that you have added to mature stores and to whether or not you are seeing any diminishing returns from the additional coolers and perhaps if you could peg that to your experience with the DG plus cooler set?","Todd Vasos","Yes, that\u2019s a great question. Everything we do here has a return attached to it and the cooler program is no different. We track it each and every week because it\u2019s a big initiative for us. Those 21,000, 22,000 cooler doors that we have put in are doing exactly what we have thought they would do and actually in many cases exceeding our expectations.","But because of the headwinds we are seeing in deflation mainly in those perishable categories of milk and eggs is diluting that will affect a little bit. But I can tell you for the long-term and that\u2019s how we look at this business for the long-term. This is the exact right thing to do and we are confident in that because as you mentioned it our Dollar General Plus and market stores, these are just segments that have already proven in those stores to be very successful that we have moved into our traditional stores. So, we are very confident over time that those will pay big dividends to us.","Dan Wewer ","Just one other follow-up the drop in customer transactions per store, I believe that just the first time that\u2019s happened since the buyout back in 2008. Where do you think that that business shifted? Was it to the mass merchants and perhaps they are able to take advantage of the lower gasoline pricing and their customers becoming more mobile as a result?","Todd Vasos","When we look at it, the headwind of SNAP for us really was a big deal and also our core consumer continues to be under a lot of pressure. I know that, when we look at globally, the overall US population, it seems like things are getting better but when you really start breaking it down.","And you look at that core consumer that we serve on the lower economic scale that\u2019s out there that demographic, things have not gotten any better for her and arguably they are worse and they are worse because rents are accelerating, healthcare is accelerating on her at a very, very rapid cliff and now, you couple that upwards of 20 states where they have reduced or eliminated the SNAP benefit and it has really put a toll on her.","That SNAP benefit reduction and\/or elimination have begun in April, right that was a kick off and you could see it immediately in the numbers. So I believe that those are the things that are affecting her today again, our core customers and by the way, we\u2019ve seen those play out before.","If you dwell the prospects of October of 2013 and coming into November of 2013 when the last large SNAP benefit reduction happened it happened almost exactly the same way on our comps and how we thought traffic. Obviously, we are up a little higher level at that time, but rest assured that our traffic slows tremendously then very similar as it did now.","The difference here is, we are going to take aggressive price actions to get that consumer back in the store. She needs a little motivation to get back in. We need to help her stretch her budget for a time period until she figures it out. Our core customer is very resilient. Those figured out over time, I think it will help as it tends to now try to figure out how to make ends mean with less money during the months.","Dan Wewer ","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Keith ","Hi, yes, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Todd Vasos","Good morning.","Peter Keith ","I was curious on the price investment, I presume that it\u2019s probably going to expand to more stores than the base of - I think you said 17%. How should we think about that dynamic on gross margin going forward?","John Garratt","The expansion \u2013 with the pricing that\u2019s something that we are assessing as we go and as Todd mentioned previously, we have to learn with everything that we do and we are seeing the benefits from the pricing actions that we have taken. Bear in mind that this does take time to fully take traction with our consumers.","So really we will control \u2013 but we can\u2019t control monitor the environment and take pricing on a as needed basis to make sure where there for our customer when she needs to make sure we are making the right decision for the long-term health of the business. Now that will of course, have an impact on margin as we do that, but again, we are focused on the long-term payback on that.","Peter Keith ","Okay, thank you. And then, maybe just a follow-up question on the discretionary category, so it looked like home and basic clothing were two areas of weakness and those have been historically a little bit better. I wouldn't think those were impacted by the spring dynamic. So, maybe could you comment on what\u2019s going on there and any initiatives to improve those higher margin categories?","Todd Vasos","The great thing about our non-consumable categories, the team has done a fabulous job, the buying team over the many years that we\u2019ve been working on this. Up until this quarter, we\u2019ve had nine consecutive quarters of growth in our non-consumables.","And I would tell you that the slowdown there is directly correlated to that traffic slowdown that we\u2019ve seen which is really I believe consumable base and that\u2019s why we are taking the actions on price that we are and other things to ensure that we get that traffic back in the store as we move through the quarters to come.","Once that happens, we are confident in our non-consumable merchandizing and our pricing there and we\u2019ve always said that consumables will drive the traffic and non-consumables will round out the basket. And we see it no different as we move forward.","Peter Keith ","Okay. Thank you very much and good luck.","Todd Vasos","Thank you","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Todd Vasos","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lasser ","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. In the areas where you saw greater competitive potency, did your comp underperform the total and by how much?","Todd Vasos","I can tell you that, that we did not see an underperformance in any measurable amounts in areas that we know that there has been some competition beating some things up. We have not seen that. We are very confident in our overall pricing strategy and structure to be honest with you. Our consumers give us a tremendous amount of credit for pricing and the value that we offer.","How we are looking at these recently announced price reductions, we are more proactive in nature in areas that we see, we have opportunity to capture additional market share in areas that we may not be quite as good if you will, from a traffic standpoint as we are in other parts of the country.","And so we are proactively taking steps to ensure that we bolster though there is and then as we expand this program over time it will be once again proactive in nature where we think the opportunity to steal share is best achieved as well as where our consumers need us most and a lot of them are within these 20 states that have recently cut SNAP.","Michael Lasser ","So to reconcile some of this, so you are not seeing the stores in areas that are more competitive underperforming. But are those the same places that you are going to be investing in price? And how do you expect to fund those price investments, will that be on your P&L or do you expect you share that burden with your vendors?","Todd Vasos","Those maybe some overlap where there maybe some other retailers doing some price initiatives as we speak. But again, we are not focused on chasing any one competitor. We are more focused on what we can control and that is looking in areas that we know that we can expand our market share in.","So, while there will be some overlap that isn\u2019t the driving factor for us behind where we go. The other thing to keep in mind here is that, we do have the wherewithal to do this as I mentioned earlier, and we have great relationships with our vendor partners and rest assured that they are working with us hand-in-hand as we continue to drive units and traffic into our stores and into their brands.","Michael Lasser ","And if I could just add a follow-up, Todd, I understood the issues with SNAP and deflation, but is there a piece of this that\u2019s just related to the consumer, job labor market getting better, so the consumer is feeling a little bit better and they are trading up, is that not possible?","Todd Vasos","I am not going to say it\u2019s not possible. We have not seen that in our data. Once again, remember that over 60% to 65% of our sales in consumer base is on that lower demographic area that of the economic scale and when you keep that in mind, her life hasn\u2019t gotten any better and that\u2019s really that customer that we are serving the most and that we are intent on making sure has enough money and enough products inside her house to build or feed her family.","Michael Lasser ","Okay, thank you so much.","Todd Vasos","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Todd Vasos","Hi Dan.","Dan Binder ","Just on the same topic of price competition, can you be a little bit clearer in terms of which channel you are seeing the most activity out of, is it the discount channel? Is it the supermarkets, is it the Dollar Stores, is it Family Dollar, those things under the Dollar Tree ownership? Any color you can provide on that and particularly on the regions that you mentioned, any particular stand out?","Todd Vasos","I think that the \u2013 some of the price reductions taken by the retailers has been flushed out pretty good out in the press. So I believe everyone knows some of the retailers that are working price right now, but as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve seen that over the years and over time and we compete very well with mass merchant retailers, grocery and drug retailers.","And then, the other thing is we \u2013 again our consumers give us a lot of credit for our prices are today we\u2019re some of the lowest in the marketplace with nearly being the parity with mass, 20% on average lower than grocery and 40% plus lower everyday than drug on the shelf and when you think about it in those terms, we feel very confident that our pricing structure is well in tact and this is all about everyday low price for our consumers.","She needs to have the confidence that if she walks in, she has an everyday low price. She doesn\u2019t have to wonder whether it\u2019s on sale or if she has to buy five or ten at a time to get the deal. She knows she can walk in, buy one and get the deal that she needs.","Dan Binder ","And just as a follow-up, you cited some pressure with the consumer. If we - maybe look forward a couple of quarters or even a year if the comp store sales don't get back to 3% at some point and we kind of linger here in that 1% to 2% range, does that impact the way you think about square footage growth? I know you\u2019ve got the 1000 store plan here set and that\u2019s probably likely to get executed, but as you think beyond next year?","Todd Vasos","Yes, when we look at our new store program, it is doing exactly what \u2013 it has been doing what we thought it would do over time. We are very happy with that. We don\u2019t see that slowing down. It is still opening \u2013 the stores are still opening 80% to 85% of our mature store base.","The returns are 20% plus on these new store locations and we have seen no difference this year than any other year in our new store openings. Matter of fact, we are indexing over 101% right now on our portfolio for 2016. So, when you look at all those dynamics and that low cost to operate and low cost to build, I can\u2019t think of a better place for us to reinvest our money than in that first in the business and then returning to shareholders second.","Dan Binder ","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vinny Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Todd Vasos","Hi, Vinny.","Vinny Sinisi ","Hey, great guys. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. Wanted to ask, appreciate all the color you gave us around the details supporting the sales number. I know you typically kind of rank order the factors in your release. And just a couple of quick points of clarification, within the food deflation part of that, which was listed first, can you give any further color around, kind of how much of that was strictly from the commodity price changes versus kind of increased competition within?","And also this might just be my own paranoia, but I know it was kind of a separate sentence where you talk about the competitive environment. So, with the kind of expectations you have for the quarter, is it safe to say that that being kind of in the second sense is kind of the last in rank order as well?","Todd Vasos","Yes, I think that is correct, first of all. Once again, we just don\u2019t see that competitive nature being the largest factor here. What we see again is that, SNAP reduction and that deflation being some of the biggest headwind and then second, third after that being just the overall macro environments in our core consumer.","When you look at the deflation, it is primarily due to commodity price reductions, so cost reductions to us which we then pass on to the consumer at lower retail predominantly that\u2019s what we are talking about here and it\u2019s in big categories for us, right, in milk and eggs. Remember, we don\u2019t have the breadth and depth that mass or grocery has in our perishable and food businesses.","So, when that deflation hits in some of these key categories, it hits us a little harder. So, in those two, but also beyond that in dry grocery, we still see sugar, grains, cereals, coffee, so some of our largest categories being affected by cost decreases, which then in term become retail decreases and as we all know, the consumers don\u2019t consume that much more just because the price is a little less expensive.","So, that is really the emphasis behind what we see as some of those headwinds and as I said before, those headwinds we anticipate seeing with us through the back half of the year.","Vinny Sinisi ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful, Todd, thank you. And maybe just a quick follow-up and this is more just kind of a \u2013 kind of top look at the group and the consumer. But, like you said today, you are maybe even seeing some increased pressure on the low-end consumer and I think most of us on the phone kind of thought it was not a fantastic low-end consumer, but more or less of a steady state.","So, maybe if any kind of anecdotes from what you are seeing specifically in the baskets or how folks might be responding when you are proactively getting more aggressive. How should we kind of think about the overall low-end in your opinion as we go forward here?","Todd Vasos","Yes, that consumer is a real special consumer. We spend a lot of time in the stores. I am out a couple times a month with our head merchant \u2013 our head operator and we see first hand this consumer each and every time we are out. And this core consumer, I tell you, has got no better as far as \u2013 as her economic well being.","Matter of fact, she tells us while we are out in the stores or even through all of our panel data that we do that while things haven\u2019t gotten a lot worse as far as income coming in, other than the recent SNAP decrease. My expenditures are going up at a very rapid rate. Healthcare is one of the big ones, because most of our consumers, while she maybe working, doesn\u2019t have healthcare and we all know that she is having to now pay for the healthcare or be taxed on it.","Right, so, that is starting to really play against that low-end consumer right now and it will continue to play against her. You couple that with those rents that we talked about, those increased rents are real and in many parts of where we serve our customers, the affordability and availability of rental units are getting more and more scarce, which is driving the prices and we are seeing that, because most of our core customers cannot and do not own their own homes.","And when we are out in the stores and we drop prices like we do, I can tell you, I\u2019ve been out in stores in the middle of the aisle and her customers come up to our store manager in tears and thanking them for being there and thanking them for the prices that we offer in a real convenient nature for her where she can walk to the store, because she can\u2019t afford anything else. When you hear that, that really brings home where this core customer is.","Vinny Sinisi ","Okay, all right. That\u2019s a helpful perspective. Thanks very much and good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Todd Vasos","Hi, Stephen.","Stephen Grambling ","Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just one quick follow-up, on your long-term guidance, I think you had outlined opportunities for margin expansion across both gross margin and SG&A, I guess, as we think about the price investments and those building blocks, do those change and are there other offsets whether that\u2019s through - I think the earlier question on vendor funds, shrink or other areas? Thanks.","Todd Vasos","Sure. So, as we said, we are really focused on looking at margin and SG&A in tandem and continue to see opportunity over the long-term. This team has done a phenomenal job over the years managing the multiple levers within gross margin and you\u2019ve seen that with six straight quarters of margin expansion and it continues to be the same levers in terms of shrink which we continue to see as an improvement opportunity over time.","We continue to drive expense control and efficiencies around DC and trans and the team continues to effectively manage the levers of category management, private-label and foreign sourcing. And we also work with our vendors to make sure that we can hit those price points.","On the SG&A side, as you saw, we had tremendous performance over the last two periods as zero-based budgeting. We\u2019ve always had a history of lean cost management and zero-based budgeting has really taken hold and help us get to that next level of savings and you\u2019ve seen that in the results and the team is working on a pipeline of future savings focused on non-customer facing areas.","And the rigor is really be coming in grains. So we will continue to work those two over time. As we\u2019ve said, not every quarter is great at the same and there are some headwinds in the near-term, but we continue to see opportunity over the long-term managing on these levers as we have in the past.","Stephen Grambling ","Fair enough. Best of luck in the back half. Thanks.","John Garratt ","Thank you.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Hope, that will now conclude our call as we hit the top of the hour. I know we are leaving a few people in the queue, but I am around and Matt is around if we could help with any questions. But thank you very much for being on the call today. Hope, you can wrap the call up.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Brandy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday August 28, 2014. This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company\u2019s earnings press release issued this morning.","Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Thank you, Brandy, and good morning everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks and then we will open the up call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases.","Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions, and other non-historical matters, such as our 2014 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures, our planned fiscal 2014 operating, merchandising and store growth initiatives, our share repurchase expectations, our beliefs regarding future consumer economic trends and various matters relating to our proposal to acquire Family Dollar. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning; our 2013 Form 10-K which was filed on March 20, 2014; and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call. We will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Where available, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which I have mentioned is posted on dollargeneral.com.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.","Richard Dreiling","Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning everyone. This morning we announced the results for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. David and I will discuss the highlights of the quarter, then I will briefly address the Family Dollar proposal.","For the second quarter, total sales grew 7.5% to $4.72 billion. Comp sales increased2.1% with increases in both traffic and average ticket extending that trend to 26 consecutive quarters. Our second quarter same-store sales began very strong, with a year-over-year increase in May of more than 3.5%. However, this growth moderated as we moved through June and July, given the competitive environment in a consumer who although resilient in the face of economic uncertainty, remains cautious with their spending. Tobacco and perishables continued to show the strongest sales gain and sales of candy and snack especially, carbonated beverages was also strong. Tobacco is continuing to comp positive even as we anniversary the rollout.","We are very pleased with the comp sales growth in our home and apparel categories as we continue to focus on making these departments more relevant to our customers. Our gross profit rate of 30.8% of sales was 53 basis points less than last year\u2019s second quarter. As has been the case for the last few quarters, the competitive environment continued to be elevated during the second quarter. In response, we increased our promotional activities while maintaining our commitment to EDLP in the second quarter, resulting in higher promotional markdowns. In addition, the higher mix of tobacco and perishables impacted our year-over-year gross margin compression.","Earnings per share increased 11% to $0.83 per share. On an adjusted basis, which excludes a legal settlement in 2013, earnings per share increased 8%. We remain on track to meet the full year adjusted earnings expectations we shared with you last quarter. I\u2019ll talk more about our operative initiatives in a moment, but now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to David","David Tehle","Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. In light of the competitive environment during much of the second quarter, we managed our gross margin well, and we are especially pleased with our ability to control expenses in the quarter.","Our gross profit increased 6% for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, gross profit decreased by 53 basis points to 30.8%. As Rick mentioned, promotional markdowns were the most significant factors contributing to gross margin compression, in addition to the higher mix of lower margin consumables, primarily tobacco and perishables. These factors were partially offset by higher initial markup. The change in our year-over-year shrink rate and the LIFO adjustment were insignificant in the quarter. This is noteworthy as stabilizing our shrink performance is the first step towards ultimately improving the shrink results.","SG&A expense was 21.7% of sales in the 2014 period compared to 21.9% in the 2013 period or 21.8% excluding the $8.5 million legal settlement. Excluding the legal settlement from last year\u2019s SG&A, our SG&A rate improved slightly as a result of improved leverage on retail labor expense and a decrease in benefit cost. Rent and advertising expenses increased at a higher rate than our increase in sales.","Interest expense was up $2million from the 2013 second quarter. We had higher borrowing, related to our increased share repurchases.","The second quarter tax rate was 38.1% compared to last year\u2019s effective tax rate of 37.4%, with the increase relating to the expiration of various federal jobs tax credit programs.","On a reported basis, our net income increased 2.4% to $251 million or $0.83 per share in the 2014 quarter from $245 million or $0.75 per share in the 2013 quarter. Excluding the $8.5million legal settlement in the 2013 second quarter, adjusted income was up slightly.","Earnings per share increased 11% on a GAAP basis and 8% on an adjusted basis.","Year to date we generated cash from operations of $487 million.","Total capital expenditures were $191million, including $66 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores, $58 million related to new lease stores primarily for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment, $27million for distribution transportation related capital expenditures, $21million for information systems upgrades and technology related projects and $16 million for stores built by the company. Year-to-date, we have opened 426 new stores and relocated or remodeled 585 stores, including over 250 of the approximately 400 planned lifecycle remodels. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our newly relocated and remodeled stores.","We did not repurchase shares in the second quarter. We have approximately $223 million remaining in the existing authorization. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we have repurchased approximately $2.3 billion or 44.5 million shares of our common stock. Our share repurchase program is currently on hold as we await the outcome of our proposed transaction with Family Dollar.","Looking at the balance sheet, as of August 1 total inventories were $2.79 billion, up about 4% on a per store basis.","Turning now to guidance. Looking forward we expect -- we continue to expect topline sales for 2014 to increase 8% to 9%. Same-store sales are now expected to increase 3.0% to 3.5% given our trends we saw in the first half of the year. Overall square footage is expected to grow approximately 6% to 7% and we continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year of $3.45 to $3.55, excluding any costs or changes to our share repurchase estimates related to the potential FDO transaction.","As you model your earnings for the third and fourth quarter, please keep in mind that we expect stronger earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter due to the easing of the comparisons. For the year, we plan to open approximately 700 new stores and capital expenditures are expected to be in the ranges $450 million to $500 million,","With that I will turn back the call to Rick.","Richard Dreiling","Thanks David. As we have said for many quarters, driving unit sales growth is key to our strategy, and we remain committed as ever to providing our customers with everyday low prices they can count on. We want to make sure that customers who walk or drive by our stores every day know that they can find nearly all of their everyday items in our small box convenient stores. So, while we would have liked stronger comps sales growth in the second quarter, we are pleased with the nice step up in customer traffic in our stores and the way the team managed expenses.","We have seen our key initiatives such as an increased focus on affordability, expansion of health and beauty offerings and lifecycle remodels gain traction, albeit somewhat slower than we had anticipated. In non-consumables, we have existing work underway for the second half of the year. In the fast-growing tech area, we've expanded our cell phone offerings and accessories.","For the home, our domestic department has been reset, refreshed with new product assortment, new colors, dedicated end-caps and a new bath towel offering with a very attractive price point of just $2. In addition, we are in the midst of repackaging our private brands across both select consumables and non-consumables categories. The goal of the re-packaging is to enhance our customers\u2019 perception of our private brand quality and most importantly the value for the price. We had a soft launch of certain key items in August, with very encouraging results from our consumer research.","All-in, we expect our sales improvement to continue as we move through the year and quarterly comparisons continue to ease. Keep in mind our merchandising strategy is based on disciplined category management process. For the vast majority of consumable items, the vast majority of consumable items we sell are national brand that shoppers can find across multiple formats and channels. The vast majority of the items we sell can be found in every large box discounter, the front end at every drug stores and grocery store and even smaller more localized retailers. What has allowed us to be successful is our ability to pair a vast number of SKUs down to the optimal items, with only the brands, the sizes and the price points that appeal to and meet the immediate or what we refer to as filling needs of our customers.","We are able to execute this strategy with the support of our disciplined category management process, coupled with significant distribution synergies and strong buying power, resulting from purchasing significant quantities of limited SKUs. This foundation of limited assortment and distribution efficiencies allows us to successfully compete with much larger retailers and provide our customers with everyday low prices that they can trust.","Let\u2019s turn to the customer for a minute. You\u2019ve heard other retailers say this, low and middle end consumers are continuing to struggle. They have changed their buying habits. Data now suggests that out of necessity, many folks have reduced their overall consumption and absolute unit growth across Nielsen measured channel data supports this. While our customer always finds a way to work through difficult time, she is struggling to overcome the sustained nature of the headwind she is facing. As we move through the second half of the year, we will begin to lap headwinds that have weighed on our core customers, including concern over the government shutdown in October, uncertainties for unemployment benefits and reduced SNAP benefits. There is no doubt that affordability remains a key focus of our core customer.","We talked about our affordability initiatives in our first quarter call. So I\u2019d like to give you a quick update. First and foremost, we are as committed as ever to our philosophy of everyday low price to drive traffic in units. We are continuing to add items under our smart and simple brand at entry level price points, and we continue to strategically introduce new $1 price point items in key consumable categories such as food, home cleaning and paper products that are focused on affordability. New items include a combination of national brands and our private brands. We currently have approximately 2,500 core $1 items in our stores, which is up 5.5% from last year. Sales of core $1 SKUs increased over 13% in the second quarter with over 44% of customer transactions including a core $1 item.","We are very pleased with our customers\u2019 response to our $1 to $5 price for in assortment in our non-consumable category. These sharp price points, coupled with appealing merchandize are enhancing the relevance of our non-consumable as evidenced by solid improvement in our home and apparel sales in the second quarter. Apparel comp positive for the first time in a year driven by broad based growth across ladies, men and boys. Non-consumables are important to our sales mix as we strive to enhance our gross profit rate. We have completed the roll out of our DG Digital Coupon capabilities in all stores. Signups for the program are going well even before our full launch planned for this quarter. We\u2019ll be making a big splash with our customers in late September with a promotion entitled Fast Way To Save to drive awareness and enrollment. Over time, we believe this exciting program will drive shopper engagement.","Turning to expense control, technology in our easy store process are allowing us to further eliminate work in the stores that in non-value added and to streamline our processes. Our goal is to create time savings that we can reinvest to better manage our stores and serve our customers. Some of our most meaningful projects relate to our more efficient back office procedures and simplification of our inventory management process. As we discussed before, continuous improvements to the distribution center store process make our easy store delivery system even more efficient.","We are learning a great deal about our customer\u2019s service perception from our updated customer satisfaction program, another great example of Dollar General\u2019s dedication to continuous improvement We are asking our customers to give us feedback on the most important aspects of our performance, how are our store standards? Are we in stock on the items they need? How is the checkout experience? These revamped metrics give us a much better view on what our customers want and the value in our stores. We expect this program to benefit our customer shopping experience and help drive sales.","I am pleased to report that we had modestly favorable results stabilizing our inventory shrunk in the second quarter, an important first step in ultimately improving our shrink results. Shrink improvement continues to be an opportunity as we remain steadfastly committed to improving shrink and optimizing our shrink levels on as store by store basis. At the end of the second quarter we had 11,535 stores with 85.2 million square feet of selling space in 40 States. Of those, more than 1,800 are in our most current DG 13 format which is more convenient, which has a more convenient layout, improved store signage and a refreshed yellow and black color scheme.","Last quarter we talked about our lifecycle remodel program which focuses on our legacy smaller footprint stores, allowing us to improve adjacency and planogram layouts in a manner more consistent with our DG 13 stores. Our total remodels to date this year includes over 250 lifecycle remodels, which now are performing significantly ahead of the chain on a same store sales basis. This program helps us build our brand positioning in the marketplace as there is an opportunity to maximize sales with significantly lower capital expenditures. We remain very excited that there are approximately 14,000 untapped locations providing opportunities for organic new store growth with low risk and high return.","We opened our Bethel distribution center in the first quarter and it has ramped up ahead of our expectation on all productivity metrics. This facility will continue to support our new store expansion in the northeast. This gives us a great template to follow as we look to build our new distribution center in San Antonio, Texas. With that being said, I want to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to the 105,000 Dollar General employees as we celebrate our 75th anniversary of savings and service.","To wrap all of this up, I\u2019d like to now turn to our proposal to acquire Family Dollar. We remain committed to what we view as a superior proposal for Family Dollar shareholders who would receive a higher value for their shares and all cash certainty. For Dollar General shareholders, the proposed transaction is a significant strategic opportunity to create immediate and long lasting shareholder value. Importantly, this proposed combination would solidify Dollar General position as the leading small box discount retailer allowing us to deliver convenience, greater selection and everyday low prices to customers through nearly 20,000 stores in 46 States with sales exceeding $28 billion and over 160,000 employees. Based on our strong track record of success and improving our own profitability since 2008, we believe we can manage the Family Dollar stores more efficiently and effectively.","Additionally, although we have highly complementary business models, we believe that further refinement of the combined product offerings will add value for our customers providing them with convenience and everyday low prices on household basics and necessities, along with a compelling assortment of non-consumable merchandize. The cost savings and synergies from the proposed transaction will enable us to share such savings with our customers. We\u2019ve done extensive analysis of the potential synergies between the two companies across merchandizing, store operation, supply chain and administrative functions. As a result of that work, we have a comprehensive and thoughtful action plans ready to put in place to capture the synergies available in this potential transaction.","We believe that this proposed combination would be very well positioned for long term revenue and earnings growth, given the anticipated $550 million to $600 million of annual run rate synergies over three years. We expect the proposed transaction would be immediately accretive to earnings in the low double digits, excluding implementation and transaction costs. While we would expect to begin to receive benefits in the first year, the synergies would be expected to ramp up consistently across the three years. Approximately 20% of the synergies are expected to come from improved category management and increased sales productivity across both consumables and non-consumable categories. 40% will come from gross margin expansion for merchandize procurement and sourcing in the optimization across our supply chains to reduce stand lines. The remaining 40% would be from SG&A cost reductions, including the implementation of our rolltainer delivery method to the stores.","Our plans are specific, actionable across every work stream of the business. I look forward to oversee the successful integration of these two companies if the transaction is complete. And I\u2019m prepared to remain as CEO through May of 2016 to do so. While much has been said about the antitrust issues, we remain confident that these issues are very manageable. We have done extensive antitrust work over the last year. The up to 700 store divesture number that we proposed was based on extensive antitrust work in order to take the issue off the table for the Family Dollar board. We are ready and willing to share this analysis with Family Dollar and its counsel and are confident that we would be able to quickly and efficiently resolve any potential anti-trust issues. We continue to carefully review our options regarding our proposal and we truly hope that Family Dollar will come to the table to explore a tremendous opportunity for maximizing value for its shareholders.","Mary Winn, I\u2019d now like to open it up for questions.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Okay. Thank you, Rick. As a reminder, the purpose of this call is to discuss our second quarter earnings and we would appreciate if you would keep your questions limited to that topic. We will not be answering any questions regarding our proposal for Family Dollar. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Brandy will now open the lines up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator instructions). You first question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first would just be on the guidance. You took down the comp range a little bit, but have reiterated EPS even as you suggested gross margin pressures remain to a degree. What are the some of the key puts and takes in SG&A or elsewhere they are enabling you to reiterate the EPS range?","David Tehle","Yeah and again I would say we kind of trimmed it a little bit in terms of when we went from 3 to 4 to 3 to 3.5. Definitely we are seeing a little bit better SG&A leverage for the back half of the year than what we\u2019ve previously had. We also tweaked the share count a little bit. The share count is a little bit lower. Again, I don\u2019t view this as a major change what we did on the comp side of it","Richard Dreiling","Stephen, as I\u2019m looking at the back half of the year, the thing that I liked most about quarter two was an acceleration of transaction growth and acceleration of unit growth, and I have always been a believer if those two are moving north, sooner or later everything else catches up.","Stephen Grambling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess to change gears a little bit, if you can comment a little bit on maybe what plan B is if there is no deal and how you think about capital allocation, recognizing that the share buyback program has been suspended as we look further out, if there isn\u2019t a deal, is there any commentary you can give us on how you will be thinking about the leverage ratio and buybacks going forward? Thank you.","Richard Dreiling","Stephen, very fair question. I\u2019m not prepared to go there yet because I don\u2019t want to give up on the deal yet.","Stephen Grambling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","All right. Maybe if I can squeeze one other in there would just be the better traffic, as you think about consumables and tobacco being lapped, are you still getting the same attachment rate or is there anything that\u2019s changing there relative to your initial expectations?","Richard Dreiling","Actually great question and again, the attachment rate on cigarettes in exactly like it has been and we are lapping where we were last year and our cigarettes are comping positive. So we are very excited with that strategic change in our mix.","Stephen Grambling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks. Best of luck in the back half.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning everyone. First question is, in the 10-Q you talked of the promotional environment in the quarter and then mentioned that that activity has moderated recently. So just wondering if you can give a little more color on where it upticked during the quarter and kind of why we saw the spike up and back down.","Richard Dreiling","Yeah, I would say the competitive activity in May was pretty intense, centered around the Memorial Day holiday. We actually made the decision to hang with our everyday low pricing, but get into the promotional fray and that\u2019s why we had a little bit more margin pressure than we had actually anticipated. Primarily the driver of our margin pressure in quarter two was promotional markdown, which was a conscious decision that we made. As we moved through June, sales began, the competitive environment I would say began to moderate and then it got really hot around the 4th of July.","We also made the decision to play in the promotional battle around the 4th of July. As we moved through July, kind of stayed intense and as we moved into August I would say it started to slow back down and it\u2019s not nearly what it was in the memorial day in July 4th timeframe. I would like throw out back to school for us. We are having a very good back to school right now. Our back to school categories, we\u2019re up 4.5% right now. In fact this week which is the first of two really intense weeks, we are actually up over 7% in the categories that are related to back to school. And I relate that to the fact that the environment has cooled down and everyday low price has a lot more value right now.","Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","That\u2019s great to hear. And then secondly, the retail labor leverage that you achieved in the quarter, is that more related to the rolltainer initiative or is it more of a tactical decision around the promotional environment?","Richard Dreiling","I think it\u2019s driven primarily by the work that Greg and his team are doing on work elimination. We are doing a much better job on the easy store sort, which is allowing the sort to be even more relevant in relation to the proximity of the product on the rolltainer where it is on the shelf. But I think we are doing a good job of eliminating unnecessary work. And our goal Matt long-term is to reinvest that labor back into more selling opportunities."," Matt Nemer \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities ","Great, thanks and have a great labor day.","Operator","Our next question comes from one Stacie Rabinowitz of Consumer Edge Research","Stacie Rabinowitz \u2013 Consumer Edge Research ","Good morning. As you are talking about -- I have two questions which may be related. As you\u2019re talking about increased promotional activity, I was wondering which category is -- or within your categories, private label versus branded, where that activity might have been concentrated? And then secondly, I thought it was interesting that you guys were talking about candy, snacks and tobacco as being some of the headlines this quarter. Those seem a little bit more discretionary than some of the other categories, and given you are talking about a pressured consumer, I was wondering if you were doing anything special for those categories that might have led to that growth?","Richard Dreiling","Great question. Let me deal with the first one. The increased promotional activity was primarily around soda pricing, I would say probably soda pricing, bread and milk would probably be the three key categories and probably in all honesty more on the national brand side than the private brand side. Tobacco is tobacco, but soda for us resides in candy and snacks and that\u2019s why you would see that number rise because it\u2019s primarily driven by carbonated beverage.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Mark Montagna of Avondale Partners","Mark Montagna \u2013 Avondale Partners","Last year second half, drugstores got very deeply promotional. Are you anticipating a repeat of that again or can we effectively anniversary that, that we're not going to have to worry so much?","Richard Dreiling","Mark, I look at the add every day with my team, every Monday with my team. It does appear Mark that things are starting to moderate. You will see a pretty aggressive soda price once in a while, but my view right now is as we move into the back half that it appears to finally be getting more in the traditional sense, competitive but not elevated.","Mark Montagna \u2013 Avondale Partners","Okay. And then just as a follow up, when you were talking about competitor promotions, was that more heavily concentrated at discounters or was it grocery stores or drug stores or pretty evenly spread?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah, great question. I would say across the board. What happens is when one channel gets hot every other channel has to respond.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Meredith Adler of Barclays.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital","Good morning. A lot of my questions have been asked, but I think you guys have talked a little a bit about testing unique plan-o-grams for individual stores based on sort of local demographics and demand. Is that something you\u2019ve actually put in place and you\u2019re willing to talk about or is it too early?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah, it\u2019s a little early, but the primary driver of that is the lifecycle store. And that\u2019s the idea going at limited square feet. So we are going in and taking out categories that are not performing as well, expanding on the on the once that are, which gives us the opportunity to add more regional or local items. The sales results on the life cycle source Meredith are very good right now. We are very pleased, but a little too soon to lay it all on the table yet.","Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital","And do you think from what you are seeing there, that any of the things you\u2019ve done in the lifecycle remodels, whether it\u2019s the unique plan-o-grams or other things, have application to the maybe stores that aren't quite so small or quite so old?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah, absolutely. What this has allowed us to do is to experiment with different SKUs without having to make a much larger commitment. So, yes, the answer is yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin \u2013 Wolfe Research ","Thanks for taking my questions, Rick, I just want to get back to the environment. I think you said you are off to a good start. But if you had to look at the numbers and say, how much is what we are doing versus how much is just the ebb and flow of the consumer because it seems like they come out for events, maybe they are coming out for back to school, although back to school is very early this year and then they go back into hibernations. I guess I\u2019m trying to gauge you guys have a lot of balls in the air trying to drive your traffic and your comp. How much is you and how much is just this ebb and flow of a consumer that\u2019s manic depressive?","Richard Dreiling","I think that\u2019s a very fair question. The first thing I would say is you have to remember we\u2019ve introduced a lot of what we are calling affordable SKUs. Some of the pressure we put on the top sales line is the fact that we\u2019re selling an item at a $1 that we probably would have sold for a $1.5 or even $2 a year ago. Some of that is us and again I always come back to Scott, I believe this is a unit game and a transaction game. And we\u2019ve made a conscious decision to sell SKUs that we believe are affordable. And I think it\u2019s fair to say too that the customer is buying less. They are stretching that food dollar. I think they are coming out for events. I think that our performance around, I would look at you and tell you our performance around Memorial Day and July 4th was better than it\u2019s been in several years and we were there for the consumer with the right prices. Right now I would say it\u2019s probably -- some of it is maybe 50% a change in tactic for us where we are trying to sell lower value SKUs and getting them into that basket and probably a good 50% of it is the retreat on the consumer side.","Scott Mushkin \u2013 Wolfe Research ","That\u2019s perfect. I appreciate the color. Can I add just one more? I think you guys the flight healthcare just helping on the expense gross side. And I was wondering how sustainable is that as we get into 2015 with some more changes coming into healthcare law and other things? Is that something that we think we can continue to get leverage on or is that something that\u2019s going to fade?","Richard Dreiling","Where we are at right now our benefit savings, the team here is taking a really interesting tact in that we are really wellness focused. Even myself I have to talk to a wellness coach once a quarter that talks to me about, how much I\u2019m exercising, what I\u2019m eating, how I\u2019m doing with my weight and that program is actually going through the chain. And I think as silly as that sounds, I think that it has actually helped us. We have seen more enrollment. I think those are all positive signs. it\u2019s a little soon for me to forecast 2015. But I think we played a lot of really good pipe here that\u2019s helping us on that line.","Scott Mushkin \u2013 Wolfe Research","Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions and good luck, by the way with Family Dollar.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line John Heinbockel of Guggenheim.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Partners","Let me ask you start with the comp chronology, do you think that the drop off in June and July, you think that was largely competitive driven? And I ask that because some of the categories you mentioned seasonal looked a little disappointing given how good your stores looked. What\u2019s your take on that and do you think that\u2019s what happened there? Do you think in August have we now bounced back to where we were in May?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah, I think as I look at the summer seasonal number, yeah actually the seasonal, the summer seasonal was up 3.3%, 3.7% right in that window. There are other categories in there with seasonal that dragged the total number down. I\u2019m actually quite pleased with what our offering was and again major commitment to more affordable items. We are definitely feeling very good about where we are quarter to date. And most important thing -- I\u2019m sorry John, the most important thing is we are continuing to grow our share and we are continuing to grow our unit.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Partners","Okay, and then just as a follow up to that, what are you seeing early with States that have raised minimum wage? California did that July 1. There have been some other States. Are you yet seeing that flow through into better consumer behavior or when do you think that will happen?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah, I think it\u2019s a little soon yet, but I will tell you this. It makes sense to me that if you put more money in people\u2019s pockets it\u2019s going to translate in more sales to us. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little soon yet. We don\u2019t have enough store representation in California to get a really big read on that yet.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer of Raymond James","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Rick, in your prepared comments, you noted that your core consumer is just cutting back on purchases given their financial situation and that certainly seems to be evident when you look at sales trends for the industry. With that in mind, if you are successful in improving the sales productivity in the Family Dollar stores, let\u2019s $40 or $50 a square foot getting close to Dollar General standards, what kind of cannibalization would you expect to take place in that Dollar General store that may be only one shopping center away?","Richard Dreiling","Dan I really can\u2019t talk about that right now, but I will tell you that\u2019s all been taken into our analysis. And again, we feel pretty strong about what we are bringing to the table on the deal. So, I need to pass on that one for that.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","I wasn\u2019t really asking about the deal. I was just trying to -- if the industry is not growing, would you think that there would be some cannibalization?","Richard Dreiling","Again, I want to kind of stay away from that because it\u2019s kind of tied to the Family Dollar deal. And again I apologize, I just don\u2019t think I should answer that right now.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Okay. This may be a question you may not want to answer either, but in terms of your retirement plans and then you indicated during your prepared comments you\u2019d be willing to stay on through May of 2016, is there a search going on right now just as a contingency of if the Family Dollar situation doesn\u2019t play out the way you hope that it does?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah, right now -- I think that\u2019s a very fair question, but right now I\u2019m very optimistic of where all this is going to go. So again, we\u2019ll get back to that later on, right?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse","Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning guys. A couple of questions for you Rick. First one is related to urban stores versus rural stores. Just a question about really the model of both of them, and what I was hoping you could do is try to help us understand the differences between an urban store and a rural store in terms of how does productivity look? How do margins look? How do returns look? And is there really a large structural difference between the two models? Let\u2019s talk about you, for you as we think about an urban versus a rural store.","Richard Dreiling","Yeah I think that\u2019s a really fair question. Our rural stores tend to do very well. They operate at a lower volume rate than the urban stores and they tend to have a lower expense structure than the urban stores. Both stores tend to carry about the same margin in all honesty. So net-net, the overall performance of the two stores tends to be about the same. I would say the only difference between the two formats would be actually a couple things. Number one shrink would be higher in an urban environment than a suburban environment and you deal with more competitive pressure in the urban environment because there tends to be more choices. But overall at the end of the day our performance has been typically pretty even across the board.","Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse","Rick, do you think an urban store, whether it\u2019s in a city versus maybe like outer ring of a city for instance, does that create a difference?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah, I tend to look at -- we call the ones on the outer ring satellite city. That\u2019s more of suburbia versus urban and again we look at that a little bit different in the urban environment and suburbia would be right in between the two extremes.","Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay and then second question for you is on the gross margin and obviously traffic is important, and it\u2019s your focus. If we think about the current environment as maybe a little bit of a new normal, tougher consumer, this sort of trench warfare on, how do you get that extra dollar amongst the competitors. How do we think about your gross margin over the next few years for instance of this is what it is? This is, is it sustainable at the current level or do you think that we\u2019d be looking at ongoing investments in price and promotions?","David Tehle","I think as you look at it that you have to look at the pluses and the minuses. We still have a lot of confidence in our initiatives that we\u2019ve been talking about for the past few years, our private label and the things we are doing, some of the exciting things, the new items that we are adding, the private label and the growth that we are seeing there. Foreign sourcing continues to be strong and continues to be growing in terms of our focus there. We are focusing a little more on consumables and trying to be less China centric in terms of where we are bringing items in from. And then we\u2019ve mentioned shrink on this call earlier that we are starting to see some progress there through what we are doing with technology and process and in centers. Those are all positives.","Obviously we are going to stay true to EDLP and making sure that we are driving more units through the box. And we\u2019ve said this before ultimately that\u2019s the most important thing for us is staying true to who we are in EDLP and keeping growing our market shares and growing the units that we are selling through the individual stores. That will override everything else. We have initiatives in place that we believe can help us grow margin but ultimately it\u2019s going to depend on staying true to EDLP and making sure we continue to grow our share. And we will sacrifice gross margin to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Stasi of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stasi \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much for taking my questions. I wanted to ask you a bit more on the continued introduction of the $1 items. Can you give us a sense for what percentage of those are replacing some items that are already on the shelves or is it strictly being additionally added?","Richard Dreiling ","Yeah, Vince, those are all incremental SKUs. We have a category management process where we step back and I shouldn\u2019t say they are incremental. Something else probably came off in another category that wasn\u2019t moving and turning as fast. But for example in the soap set we or the chemical set we would have added SKUs taking it from somewhere else.","Vincent Stasi \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just on your $1 to $5 non-consumables and this is maybe a good combo question with that as well as well as the $1 items. What any do you think were in with that? Where can it go and as particularly on the $1 to $5 non-consumables do you guys foresee any change down the road in terms of mix of consumables versus non-consumables?","Richard Dreiling ","Vince, I would like to see the non-consumable mix start to increase. Obviously that\u2019s where the margin is in our business and the introduction of these $1 SKUs, $5 SKUs. I think we are going have more $1 SKUs for Christmas this year than we\u2019ve ever had. And they carry more margin all be it you sacrifice on the top line but you give the customer what they want. We are working very hard to get the non-consumable mix as a percentage of sales up.","Vincent Stasi \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Do you have any sense, Rick for where ultimately that could go?","Richard Dreiling ","I wish I could look at you and give you a definitive number. I just like to see it move north of last year for a quarter. I want to start there first.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray.","Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray","I know it's tough out there, but it's a nice growth in the discretionary category. I had a question on SG&A. I was wondering at the beginning of the year you guys had quantified about $45 million to $50 million of fall back and incentive comp in the Affordable Care Act. I was wondering if that dynamic was still in place because your SG&A leverage is still coming in a little better than we had expected?","David Tehle","That dynamic is still in place. Again if you look at this quarter that we are coming out of, we got some help from benefits, from healthcare. Our claims are being down. We talked a little bit about that and then our workers comp also gave us some help. Still staying with what we had said earlier in the year that the impact that team share Affordable Care and then that sale lease back that we did will have on SG&A. Certainly there may be some factors offsetting that, but those items are still out there."," Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay. And then I guess just thinking about that rolling forward, you've historically had seen 3% comps to get some leverage. It looks like that has come down even despite these headwinds. Are you now at maybe a lower run-rate on where you could begin to see on leverage?","David Tehle","No. We\u2019ve said 3.0 to 3.5 and I think 3.5 is probably still a good number. Again we had some things this quarter that definitely helped us, but I wouldn\u2019t come too far off of that 3.5 that we\u2019ve talked about traditionally.","Peter Keith \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thanks a lot. Good luck with the back half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Dan Binder of Jefferies and Company.","Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Company.","Good morning. It\u2019s good to see the two year comp accelerate as you lap the cigarette introduction last year. I'm curious if you can quantify what that contributed to comps this quarter as we've lapped that initiative.","Richard Dreiling ","Yeah. I would tell you probably, we haven\u2019t really let that out but the contribution to the comps is de-accelerating at a significant rate and the important thing is that comps -- that cigarettes are still comping positive.","Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Right. Okay. You mentioned earlier that the summer seasonal was strong but maybe some other areas were soft. I don't know if you have any other color around those other areas and what the opportunity might be to improve on that.","Richard Dreiling ","It was primarily sundries house hold type items that as we said we are working a little bit hard on to get those going. I was pleased with apparel. I\u2019d like to reinforce that we had men\u2019s and ladies and children\u2019s, boys particularly were all solid. And one of the other things too Dan, believe it or not in the seasonal category is magazines, and the whole magazine world is going through a significant restructuring now. And we are not as in stock on that particular category, magazines and books as we have in the past. So the seasonal number is more than just good old fashioned summer seasonal stuff.","Dan Binder \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Okay. I don't know if you'll be willing to answer this because it is a little bit related to Family Dollar, but I was just curious given all the work you've done on real estate, how many sort of two player markets would you say are out there today where you don't have another major competitor besides a dollar store?","Richard Dreiling ","And again, I apologize. It\u2019s a little soon for me to talking about those things. So all I would say is we are continuing to work and explore our options","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","I guess my question is also on the promotional environment. Clearly it's intense. It seems to be increasingly volatile, changing on what sounded like a week by week basis given your comments about that. So I guess my question is, what expectations have you kind of built in regarding the broader competitive environment into your guidance for the holiday season where we know it's always a more promotional timeframe?","Richard Dreiling ","Yeah, I think that as we move through the back half of the year, I think the competitive environment will be heightened, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to irrational. I think it appears to me people -- someone else actually brought it up on the call. I think the activity in the consumer is more focused around certain specific events. And I think Labor Day and we are prepared for a pretty intense Labor Day but then we think things will probably settle down for a period of time. We are ready to go for Black Friday. We\u2019ve got our Christmas plan in place and I see no deviation from what we have laid out.","Scot Ciccarelli \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","If the environment is always more heightened around the holidays and you brought up Black Friday and obviously Christmas after that, isn't that where it's most likely to get irrational?","Richard Dreiling ","Yeah, but I think right now we have a plan in place that\u2019s a little -- we\u2019ve gone through two quarters of this and we have a plan in place now that should be able to anticipate that if it\u2019s going to happen. That\u2019s why we\u2019re pretty confident that the back half margin is going to be pretty flat to last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Just wanted to follow-up on the top line. As you did reiterate or you provided adjusted full-year guidance for same-store sales up 3% to 3.5% after comping I believe a 1.8% in the first half and with the tobacco comp still positive, but decelerating. If you can just maybe help us understand which categories you expect to see the acceleration, just maybe provide a little more color on the initiatives in consumables or how we should think about maybe the discretionary side of the store with apparel and home, just so we are more confident and comfortable with the back half view.","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. As I\u2019m looking at this, Paul, I expect the acceleration to be broad based. I\u2019m particularly looking for food, chemical and paper particularly to begin to accelerate as we move through the back half of the year. I think that we will see comps accelerate as we move across the two quarters, taking into account we are up against a very soft fourth quarter last year. What is encouraging me right is the increase in traffic and the increase in units and particularly the increase in unit share. And why we have sacrificed some sales in order to sell more SKUs that are more affordable, we believe that the traffic is going to overcome that as we move through the quarter.","The attachment rate on cigarettes continues to be at or above what we thought it was going to be and I think we are very well positioned. I\u2019m very excited about what we are going to do from November to January 1 in particular. By the way, I forgot about we had the coupon program rolling out too, which is going to allow our customer to be able to extract savings out of the newspaper without having to click coupons and then be downloaded to their phone and they can use as many as they want when they get to the store.","Paul Trussell \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you. That's very helpful. Just in terms of gross margin, we have now had a few quarters in a row of contraction in the 50 to 60 basis point range. Could you just help clarify what is embedded in the guidance in the second half? I know you're lapping tobacco so that should certainly help along with the private label in shrink initiatives that you spoke to. But just clarify to what extent gross margins are expected to decline or actually turn flat to positive as we move forward through the balance of the year? Thank you.","David Tehle","I\u2019ll take a shot in and then certainly Rick may want to say more. We are not giving a specific number on gross margin. We do see considerable improvement from what we saw from the first half of the year, and you\u2019re right one of the big factors is lapping tobacco. We also see the back half year being less promotional, than what we saw in the front half of the year so that has an impact also on it. So we are anticipating significant improvement on a basis point basis from what we saw the first half of the year.","Richard Dreiling","I would say too, Paul, that when I look at the margin in the second quarter particularly, a lot of that was self-inflicted by our decision to get a little more promotional particularly on CST but not give up on our everyday low prices. And we didn\u2019t raise any prices to offset that promotional activity. And I\u2019m actually thinking based on what we with customer traffic and unit it was a wise decision.","Paul Trussell \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Could you at all quantify the self-infliction versus the tobacco drag to 2Q gross margins?","Richard Dreiling","I would rather not do that and I apologize.","Mary Winn Pilkington","We put (inaudible) in the press release as well.","Richard Dreiling","Promotional activity was certainly on the top.","David Tehle","Right, the highest. Yes","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Mann of Johnson Rice.","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice & Company","Good morning, Rick. Thank you for taking my question. I'm curious, when you talk about some of the affordable initiative that you're doing, can you clarify the margin impact of those items as you accelerate that? Are they at the same INU or is there some degradation there?","Richard Dreiling","Good question. They actually tend to carry more margin at the end of the day. Now you sacrifice the sale. You have to look at a little like private brands. When the consumer buys a private brand, you give up some sales but you make more margin. The $1 SKUs that we\u2019ve adding are actually carrying more margin.","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice & Company","Okay. That's great clarification. And then on the legacy remodel program, any more commentary you can give on the kind of lift you're seeing there and the opportunity to perhaps accelerate that into 2015? How much can you ramp that up?","Richard Dreiling","I think the --rather than getting into a specific, I would say the lift is significantly above the average that we are running in the chain right now. And our goal is we think we have up to 1,500 stores that we could do. We have 250 done. As we move through 2015 I think as this continues to play out you\u2019ll probably hear us talking about accelerating that.","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice & Company","And then one last question. The inventory growth coming out of the quarter, it seems like you're expecting similar comp increase to that growth, but I want to make sure. Any additional clearance carryover versus last year that we need to think about?","David Tehle","Our turns right now, the way we calculate them are at 4.8 and the same as it has been the past three quarters. Total inventory increased a little over 10% on a 7.5% sales increase. We like to see that inventory increase about the same as sales. On a store basis we are up 3, 7, 4, somewhere in that range. Clearly new SKUs tobacco presentation levels, a variety of reasons. The bulk of it is core inventory. So that\u2019s just where stand on inventory right now.","Richard Dreiling","The other thing I\u2019d like to throw out there, I\u2019m sure you guys are aware there\u2019s an import strike scare out there. And we made a conscious decision to bring some of our holiday merchandise in a little sooner.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Brandy, I have that it\u2019s top of the hour. So unfortunately we\u2019re going to cut the call off now. But everyone thank you very much for joining us. If you have any questions, Emmett, Joe and I are around so please feel free to give us a call, and thank you for your time and attention today.","Operator","Thank you.

Today is Thursday, August 29, 2019. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning.","Now I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Donny Lau, Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development and the Interim Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Lau, you may begin your conference.","Donny Lau","Thank you, Priya, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and John Garratt, our CFO. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at investor.dollargeneral.com under News & Events.","Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our strategies, plans, goals or beliefs about future matters, including, but not limited to, our fiscal 2019 financial guidance and real estate plans. Forward-looking statements can be identified because they are limited to statements of historical fact or use words such as may, will, should, could, would, can, believe, anticipate, expect, assume, intend, outlook, estimate, guidance, plan, opportunity, long term, potential or goal and similar expressions.","These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from our expectations and projections, including but not limited to, those identified in our earnings release issued this morning, under Risk Factors in our 2018 Form 10-K filed on March 22, 2019 and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date.

Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which as I mentioned, is posted on investor.dollargeneral.com under News & Events. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up question if necessary.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, Donny, and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our second quarter results, driven by strong performance on both the top and bottom lines. The quarter was highlighted by same-store sales growth of 4%, including an increase in average basket size and another quarter of meaningful traffic growth. Our results this quarter were fueled by solid execution across many fronts, including category management, merchandise innovation, store operations and continued progress with our strategic initiatives.","In addition, we remain focused on disciplined cost control, which resulted in another quarter of solid earnings growth. Notably our second quarter comp performance represents an increase of 7.7% on a two-year stack basis, which is the highest in 23 quarters and speaks to the underlying strength of the business. Given our first half performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2019. John will provide those details during his remark.","In short, we are executing well against both our operating and strategic priorities and believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth as we move forward. Now let's recap some of the top line results for the second quarter. Net sales increased 8.4% to $7.0 billion compared to net sales of $6.4 billion in the second quarter of 2018. We are particularly pleased with the continued strong performance of our new stores and sustained positive sales momentum in our mature store base.","Once again, this quarter, our highly consumable market share trends in syndicated data continued to exhibit strength with mid to high single-digit share growth in both units and dollars over the 4, 12, 24 and 52 week periods ending July 27, 2019. Our same-store sales increase during the quarter was driven by strong performance in both consumables and non-consumables sales. Our non-consumable sales growth was driven by positive results in seasonal and in home. These quarterly results further validate the belief that our focus on our operating priorities is working and that we are pursuing the right strategies to create meaningful long-term shareholder value.","We continue to believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and are advancing our goal of further differentiating the Dollar General business from the rest of discount retail landscape. Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to take the opportunity to congratulate Jeff Owen on his recent promotion to Chief Operating Officer. As was announced this morning, Jeff is assuming the responsibility for store operations, merchandising and supply chain. As a large and growing retailer, we believe this alignment further strengthens the company and positions us well for continued future growth.","Jeff has served as our EVP of Store Operations since 2015. During his time in that role Dollar General added more than 3,500 stores and increased sales by over 35%. Prior to serving as EVP, Jeff spent more than 20 years with this company in increasing roles of responsibility beginning with us as a store manager and eventually rising to SVP of Store Operations. I also like to congratulate Steve Sunderland on his promotion to EVP of Store Operations, where he will oversee operations of our nearly 16,000 stores across the country. Steve joined Dollar General team in 2014 as SVP of Store Operations, where he has led approximately 8,000 stores and nearly 70,000 employees. Steve brings more than 30 years of retail operations experience to the role and I know our teams value his leadership.","I'm very proud of both Jeff and Steve and grateful for all they have done for this company. I am confident they are the right leaders for these positions and I look forward to working with them in their new roles as we continue to drive long-term growth at Dollar General.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Garratt","Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Now that Todd has taken us through a few highlights of the quarter, let me take you through some of the important financial details of the second quarter. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 30.8% in the second quarter, an increase of 13 basis points. This increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of net sales and higher initial markups on inventory purchases.","These factors were partially offset by higher shrink, increased distribution costs, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category and sales of lower-margin products, comprising a higher proportion of sales within the consumables category. We benefited this quarter from a reduction -- continued reduction in promotional markdown activity, following targeted increase during the fourth quarter of 2018. We continue to believe these targeted actions drove loyalty and contributed to additional share gains as evidenced by our strong sales results during the first half of 2019.","SG&A, as a percent of sales, was 22.5%, an increase of 32 basis points. This increase was driven by expenses of $31 million or 44 basis points in the quarter relating to significant legal matters. Excluding these Significant Legal Expenses, we leveraged SG&A expense with adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales of 22.1% or a decrease of 12 basis points. These results also reflect an increase in expenses for store supplies and were partially offset by lower utilities costs as a percent of sales and reductions in benefits costs and workers' compensation and general liability expenses.","As previously discussed, we are investing in our four strategic initiatives this year. I'm pleased to report that we're making great progress on each and we remain excited about the long-term transformative potential of these initiatives. Year-to-date through the second quarter we have invested $19 million in SG&A expense, attributable to our strategic initiatives. We continue to believe these investments position us well to deliver meaningful benefits to the business over both the intermediate and longer term.","Moving down the income statement, operating profit for the second quarter increased 5.9% to $578 million compared to $545 million in the second quarter of 2018. Adjusted operating profit for the second quarter, which excludes the legal expenses I mentioned earlier, increased 11.6% to $609 million compared to $545 million in the prior year period. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.9% and compares to 21.5% in the second quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter increased 8.6% to $1.65. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter, which excludes the after-tax impact of the previously mentioned legal expenses, increased 14.5% to $1.74. Overall, we are pleased with the balanced performance the team delivered during the quarter, resulting in strong profit growth.","Turning now to our balance sheet, which remained strong. Merchandise inventories were $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 13.4% overall and an increase of 7.5% on a per-store basis. As previously discussed, we implemented a change to our inventory replenishment process in the first quarter, which is enabling us to support even higher levels of on-shelf availability. And while as anticipated this change is resulting in higher inventory levels overall, we continue to believe this change better positions us to support and drive continued sales growth.","In addition to our inventory replenishment efforts, we are implementing enhanced processes focused on improving the in-stock performance in stores that do not meet our standards. I'm pleased to report our efforts drove a 20% improvement in on-shelf availability, in targeted stores during the quarter and we believe, we can continue to drive improvements in this area as we move ahead.","Overall, we continue to believe, our inventory is in great shape and remain focused over time on driving inventory growth that is in line with or below our sales growth. Year-to-date through the second quarter, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $1.1 billion. Total capital expenditures through the first half of 2019 were $293 million and included planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, continued investments and construction of our Amsterdam New York distribution center and spending related to our strategic initiatives.","During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for $185 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $82 million. At the end of the second quarter, the remaining repurchase authorization was $961 million. Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth.","We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders, through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately three times adjusted debt to EBITDA.","I'll close with an update on our annual guidance for fiscal year 2019. As you know, upon its effective date, the proposed List 4 tariff recently published by the U.S. Trade Representative will expand the list of products that are currently subject to tariffs at a now expected rate of 15%. In addition, tariff rates on List 1 through 3 are expected to increase to 30%, up from 25% effective October 1.","Over the past several quarters, our teams have been diligently working to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and our business. As a reminder, our efforts are focused on four key areas, continual negotiations with our vendors, product substitutions, product reengineering and country of origin diversification. We intend to continue these efforts to do all we can to minimize the impact to our customers and remain focused on our everyday low-price strategy to provide our customers with the value they need and have come to expect from Dollar General.","Now as you may recall, the anticipated impact of the May 10 tariff rate increase was included in our prior full year guidance which we provided on May 30. Our updated guidance today, reflects the anticipated impact of the expected tariff rate increase on List 1 through 3, the proposed List 4 tariffs and tariffs previously implemented. Despite these incremental headwinds, we are raising our full year financial guidance, primarily as a result of our strong first half performance.","For fiscal year 2019, we now expect net sales growth of approximately 8% and same-store sales growth to be in the low to mid-3% range. We are increasing our expectations for operating profit growth to approximately 5% to 7% and expect adjusted operating profit growth of approximately 6% to 8%. And we are raising our outlook for diluted earnings per share to the range of $6.36 to $6.51 or adjusted diluted EPS of $6.45 to $6.60.","Our adjusted operating profit growth and adjusted diluted EPS guidance exclude the impact of legal expenses I noted earlier. Both our GAAP and adjusted EPS guidance assumes an estimated effective annual tax rate of approximately 22% to 22.5%. Finally, our fiscal year 2019 outlook for real estate projects, capital spending and share repurchases remains unchanged.","Let me now provide some additional context on our current expectations. First, our guidance does not contemplate additional tariff increases in tariff rates or the expansion of products subject to tariffs beyond those which are either, currently in effect included in the List 4 proposal or incorporated in the expected 5% tariff rate increase on List 1 through 3. Additionally, it does not reflect any tariff-related impacts to broader consumer spending.","With regards to gross margin, we now expect our rate improvement for the second half to be roughly in line with Q2 when compared on a year-over-year basis. Relative to our previous expectation of quarterly improvements in the gross margin rate year-over-year comparison throughout the year, our revised outlook is primarily driven by our strong Q2 performance as well as the anticipated impact of both the List 4 tariff proposal and the expected tariff rate increase on List 1 through 3.","In terms of SG&A, we now expect to invest approximately $55 million on our strategic initiative this fiscal year, the majority of which will be on our DG Fresh and Fast Track initiatives. We continue to expect this spending will increase sequentially through the third and fourth quarters.","In summary, I am pleased with our first half results and excited about what's still to come as we look at the back half of the year. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing in initiatives for longer-term growth. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial goals to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong operating cash flow and long-term shareholder value.","With that I will turn the call back over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, John. As I've shared with you over the past several quarters, we're investing in and building momentum behind certain strategic initiatives that we believe will drive strong sales and profit growth in the years ahead. I want to take the next few minutes to update you on the progress we are making.","Starting with our nonconsumable initiative or NCI. In 2018, we launched a new and expanded assortment in key nonconsumable categories including home domestics, housewares, party and occasion. I'm pleased to report that the NCI offering continues to resonate with customers as evidenced by strong sales performance across our enhanced product categories. Importantly, this performance is contributing to improvements in both sales and gross margin rate in these stores.","In addition to higher nonconsumable sales, we are also seeing a positive halo effect in consumable sales. Overall, remodels that include NCI delivered greater sales lift and improved gross margin rates compared to traditional remodels. These results reinforce our belief that NCI can be meaningful to our sales line and a margin driver as we move ahead. The NCI offering was available in more than 1,500 stores at the end of the second quarter and we plan to expand the offering to a total of approximately 2,400 stores by the end of 2019.","And while the NCI store count is still relatively small compared to our overall store base, we are realizing additional benefits by leveraging learnings from these stores. Specifically, we are incorporating select NCI products throughout the broader store base, resulting in positive sales and margin contributions across the entire chain.","Turning now to DG Fresh, which we introduced earlier this year. As a reminder, DG Fresh is a strategic multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods such as dairy deli and frozen products. This assortment currently represents approximately 8% of our total sales. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product costs on our frozen and refrigerated items, thereby enhancing gross margin.","And while it's still early, we are very pleased with the progress and gross margin improvements we are seeing. Two other important goals of DG Fresh are to drive on-time delivery and higher in-stock levels. For example, we have historically seen about a 10-point gap in in-stock levels between our dry goods and our fresh products. We believe we can close the gap with DG Fresh which is [Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen please standby.","Todd Vasos","Okay. And I apologize we dropped the line somehow. I'll start back with two other important goals for DG Fresh are to drive on-time delivery and higher in-stock levels. For example, we have historically seen about a 10-point gap in our in-stock levels between our dry goods and our fresh products. We believe we can close the gap with DG Fresh which is supported by results in our early phases of the rollout.","In addition to gross margin and in-stock benefits, DG Fresh will eventually allow us to control our own destiny on assortment in these categories. This could include a wider selection of both national and private brands as well as an enhanced offering for our better for you items.","And while produce is not included in our initial rollout plans, we believe DG Fresh could provide a potential path forward to expanding our produce offerings to more stores in the future.","We began shipping from our first DG Fresh facility in Pottsville, Pennsylvania in January and are now shipping from two additional DG Fresh facilities in Clayton, North Carolina; and Atlanta, Georgia. I'm also pleased to report that our fourth DG Fresh facility in Westville, Indiana is scheduled to begin shipping in the next few weeks.","In total, we are now self-distributing to more than 3,500 stores, an increase of approximately 2,700 stores from the end of Q1. And with an anticipated opening of our fourth facility, we remain on track to capture benefits from DG Fresh in approximately 5,000 stores by year end.","In short, we are very excited about the early results we are seeing from this initiative as well as the long-term potential benefits it can deliver for our customers and our business. We continue to believe it can be as accretive as early as 2020.","With respect to our digital initiative, our efforts remain focused on deploying technology to further complement the customer in-store experience. In turn we believe digital can drive additional traffic as well as increase in basket size. In fact, our digitally engaged customers check out with average baskets twice as large as the company average.","Our digital efforts continue to be based on the needs of our core customer. Most recently we introduced a new shopping list feature representing yet another enhancement to our Dollar General mobile app. This tool not only allows customers to build and save shopping lists, but makes it even easier for them to save money through digital coupon push notifications and comparable private brand product suggestions.","We also continue to innovate within our DG GO! app. As a reminder, this app allows customers to use their phone to scan items as they shop; see a running total of the items in their basket using our Cart Calculator tool; and then skip the line by using DG GO! checkout which is currently available in more than 250 stores.","We plan to consolidate DG GO! into one primary Dollar General app in Q3 of 2019, furthering our efforts of delivering an even more frictionless shopping experience to our customers.","We have previously noted that our customers are using Cart Calculator functionality frequently as a budgeting and optimization tool even when they're not using DG GO! to checkout. Based on this insight, we have made Cart Calculator available in approximately 12,000 stores as we continue to leverage customer insights and innovation to deliver on our customers' needs.","Looking ahead, we remain focused on leveraging our current digital infrastructure and Dollar General app to further enhance our value and convenient proposition for our consumers. Our plans include a pilot of DG pickup in the second half which is our buy online pick up in-store offering and we are excited about the additional opportunities that lie ahead. Our digital efforts will continue to be tailored specifically to the Dollar General customer and our important component of our long-term growth strategy.","Moving now to an update on Fast Track. As a reminder, Fast Track is centered on increasing labor productivity in our stores enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability.","There are two key components to Fast Track. First is streamlining the stocking process in our stores through rolltainer optimization and with even more shelf-ready packaging. These efforts should reduce the amount of time spent stocking shelves during the truck unloading and restocking process throughout the week.","We continue to make good progress with incorporating more shelf-ready packaging and I'm pleased to note that we are well ahead of schedule with our rolltainer optimization efforts.","In fact we have completed sorting one half of our distribution centers and are encouraged by the early results including positive feedback from our store teams. Our goal is to complete the resorting process in all remaining distribution centers by year's end.","The second key component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which we believe can further improve speed of checkout, while also reducing the amount of labor hours needed in stores for this activity. Our goal remains to pilot self-checkout in select stores in the back half of this year.","Overall, we are making great progress on our strategic initiatives enabled through focused and disciplined execution. We believe we are an innovative leader in our channel and we are well-positioned to capture market share in a changing retail environment.","Along with our strategic initiatives, we remain committed to our four operating priorities. Let us take the last few minutes to update you on a few of those efforts. Our first operating priority is to drive profitable sales growth. The team has developed a comprehensive plan to drive continued growth with several ongoing initiatives.","Let me quickly highlight just a few. Starting with our cooler door expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative, we began our cooler expansion efforts in earnest in 2013 and believe we continue to have ample runway with this important program. During the first half, we added more than 20,000 cooler doors across the store base. In total, we expect to install over 40,000 cooler doors this year as we continue to build on our multiyear track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales.","In addition to being a great sales and traffic driver, the expansion of our cooler door footprint over the years has provided the scale necessary to enable DG Fresh. Importantly our DG Fresh learnings and success to-date, we are increasing the capacity of our cooler doors.","More specifically, we have recently begun incorporating higher-capacity coolers into our real estate program. These coolers provide over 45% more holding capacity than traditional coolers, which will allow us to expand our assortment offering by approximately 25%, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver a wider product selection.","Going forward, these higher-capacity coolers will be included in the majority of all new remodel, relocated stores, and new stores. We believe these efforts better position us to capture additional sales opportunities as we move ahead, including those associated with DG Fresh.","Turning now to our private brands, which continues to be an important area of focus for us. Our goal is to drive overall category awareness and adoption with our customers through improved and more impactful displays, consistent messaging in-store, as well as across print and digital media, and enhanced quality perception. I'm pleased with our continued progress across these fronts which contributed to our strong second quarter performance.","Our Good & Smart brand is especially popular with our customers and remains an important part of our better for you offering. As a reminder, this product line provides customers with a variety of better for you options at low prices and is now available in approximately 3,900 stores with plans for further expansion as we move forward.","Another key contributor to our growing private brand popularity is Believe, our new and aspirational cosmetic line. With all items priced at $5 and below, the quality and value perception associated with this brand is generating tremendous buzz and we are pleased with the early results. We are also seeing positive results from our recent rebranding efforts with our Studio Selection line within the health and beauty category, and we believe customers will be equally responsive to our most recent rebrand Gentle Steps, which is our new baby products line.","Overall, private brands remain an important part of our ongoing strategy to drive profitable sales growth, and we are excited by the momentum we are seeing across our portfolio.","Finally, I want to touch on our recent partnerships with Western Union and FedEx. Western Union is now available chain-wide offering our customers the ability to send and receive cash in nearly 16,000 convenient Dollar General locations. Building on the Western Union service is our recent partnership with FedEx, which we announced during Q2. This partnership will provide our customers with convenient access to FedEx pickup and drop-off services at their local Dollar General store. We plan to roll out this service to over 1,500 locations in Q3 expanding to a total of more than 8,000 stores by the end of 2020, further advancing our long track record of serving rural communities.","By further enhancing our convenient proposition, with new services that our customers want we believe both offerings can become traffic drivers over time. As you hear from us often the customer is at the center of everything we do. These are great examples of being able to further leverage our unique real-estate footprint to increase access to the solutions our customers want and the communities we call home.","Beyond these sales driving initiatives, we are continuing our efforts to enhance gross margin. In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with NCI, DG Fresh and private brand efforts reducing shrink remains an important opportunity for us. We rolled out approximately 2,000 additional Electronic Article Surveillance units in the second quarter bringing the total number of stores with EAS to approximately 12,600. Given the success, we continue to see with this program, we are accelerating our efforts.","In fact, we now expect to incorporate EAS in all stores by year's end, which represents an increase of about 6,000 units compared to our previously target of approximately 3,000 units for the year. We also continue to pursue distribution and transportation efficiencies to support our profitable sales growth. Reducing stem miles is an important contributor to these efforts and the successful opening of our Longview distribution center earlier this year is expected to drive additional efficiencies as we move ahead.","In addition, the construction of our distribution center in Amsterdam, New York is progressing nicely and we anticipate it will begin shipping later this year. We are also accelerating the expansion of our private fleet, which now intend to add more than 100 tractors this year up from our previous goal of 75 tractors bringing our total overall fleet to approximately 300 units by year's end.","Finally, while tariff impact mitigation is at the forefront of our global merchandising efforts as we noted earlier foreign sourcing remains a long-term gross margin opportunity. Our goals include increasing penetration as well as diversifying countries from which we source. In fact, we have already reduced our sourcing exposure to China this year alone by approximately 7% and we continue to lay the foundation for ongoing success in these efforts.","Our second priority is catching growth opportunities. Our best-in-class real-estate team continues to deliver strong results and our proven high-return low-risk model for real-estate growth continues to be a core strength of the business. Our real-estate model continues to focus on five metrics that have served us well in evaluating thousands of new stores in recent years. These metrics include new store productivity, actual sales performance, rate of return cannibalization, and the payback period.","Each of these metrics continue to meet or exceed our expectations, reinforcing our belief that new store growth is the best use of our capital. In addition to new store growth, our remodel and relocation program continues to be an important part of our real estate strategy. This year, we plan to open 975 new stores, remodel 1,000 of our mature stores and relocate approximately 100 units. We remain on track to achieve these goals by the end of the year.","During the first half, we opened 489 new stores; remodeled 653 stores, including 254 stores in the Dollar General Traditional Plus or DGTP; remodeled and relocated 46 stores. We also added produce in 64 stores, bringing the total number of stores which carry produce to approximately 550. As a reminder, a traditional remodel delivers a 4% to 5% comp lift on average. This compares to an average of 10% to 15% comp lift for a DGTP remodel, which is a traditional store format with expanded cooler count. And when we are able to add produce to a DGTP remodel, it delivers comps at the higher end of the 10% to 15% range. Overall, our real estate pipeline remains robust and we are excited about the continued growth opportunities ahead.","Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator. A cost-control mindset is pervasive throughout the organization and it is an important part of our culture. We have a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions.","We continue to focus our efforts on reducing existing costs where possible, through a zero-based budgeting process. I'm pleased with the team's efforts this quarter, which helped to mitigate the impact of the investments made in our strategic initiatives and contributed to the leverage in adjusted SG&A expense that John noted earlier. In addition to generating significant cost savings to date this process also produced other meaningful initiatives, including Fast Track which we believe can significantly reduce costs over time as well as our recent partnerships with Western Union and FedEx and the income associated with these service offerings.","Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage. As a growing retailer we continue to create new jobs in the communities we call home. And for those associates already on the team this growth is generating many opportunities for career advancement. In fact, more than 12,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes and we continue to innovate on the development opportunities we can offer our teams including continued expansion of our private fleet and those associated with DG Fresh.","We believe our continued engagement with our employees is the most effective way to understand how we can continue to support them. Importantly, our strong employee engagement metrics continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. In addition, we analyze a variety of metrics to ensure we remain positioned to attract and retain talent. These metrics include store manager turnover which continues to trend better than last year's all-time record low.","We also continue to be pleased with our applicant flows and time-to-fill open positions, reaffirming our belief we continue to be an employer of choice in the communities we serve. We held our annual leadership meeting in Nashville last week and I was once again amazed by the energy and dedication on display from more than 1,500 leaders of our company from across the country. Our time together each year reinforces for me how powerfully the Serving Others culture is ingrained in our people.","In closing, we are excited about our strong position midway through the year. Our first half results demonstrate strong execution across a variety of fronts, and I am proud of the team's performance. We have many exciting projects and initiatives underway to continue driving strong growth through the rest of 2019 and over the long-term. As a mature retailer in growth mode, we believe we are uniquely positioned to continue delivering value and convenience to our customers and long-term value for our shareholders.","I want to offer my sincere thanks to each of our approximately 141,000 employees across the company for their commitment to serving our customers and communities and I look forward to working together to deliver a strong second half.","With that, operator we would now like to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Between you and your Dollar Store multi-price point competitor, you posted some of the best comps we've seen in a while, particularly on a multi-year stack basis. So, Todd, do you think that this is the right economy for your model? Or is what you're experiencing just more a function of all the various initiatives that you have in place right now like improving on-shelf availability by 20%?","Todd Vasos","Yes. Michael, we've said for many, many years and we continue to believe that this model works great in good times and in not-so-good times or even bad times. I tell you, the success that we're seeing is really -- and I'm really proud of the teams from our merchandising to operations, the supply chain teams, to delivering on both our shorter-term initiatives and our longer-term strategic initiatives.","I would tell you, we continue to see a bright future and runway ahead of us on our top line and we will continue to execute -- and which is one of our strengths, to execute at a high level these initiatives. We believe, we've got the right initiatives to drive sales into the future.","Michael Lasser","And would that mean that, Todd, your implied guidance for the back half does look like it -- would suggest that comps will slow a little bit? Is that based on what you're seeing now? Or is there any other factor that would drive a slowdown in the business?","John Garratt","Mike, this is John. I'll tell you that we feel great about the business fundamentals and the continued profitable sales growth we delivered in Q2. We raised our outlook based on the strong year-to-date performance, but there's a lot of year left. There's tougher laps in the back half and there's some uncertainty around the macro environment, but we feel comfortable with the guidance provided and feel great about the way the business is performing.","Todd Vasos","And also, Michael, just remember, we've got six less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year and I also want to remind everybody the snap pull-forward last year from Q1 into Q4 was about 70 basis points. So that will be a headwind in the Q4 time frame this year. As John indicated, we believe we have adequately put all that into what we believe is our pretty strong guidance for the back half of the year.","Michael Lasser","And, Todd, you were helpful to provide the number that you've reduced your exposure to China by 7%. Where does the total overall percent reside right now?","Todd Vasos","Yes. It's no secret, right? I mean, those moves have been in effect for -- or underway for many months now. And in other parts of Southeast Asia, Mexico and other place that we've seen some success, so we continue to diversify country of origin.","The great thing is, we've had boots on the ground in Mexico, Vietnam, Cambodia and many other Southeast Asian countries, including India as well, for many, many years and so we're just leveraging that capability to an even greater -- a greater time right now with these tariffs and the uncertainty around those.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. Congrats on a great quarter and nice execution.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Matthew Boss","So, John, maybe on the gross margin, can you help walk through the drivers behind the inflection back to the second quarter gross margin expansion? As we look ahead, what inning are we in today as we think about the gross margin opportunity related to DG Fresh and your non-consumables initiative? And just any way to help size up the multi-year gross margin opportunity that may be tied to these initiatives, I think, would be really helpful.","John Garratt","Well, thank you, Matthew. I'll start by saying, we feel great about the balanced Q2 performance, with the strong top line, while enhancing our margin 13 basis points over last year. If you recall back, as we said we would, we continued to be more targeted in promotional activity, leveraging the tools we put in place to be more efficient on the spend to get more bang for the buck, as you saw, delivering strong comps and traffic, while being more efficient with that spend.","We're also really excited about what we're seeing from the impact of new initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI. We're seeing the impact of that and that will scale as we go on. We said in our prepared comments, that we expect rate improvement in the second half to be roughly in line with Q2 compared on a year-over-year basis.","And while, there continues to be headwinds in our environment, we believe we have opportunities to increase margins over time. As these initiatives scale, they'll be a bigger and bigger impact on our margin. And we have a lot of other levers at our disposal.","The team did a great job on category management. We see continued opportunity to increase foreign sourcing penetration. As we talked about in our prepared comments, there's a lot of exciting things going on with private label that can help increase that penetration. There's a lot of opportunities to increase supply chain efficiencies.","The team did a great job last year mitigating the impact to that. We're in more stable environment now and there's a lot of leverage there. We have great support from our vendor community and we just believe we're making the right investments to grow operating margin over the long term and believe we have a lot of other levers at our disposal that we've made great trade-offs over time.","Matthew Boss","That's great. And then, just a follow-up on the expense front. How best to think about SG&A dollar growth versus sales in the back half of the year. Maybe what's the efficiency opportunity you see from Fast Track? And any obstacles you see to returning to the 2.5% to 3% fixed cost hurdle as we move to next year?","John Garratt","Yes. There too, we're very proud of the first half performance, both Q2 and first half. If you exclude the impact of the legal charge, we leveraged our SG&A while investing $19 million year-to-date in SG&A. As we mentioned in our prepared comments, we're accelerating the spend a little bit, $55 million this year versus the previous $50 million estimate and that's really a reflection of accelerating investments in key strategic initiatives like DG Fresh and Fast Track.","As we've said, there is some front-end pressure associated with that. There are some start-up costs that pressure SG&A, but we like to look more broadly at operating profit. And as you look at operating profit, we really believe that these initiatives over time will not just enhance sales, but improve our operating profit over the long term.","So we have to work through the start-up expenses. We said that as we go through the year that the expenditures, I guess, these initiatives will grow and the majority of which is against DG Fresh and Fast Track. But we're also seeing the benefits of the scale as well, such as, we get into next year we still expect these to be accretive as early as next year.","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of luck.","Todd Vasos","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. So a little bit of a follow-up on the gross margin. In the prepared comments you said it should -- Fresh could be accretive as early as next year. I wanted to ask what the gating factor is on the timing and the magnitude of that.","Todd Vasos","As you look at DG Fresh, we are squarely focused on delivering and executing at a very high level. And I would tell you that we're very, very encouraged in what we see. We're getting the cost of goods savings we expected with the 3,500 initial stores that we've rolled out and we still feel that it's going to be accretive as early as 2020.","Again, we're already starting to see some of this. It was asked earlier what inning are you in, I would tell you we just got up to the plate and I think we just hit a good solid double or triple in the first quarter of this DG Fresh rollout. So, I think, we got a lot more opportunity ahead of us and it should benefit us both on the sales and gross margin lines as we move forward.","Simeon Gutman","And I think the, as early as 2020 comment, so it sounds like it's going well so far. I guess you need to do more -- a higher percentage of the chain. But if things continue to go as planned, it sounds like that's going to be the inflection point into next year as far as becoming gross margin accretive. Is that fair?","Todd Vasos","Yes. I think that's the way to look at it. With 3,500 stores against our 16,000-or-so store base right now, it's the law of numbers. And we'll be up to 5,000 by the end of this year and we don't see that slowing as we've indicated. And so, we believe that as we move into 2020 it will definitely be accretive.","Simeon Gutman","And just -- and, I guess, still sticking to gross margin, is the magnitude of the benefit you're seeing in the initial rollouts of it, is it -- how is it playing relative to your expectations?","John Garratt","Yes. As we convert items, as we convert stores, it is right where we thought it would be in terms of the cost savings, that is substantial cost savings that, as we said, as we scale that, will be very impactful to helping our gross margin.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. Thanks for all the color. Take care.","Todd Vasos","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Also, congrats on a really strong quarter.","Todd Vasos","Thank you. ","Rupesh Parikh","So maybe to start out, I was just curious to get your thoughts latest -- your latest views on the healthier consumer. And I was curious, as you look at some of your surveys that you do with your consumers, are tariff concerns are popping up at all in the conversation?","Todd Vasos","Yes. I would tell you, as you know, Rupesh, we really talk to our consumers each and every quarter. And she is telling us about the same as we've -- that we've talked about before. She's still back to work, making a little bit more money working more hours versus actual average hourly rate being up for her is really more productivity more hours. And she is feeling a little bit more timid just like we've seen in past -- in the past couple of quarters. But I would tell you that tariff has not really been -- she has not called that out and she really hasn't called out a lot of headwinds yet from what she would think about as price increases or inflation.","So she really hasn't been calling that out at least up till now. But we're really mindful that with List 4 getting ready to take effect across all retail that she still may see some of that. The great thing about this model is that we do good in good times and in bad times, right, or when she needs us more. And we stand ready willing and able to deliver to her, as she may need us a little bit more toward the back half and the early part of next year.","Rupesh Parikh","Great. And then one follow-up question. We've been getting some questions just on some of the proposed SNAP changes out there. I was curious if you have any initial views towards those proposals?","John Garratt","Yeah. What I would say as a reminder that if you look at our SNAP sales tender as a percentage of the total, it's less than 5%. And if you look at the guidance we've provided we've estimated what we think the impact of that would be, and that's all captured in the guidance.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Prykull with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Chris Prykull","Good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask a little bit about that non-consumable initiative. It sounds like things are going pretty well there. Can you maybe just give a little bit more detail about the categories that you're seeing the most benefit in the halo benefit that you mentioned? Can you quantify the incremental lift that you're seeing in the remodels where that initiative is being added? And then how many stores could you roll that out to in 2020 and beyond?","Todd Vasos","Yeah. We're very pleased with the early results. As we indicated, we'll have up to 2,400 stores up and running by the end of this year. We believe we can do many, many more if not the entire chain eventually, the way this is starting to play out.","We're very happy with the gross margin opportunities that are existing out of this. The stores that we have converted over already are seeing strong gross margin lifts for the entire store and sales lifts for the entire store, which is exactly what we thought would happen. So as we continue to scale this, it will continue to have a bigger and bigger impact on our total store both margin and top line.","The great thing is we're into our fifth replenishment cycle already and are seeing great results from even now into our fifth replenishment. And that's from the consumer takeaway to how our stores and our operators have been able to manage a new muscle if you will in working no planogram, but yet working the treasure hunt environment and they've done a fabulous job with it.","So we're really pleased with what we see. And in my prepared remarks, I think you also remember hearing we've taken some of those learnings not only items, but in some cases full categories and we have now flushed it through the other part of the chain so upwards of 16,000 stores.","So you're seeing strength, which was the other part of your question in seasonal and in home in domestics. Those are some of the areas that we're seeing some of the biggest increases. We saw great increases in party and occasion. And when you think about party, it crosses everything from plates, cups, napkins to balloons, helium balloons doing very, very well for us. So it's really across the board.","Chris Prykull","Great. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up. Any way to quantify the impact from your partnerships with FedEx or Western Union? Or maybe just some thoughts around the strategic rationale for doing those. Are your locations on average closer to customer households than FedEx or Western Union locations?","John Garratt","This is John. Good question. What I'll say while not material to 2019, we're very excited about the partnership. If you look at FedEx, we'll be starting out with 1,500 stores in Q3 scaling to 8,000 by the end of 2020. Western Union, there too early stages there in all the stores.","What we really think this demonstrates is our ability to further leverage our unique footprint and provide services to underserved customers that others have difficulty getting to. And with service partnerships like this and there could be others, we believe we're helping drive traffic. They also can be effective income drivers to the business as well, so we're excited about what it does for the customer and how it can help our financials going forward.","Chris Prykull","Thanks so much. Good luck for rest of the year.","John Garratt","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Karen Short","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And I'll add my congratulations as well. Great quarter.","Todd Vasos","Thanks Karen.","Karen Short","I just want to ask on guidance. So when I look at your operating profit per square foot the growth that you saw this quarter, I mean it was the best growth rate in what I count is like 11 quarters. And it just seems that with respect to what drove it this quarter a lot of those things are actually sustainable through the back half and I know you pointed to some areas of conservatism. But maybe you could just parse that out a little bit, because it does feel like full year guidance is being extremely conservative.","John Garratt","Thanks Karen. I'll start by saying, we feel great about the business fundamentals and how we start out the year with strong top line and bottom line performance and based on that raised our outlook. It's important to -- you remember that we did absorb additional tariff increases into our guidance while still raising it. So there's a lot of year left, but we feel comfortable with the guidance we provided.","Karen Short","Okay. And then just a follow-up. You did call out higher shrinks within the gross margin. Any color there obviously because EAS has benefited shrink over the last several quarters?","John Garratt","As you pointed out over the last three years, the team's done a great job significantly reducing shrink. But as we've said before, it's never a straight line to the top. We always look to balance shrink with in-stock and obviously this year as we've said really doing great work around improving our in-stock levels. But we continue to see shrink improvement over the long-term.","One of the biggest wins, we've had lately is EAS. We opened -- we added 2,000 more EAS units in Q2. Based on the successful results, we've seen from EAS, as we mentioned we're expanding that. Rather than adding 3,000 this year, we're now going to add 6,000 finish out the chain really just given the results we've seen from this. So we expect that to continue to help us reduce shrink over the long-term and continue to see opportunity there.","Karen Short","Okay. But nothing specific to point out this quarter?","Todd Vasos","No. None.","Karen Short","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Mushkin","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to actually ask a more strategic question of the team given the fact that all these initiatives are starting or will start to bear a lot of fruit. I'm just trying to understand where you think there's some levers. I mean, if I look at Home Depot, they kind of keep their gross margins flat and reinvest pretty heavily to drive sales. I was wondering what your kind of thoughts are strategically that way. Can you use price as a lever? Do you speed up the Fresh? I mean what do you do with the -- as it looks like the profitability of the company is going to continue to accelerate?","Todd Vasos","Again, we feel very good about the strategic initiatives in total and we've always said, we reserve the right at any time to continue to reinvest back into the company. But those of you that know us well, we don't do any of that without a solid return attached to any of those investments. And that's the strength of Dollar General is that and our execution level.","And I would tell you that we feel good about where we are today on the strategic initiatives we have out there. We have a plethora of them as you know, but the great thing is we're executing at a high level across all of them. And many of them are aimed right at gross margin and some of them are aimed right at the SG&A line to continue -- so that we can continue to grow our operating margins. And that's really what we're squarely focused on is operating margins.","Scott Mushkin","And Todd, so if you look at it and you look at kind of the modern DG stores that's evolving, I mean, it seems to really replace for a shopper or could replace a shopper certainly many trips to the grocery stores, but maybe even to the super-centers. And as a follow-up question to what I just asked you, I mean, do you see this as a vehicle to increase trips? And where do you think pricing plays in that as you look at the company over the next couple of years?","Todd Vasos","Yeah. If you look at where we are, our pricing is as solid as good as it's ever been against all classes of trade. So we feel very good about that and we watch that each and every quarter. That is the cornerstone if you will of our value proposition here at Dollar General.","We're squarely focused on serving that customer. We are a fill-in shop. We are not a full stock-up a full shop or a big stock-up shop. But in saying that, we want to make sure that the value and convenient nature of Dollar General is enhanced at all times. And many of these initiatives go right against those type of items to make sure that -- in fact that convenient level is there for her. And we talk to our core customers each and every quarter as I mentioned earlier, and she does tell us that she wants more products from us. And that's really what we're delivering and especially in rural America where options are very limited.","So if we can deliver a fresh offering that's strong and a better for you offering, which we're doing in many of these stores, there's a healthy option for her as well in these communities. And if it means that she doesn't have to make another trip to a big-box store somewhere in the month then I think it benefits her greatly. And that's how we look at how we're building this Dollar General for the future.","Scott Mushkin","Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell","Good morning and great quarter. Just a few quick ones for me. One with the higher-capacity coolers, does that involve in taking away any allocation of space from other categories and are utilizing that to actually add-in some new and incremental SKUs versus just make sure you have increased availability of current items?","And then on private label and private brands certainly sounds like there's success there. Can you quantify at all or let us know to what extent your private brands are growing relative to national brands? Thank you.","Todd Vasos","Sure Paul. Yeah, so when you look at the higher capacity coolers, again as I stated earlier, we don't do anything here without a return against it and without testing and learning. That's the core strength of Dollar General. And these higher capacity coolers are the exact same coolers that are in the DGTP stores just not as quite as many doors. So it's the same coolers, the same exact ones.","And so to answer your question specifically, we do lose a little hanging apparel when we go to remodel, relocate or put it in a new store with these higher capacity coolers. But once again as I've been stating for many quarters now, we continue to reduce our hanging apparel for better traffic driving items across the chain. So this is just a continuation and an acceleration quite frankly of our ability to be able to do that.","It does give you both sides of the equation to your point. It gives you higher capacity so that you're in-stock, especially on a lot of fast moving goods but it also gives you the opportunity for 25% more new items in these coolers versus the smaller lower capacity ones we had before. And that will increase sales.","So both your in-stocks will increase sales and the assortment will increase sales. Again our core consumer is asking us for more products in our fresh frozen and dairy and deli items and that's exactly what we're going to deliver to her.","So we're excited. This is -- this wasn't contemplated in our earlier rollout this year. But as we continue to see the success of our DGTP remodels, we thought it was the best use of our capital to go in and do those and that's exactly what we're doing.","And then as it relates to private brands, we're very happy with all the work that the team has done around private brands in the last couple of quarters. They've been ready enough to be able to deliver to the customer an even enhanced value proposition there. Our believe make-up line is doing phenomenal. It got so much buzz across social media, across CNN this past quarter and has driven a lot of additional traffic into our stores and again everything under $5.","And so I would tell you that our private brands are growing at a very nice clip and we only see that benefiting our core consumer even greater as time goes on. And we continue to re-launch things like Gentle Steps that I talked about in our baby line.","So more to come there. I believe that we're in the early innings of what Dollar General can do with private brands in totality. We're really, really happy with what we see. And quite frankly a lot of integration in our signing, in our advertising also helps. So when the consumer gets to the store, she sees a consistent message and she understands that message.","Paul Trussell","Thank you. And then lastly for me just on the pickup pilot, can you just tell us how you're going to approach that?","Todd Vasos","Yeah. We're going to go slow here. We want to make sure that the consumer resonates with that. So remember our average basket size is $12 or less, five items or less on average. So it's a little bit different shop than what you would find in a big-box retailer. And so buy online pick up in store will be no different. It will be a different shop. But what we believe we can do is offer her another leg of convenience. So that she can come to the store, pick up what she needs probably add an item or two to her online pickup and then be able to get out very, very quickly.","And so we're going to test it. We're going to go slow here. We're going to test it in the back half of the year. And as I indicated last quarter, we believe that the customer will resonate with this but we'll have to wait and see.","But again I think it's important to note here that we're not going to sit back and wait for the customer to already be there. We're going to meet her, our core customer where we believe she's going to be. And having this ready and ready to rollout in a large-scale way somewhere down the line, I think is the exact right thing to do, no different than e-commerce for us. We've had an e-commerce site up and running for the better part of seven years now. And when our core consumer is ready to buy more online, all we have to do is turn the dial up there and that will be no different than buy online pick up in the store.","Paul Trussell","Thank you. Best of luck.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Operator","The final question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robby Ohmes","Thanks for squeezing me in. Todd, I know we've seen in our price studies how well you guys are doing in pricing and you got all these great initiatives. Just could you speak to us about the competitive environment? Has anything changed? Are you seeing regional grocers raise prices, which we think we've seen in some cases? Have you seen store closings, smaller players that were not able to track go out of business? Any color on that would be fantastic. Thanks.","Todd Vasos","Yeah. Sure Robby. We -- I would tell you that again we are -- as well-positioned on price against all classes of trade than we've been in the 10, almost 11 years that I've been here at Dollar General. And it is the cornerstone of that value convenience proposition to our customer.","And in saying that we really haven't seen too much of a difference broadly on pricing whether it be every day or promotional. It's been fairly tame out there. But in saying that we continue to work the price levers to make sure that we're right priced in every DMA that we serve out there across the country.","And as you look with our scale getting larger and larger each and every year and our ability to keep prices low because of our limited SKU assortment that we have, we continue to be very well priced. And that's exactly what our consumers are looking for. And that's why we know that either in good times or bad those consumers are going to come flocking in to see Dollar General.","And the last thing I would say is that our fastest growing segment still is the consumer making over $50,000 a year. That's the fastest growing segment we have and I think that really speaks to every consumer is looking for value and is looking for convenience. And I believe that all the work we're doing inside of our box to transform it into an all-around shop is really resonating with the customer.","Robby Ohmes","Terrific. Thanks so much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"7188":["Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call May 31, 2018 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Jennifer Beugelmans - VP, IR & Public Relations","Todd Vasos - CEO","John Garratt - CFO","Analysts","Michael Lasser - UBS","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Vincent Sinisi - Morgan Stanley","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer","Marissa Sullivan - Bank of America","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Peter Keith - Piper Jaffray","Operator","Good morning.

Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up question if necessary.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, Jennifer and welcome to everyone joining our call. We had a solid first quarter and we're off to a good start in the second quarter here. Here in the first quarter, we delivered strong net sales growth, gross margin expansion, and expense containment.","We remain on-track with our full year guidance, specifically with regard to first quarter EPS, we believe we are right where we need to be. During the first quarter, we delivered 2.1% same store sales growth driven by fundamental improvement in customer productivity as illustrated by increases in both average units and dollars per basket.","Importantly, we achieved this growth despite facing unseasonably cold and damp weather which created a sales headwind. We also built momentum within each of our four operating priorities and we believe that our execution on these and our progress against key strategic initiatives are laying the foundation for long term growth. ","Now let's recap some of the top line results for the first quarter. Net sales increased 9% to $6.1 billion compared to net sales of $5.6 billion in the first quarter of 2017. Our same store sales increase of 2.1% reflect strong performance in the consumable category. We continued to gain market share and highly consumables over the 4, 12, 24 and 52 week periods and the May 5th, 2018 according to syndicated data.","We are committed to being priced right for our customer every day and believe we remain well positioned against all classes of trade and across all geographic regions in which we operate. We believe our everyday low price has contributed to our share gains.","Well it's always competitive in discount retail, we continue to see rational pricing activity across the industry. As we continue to execute against our operating priorities, we believe we have the opportunities to continue to capture market share.","Our first quarter comp included the impact of unseasonable weather in late March and April, which we believe negatively impacted our non-consumable categories, particularly among Spring and Summer products. Consumables which represent 75% of our business were also impacted by weather, although still comped at a very healthy rate during the first quarter. ","To give you a little more insight into the magnitude of the weather impacts, midway through the first quarter, our comp sales, we're tracking ahead of our full year guidance in fact we achieved our highest comp sales for the quarter in March. our comp sales in April, however, were negative. As we moved out of April and through now into May, the unfavorable weather subsided and we are encouraged by the strong start to our second quarter.","Based on our year-to-date results and our outlook for the remainder of the year we are reiterating our full year 2018 financial guidance in its entirety. After John's comments, I will share some further insights on how we plan to continue driving growth in 2018 and beyond. ","With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Garratt","Thank you Todd and good morning everyone. Now that Todd is taking you through a few highlights of the first quarter, let me take you through important financial details. I will also spend time reviewing our 2018 guidance, unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year over year. As Todd has already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit.","We were pleased to deliver gross profit expansion in the first quarter. Gross profit as a percent of sales was $3.5% in the first quarter, an increase of 17 basis points. This increase was primarily attributable to higher initial markups that inventory purchases and improved rate of inventory shrink.","These factors were partially offset by a greater proportion of sales of consumables which generally have a lower gross profit rate that our other product categories, the sales of lower margin projects - products comprising a higher proportion of consumable sales and increased transportation costs.","SG&A expense as a percent of sales was 22.4%. This was an increase of 60 basis points. The first quarter of 2018 SG&A results were driven by increased retail labor expenses, occupancy costs, utilities expenses and property taxes on lease stores, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales.","The vast majority of the deleverage in the SG&A rate was primarily due to two factors. First, the previously announced expenses associated with the store manager investments and the ramp up of the stores opened in the second half of 2017.","And second to the unseasonably cold and damp weather that negatively impacted sales and drove higher than expected utilities expenses. The operating margin rates for the quarter would've been flat, if not for those investments in the weather.","Moving down the income statement or effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6%. This was largely aligned with our full year guidance of 22% to 23%, which we are reiterating for the full year. This compares to 37.2% in the first quarter of 2017.","Finally, diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.36. We have a solid balance sheet and a track record of generating strong cash flow from operations. Merchandise inventories were $3.6 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2018 up 8.9%, but slightly below our net sales growth. ","Inventory growth was relatively flat on a per store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape and we remain focused on managing inventory growth to be in-line with or below our sales growth.","In the first quarter, we generated strong cash flow from operations totaling $549 million, an increase of $38 million or 7.5%. The strong growth was on top of the 26% year over year increase we reported in the first quarter of 2017.","Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $165 million and included our plan investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, continued investments in our two distribution centers under construction and spending related to the previously announced acceleration of some key initiatives.","During the quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock for $150 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $78 million. Till the e end of the first quarter, we return cash to shareholders totaling $228 million to the combination of these share repurchases and quarterly dividends.","From the inception of our share repurchase program in December 2011 through the first quarter of 2018, we have repurchased $5.3 billion or 83 million shares of our common stock. At the end of the first quarter, the remaining repurchase authorization was approximately $1.2 billion.","Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, as we continue to be disciplined and focused on financial returns. Our first priority is investing in high return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth.","We remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases in quarterly dividends while maintaining our current investment grade rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately three times adjusted debt to EBITDA.","Turning now to our guidance, as Todd highlighted we are off to a solid start during the first four months of 2018. Based on this performance and our outlook for the rest of the year, we are reiterating our fiscal 2018 full year guidance, including net sales growth of approximately 9% comp growth in the mid 2% range, operating margin rate relatively unchanged compared to the 2017 fiscal year and diluted earnings per share for the full year in the range of $5.95 to $6.15.","Given the puts and takes of sales growth and margin rate this year, we want to provide a little more insight on the trajectory of our expectations. First starting with sales, we're off to a good start in the second quarter, but bear in mind the second quarter comp last does get tougher relative to the first quarter.","Also, as a reminder in the second half of 2017, we opened 741 new stores driven by the acquisition of the Dollar Express locations, which is a much higher number than our typical cadence.","As a result, in the second half of 2018 we will have an unusually high number of stores rolling into the comp space. The anticipated positive impact of these stores helps offset the tougher comparisons we face in the second half. This positive impact is contemplated in our full year guidance.","Seconds, looking at gross margin, we continue to see freight and fuel headwinds, but as a reminder, we begin to laugh these pressures and the second half of the year. The team is executing strategies that we believe can help mitigate the impact of these headwinds overtime.","We remain committed to our everyday low price strategy, which we believe is a competitive advantage. To that end and as part of our ongoing operating philosophy, we routinely monitor our price position and make adjustments as necessary.","Our full year outlook includes the expected gross margin impact of any known challenges in these areas. Turning to SG&A, as reminder for modeling purposes, our long term goal is to leverage SG&A on an annual basis in the range of 2.5% 3% same store sales growth.","It is not our strategy to leverage SG&A at lower comp levels as we expect to continue to make targeted investments in the business. Additionally, as we have said previously, we are focused on operating margin growth, which allows us to dynamically make choices that enable us to do is write for the longer term health of the business.","Finally, regarding EPS, I would remind you that in the third quarter of 2017, we saw $0.05 estimated net negative impact to diluted EPS due to the hurricane. As always, we are focused on carefully controlling costs even as we make targeted proactive investments.","We continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while positioning our business for long term growth. ","We remain confident in our business model and our ability to drive profitable same store sales growth, deliver healthy new store returns, generate strong cash flow from operations and create long term shareholder value.","With that, I will turn the call back over Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, John. Let me now walk through how we are executing against our operating priorities and initiatives for 2018, as well as updates you on the progress on our long term strategic initiatives.","Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth. With the focus on driving both the top and bottom lines, we expect our most impactful topline initiatives for 2018 to revolve around merchandising and store operations.","These initiatives are designed to enhance the value and convenience proposition for our customers, offering them the trusted simple solutions they seek from us every day. We continue to strategically invest in our mature store base. We are particularly focused on remodeling stores that have fewer than 12 cooler doors. These store remodels typically drive among the highest returns.","By the end of fiscal 2018, we anticipate that across our store base we will have an average of 20 cooler doors up from 10 in 2012. Through the end of the first quarter, we had installed nearly 7,000 additional cooler doors across our mature store base.","In total, we expect to install over 20,000 additional cooler doors across our mature store base this year. We know the expansion of coolers tends to drive trips and basket size. As a result, we expect to build on our multi-year track record of growth in cooler doors and associated sales.","We have been enhancing the in store experience by adding shoppable queue lines. This update allows us to merchandise the check lane with compelling point of purchase items that we believe are interesting to our consumers.","During the first quarter, we added this enhancement to over 500 stores bringing our total for the chain to approximately 6,000 stores. The queue line retrofit performance has been very strong. We expect to have this enhancement in over 7,000 stores by the end of 2018.","Building on the success of Phase I launch of our health and beauty initiative in 2017, we're launching Phase II in 2018. As reminder, during Phase I, we focused on building awareness among our current customers, with our special combination of value and convenience within health and beauty items, we believe we can do even a better job marketing these products to customers who routinely come to Dollar General for their shopping needs.","In Phase II, we want to build on the increased category awareness we created during Phase I, by further enhancing the quality perception of the health and beauty products we offer. Some of our actions include improving our display quality, connecting our in-store merchandising with our print and digital media, and creating an easier shopping experience.","Given our price position compared to other channels we believe we can capture share of wallet with our existing customers as well as identifying innovative ways to drive new customers into our stores. We plan to execute Phase II in about 7,000 stores in 2018.","Another initiative I want to mention within merchandising is our efforts in private brands. Our private brand strategy focuses on enhancing product perception and demonstrating the unique nature, superior value and quality compared to national brands.","We intend to use our in-store merchandising expertise to highlight the value pricing and our 100% satisfaction guarantee as we believe both resonate with our customers. We currently have approximately 40 unique private brand product lines.","Our goal is to ensure that we are offering compelling value priced alternatives to national brands given the significant price gap compared to national brands and other channels, private brands play an important role in helping our customers stretch their budgets.","Within our merchandising initiatives, we also have many new and exciting research plan for 2018. Let me briefly highlight two of them. First, we recently launched a better for you offering intended to provide our customers with healthier consumable options at affordable prices.","Over time, we expect this offering to include more than 130 products within better for you, we're launching a new private brand called Good and Smart, which will represent approximately 75% of the total Better For You portfolio.","Our goal is to build Good and Smart into a unique private brands that becomes a go-to-product line for our customers when they look for good food choices at smart prices. Second, we are rebranding our private beauty product portfolio under the name Studio Selection.","Our goal with Studio Selection is to create an aspirational, yet affordable line of products that will help us further build loyalty and excitement among key demographics. We believe these attractively packaged quality products can help us capture even more market share.","These are just two of the exciting launches we have planned throughout the rest of the year. We look forward to updating you on the success of our merchandising initiatives throughout the rest of 2018.","Let's now turn to the important work of our store operations team. A large part of their current focus is increasing on shelf product availability. This critical metric is paramount for our customer and is directly tied to sales right.","The team has done an excellent job of improving on shelf availability and has further improved store cleanliness and speed of checkout. All important parts of the in store experience. As a result of this execution, we have seen customer satisfaction grow since we began measuring this metric. This is one of our most important metrics and we believe we can drive it even higher and cultivate even more affinity from our customers over time.","Turning for a moment to gross margin, over the long term we believe there are several opportunities to enhance gross margins. These include further reductions in shrink, additional contribution from global sourcing, private brands, and not consumable sales as well as achieving additional distribution and transportation efficiencies.","Inventory shrink reduction remains our largest near term gross margin opportunity and we are executing on multiple fronts. Our comp initiatives include deploying defensive merchandising tactics, leveraging technology, and new process controls and expanding article electronic article surveillance or EAS.","This year, we're on track to deploy 5,000 new units bringing the total stores with this technology to about 10,000 locations. The majority of this year incremental units were completed during the first quarter.","EAS is a proven high return project for us to help further reduce shrink and drive sales by improving on shelf availability. We believe that our EAS investments can deliver multiple years of benefits.","While we have seen carrier rates and fuel costs on the rise, we believe our ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce expenses can partly offset our expense and exposure to these headwinds. Some of our ongoing initiatives include reducing our stem miles, improve our load optimization, growing and diversifying our carrier base and expanding our private fleet.","Our 16th and 17th distribution centers are currently under construction in Longview, Texas and Amsterdam. New York. We anticipate that both of these DCs will open in the 2019 calendar year and then we will see relatively quick and positive impact on stem miles.","I was recently at our newest distribution center in Jackson, Georgia for their grand opening celebration. The team in Jackson is excited and engaged and we look forward to their contribution to our future performance.","We also remain on pace to expand our private fleet to over 200 tractors by year-end up from an 80 tractors at the end of 2017. Over time, we believe this will give us added flexibility and help insulate us from future carrier rate fluctuations.","Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. We have a proven real estate growth model that is high return, low cost, and low risk. While our real estate model has strict return thresholds, it provides us with the flexibility necessary to dynamically invest in both growing our new store base and remodeling our mature store base. ","These strategic investments have allowed us to enter new markets and store formats while extending our runway for long term growth. As a reminder, we closely monitor five core metrics to ensure that new store growth continues to be the best use of our capital; first, new store productivity as a percent of our comp store sales, which continues to average in the range of 80% to 85%.","Second actual sales performance compared to our proforma models. Third, average returns of 20% to 22%. And forth, cannibalization of our new stores on our comp store base, which has remained relatively consistent in our measurement. And then finally new stores must have a payback period of two years or less.","We have consistently hit our goals for these metrics. We are very pleased with her overall new store returns and we remain committed to investing our capital effectively to drive strong financial. ","For 2018 we expect to open 900 new stores, remodel 1000 of our mature stores and relocate approximately 100 stores. That's about 2000 stores in total. Of the 1,000 plan remodels, we expect approximately 400 locations to be in the Dollar General Traditional Plus format or DGTP for short. This format has a higher cooler count that can accommodate more perishable items.","We're on track to achieve these goals by the end of the year. During the first quarter, we opened 241 stores, remodeled 322 stores and relocated an additional 31 stores. 125 of the stores remodeled in the first quarter were in the DGTP format. We included a fresh produce section in 45 of these remodels.","As a reminder, our remodel store delivers a 4% to 5% comp lift on average, and a DGTP remodel delivers an average of 10% to 15% comp lift. Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending.","All of our spending is filtered through three criteria. First is a customer facing. Second, does it align with our strategic priorities. And third, how does it impact our risk profile. At the store level our operational initiatives for 2018 are centered on space optimization and ongoing efforts to simplify our operations by reducing unproductive inventory, operating complexity and product movement within the stores. ","These actions are designed to control costs and allow our store managers and their teams to provide better customer service as well as fast, clean and in store, in store shopping experience. All of these actions can help drive higher sales.","We are tracking customer satisfaction scores at the individual employee level, which increases accountability and creates opportunities for employee recognition at the store, support center, work elimination, and process improvement or ongoing efforts to take cost out of the business. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture growth opportunities, control expenses, and always seek to be a low cost operator. ","Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage. We believe we are well positioned from a wage perspective across our employee base. That said, we monitor market by market and act as needed to ensure we remain competitive in the labor markets where we operate.","This proactive strategy coupled with the career opportunities we offer associates continues to reinforce dollar general's position as an employer of choice. The career opportunity we offer is our most important currency and attracting and retaining talents.","With our business growing each year, we are providing opportunities for individuals around the country to grow their careers and make improvements in their lives and the lives of their families. Career development is an integral part of the Dollar General culture and we are focused on helping our employees reach their full potential.","Approximately 70% of corporate leadership positions are filled with internal candidates and over 10,000 of our current store managers have been internally promoted. This year with our plan to open 900 new stores, we expect to create over 7,000 new jobs in the United States. We are confident that we will continue to re-track, excuse me, and retain the right talent and we are prioritizing investments in our people.","Finally, before I opened the call for questions, I want to quickly touch upon our recent progress executing against two of our strategic growth initiatives that we talked about last quarter. Starting with our digital initiatives, in the near term we are strategically investing in our business to help our customers utilize digital tools and resources to create a more personalized and convenient in store shopping experience.","With nearly 75% of the US population currently within five miles of a Dollar General, we have a unique opportunity to help shape our customers digital shopping behavior all while leveraging our nearly 15,000 Brick and Mortar stores to help them save time and money.","Last quarter we shared our plans to launch our new DG go App, which allows customers to use their phones to scan items as they shop and then skip the line by using the self checkout. Not only this app save our customers time, but it also allows them to see a running total of their baskets.","Additionally, as they scan each item, they receive alerts to potential savings on the items they are purchasing. All of this makes staying on budget easier. The DG go App went live in the Apples, The Apple App store and Google Play Store earlier this month and the service is being piloted in 10 stores. We intend to roll it out to another 100 stores in the second quarter.","As we continue to develop this app, we intend to integrate more functionality to deliver an even more personalized shopping experience. We are excited about this new technology and look forward to sharing updates with you as the year progress.","To compliment these efforts we are continuing to push forward and other digital initiatives such as our digital coupons and personalized marketing campaigns that will help our customers save even more time and money. ","We know that our customers who more frequently engaged with our digital tools tend to checkout with average baskets about twice as large as our chain wide average. With more than 12 million subscriber accounts we are excited about the foundation we have built for the future.","With our unique real estate footprint and model of value and convenience, we believe we own the last mile. As such, we have an opportunity to use our understanding of our customers' digital shopping behavior to create an even better in store experience and develop online tools that will help them save time and money. ","Turning to our non consumable initiative. In recent weeks, we began our tests have a bold new and expanded assortment in key categories. Our model enhances the treasure hunt experience by first offering a new differentiated and limited assortment that will change throughout the year.","Second, displaying the new offering in high traffic areas with improved adjacencies and increased focus on key categories to enhance the in store experience and create a sense of purchase urgency.","And third, continues to develop exceptional value by pricing the majority of the offerings at $5 or less. While we're expanding our assortment and select categories, the amount of space currently dedicated to non consumables within our stores remains the same.","We plan to implement this set and approximately 700 store locations this year as we look to further compliment are strong and growing consumer business. We are excited about our plans and believe we are well positioned to capture market share in a changing retail landscape. ","In closing, we delivered a solid first quarter and we are excited about the business and the outlook for the remainder of 2018. We believe we operate in the most attractive sector and retail and our business model is differentiated by a real estate and operating model that delivers best in class new store growth, steady comp growth, solid earnings, and strong cash growth generation.","I want to thank each of our over 130,000 employees across the company for all of their hard work and dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others. As a team we are excited about our position and we look forward to building on our progress and delivering strong performance throughout the rest of 2018.","With that operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Todd Vasos","Good morning Michael.","Michael Lasser","Good morning Todd. Thanks for taking my question. Has traffic been positive in the second quarter to date now negative in the last quarter. So how much are you willing to accept it or might have to step on some price investments or other initiatives in order to drive that? ","Todd Vasos","Yeah. Michael, we feel real good about our star to our second quarter. One Stat that whether headwind that we saw a baited and we got back to some normalized weather patterns at the very tail end of April, but mainly now in the month of May.","We really feel good about our position. We really feel as great about where we are on our pricing, competitiveness in. It gets us all against all classes of trade and in all the areas that we operate in, a couple of those with our initiatives to grow both traffic and our sales and baskets.","I think that as we continue to move throughout the rest of this year, we'll see. We'll see continued momentum in our, in our top line, in our comp stores and in our traffic. ","Michael Lasser","And then my follow up side, you mentioned that the contribution toward ramping to productivity should help a front, upper back half here. So you quantify what you're expecting to ramp the, in what it's been over the last quarter, going to provide us better and teaching of how you're more mature. Stores are performing and I still have been inevitable store gross sense for what the overall growth might? ","John Garratt ","Yeah. In terms of the back half of the year, what we wanted to point out is we opened an unusually large number of stores in the second half of last year, 741 stores. I believe that's about 80 percent increase over the prior year.","And when you have that many stores rolling into the base, it delivers a considerable tailwind, which helps offset, as you'll see higher comp lamps in the second half of the year. So we do see that as a tailwind.","In terms of new stores and mature stores, we continue to see solid contribution from both. As we've said in the past are a new store, a real estate contribution for both new stores, remodels, net of cannibalization delivers about 150 to 200 basis points.","Obviously as you're opening new stores that moves you toward the higher end of that range. But we continue to see a cost benefit from our mature stores as well. So, as we look at our, a comps for the year and the guidance that we provided, both in terms of where we're at in terms of the initiatives performing well in terms of the fundamentals of the business coupled with this gives us confidence in the guidance we provided. ","Michael Lasser","Okay. Thank you. And Best of luck. ","John Garratt ","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning. On gross margins I mean, sounds like shrink remains a strong opportunity. I'm just wondering if it's enough to key gross margins actually up all year or should we just expect that that second half comparison just gets too difficult on that front? And also just wondering if you are seeing any incremental pricing or freight headwinds versus your initial a guide? ","Todd Vasos","Sure. A couple of questions there. I'll try and hit all those along the way. I will start by saying that, we're very pleased with the performance in Q1, delivering 17 basis points of margin expansion, despite the -- we also called out that, if you look at overall operating margin would have been level if you exclude the impact of the weather.","And we really look at it that way. We really look at as we look at the full year operating margin rate, which we said would be even with last year over the for the full year in our guidance. And we believe that's the right way to look at it so that we can manage all the levers within gross margin and SG&A make the right trade offs in the best interest of the long term growth of the business. ","With that said, it's in gross margin specifically, we had a lot of levers within their shrink that you mentioned is one that we're very excited about. We've delivered six consecutive quarters of sequential improvement with shrink. We've made investments in EAS and it's, we talked about which are performing very well as well as all their targeted investments in defensive merchandising. ","We have a lot of process rigor in place around this leveraging technology such as video enabled exception based reporting. So a lot of tools and process rigor to help drive shrink. But in addition to that, we have other levers within gross margin to partly offset the pressures you mentioned. ","We as others have seen pressures on fuel and freight rates, but I think the team has done a phenomenal job managing all the levers within our disposal there as we continue to see those headwinds, as we continue to open new distribution centers, we have two under construction now that reduces the stem miles.","We're also driving improve efficiencies around load optimization and productivity improvements throughout the supply chain. We're expanding our private fleet. We're expanding and diversifying our carrier base so a lot of tools at play here to help offset that.","In addition to that, there's other levers within growth margin team does a phenomenal job with category management. We see opportunity to increase our private label penetration for insourcing, penetration and grow our non-consumables business. So as you look at all those both within gross margin and the ongoing rigor around SG&A, we feel good about the guidance that we provided for the full year. ","Paul Trussell","Got it. And I appreciate all the commentary on a cadence early on the call, but, but just to kind of clarify your 2Q comments, you're off to a good start but have tougher compare sequentially. I don't want to put words in your mouth.","Are you outlining that we should think about the second quarter has the opportunity to be better than 1Q, but the second half just given the new stores, could, should be better than the first half? You can just circle back in detail that? Thank you. ","John Garratt","Yeah. So two things there. One, we just want to point out if you look at the cadence of the month, we started out with solid comps in February and March. And as we said running ahead of our full year guidance for comp then as we got into the end of March and into April, we saw a dip negatively and then we saw those returned a strongly positive with a great start to Q2.","So we wanted to make sure people are well aware of that cadence where we're starting up the quarter. Why that gives us confidence on the full year guide? Just pointing out thethe, the lap in q Tutu and the balance of the year, we just wanted to remind people of that.","I think people were trying to figure out the case, just want to remind them that, while we're off to a great start, the lab does get tougher, but as we get into the back half of the year in particular, as we mentioned, with all those new stores getting into the space, that gives us confidence that we can lap those nicely and deliver the full year guidance. ","Paul Trussell","Got It. Best of luck. Thank you ","Operator","Your next question is from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","John Garratt","Good morning Vinny.","Vincent Sinisi "," Hey, good morning guys. Thanks very much for taking my question and thanks for us some of the quantification around that, the headwinds this quarter. First question, I just wanted to ask about the labor expenses. If I just want to kind of make sure that I, that I heard you guys properly.","So, one of the consistent questions we've gotten from folks since last quarter was, like the full year outlook, sounds good. Are they going be able to hold to it now from what you've said in terms of the margin guidance and in terms of even margin this quarter X whether it would have been flat?","So is it fair to say that just from a labor perspective kind of costs were in line with where you were thinking last quarter and that you still do feel good about that particular component of the outlook for this year? ","Todd Vasos","Yeah. Absolutely. just as a reminder, we had one period in Q1 that we were still yet not lapped our investment in our store manager compensation and training. And so when we add, we add detail that out, when you look past that. I'm on labor. We're, we're seeing the benefits from our labor investments last year.","And our turnover rates are, are well in well in check and our applicant flows or are as strong as ever in matter of fact stormy than we've seen in recent years. So right now we feel very good about where we are in labor. But as I indicated, we continue to watch that and we monitor it market by market and we'll make adjustments if needed. But right now we see that we're in really good shape. ","Vincent Sinisi ","Perfect. And then just a quick followup. I think we're roughly maybe a year and now into some of the smaller format tests, both the, DGX in this kind of 6,000 foot range. Just kind of what have you learned over the, over the past year. Should we still think of it as tests or kind of what are you seeing from those, those smaller formats and maybe kind of thoughts as we look forward here from a store growth perspective? ","Todd Vasos","That's a great question. As you take a look at it, I'll address the smaller format store first, that, that concept is doing very well for us. We're using that concept in deeper urban areas as well as very rural areas that are are perhaps more crossroads than they are cities or towns. And we continue to open those and we continue to be very pleased with the results of those.","On the DGX front we've got three stores that are up and running. We're looking for two more sites for this year, so we should have five by the end of the year. I would consider that still more in the test phase.","As we continue to play with the mix a little bit to see what resonates and what doesn't with the consumer. but I have to tell you the three stores, we're very happy with what we see so far and it could be a nice unlock for our deep urban type areas across many of our metro us cities that we have out there. ","Vincent Sinisi ","All right, great. Best of luck.","Operator","Your next question is from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. ","Matthew Boss ","Thanks. Hey, Todd. Any change in the larger picture view doesn't happen with the low income consumer and as you talk about the tailwinds versus the headwinds. And I think more recently we've talked about that when exceeding headwinds. Just maybe how best to think about where you see that today and going forward? ","Todd Vasos","Yeah, I'm Matthew as we really are probably some of the best out there at knowing our core customer and really looking at her each and every quarter and I can tell you that, still today, I would tell you that her economic outlook is more of a tailwind than it is a headwind.","But there are those expenses that continued to rise for our core consumer. We continue to watch fuel rates, but right now that isn't too much of a headwind for, but we continue to watch that. But, rents and healthcare are the two big ones.","Especially rents in rural areas. It's, there's not an abundance of homes and housing there and in rents have escalated a, at a pretty good clip in the rural area. So we continue to watch that because that becomes a headwind obviously for our core consumer.","But right now she's back to work. Wages are up a little, her competence levels are up a little, so all that is really positive and gives us confidence in our full, your full year outlook on that top line.","Matthew Boss ","And then just a follow up how would you measure the competitive backdrop versus how that's the thing about mark downs with headwinds, somebody you haven't spoken to in the last couple quarters? And then maybe just multiyear any update on foreign sources, some of the initiatives from the gross margin side? ","Todd Vasos","Yeah, right now as you look at the competitive landscape is, this channel and as well as just consumable retailing, it's always a very competitive out there. But I have to tell you that we are looking at this as we have in the last couple quarters is that we believe it's a well in check the competitive nature of what's out there.","We are competitively priced everyday low across the board and as we continued to become more and more competent and where that consumer is, we can see the pull back a little bit on that markdown and that's why you haven't heard too much about that and that continues to be a nice tail wind for us as well.","But as we continue to look forward, we always reserve the right though to make sure that, we stayed very competitive price. So we watched price very closely across all channels of trade. ","Matthew Boss ","Great. Best of luck.","Operator","Next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So first on the food inflation backdrop, I'll just curious in terms of what type of impact that had during the quarter and your expectations for, for the balance of the year? ","Todd Vasos","Yeah, I'll just summarize that by saying we're not seeing a material impact one way or the other from food inflation right now. ","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great. And then as we look at the traffic declined during the quarter, do you attribute that primarily to weather or other factors at play? ","Todd Vasos","So as you take a look at, again, the cadence of sales in the quarter, I think it's fair to say, traffic followed very closely that same cadence. So, predominantly it definitely was a weather phenomenon. ","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Todd Vasos","Sure. ","Operator","Your next question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America.","Marissa Sullivan","Hi, good morning. This is actually Merissa Sullivan. I'm for Robby. I wanted to touch on that some of the produce tests that you're doing in some of your stores that beyond just the duty marketplace, how many stores does it right now? What are you seeing and what are your thoughts in terms of expanding produce to more of the store base? ","Todd Vasos","Yeah, today we have over 200 stores outside of the market store, a piece for the produce, as we indicated we put a 45 more stores in this past first quarter. We feel good about where we are. We've got a lot of track record because of our market stores for many years on how to how to, how to treat produce within our stores, but we're still learning in our smaller store formats.","But we see it as a competitive advantage, especially in rural areas where there isn't a lot of competition and slash or food choices, especially healthy food choices for our core consumers. So we see it as a real opportunity and an advantage to deliver something to our core consumer that they're looking for.","And unfortunately today in many of the markets having to drive 15, 20 miles to get it. So we'll continue to learn and grow with that. I, I would tell you it's not going to be for every store somewhere down the line. But it could, could it be for thousands eventually? Yes, it could. ","Marissa Sullivan","Got It. And just to follow up on your comments around some of your treasure hunt initiatives. I know you gave us the annual targets. How many stores do you have that initiative and right now, and can you give us any early commentary on what you're seeing in terms of lifts and penetration and the discretionary categories in those stores? ","Todd Vasos","Yeah. It's in the very early stages as you can imagine. We have a handful up and running. Again, we've got a very aggressive plan to do 700 and by the end of the year we feel very good about executing against that.","It's probably a little early to talk about what we, what we're seeing. I can, I can tell you though that in the early results, they are on the positive side. But again, keep in mind a very early so, stay tuned, we'll give you more color as that becomes a more crystallized for us.","And we, we believe though it should be a, a real win for us in the longterm because what our consumers tell us, is in not consumable arena. They're looking for more of a treasure hunt experience than an everyday consumable shop for non consumables. SoI think that we're on the right track, but time will tell. ","Marissa Sullivan","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. ","John Heinbockel ","Let me start with, you talked about the ROI of the store manager effort. So what metrics have you seen improve, say over the last few years since you've done that? And then one of the things that it does tend to improve, I think is shrink have you seen that correlate with shrink as well?","Todd Vasos","So we're very pleased. We were actually well exceeded the ROI in your one, well exceeded it. The culprits if you will they're the ones that you would think a, you will get benefit from there. We're getting benefit.","So that top line, I believe we're getting benefit there. We're definitely getting benefits from turnover. We're at, historic lows on our store manager turnover. And as John being a student of this business for a long time a good strong, stable store manager, then that translates and we're seeing this into less turnover in the assistant manager ranks and even less turnover in our hourly ranks, and we're seeing that for the very first time in so many years. ","So we know it's directly attributable to our efforts there. You couple that with the training that we did last year and developing our people and encouraging them to move ahead with this company, it's all been a win.","So we feel very good about that investment. And we believe this has a multi-year link to it and we should see benefits as we move throughout \u201818 and even into early \u201819.","John Heinbockel","And then when, when you think about the discretionary business, right? So it had been negative for a while, turn positive in the second half of last year. You know negative in the first quarter, is it, is solely weather. And do you think a discretionary in total at all, all those three categories, they will be positive for 18?","Todd Vasos","Well, as you look at our non-consumable business. It's very important to us. Our teams work hard at ensuring that they have the right items at the right price for our consumers. You couple all of our efforts and category management there over the years. I would tell you as you look at Q1 we are pretty pleased with our non-consumables we're tracking, until we hit that, that weather time that we talked about.","So we're, we're pretty bullish as we move now into Q2. I can tell you that, again, we've talked about comps have accelerated and leading the way in comps right now are some of these seasonal and non-consumable categories.","And you would think that would be true because we're making up some of that ground. You never make up all of it, but you're making up some of that ground coming from the loss of Q1.","In the long term though we believe that that non-consumables is one of our biggest opportunities and that's the reason why our non consumable initiative of the 700 stores we're going to put in the ground this year with that is going to be so important as we continue to move forward. We believe that we may have the right formula here to really start to move, are non-consumable sales force. ","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Keith ","Morning. Thanks. Good morning guys. And Todd, you had noted on the, the plus formats. It's a pretty impressive complex 10% to 15%. There does seem to be a step up in the remodel activities that format, is that something that you think is a newer initiative that can carry forward for a couple of years at this called 400 DG plus format remodels? ","Todd Vasos","Yeah. We have a very intricate real estate model which includes looking at all of our mature store bases and in touching those every 7 to 10 years on a remodel basis. So, the answer to your question, we believe the DGTP remodel has a lot of legs to it still left.","We again, don't believe every remodel will be underneath that. But again, could there be thousands of those somewhere down the road? Absolutely can be. And the same with the produce pieces I mentioned. I believe that you can see that in thousands of stores as we go into the future.","But we're very, very pleased with that DGPT format because it leverages our current box, but just makes it that much more productive. And those 10% to 15% comp lifts on a remodel or very, very impressive. ","Peter Keith ","Okay. Thank you. And then lastly for me, I don't think it was ever quantified, but would you be able to give us what your estimation of the weather impact on Q1 is and then what amount of that you would expect to recapturing Q2? ","Todd Vasos","We didn't quantify that, but I think it's instructive again, when you look at the cadence of the quarter in terms of how comps were, ahead of the full year guidance prior to April when the weather impact was and we're off to a great start for this quarter.","And as you look at the categories it was, the weather sensitive categories impact in the spring and summer and other weather sensitive categories. And if you look at the consumable side, which isn't as impacted by that, we had a very solid, strong comps in the consumables category. ","So I think it's instructive to look at it that way as well as we've indicated from an expense standpoint, if not for the impact of the weather, we would have been even year-over-year in terms of operating margin, when you factor in the impact it had not only on the sales but weather related expenses. ","Peter Keith ","Okay, great. Is there, there's a recap for dynamic and if not, is there some markdown risk to Q2? ","Todd Vasos","No, at this point we feel very confident in our sell-through rates, especially as now we moved into the month of May, we've seen that acceleration. We don't see anything on the horizon that worries us at this point. ","Peter Keith ","Okay. Terrific. Thanks a lot guys. Good luck.","Operator"," Thank you.

Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up question if necessary.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you Jennifer and welcome to everyone joining our call. We are pleased with our third quarter results, particularly given the two major hurricanes that devastated communities in some of our most heavily penetrated areas in the South Eastern United States. We stay focused on our initiatives, kept the customers at the center of everything we do, and our financial performance during the quarter demonstrated what this type of focus can produce.","Before discussing our third quarter results, I want to express my gratitude to all of our teams who have worked so diligently in very difficult circumstances to serve the communities we call home. We recently visited with our field teams in the Carolinas and The Florida Panhandle where the damage was the greatest. I say it frequently, but it bears repeating, I am so inspired by our teams consistent dedication to our mission of serving others. ","Turning now to our third quarter performance, we delivered another solid quarter with strong growth on both the top and bottom lines. On the top line our same store sales growth of 2.8% resulted in our highest two year stack in 11 quarters. ","This quarter our comp growth was primarily driven by our customer checking out with larger basket. We believe this is a reflection of all the work we have done to make the box more relevant for our customers. As our customers needs evolve, they are telling us they want a fuller shop from us and we are delivering with even more of the products they want at the values they need. ","Year-to-date through the 2018 third quarter we posted 2.9% same-store sales growth, which continued to be driven by greater customer productivity. We feel good about our 39-week performance, as well as the outlook for the rest of the year. We did, however, incur greater than anticipated disaster related expenses during the third quarter, primarily as a result of the hurricanes. ","We have updated our full year 2018 operating margin rate and diluted EPS guidance to include the estimated impact of these expenses on the third and fourth quarter results. John, will walk you through those details in just a moment. ","As we continue to execute our strategic initiatives, we remain focused on our operating priorities and we believe we are in a great position to finish the 2018 year on a strong note. ","Now let's recap some of the top line results for the third quarter. Net sales increased 8.7% to $6.4 billion, compared to net sales of $5.9 billion in the third quarter 2017. We continue to be very pleased with both the productivity from our new stores, as well as the performance from our mature stores. ","Our 2.8% same store sales increase was again led by our strong performance in consumables. We are listening to our customers and providing the products they want and need. This performance allows us to continue growing market share. We remain well positioned against all classes of trade as evidenced by our market share gains in the 4, 12, 24 and 52 week periods ending November, 3, 2018 as measured by syndicated data. ","We believe these share gains are coming from multiple retail channels and competitors, underscoring the broad appeal of our value and convenience offering. Further as we continue to execute across our growth strategies and operating priorities, we believe we have an opportunity to capture incremental share from a variety of sources. ","While it's always competitive in discount retail, pricing activity has remained rational and our pricing surveys indicate Dollar General continues to be well positioned across all geographic regions where we operate. We believe this positioning and our commitment to everyday low prices contributes to our market share gains. ","We saw improvement in our non-consumable categories, which overall comped positively again in the third quarter. This growth was primarily driven by strong sales in a seasonal category, along with our best performance in the home category in ten quarters. ","We remain focused on driving sales improvement in the non-consumable categories, which I will discuss with you in more detail later in the call. After John\u2019s discussion I will also provide an update on our execution against our operating priorities and strategic growth initiatives. ","With that, I will now turn the call over to John to provide you with more detail on the third quarter financial results.","John Garratt ","Thank you, Todd, and good morning everyone. I will now take you through some of the important financial details for the quarter and year-to-date. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. ","As Todd has already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 29.5% in the third quarter, a decrease of 39 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in the LIFO provision, the ongoing product category mix shift to consumables, as well as higher sales of lower margin consumable products, higher markdowns and increased transportation costs. ","We recorded a $12.5 million LIFO provision in the third quarter of 2018, compared with the $0.5 million LIFO provision in the third quarter of 2017. This LIFO increase was attributable to cost increases, which were primarily due to direct and indirect impacts of tariffs and the increased transportation cost pressures. ","As you heard from us and other retailers throughout the year, our business has continued to see the effect of higher transportation costs due to the tight carrier market and higher fuel prices among other factors. While we have navigated sales mix challenges and markdowns as part of the retail landscape for many years, the headwind from transportation costs is a relatively more recent challenge impacting our gross margin. We anticipate this trend to continue primarily as a result of higher carrier rates. These factors were partially offset by another quarter of improved inventory shrink. ","SG&A as a percent of sales was 22.6%, a decrease of 21 basis points. The leverage in the third quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by reductions in incentive compensation, lower advertising and supplies expenses and lower repairs and maintenance expenses as a percentage of sale. Partially offsetting those decreases were an estimated $14.1 million in hurricane related expenses, as well as a $5.8 million year-over-year increase in other disaster related expenses, both of which were greater than anticipated. ","In total, these hurricanes and disaster related expenses had a negative 31 basis points impact on 2018 third quarter SG&A as a percent of net sales. Despite the significant negative impact of these disaster related expenses, we were able to gain SG&A leverage even as we continue to invest in the business and in opportunities for long term growth. We expect to continue investing in strategic initiatives that we believe will extend our runaway for growth. ","Moving down the income statement, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20% compared to 35.8% in the third quarter of 2017. This decrease is primarily attributable to the lower Federal Tax Rate in the 2018 period as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. ","Finally, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.26, which includes an estimated net negative impact of $0.05 related to the hurricanes and disaster related expenses that I just mentioned. It is important to note that in the fourth quarter we also expect to report about $0.04 in expenses related to the third quarter hurricane. These third and fourth quarter expenses are both incorporated into our updated guidance. ","Turning now to our balance sheet which remains very strong, merchandise inventories were $4 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2018, up 10.6% overall and up 4% on a per store basis. We believe our inventory remains in great shape and we are focused over the long term on managing inventory growth to be in line with or below our sales growth. Further, our ability to generate significant cash flow from operations also continues to be a great strength to the business. ","Throughout the first three quarters of 2018, we generated strong cash flow from operations totaling $1.5 billion, an increase of $371 million or 32.5%. Year-to-date the third quarter of 2018 total capital expenditures were $551 million and included our planned investments in new stores remodeled and relocations, continued investment in two distribution centers under construction and spending related to the previously announced acceleration of certain key initiatives. ","During the quarter we repurchased 2.8 million shares of our common stock for $298 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $77 million. Through the end of the third quarter we returned a total of $879 million in 2018 to our shareholders through our share repurchases and quarterly dividend payment. ","From the inception of our share repurchase program in December 2011 to the end of the third quarter of 2018, we have repurchased $5.8 billion or 88 million shares of our common stock. At the end of the third quarter, the remaining repurchase authorization was approximately $706 million. ","Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and we continue to be disciplined and focused on financial returns. Our first priority is investing in high return growth opportunity, most notably in new store expansion, as well as infrastructure to support future growth. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividends, while maintaining our current investment grade credit ratings and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA.","Finally, moving on to our updated fiscal 2018 guidance which replaces the guidance we provided on August 30, 2018, let me remind you about some of the key drivers. As we've noticed throughout fiscal 2018, our earnings outlook include our current expectations regarding the impact of transportation cost headwinds, sales mix margin pressures and investment in our strategic initiatives. Our guidance also reflects our year-to-date result and outlook for the remainder of the year, including the higher than anticipated disaster related expenses for both the third and fourth quarters, primarily due to hurricane Florence and Michael. ","For fiscal 2018 we now expect net sales growth to be approximately 9%. For same store sales growth we expect to be in the middle of our previously provided range of mid-to-high 2%. For fiscal year 2018 we now expect our operating margin rate to be modestly below our fiscal year 2017 operating margin rate. This reflects the greater than anticipated disaster expenses I mentioned earlier. ","Additionally we now expect diluted EPS for the full year to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.05. Our diluted EPS guidance now assumes our tax rate will be in the range of 21% to 22%. We are nearing the range of our expectations for capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 to $725 million to $775 million. Our outlook for fiscal 2018 real estate projects remains unchanged and we expect to repurchase a minimum of $850 million of shares, but will be opportunistic depending on our cash flow and other factors. ","We are pleased with our position as we enter the holiday season and we are excited about the business. We believe we are implementing the right actions to help mitigate headwinds and maximize our sales growth opportunities. ","As always, we are focused on carefully controlling expenses even as we make targeted, proactive investments. We continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with the goal of delivering consistently strong financial performance, while positioning our business for long term growth. ","We remain confident in our business model, and our ability to drive profitable same store sales growth, deliver healthy new store returns, generate strong cash flow from operations and create long term shareholder value. ","With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd. ","Todd Vasos ","Thank you, John. We are pleased with our financial results and are proud of the team's focus. I want to take the next few minutes to walk through how we are executing against our operating priorities and give you an update on the progress we are making on our long term strategic growth initiatives. ","Starting with our first priority of driving profitable sales growth, a portfolio of top line initiatives is contributing to the strong year-to-date performance we have seen through the third quarter of 2018. These initiatives are designed to enhance the value and convenience proposition for our customers, offering them the trust of simple solutions they seek from us every day. ","Our cooler expansion continues to be an important sales initiative, particular in mature stores. The team has done a fantastic job increasing the average number of cooler doors across the chain and we are seeing a great return on this investment. As of the end of the third quarter we have installed more than 20,000 cooler doors across our mature store based in fiscal 2018. Based on the success of this initiative, we anticipate continuing our cooler expansion efforts in 2019.","During the third quarter we also continued to ramp up optimized queue lines throughout select stores. The performance of these queue lines remains very strong, exceeding our own expectations. We now have the queue lines enhancement in approximately 7,500 across the chain. Given the continued success of this rollout, we anticipate expanding this initiative in 2019 as well.","We continue to be very excited about the early results from our Better-for-You initiative, which is performing well above our initial goals. We launched Better-for-You just a few months ago in response to feedback from our customers who are starting to look for healthier food options at affordable prices. We are very pleased to be able to provide these product options to our customers at attractive price points that fit their budget. ","Currently we have approximately 2,700 stores that are carrying a great selection of Better-for-You products, including several items under our Good & Smart private brand. In fact, over the last four week period of the third quarter, half of our top 10 unit movers within Better-for-You were Good & Smart branded items. We believe that the Better-For-You products appeal broadly to our customers and that we can rollout this offering to additional stores in 2019. ","In addition to these initiatives, we are excited about the holiday season and our product offerings, as well as several exciting sales campaign will be running. In particular, I'm excited to note that we are now offering the LEGO toy brand in all of our stores for the first time. Not only are we bringing the trusted and beloved toy brand to our customers during the holidays, we have also secured the only LEGO brand partnership within our channel. ","In addition to merchandising, our store operations teams are hard at work enhancing the customers shopping experience and driving productivity within the store. We continue to see improvements in overall customer satisfaction scores. We believe this is a direct result of our focus on friendliness, on-shelf availability, store cleanliness and speed of checkout. We monitor these metrics closely and we are continually talking with our customers. ","The data show the improvements in these areas are correlated with improved customer experiences, which we believe fosters greater loyalty and leads to sales growth. We have previously discussed our opportunities to further enhance gross margin. Our initiatives related to many of these opportunities are underway and continue to deliver results. ","For example, our efforts and investments in inventory shrink reduction continue to pay benefit through the quarter as we saw our eight consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in the shrink rate. Shrink improvement remains a near term gross margin driver and we are executing on multiple initiatives, including electronic article surveillance, defensive merchandising and increased use of technologies such as video enabled exception based reporting. We believe there is still runway for improvement, and we expect to see continued benefit from investments in these shrink initiatives. ","As we noted last quarter, we are successfully reducing shrink, while also increasing on-shelf availability. This balance is hard to achieve and can be tough to maintain. To further support our ability to sustain and drive on shelf availability even higher, we are putting a number of new initiatives in place to support and drive sales growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond. These efforts dovetailed nicely with our focus on driving customer traffic as well. ","In addition to shrink reduction we also have other longer term opportunities to enhance gross margin through a number of efforts. Starting with distribution and transportation, we continue to focus on reducing stem miles, improving load optimization, growing and diversifying our carrier base, and expanding our private fleet.","With regards to our private fleet, we remain on track to expand from 80 tractors at the end of fiscal 2017 to approximately 200 tractors by the end of the fiscal year. 200 tractors would cover approximately 10% of our outbound freight needs, but we believe the added flexibility and learnings can also help us down the road in the event of future carrier rate fluctuations.","We continue to evaluate opportunities to drive efficiencies and productivity within our distribution network to support profitable sales growth. Our distribution center is currently under construction in Longview, Texas; Amsterdam, New York, both remain on schedule to begin shipping in the 2019 calendar year. ","Other gross margin opportunities include our efforts around category management and private brands in particular. Throughout fiscal 2018 we have executed the strategy to promote our portfolio of value priced, high quality private brands. Our efforts have included a relaunch of our core health and beauty brands, studio selection, a refinement of our advertising strategy and shifted more of our circular space to showcase our private brands and advertising campaigns that highlight compare and save options versus national brands, and of course our money back guarantee on private brands. ","Foreign source [ph] remains an opportunity over the long term as well. Currently our efforts include strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs on Dollar General and our customers.","Over the last several years we have directly imported approximately 5% to 6% of our purchases at cost. With the current tariffs in place, including the most recent wave at 10%, we have a relatively low exposure on direct imports. Depending on the scope of future rate increase or expansion of products subject to tariffs, it could have a more significant impact on our business and on our customer\u2019s budgets. ","Given that backdrop, the team is working diligently to mitigate the impact where possible and to minimize the need for price increases. Short term, we did opportunistic forward buying to get in front of the tariffs on some items. We have long standing relationships with our vendors and we are working closely with them to find ways when possible to reduce cost. This could include shifty manufacturing to other countries, reengineering the product or finding substitute products that are not subject to these tariffs. ","In addition to the potential tariff impact, we are watching key economic factors that impact our customers. While the economy appears to be doing well, we know that our core customer is always challenged. With concerns about healthcare, inflation and rent expenses and fluctuating gas prices, we know she remains very concerned about our budget. Our customers are at the center of everything we do and we remain committed to serving them with the everyday low prices they have come to know and appreciate from Dollar General. ","Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven high return, lower risk model for real estate growth continues to be a core strength of the business. In addition to the tremendous contributions from new stores, our remodeled program continues to add significantly to our growth. Collectively these real-estate efforts have allowed us to extend our run way for the long term growth. ","As a reminder, our real estate model focuses on five metrics to ensure that new store growth is the best use of our capital. These metrics include new store productivity, actual sales performance, average returns, cannibalization and the payback period. We have consistently hit our overall goals for these metrics and we are very pleased with our overall new store returns and we remain committed to invest in our capital effectively to drive strong financial returns. ","This year we shared with you our plan to execute approximately 2,000 real-estate projects, including 900 new store openings, 1,000 mature store remodels and 100 store relocations. We are on track to achieve these goals by the end of the fiscal year. ","This year through the end of the third quarter, we have opened 750 new stores, remodeled 925 stores and relocated 92 stores. Of the 925 remodeled stores, 359 were remodeled into the Dollar General Traditional Plus format or DGTP, which is the traditional store size with an expanded cooler account. We included a fresh produce section in 107 of these DGTP remodels. ","As a reminder, our remodel store delivers a 4% to 5% comp lift on average and a DGTP remodel delivers on average a 10% to 15% comp lift, and when produce is included in a DGTP, it delivers a comp lift on average at the high end of that range. We currently have approximately 425 stores throughout the chain that carry produce. ","We are excited to announce our plans for 2019 real estate growth. For our fiscal year 2019 we plan to open 975 new stores, remodel 1,000 mature stores and relocate 100 stores. We are proud of the team's ability to support approximately 2,075 real estate projects in total. Of the 1,000 planned remodels, we expect approximately 500 to be in the DGTP format. We also expect to add produce to approximately 200 of these store. ","Over 975 anticipated new stores, we plan to open approximately 10 in the DGX format. As a reminder, DGX stores are about half the size of a traditional Dollar General store and have a product selection that is tailored to vertical living customers. We currently have three DGX stores, which overall are doing well versus our expectations. We are excited to continue investing in this innovative concept.","Our third operating priory is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low cost operator. Over the years we have established a clear and defined process to control spending. We continue to refine our process and have developed a culture highly focused on examining cost and expenses. ","Our spending is filtered through three criteria. First, is the customer facing; second, does it align with our strategic priorities; and third, how does it impact our risk profile? We continue to focus efforts in the stores on space optimization and simplifying our operations by reducing unproductive inventory, operating complexity and product movement within the stores. ","Our teams are focused on these efforts through optimization of our operations and leveraging technology in new and exciting ways. We will continue to focus on our underlying principles to keep to the business simple. while moving quickly to capture growth opportunities, control expenses and always seek to be a low cost operator. ","Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people, as we believe they are a competitive advantage. Our investments in wages continue to pay benefits in the third quarter. As of the end of the third quarter, store manager turnover was trending toward our all-time best on record and our time to fill open positions was also at an all-time best. We continue to monitor the wage averment carefully and believe we remain well positioned across the organization as illustrated by robust applicant flow at every level. ","As we have seen the market change, we have proven that we are able to and ready to adapt to any change. We have continued to place an emphasis on employee engagement and our recent actions reflect our commitment to listen and respond to their feedback. ","In 2018 alone we have expanded the benefits we offer employees to address a number of their needs. For example, we now offer expanded paid parental leave for mothers and fathers, adoption assistance, day one access to benefits for store managers and a new dress code policy for store employees that they really seem to like. ","Coupled with existing benefits, such as tuition assistance and college course credits for store manager training, we believe we are providing our employees with a comprehensive set of benefits, and perhaps more importantly, we are continuing to communicate directly with our employees and giving them a voice. We believe all these factors have contributed to the increase in employee engagement scores that we have seen. ","Even with these great benefits, we still believe that the opportunity to build a long term career at Dollar General is the most important currency we have to attract and retain top talent. The ability to advance the higher pay-in and higher responsibility jobs in a relatively short amount of time provides a great opportunity for our employees to grow in meaningful ways, both personally and professionally. Remaining an employer of choice is an important priority for us and we believe we are well positioned to continue to attract and retain talent. ","Finally before I open the call for questions, I want to quickly update to our recent progress executed against our digital and non-consumable strategic growth initiatives. I\u2019ll start with our digital initiatives. ","In the near term our digital strategy remains focused on using technology to improve the in-store experience by offering customers even more personalization and convenience. Launched earlier this year, the DG GO! App is now live in approximately 250 stores, which completes our rollout for 2018. As a reminder, the app allows customers to use their phone to scan items as they shop and then skip the checkout line by using the DG GO! Kiosk. ","We estimate we currently have more than 20,000 active monthly users and the feedback on the app continues to be positive. It seems to be fitting very nicely with our customers shopping habits and creating even more convenient frictionless shopping experience. We know that our customers who more frequently engage with our digital tools tends to shop with us more often and check-out with larger average basket. ","We currently have more than 15 million subscriber accounts within our Digital Coupon program, including 1.3 million new subscribers in the third quarter alone. These subscribers equip more than 700 million coupons this year in 2018. Deploying innovative technology across our stores remains an incredible opportunity for us and we are investing accordingly. We look forward to continuing to test, analyze and learn as we look to further enhance the use of technology. ","Turning to our non-consumable initiative, in the second quarter we began a test of a bold, new and expanded assortment in key non-consumable classes, home, domestics, housewares, party and occasion. As a reminder, this initiative is focused on first, offering a new differentiated and limited assortment that will change throughout the year; second, displaying the new offering in high traffic areas with improved adjacencies and increased focus on key classes to enhance the in-store experience and create a sense of purchase urgency; and third, continuing to deliver exceptional value by pricing the majority of the offering at $5 or less. ","While the amount of space that we dedicate to non-consumables remains the same, we believe this merchandising strategy will drive greater sell through and enhance gross margin over time. We have added this assortment to approximately 600 stores and are on track to have approximately 700 total stores up and running by the end of the fiscal year. ","We are still in the early stages. That said, we are now working through our third replenishment cycle in the first of the stores where we launched this initiative and we remain encouraged by the results we've seen. ","In closing, we delivered another solid quarter and we are proud of our results. We continue to be excited about our business and believe we operate in the most attractive sector in retail. We have a differentiated business model that leverages our real estate expertise and our low cost operating experience, with our laser focus on delivering value and convenience to our customers. ","I want to thank our more than 135,000 employees across the company for their dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others. Your comment was certainly on display this quarter as you rallied around our communities in need. ","As we enter the busy holiday, I also want to express my gratitude to all employees for your hard work, helping our customers save time and money every day. You are our most important resource and we appreciate your contributions to Dollar General\u2019s success. We are excited about our position and we are working hard to finish out 2018 strong and head into 2019 with great momentum. ","With that operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Todd Vasos","Good morning.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So on the gross margin line, I was hoping for a more holler in terms of some of the puts and takes as you look out for Q4, and also just some initial thoughts on what headwinds you think will continue into next year. ","Todd Vasos","Yes, so I\u2019ll talk about the performance thus far and then talk about in the direction of questions in terms of what we see looking forward. ","You know as you look year-to-date our gross margin is down 10 basis points. In Q3 we did see some increased near term pressures from carrier rates, tariffs, you know coupled with the ongoing headwinds we always manage through with mix and mark down pressures. ","As we look to \u2013 ahead in the near term, you know I think these pressures will continue with the carrier rates and tariffs. The team continues to mitigate those and has done a really great job of that, but it's hard to say how long those pressures will persist. But I would say as I look over the long term, we still see an opportunity to grow our gross margin, enhance it, reinvest in the business as needed. ","You know as we look at the levers, there\u2019s multiple levers within gross margin an SG&A. As you look at gross margin, we continue to see great performance from shrink, eight consecutive quarters of sequential improvement there and with the investments we\u2019ve made, the process rigor, we see that continuing. We just completed putting 10,000; you know growing our EAS cadence from 5,000 to 10,000 and seeing great results there. ","The team does a great job of category management. We continue to see opportunity to increase our private label penetration, our core and sourcing penetration and our non-consumable sales. We are pleased to see positive comps again on our non-consumables and as Todd mentioned, we are pleased with what we are seeing from the non-consumable initiative. ","And on the supply chain side, you know while we do have the headwind of transportation costs facing everybody, the team is doing a great job. It has been proactively mitigating that. We continue to open new DC\u2019s to opening this year, which will reduce stem miles, continue to reduce load optimization, drive DC productivity. We are very pleased with the results we are seeing from our private fleet as we stepped that up from 80 to 200 tractors based on the success we've seen and continue to expand and diversify our carrier base. So a lot of levers here within gross margin. ","As we look at the SGA, you know we are pleased to leverage our SG&A again for the second consecutive quarter since we anniversaried the investment we made last year in our store manager compensation, which is paying off very nicely for us. So as you look across all these, while this is near term headwinds, over the long term we see an ability to enhance our gross margin and operating margin overall if we found out all the levers within operating margin. ","Rupesh Parikh","Great. And a quick follow up; so LIFO provision seems to be a bigger headwind this quarter. Do you expect that to continue into Q4? ","Todd Vasos","Yes, if you look at the key drivers of the LIFO provisions, the $12.5 million we reported, it was primarily attributable to direct and indirect impacts of tariffs and increased transportation cost pressures; those do persist. But I will say as you look at Q3, because you are looking at the end of the year and because a lot of it occurred in Q3, we had to reflect the impact through the first three quarters there. But it will be an impact in Q4, a proportionate amount of that and to the extent anything else increases or decreases, that'll change the LIFO provision and all this is, of course is contemplated in our guidance. ","Rupesh Parikh","Great, thank you. ","Operator","The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays Capital. ","Karen Short ","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on that a little bit. So in terms of looking forward I guess, I mean I'm talking about \u201919, it seems that transport should mitigate slightly and it doesn't sound like you will have to be making any labor investments into \u201919. Can you maybe just give a little color on that if that\u2019s an accurate way to think about \u201819? ","Todd Vasos","Yeah, you know what I'll say as we look forward we\u2019ll be coming out with guidance later for next year, but what I would say is as we look for work, we continue to see ourselves as a double digit adjusted EPS grower. You know to your point, it\u2019s hard to say how long the carrier rate pressure will continue, but we feel we are very well positioned with the mitigating actions that we are taking as that stabilizes. ","To your point on labor, you know as we look at labor costs, we are very well positioned right now. You know with the investment we made in store manager compensation last year and now we had anniversaried that, we are seeing great results in terms of [ramp A] [ph] store. But that we've seen around store manager turnover and applicant flows and staffing levels and we see throughout the organization at the store level, we are very well positioned in terms of staffing and applicant flows. ","And as we look at it, you know we are competitive, you know not just on wages, but the other benefits that Todd mentioned that we've added this year for the overall compensation, as well as when you just look at the growth opportunities in Dollar General. That\u2019s a real compelling driver for people who want to join Dollar General, as they can advance rapidly through the organization and they are really looking at their career. ","So as we look at it, we are well positioned. You know we'll look market-by-market to make sure we stay competitive as we are now, but we don't see a major investment on the horizon, you know like we had to make \u2013 we made last year proactively. ","So as you look at the levers, the fundamentals of the business remain very strong. We continue to see a long run rate for growth with new unit development; we continue to see great store level economics and great returns; we continue to see our returns at the high end of that 20% to 20% after tax IRR, which again is burdened with the impact of cannibalization. ","The failed initiatives continue to perform well. We continue to grow units and share and we have multiple levers as I mentioned within gross margin, SG&A and in turn the business generates a tremendous amount of cash, which we can reinvest in high return projects like new store growth, strategic initiatives and the infrastructure. So it's a very strong business model, a very resilient business model and we still see ourselves as 10% growth over the long term. ","Karen Short ","Okay, thanks for that. And I just wanted to ask quickly about traffic. I mean traffic obviously was positive in the third \u2013 or second quarter and then it went flat this quarter. Maybe just a little color and how we should think about traffic in 4Q and I am just wondering if there was any hurricane impact on the traffic? ","Todd Vasos","Yeah, you know as you look at traffic, we are surely focused on driving that top line to include that traffic that you mentioned. Being flat we would like to have seen a little bit more on the traffic side, but I have to say the actions that the team has taken to drive that top line is really paying benefits in a fuller basket shop, and that's really where we are seeing the benefit right now. ","But I could tell you that the team right now as I mentioned in my prepared remarks are squarely focused on 2019. As you can imagine we are six months out or longer and stay tuned as we roll out our \u201819 initiatives. There\u2019s some really good initiatives around driving both that top-line and the traffic number into \u201919. We feel that long term, the traffic number being positive is one of our most important currencies. ","Karen Short ","Great. Thanks very much. ","Todd Vasos","Absolutely.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Michael Lasser ","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question Todd. So year-to-date your comp is trending just below 3% in your comparison in the fourth quarter and your guiding to maybe 2% to 2.5% as implied by your outlook. Why wouldn't it be better than that? Have you seen a slowdown to start the fourth quarter?","Todd Vasos","Yeah, what I would say is as you look at \u2013 your first looking at Q3, we saw stable performance throughout the quarter. If you look at the first period of the quarter versus the last period of the quarter, they were comparable and solid throughout and positive on both consumables and non-consumable. ","As you look at the full year guidance, it was a minor adjustment. You know we had said previously that we were looking at mid to high on comp growth, anchored both towards the middle of that. And I think if you do, the math on that doesn\u2019t suggest a material change in the trajectory there. Again, we feel very good about the initiatives in place and how they are performing, the fundamentals of the business and continuing to share all the channels of our retail.","Michael Lasser ","And my follow-up is, did you tweak your guidance on the cost side largely because of the hurricane. Can you give us some more depth on what\u2019s specifically driving the $0.09 incremental headwind? How many stores were impacted? Is this mainly due to store damage and lost sales, and just something else going on? ","Todd Vasos","Yeah, so as you alluded to, with the guidance change it was primarily driven by the $0.09 impact of the unanticipated disaster related expenses. As we called out, that was primarily driven by hurricane Florence and Michael and within that you know the type of \u2013 we hadn\u2019t disclosed the number of stores impacted, but you know what I will say is as you look at our footprint, we are particularly dense in coastal Carolina and costal Florida, as well as in rural areas where a lot of the heaviest damage was. So we had a high store concentration there. ","As you look at the nature of the cost, it was store damage and repairs, inventory damage were the key drivers there. As we did mention while hurricanes were the primary driver here, that cost figure that we provide also included the impact of other disasters, most notably flood and fires. Again, that were rather usual in nature above and beyond the normal run rate that we assumed, and that was the primary driver for guidance today, as well as just other miscellaneous puts and takes. ","Michael Lasser ","Were there any other significant callouts that motivated you to adjust the guidance or maybe you can give us a little bit more detail on those?","Todd Vasos","You know I would say that if not for the impact of the disasters, you know the $0.09 impact we wouldn\u2019t have seen the need to adjust the guidance. You know within the other penny there, there is various puts and takes that I mentioned, including you know the higher transportation costs and tariffs net impact on LIFO, but obviously \u2013 you know but then there are a lot of puts and takes on that, on the penny. ","Michael Lasser ","Thank you so much and good luck with the rest of the year. ","Todd Vasos","Thank you, Mike. ","Operator","The next question will come from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Paul Trussell ","Good morning. ","Todd Vasos","Good morning. ","Paul Trussell ","Still a lot of moving parts regarding the tariff conversation, but could you just give a little bit more detail on how your business has prepared for the potential of incremental tariffs, the impact your seeing in the P&L today and to what extent you have already mitigated some of those additional potential costs in 2019? ","Maybe just taking a step back on gross margins, you outlined earlier John a number of positives and tailwinds on the gross margin front, but if we look back over the last five years, you know I think gross margins are down roughly 90 to 100 basis points. How should we think about maybe the longer term opportunity on gross margin and where that can get back to? ","John Garratt","Sure Paul. So as you look at the tariffs, obviously we like a lot of folks out there in retail, we are very proactive around the possible tariff impact that we saw coming down. We took a lot of proactive steps, including as we talked about mitigating steps to order some products in a little bit early, so some opportunity to move some products in a little earlier, we did that. ","We've been working diligently with our community overseas, particularly in China, our offices there and our vendor community to ensure that we can reduce some costs. We got great relationships, big relationships with those vendors over there, those factories and players and we\u2019ve been able to do a lot around reducing some of the cost to also move around some of these tariffs. ","And then lastly, we continue to move our product and look to ways to move product out of China. That\u2019s not a phenomenon that happens overnight, but if you go back, we've been talking about moving product out of China for quite a while and not being so China centric. We\u2019ve been working hard at that. So I believe we're a little bit ahead of the game there. We continue to work hard to move product lines and different opportunities to move things out of China itself. ","You know as you look at gross margins, you know just in general, I would say the team has done a really good job in the environment that is out there right now. I could tell you that we've got a lot of leverage that we continue to pull in gross margin as John has indicated and we continue to work really hard around making sure that whatever we do at the end of the day is that we've got the right price for the consumer and that's always top of mind for us. ","And I believe you see through our surveys that we are in very, very good shape on pricing, because at the end of the day in long term, that will be the real test for the consumer on your health as a company and we believe our share gains as of late have come because of our pricing, our pricing activity and that's always been there and always will continue to be there. But we stay really focused on margins to deliver both at top line and the bottom line. But operating margin is really where our focus is and we\u2019ll continue to work all the levers. ","Paul Trussell ","Thank you very much and just a quick follow up. I appreciate you giving your forward guidance regarding store expansion and remodel opportunities. Maybe just quickly give a little bit more detail around what you see as the white space opportunity. Are these doors being opened and mostly you know these are back filling current markets. To what extent are you looking to penetrate urban markets and also what have you seen in terms of your latest class of stores from a productivity and return standpoint?","Todd Vasos","Sure. You know as you take a look at it, the team\u2019s done a great job over the years. One of our core strength is finding the right opportunity out there, the right real estate and then opening stores and over the years Paul, we've done a very good job in really watching the key metrics that we talked about. I can tell you that the latest class of stores in 2018 have been coming right out of the ground just where we thought it would, so again you know right in that upper 90% to 100% of performer range and that continues to be right where we believe the sweet spot is. ","And as continue to look out, we think there's a tremendous amount of runaway still to open up stores in the continental United States. The class of 2019 will look very similar to the class of 2018 as far as the make up between rural, metro and more urban type setting. So again, heavily driven toward the little bit more, driven toward the rural communities. But yes, over time we believe that opening more and more stores in metro is the right thing to do and we have strategic goals and opportunities and initiative centered around that that we are going talk about a little bit further as you move into 2019. ","But sufficed to say that our formats that we've developed over the years has really given us the opportunity to open the white space up and we still believe there's 12,000 to 13000 opportunities to put a Dollar General store out in the continental United States and in areas that you know are not as familiar as evidenced by opening 10 next year DGX stores is what our goal is, and those are in vertical living, more densely populated areas in some key cities out there across the US. ","So we feel as good as ever about a real estate portfolio and to include our or remodel program which is very, very strong and continues to throw off fabulous comps as we continue to move forward too. So we got a great runway ahead of us and we are capitalizing on that very quickly. ","Paul Trussell ","Thanks for the color. Best of luck! ","Operator","The next question will come from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Vincent Sinisi","Hey, great! Good morning guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to go back one second, just to the revised outlook. You know kind of the puts and takes and tell me if I'm thinking about this correctly as well. ","Right, if you kind of take the midpoint of your new guidance on the EPS lines from the commentary you know around the EBITD, you have done a great job of telling kind of what the hurricane impact is and then if you kind of though add the lower tax rate benefit in there, it seems like there's still a little bit just kind of more of a core EBITD you know decline there. ","From the commentary it sounds like that's largely, you know really around the gross side with the transportation costs and tariffs. I guess is that kind of a good sum up? Is that true? And are there any other factors for 4Q specifically that we all should be thinking about? ","John Garratt","I think that is a good summary. As you stated, the biggest driver there was the hurricane, disaster related expenses and as you look at that other penny, there are puts and takes. You know in retail you are always battling through mix and markdowns and we've been doing that for years very well. ","I think the piece that adds a little extra pressure this quarter is and look for the near term is the higher transportation costs and tariffs, but I think that was a good summary overall, and again over the long term we see a lot of levers to not only mitigate these, but enhance gross margin and operating margin. ","Vincent Sinisi","For sure. Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up, this is kind of a more of a big picture thought. You know when we are thinking about kind of the future of you know how you continue to generate solid ticket and traffic, you talked about numerous initiatives of course as well as you know kind of mix changes and tests and formats. ","It seems at least like you know with some of the store growth plan and different formats on the smaller ones and the plus, I guess the basic question here is, you know what are some of the bigger learnings so far and while maybe \u201819 store growth is going to be similar to \u201918, you know kind of how do you see the mix and also maybe the makeup on the sizes of the stores, maybe changing going forward? ","Todd Vasos","That's a great question. We look at that obviously very often internally and we actually build our initiatives around those very thoughts and I could tell you that we intentionally develop these additional format to be able to move into certain demographics across the U.S. where a one size fits all mentality is really not the way to be productive and to make the most of your real estate portfolio and of course driving top line and traffic as you indicated. ","So having those opportunities to put stores for instance, with a produce selection in the areas that are more food deserts in the United States, both in the rural communities and by the way in more metro settings, we find that we can drive a tremendous amount of traffic that way. ","Same thing with our cooler expansion that we've been very, very open about over the last many years. I would tell you that if you are thinking about a baseball game here, we are still probably only in the bottom of the fifth inning when it comes to our cooler expansion opportunities, both in our mature store base and of course as we continue to refine our Dollar General Plus and DGTP concepts with broader cooler expansion in them. ","And again I think as you look at this, our consumers are voting with their pocketbooks and we are driving nice comps through the box today and when you look at these remodels throwing up 10% to 15% comp lift in DGTP with these additional coolers and then the high end with produce, we feel that we've got a real good runway ahead of us to continue to drive both traffic, tickets and overall sales very profitably, you know which is our first priority out there that\u2019s driving that profitable sales growth. So overall we believe that portfolio is very strong. ","Now as you move in the outer years, you will see a mix change to a \u2013 it won\u2019t be a radical change, it'll be a slow methodical change to a little bit more of a heavier metro mix as we continue to build the portfolio out. But it will be \u2013 we\u2019ll signal that very well over time and we\u2019ll make sure that in fact we do it very methodically. And again as I indicated, we'll talk about in 2019 some initiatives we have around our urban setting and our urban initiatives that we are working on very hard right now out there. ","Vincent Sinisi","Okay, super helpful color. Thanks very much guys. Best of luck!","A - Todd Vasos","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ","Aaron Grey","This is Aaron Grey on for Matt Boss. Thanks for the questions. As we think about your underlying EPS profile, are we right to think that ex the impact of hurricanes and tax reform we are still on track to hit roughly around 10% EPS growth for the year? And then as we look forward any change to your ability to drive double digit EPS growth for the next few years? ","John Garratt","No I think that the way to look at it, as you look at this year we feel very good with the guidance we provided, that that provides a very strong top line, bottom line performance for the year while reinvesting you know our initiatives and is consistent with that long term goal of driving double digit adjusted earnings per share growth. ","And as I mentioned earlier, as we look over the long term we continue to see ourselves as a double digit EPS grower with a strong fundamentals of the business on new store growth with the performance Todd mentioned, driving comp growth with the initiatives in place, continuing to grow units and share with a number of levers we have within operating margin I mentioned and the tremendous amount of cash this business generated to reinvest. We see this as a strong resilient business model with the fundamentals in change and I think that\u2019s the right way to think about it. ","Aaron Grey","Okay great, thanks. And then on SG&A, are we still right to think about 2.5% to 3% as underlying fixed costs for the fourth quarter and then also as we look into 2019? ","Todd Vasos","Well, we don't break down you know guidance specifically between SG&A and gross margin by quarter. We did give the overall guidance for the year, but I would say our goal remains to leverage SG&A in that 2.5% to 3% range and we are pleased to have done that. The two quarters, the last two quarters since we anniversaried that important investment in our store manager compensation and other long term allows levers to do that and that\u2019s our goal and intention.","Aaron Grey","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Operator","The final question is from Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please go ahead. ","Garrett Klumpar","Hey guys. It\u2019s actually Garrett Klumpar on for Greg. Thanks for letting us in. Just wanted to touch on the DG GO! App. You continue to see you know pretty good growth there. Just wandering, you know you called out improving the in-store experience is the biggest near term on digital, but just wondering if we can get a little more color on what specifically you think are the key areas of improving that convenience offering for customers. ","John Garratt","Sure. You know we talk to our customers all the time and as you know convenience is measured differently depending on what customer you ask. But I could tell you that we are squarely focused on making the convenience offering within our four walls even more convenient. You know again we are very convenient as far as where we are located. We are very convenient, you can park at the front door, walk in, you can get in and out of our stores with a five or six item shopping experience in less than 10 minutes; five in most cases, but you know what our consumers are also saying, how do you even get more convenience? ","So the DG GO! App does that, where she can skip the checkout line by checking herself out and what we\u2019ve seen is good adoption so far with that app. Again, only 250 stores like everything here at Dollar General, we test and we learn before we move and roll out and we want to make sure that the return is as strong as we believe it'll be for this initiative. So stay tuned, more to come. We believe that we are on the right track, because again it's about making sure that our consumers have a frictionless shopping experience, quick in and out and we give her exactly what she wants here at Dollar General. ","Garrett Klumpar","Alright, great. Thanks so much. ","Todd Vasos","Thank you. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve reached the end of the allotted time for the Q&A session. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, Jennifer and welcome to everyone joining our call. We ended 2018 on a strong sales note with a 4% comp in the fourth quarter. While we certainly faced various challenges throughout the year, we believe 2018 was a great year for our employees, our shareholders as we remain squarely focused on taking care of our customers.","As we head into 2019, we are excited to have so many new opportunities ahead of us. During today's call, I will cover five main topics. I'll start with key highlights from the fourth quarter results. Then, I'll update you on our progress and outlook for our digital and non-consumable initiatives. Third, I'll lay out two new strategic initiatives we are excited to be launching. Fourth, I'll give you an update on the results we are achieving with our operating priorities. And finally, I'll finish with our operating plans for fiscal 2019. John will provide you with some 2018 financial highlights, guidance for fiscal 2019 and our perspective on Dollar General\u2019s long term growth.","Turning to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial performance, we delivered a very strong top line in the fourth quarter with net sales increasing 8.5% to $6.6 billion compared to net sales of $6.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full fiscal year, net sales increased 9.2% to $25.6 billion compared to net sales of $23.5 billion in fiscal 2017. The strong net sales performance throughout fiscal 2018 was balanced between performance from both new stores and mature stores. ","During 2018, we continued to gain market share in highly consumable product sales, which was a key driver of our strong sales performance. Syndicated data shows that we had mid to high single digit growth in both units and dollars over the 4, 12, 24 and 52 week periods ending January 26, 2019. For full year comp sales, we posted a 3.2% growth rate for fiscal 2018, marking our 29th consecutive year of same store sales growth.","Given the overall strength of the economy in 2018, this continued growth underscores our belief that our business model can perform well in all economic cycles. We\u2019re proud to continue our legacy of serving the underserved by providing them with the value and convenience that they have come to expect from Dollar General.","As I mentioned, we finished the year with a very strong 4% same store sales growth rate in the fourth quarter. This growth resulted in our highest two year stack in 21 quarters and our third consecutive quarter of accelerated two year comp stack growth. The fourth quarter top line performance was driven by growth in both average transaction amount and customer traffic. This quarter's average transaction amount growth included expansion in average unit retail and increased units per basket.","Driving profitable traffic is paramount to the health of our business over the long term. This quarter, we took steps to continue providing our customers with terrific value and focus on promotional activities that allowed us to take share from multiple classes of trade. We believe we can sustain these share gains in 2019 and that these investments attracted customers who will continue to shop at Dollar General.","These actions were especially important in the fourth quarter, given the increased seasonal sales volume seen across retail industry during this time of year. We achieved our goals of growing traffic and market share and continue to broaden our overall customer base. We were also pleased to deliver another quarter of solid growth in non-consumables. ","We were particularly excited about our performance in the home category, which led overall comp growth in the fourth quarter. The team is doing a great job in this category, which led to our best performance in home in many years. This is the first time in quite a while that we've seen a non-consumable category out-comp consumable growth.","During the fourth quarter, we believe same store sales benefited from the acceleration of February SNAP payments during the government shutdown. Based upon analysis of EBT sales, we estimated this created an approximate 70 basis points benefit for same store sales.","As we head into 2019, we believe we have compelling opportunities to gain more market share, drive profitable traffic to our conveniently located stores and deliver more the products our customer seeks at the value she needs. We remain focused on these opportunities and after John\u2019s discussion, I look forward to sharing how we are targeting our efforts in 2019.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Garratt","Thank you, Todd and good morning everyone. I would like to walk you through the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year and then I'll take a few minutes to discuss our fiscal 2019 financial guidance. I\u2019ll also provide you with some thoughts on our long term business perspective. Unless I specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year.","As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which as a percentage of sales was 31.2% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 91 basis points. This decrease was partially attributable to higher markdowns. As Todd mentioned, this quarter, we proactively invested in promotional activity to drive traffic and market share and we believe we remain well positioned against all classes of trade and across all geographies where we operate. ","That said, pricing is always competitive in discount retail and we watch the environment very closely. In 2019, our strategy is to further optimize our promotional activities, as we focus on driving profitable sales and traffic growth. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was also negatively impacted by lower initial markups on inventory purchases, an increase in the LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables country, which generally has a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories, and the sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of sales within the consumables category. Partially offsetting these items was lower inventory shrink.","SG&A, as a percentage of sales, was 21.6%, a decrease of 34 basis points. The decrease was driven by reductions in repairs and maintenance expenses, benefits costs and incentive compensation expenses and lower utilities as a percentage of net sales. Partially offsetting those decreases were approximately $11.7 million in hurricane related expenses due to two hurricanes, which occurred during the third quarter of 2018 as well as a $2.2 million year-over-year increase in other disaster related expenses, both of which were greater than anticipated in our original fiscal year 2018 forecasts. As a reminder, 2017 fourth quarter SG&A expense included costs related to accelerated store closures.","Moving down the income statement, our effective tax rate for the quarter was an expense of 21.2%. This compares to a negative 18.9% tax rate in the fourth quarter last year, which was a benefit. The benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, at the new lower federal corporate tax rates as result of federal tax reform. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.84, which includes an approximate $0.04 negative impact of disasters, the majority of which was driven by hurricanes that occurred in the third quarter.","Turning now to our balance sheet, which remained strong at the end of fiscal 2018. Merchandise inventories were $4.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2018, up 13.5% overall and an increase of 7.3% on a per store basis over the end of the 2017 fiscal year. Inventory levels increased in the back half of fiscal 2018, as we brought in inventory to stock our new Longview, Texas distribution center. Additionally, as we discussed with you last quarter, we proactively made some strategic and opportunistic forward inventory buys, in part due to concerns over potential tariff increases. These buys aimed at keeping overall costs low contributed to the higher inventory level at year end.","As we noted in recent quarters, we have been successfully reducing shrink, while also increasing on-shelf availability. This dynamic is difficult to both achieve and maintain. In 2019, we are taking action to update our inventory replenishment cycle to support even higher levels of on-shelf availability for our customers every day, while continuing to take actions designed to further reduce shrink. We believe our inventory quality is in great shape and our goal remains to drive inventory growth that is in line with or below our sales growth over time. ","Fiscal 2018 was another year of strong cash flow from operations, which totaled $2.1 billion, an increase of $341 million or 18.9%. Total capital expenditures for 2018 were $734 million and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocation, continued investments in construction for two new distribution centers and spending related to the previously announced acceleration of certain key initiatives.","During the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of our common stock for $360 million and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $75 million. For the full year, we returned a total of $1.3 billion in capital to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. ","The remaining repurchase authorization at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately $346 million. And yesterday, our board approved an additional $1 billion in incremental share repurchase authorization. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and we are focused on financial returns. Our first priority is investing in high return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth. ","We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends, all while maintaining our current investment grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio approximately three times adjusted debt to EBITDA.","Turning now to fiscal 2019. This year, we expect our core business to continue to deliver strong growth and allow us to invest in our ongoing strategic initiatives as well as the two new ones that Todd will discuss in greater detail shortly. Overall, our long term financial performance goals remain squarely focused on delivering strong growth in net sales, comp stores sales, operating profit and diluted EPS, which is also supported by our financial strategies. ","In some years, we will balance the decision to invest with delivering on our long term goal of double digit adjusted EPS growth. We believe that net sales, comp store sales, operating profits and diluted EPS are the core metrics that you should be focusing on in order to gauge our progress. ","I will now provide you with our outlook on these metrics for 2019. For fiscal 2019, we expect net sales growth of approximately 7% and comp sales growth of approximately 2.5%. Moving on to profitability, I'd like to share a few insights with you. We are of course laser focused on operating profit and operating profit margins. In 2019, we expect to grow operating profit by approximately 4% to 6%. Our goal is to improve operating profit margin over time and we believe we are making the right operating decisions and investments to achieve this goal.","This year, this means that we will be making investments in strategic initiatives, including DG Fresh a supply chain initiative, as well as Fast Track, an in-stock productivity and customer service initiative. While both of these initiatives are still in the early test phase, we believe these investments will allow us to enhance our operating margin profile over the long term. The associated investments however will pressure SG&A rates in the near term. ","With this as a backdrop, I\u2019ll now provide you with a few other insights into overall gross margin and SG&A spend for 2019. First, the changes to our inventory replenishment cycle that I mentioned earlier will have an initial gross margin price tag, mostly due to the impact on product inventory mix. In addition, there will be a working capital outlay required. There is correlation between on-shelf availability and sales. And we believe these changes will position us to support and drive top line growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond.","Second on transportation. While we have seen some signs of stabilization in a more balanced marketplace, we anticipate that we could see continued transportation cost increases in 2019. Third, on tariffs, our guidance assumes that the government maintains current tariff levels and the guidance does not contemplate any increases in rates or any additional tariff and accidents. ","We believe that the first quarter gross margins will be the most pressured on a year-over-year basis and that we will see improvements in the year-over-year comparison as the year progresses. Regarding SG&A, we will have startup expenses related to the two new initiatives in addition to ongoing investments in other strategic initiatives. In total, we expect to spend approximately $50 million on these strategic initiatives in 2019, the majority of which will be in our two new initiatives. ","We expect these investments to pressure SG&A, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year. While these SG&A investments should improve gross margin and overall operating margin over time, they will move our SG&A leverage range above 2.5% to 3%. That said, we believe these investments will be accretive as early as 2020. Given these gross margin and SG&A expense factors, we expect operating margins to be more pressured during the first half of the year. ","Based on these dynamics, we are providing fiscal 2019 diluted earnings per share guidance of $6.30 to $6.50. Our diluted EPS guidance assumes an estimated effective tax rate of approximately 22% to 22.5% in 2019. Overall, our capital spending in 2019 is expected to be approximately $775 million to $825 million, as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives and general business needs to drive and support future growth.","In terms of cash distributions to shareholders, yesterday, our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share, which is an increase of approximately 10% compared to the fourth quarter 2018 dividend. In fiscal 2019, we plan to repurchase approximately $1 billion of our common stock. We are pleased with our strong position, as we enter the year and we are very excited for our plans for 2019. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing in initiatives for long term growth. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing operating priorities to drive profitable same store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long term shareholder value.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, John. I'm proud of the team's execution that led to strong results this year and feel confidence that we're making the right investment and operating decisions that will allow us to extend our runway for profitable growth. ","Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes providing you with an update on the progress we have made on our digital and non-consumable initiatives and outline two new transformational strategic initiatives that we're launching. Starting first with digital, in 2019, our digital strategy will remain focused on using technology to further enhance the in-store experience. We are confident that we can use technology to create a more personalized and convenient shopping experience for our customers.","In 2018, we launched the DG GO! app, which allows customers to use their phones to scan items as they shop, see a running total of the items in their basket using our card [ph] calculator and then skip the checkout line by using the DG GO! kiosk. The app has been popular with our customers and through the end of fiscal 2018, we had more than 140,000 downloads and exited the year with approximately 25,000 monthly active users, despite only having DG GO! kiosk in approximately 250 stores.","Pending performance data, our goal in 2019 will be to expand this offering to more stores. We have engaged with our customers to understand how they are using the app to learn how we might improve it further. One key learning is that our customers are using the card calculator frequently, even when they're not using DG GO! kiosks to check out. We believe they're using the card calculator to stay within their budgets and optimize their shopping dollars. ","Based on this, we recently launched card calculator in approximately 200 stores. Throughout the first half of 2019, we intend to roll out this useful tool for our customers in the majority of our stores. We have invested and upgraded Wi-Fi to facilitate in store use of this and other digital tools.","Having a user friendly and helpful suite of digital tools is becoming increasingly important to our customers and therefore, to Dollar General. We know that our customers who more frequently engage with our digital tools tend to shop with us more often and check out with larger average baskets. In fact, their baskets on average are about twice as large as those of non-digitally engaged shoppers.","Currently, we have more than 15 million digital coupon subscriber accounts, and more than 900 million digital coupons were clipped in 2018. Our goals in 2019 are to increase our subscriber base and perhaps more importantly, the frequency of use. We want to make sure that users are engaged with our app more frequently to save time and money. This means that we will be launching digital marketing strategies, focused on customer acquisition, retention and engagement. Our goal is to use personalization to drive both sales and gross margin benefit over time.","Finally, as we continue to test and learn within our digital strategy, we plan to pilot buy online, pick up in store offering in the second half of fiscal 2019. We are in the early stages of many of these efforts within our digital strategy and we are excited about the potential and the opportunities that lie ahead.","Turning now to non-consumable initiative or NCI. In 2018, we began our test of a bold new and expanded assortment in key non-consumable categories of home, domestics, housewares, party, and occasion. With the amount of space dedicated to non-consumables that remains the same, we believe this merchandise strategy will drive greater sell through. The NCI offering was added to approximately 700 stores as of the end of 2018, and we plan to have it in approximately 2,400 stores by the end of 2019.","It is important to note that while it is still relatively early, we have now worked through multiple replenishment cycles and we like the momentum the reset is generating. We are seeing improvements in traffic and sales as well as meaningful improvement in category mix and gross margin within these stores. We believe this offering will continue to generate excitement for our customers, as it rolls out more broadly.","Today, I'm excited to introduce two new transformational initiatives that we are rolling out in 2019. The first initiative is one that we call DG Fresh. The DG Fresh initiative is a strategic multi phase shift to self distribution of perishable goods, primarily fresh and frozen. We believe this initiative will allow us to accomplish three key goals. ","First, it will allow us to reduce product costs, which can have a meaningful impact on our gross margin in the coming years. Second, it will facilitate higher in-stock levels of these goods, which should help to drive sales. And third, it will allow us to control our own destiny in fresh foods, most notably by distributing perishables ourselves, we can carry more of the fresh products and brands our customers want.","These include better for you items and national brands. Today, there are many items we cannot cost effectively procure through our current model. In addition, self distribution will allow us to offer a wider selection of our own private brands to provide our customers with even more compelling value. Overall, we expect DG Fresh to allow us to do a better job of tailoring our product selection to fit the needs of our customers, particularly in rural areas.","While our initial focus is on distributing the types of fresh and frozen products we already carry, this approach also provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more of our stores in the future. We launched this initiative early in calendar year 2019 and we are currently distributing to approximately 300 stores in the northeast from a new Cold Storage Facility we own in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.","By the end of this fiscal year, our goal is to be serving as many as 5000 stores from up to four new DG Fresh distribution facilities. Beyond 2019, our goal is to fully implement DG Fresh initiatives chain wide within three to four years as an annual rollout phase similar to what you see in 2019.","As John mentioned, the startup costs for DG Fresh will be a headwind to SG&A this year. However, we expect this initiative to be meaningfully accretive to sales and operating margin over time. The transition to self distribution has been relatively smooth, which is a testament to the strong relationships we have with our vendors, the support of our distributors, and our proven ability to execute complex projects. We are excited about the potential for this initiative.","The second new strategic initiative we're introducing today is Fast Track. Fast Track is a two pronged approach to increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability. Driving our performance higher in these areas will be foundational to our ability to execute on our buy online, pick up in store pilot later this year. ","In addition, we believe that our success with Fast Track over the long term can create significant SG&A savings. The first key component of Fast Track involves streamlining the stocking process in our stores, which we call one touch unloading. This new approach is designed to make stocking shelves simpler and faster, reducing the amount of labor needed to complete this task.","It will begin with fundamental changes at the distribution centers where we will make, which we will make processes even more store friendly with products and deliveries sorted by locations within the store. Our focus is on reducing the amount of time spent stocking the shelves following a truck delivery, allowing us to get products on the shelves more quickly. We also believe we can reduce the amount of time that our store associates spend restocking shelves in between deliveries.","The second component of Fast Track is self checkout option. This self checkout will allow customers to scan and pay for their items with little to no assistance needed from our associates. Dollar General is known for value and convenience and our customers have told us that speed at checkout is vitally important to their in-store experience.","Ultimately, Fast Track should help boost on-shelf availability and free up labor hours that we can dedicate to other in-store priorities such as customer experience. Our goal is to pilot Fast Track in several of our distribution centers and select stores during 2019. Following the pilot, we will determine the best plan for a broader rollout.","Like the DG Fresh initiatives, Fast Track will also have an upfront cost that will impact SG&A. At scale however, we believe this initiative will be accretive to our SG&A profile and well worth the investment. These are just a few examples of how we continue to be an innovative leader in our channel.","We're excited about these long term strategic growth initiatives, which are fully aligned with our ongoing commitment to our four operating priorities. As you will recall, our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. We have a robust pipeline of initiatives in place to drive growth in 2019. Our most impactful merchandising initiative continues to be our cooler door expansion. As we head in to 2019, this remains a significant opportunity. Coolers are a great traffic driver and they allow us to offer even more of the products our customers want. In fiscal 2019, we plan to install more than 40,000 cooler doors across our store base.","In 2018, we launched our Better For You initiative, which introduced healthier food options in more than 2500 stores. This offering was in direct response to conversations with our customers who told us they wanted healthier options at affordable prices. We are pleased with the initial customer reception and the performance of this product set. We intend to offer the Better For You products in approximately 6000 stores by the end of 2019.","Our new, good and smart private brand has gained traction with our customers and we are positioning it as a core product line in Better For You. In addition to good and smart launch in 2018, we had great success with the launch of Studio Selection, our aspirational health and beauty private brand. In 2019, we're planning a similar private brand launch in baby products.","I'm also excited to announce that we\u2019ll be launching a new private brand and cosmetics in April. We remain dedicated to the beauty category at Dollar General and we believe we can continue to take share from all classes of trade. Having a premier private brand is an important part of our strategy. The new DG private brand will be called Believe and will include an inspiring lineup of attractively priced cosmetics that we think will be appealing to our customers.","This cosmetic line is just one part of our ongoing efforts to capture share in the health and beauty category. From efforts focused on the growing bath and body segment to enhancing the shopping experience in this section of the store with more intuitive signing and product placement, we have a lot of opportunity to drive HVA sales.","Across private brand, we continue to believe we can increase sales and penetration, which could have a meaningful impact on both gross margin and sales growth over the long term. In 2018, we conducted a holistic review of our private brand portfolio and are incorporating what we've learned into our 2019 go to market plan. In addition to sales driving initiatives, we continue to pursue opportunities to enhance gross margins. ","In 2019, we intend to roll out electronic article surveillance units to approximately 3000 stores. We expect to complete this rollout by the end of the second quarter, bringing the total for the chain to approximately 13,000. Beyond this ongoing near term opportunity, I'd like to give you a brief update on other longer term gross margin opportunities. ","First, within distribution and transportation, we have continued to execute our strategy to reduce stem miles. I am proud to note that our distribution center in Longview, Texas, began shipping in January and it is ramping up very quickly and we expect our distribution center in Amsterdam, New York to begin shipping later this year.","As at the end of 2018, we successfully expanded our private fleet to approximately 200 tractors, up from 80 at the end of 2017. In 2019, we plan to expand our privately fleet further. While this fleet remains a small piece of our overall transportation needs, we believe it continues to provide strategic flexibility.","Finally, foreign sourcing remains a long term gross margin opportunity. We are specifically focused on diversifying country of origin as well as growing overall foreign sourcing penetration. We believe there are many countries around the world where we can source goods at even greater value for our customers.","Our second operating priority is capturing growth opportunities. As we enter 2019, our proven high returns, low risk model for real estate growth is a core strength of the business. We have a long standing track record of successfully opening hundreds of stores every year that meet our strict return thresholds. The flexibility of our model has allowed us to invest in new formats, store growth, and a remodel program, all with strong returns that contributes significantly to our growth. ","Our store format innovation allows us to expand our addressable market opportunity as well. This innovation will continue to play a key role in 2019, as we plan to open 975 new stores to serve communities across the country. Our real estate model continues to focus on five metrics. These metrics help us determine that new store growth remains one of the best uses of our capital.","We continue to see great results with new store sales performing at nearly 100% of pro forma expectations and returns near the high end of our 20% to 22% goal. We are proud of our track record for executing successful real estate projects. In 2018, we completed a total of 2065 real estate projects, 65 more than we had originally anticipated.","For fiscal year 2019, we plan to remodel 1000 mature stores and relocate 100 stores. We expect approximately 500 remodels to be in the Dollar General traditional plus or DGTP format. We also expect to add produce to approximately 200 stores, the majority of which will be DGTP remodels.","As a reminder, our traditional remodel stores which have approximately 22 cooler doors deliver a 4% to 5% comp lift on average in year one and DGTP remodels with approximately 34 cooler doors delivers a 10% to 15% comp lift on average in year one. DGTPs with produce are at the high end of this range.","Over the past two years, we have conducted an exhaustive pilot of our DGX stores and during that time, we have refined and enhance the concept. We are now confident that we can drive profitability in this smaller box and we plan to open approximately 10 DGX format stores this year. DGX stores are about half the size of a traditional Dollar General and have a product selection that is tailored to vertical living customers, particularly millennials. We are excited about these plans for continued growth and innovation in 2019.","Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low cost operator. Over the years, we have established a clear and defined process to control spending. This process has served us well and the entire organization has embraced a cost control mindset. In our stores, we continue to manage expenses through the efforts such as optimizing product assortment, reducing operating complexity, and reducing product movement within the stores. ","One of the reasons we are so excited about our Fast Track initiative is that we believe it has potential to be a significant and incremental driver of store level efficiency. ","Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people, as we believe they are a competitive advantage. Our ongoing dialog with our employees is critical and we learned from these conversations to reinforce our position as an employer of choice. In 2018, we greatly expanded our benefits to include those that resonate most with our employees, including paid parental leave for mothers and fathers, adoption assistance and day one access to healthcare benefits for store managers.","We also launched new training programs, including a private fleet driver training program for distribution center employees to complement other existing educational benefits such as tuition assistance and college course credits for store manager training. And I am very proud to announce that for the eighth consecutive year, Dollar General was named to Training Magazine's top 125 training list, ranking number one overall on this, the most recent 2019 list.","In 2019, we are expanding our benefits to include day one eligibility for telehealth benefits for all employees in our organization. Our part time employees told us they need help assessing affordable healthcare and we believe this will be a valuable benefit. We always monitor the wage environment carefully and believe we are well positioned across the organization, as illustrated by robust applicant flow at every level.","Our investment in store manager wages and training continued to pay dividends in 2018 and we finished the year with our lowest store manager turnover rate on record. We are also doing very well at the store level where we are seeing our time to fill open positions at all time best levels for the company. We think our competitive compensation and benefits package is compelling. But we believe that the opportunity to build a long term career with a growing retailer is the most important currency we have to attract and retain talent.","In 2019, we plan to create approximately 8000 net new jobs. This growth creates an environment where employees have opportunities to advance to higher paying and higher responsibility jobs in a relatively short amount of time. Being an employer of choice is a priority for us and we will continue to seek out opportunities to enhance our employee experience.","In closing, 2018 was a very good year for Dollar General. The business is in great shape as we enter 2019 and we're excited about the future. As John mentioned, our long term goal generally remains to deliver double digit adjusted EPS growth. To do this, we need to make smart business decisions that focus both on growing the top line and capturing incremental operating margin where and when we can. Today, I have highlighted how our progress on our initiatives and operating priorities contributed to a great 2018.","Looking ahead, we believe we are making the right long term strategic investments from a position of strength. With our business model that leverages our real estate acumen, low cost operating experience and our laser focus on delivering value and convenience to our customers, we believe that Dollar General\u2019s business is differentiated from the rest of the retail landscape.","I believe we have the best team in consumable and I hold each person on my senior team accountable for delivering today and planning for tomorrow's growth. I am confident that no one on the team will be satisfied with anything less. I am proud of the team's innovative approach to retailing, the strategic initiatives they have put forth in motion and the financial performance we are driving, we continue to be the leader within our channel.","We believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors of retail and we have confidence that our strategy and execution will allow us to continue to reach our goals. Finally, a heartfelt thanks to each and every one of our more than 135,000 employees for the hard work that they do every day, which allows us to fulfill our mission of serving others.","With that operator, I\u2019d now like to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi","So just wanted to go, of course, to the incremental investments on the initiatives this year. With obviously still early stages around fresh and whatnot, can you just give us a little bit more of a sense, for that 50 million specifically, like how much at least directionally of maybe a lift to comps you think that could provide earlier on and then, how much of that may be recurring as you ramp some of these initiatives going forward? I guess, obviously, everyone kind of on the line today is just saying, kind of okay, a bit below the double digit growth algorithm for this year, but when can that maybe return if that\u2019s of course helpful context?","Todd Vasos","Okay, a couple of questions there. I'll start with the first one around the initiatives. As you look at the initiatives, as we said, we see these as being accretive as early as next year. The two new ones we talked about, our Fast Track and Fresh, we're very excited about both. As you look at Fresh -- we see both of them helping the top line and the bottom line.","As you look at fresh, the immediate impact we see from that is helping our gross margin, helping reduce our product costs. Now that does come with upfront expenses, particularly in SG&A and there's a trade off for SG&A for gross margins. But we're very excited about what that can do, not only to our costs, but then also our flexibility and longer term what that could mean in terms of, as we expand our fresh offering and in stock availability there, we think that can be a meaningful sales driver.","On Fast Track, that has two parts to that, you have the self checkout piece and then you have the one touch shelf stocking piece. The latter will have the more immediate impact and we're starting to do that now and we\u2019ll scale that over the course of the year. The self checkout will take a little bit more time with the technology involved in driving the adoption on that. So, these are sizeable investments this year, they'll pressure the SG&A, but as we look out, we see them as being accretive as early as next year, having a meaningful impact on our overall operating margin, EPS growth and really positioning us with the long term in line to drive double digit EPS growth over the long term.","Vincent Sinisi","And then if I could, last quarter, you guys had mentioned and we've been getting quite a bit of questions around it, just kind of your internal surveys, the confidence was looking a little bit shaky, potentially for kind of later this year, but it was nice to see of course in the release today, that ticket and traffic were both positive. So any updates there, any work, any thoughts around what you're seeing the basket around the house? That would be great. ","Todd Vasos","Yeah, I would tell you, we talk to our core customer each and every quarter. And while she is feeling better about having a little bit more money in her pocket, she continues to tell us that it is definitely from productivity, meaning working more hours, and in some cases, multiple jobs. But what she is also telling us is that she is feeling a little less competent than she was at the middle of last year to the end of last year, which gives us a little bit of pause from the standpoint that we think that our core customer is starting to weaken a little bit, which obviously we do very well in all economic cycles. So we're positioning ourselves for the back half of the year for a little weaker consumer, as we move through the year.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan.","Matthew Boss","So maybe can you speak to the proactive promotional actions that you took in the fourth quarter, any higher level changes in the competitive landscape that drove the change and just how best to think about markdowns in gross margin in 2019?","Todd Vasos","Yeah. I'll start and then turn it over to John for \u201819. We really went after some targeted markdowns in Q4. As you know, Q4 has the highest traffic counts across retail, not only Dollar General and we've got a track record here of working the price levers pretty well and we know which ones to work for the stickiness of the customer, meaning, we pulled some promotional levers in the fourth quarter that we believe will sustain that traffic growth in to Q1 without having to be nearly as aggressive. And we saw -- we went at it from a position of strength and we saw a real opportunity to take share, as we went through Q4. It did exactly what we thought it would do and positions us very well going into the first quarter here in 2019. ","John Garratt","And as Todd said, with this helping drive traffic and picking share in our belief that we can retain these customers, we believe we're very well positioned going into 2019 to further optimize our promotional activity, while at the same time, driving profitable sales and traffic. So we feel we're very well positioned.","Matthew Boss","And then just a follow up on the same store sales. So help us to think about the cadence this year relative to the 2.5% for the year. It sounds like we should anticipate the first half better than the back half, just given what you've seen in your surveys. But have you seen the momentum continue in the first quarter, despite tax refunds and some pressures that others have cited?","Todd Vasos","Yeah, I'd start by saying the fundamentals are very strong. We're really pleased with the impact that our initiatives are having and the share we're taking. There is a bit of a timing impact to start the year. We talked about the benefit from the acceleration SNAP payments from early Q1 into late Q4. That did have a bit of an impact on the beginning of the quarter, not necessarily dollar for dollar, but I would draw that timing to your attention. Other than that, it's a pretty smooth year in our minds and everything's firing on all cylinders.","Operator","The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","So just going back to your commentary in the press release about generally double digit EPS growth going forward, is that more of a reflection that this year is going to be low 10% and you expect to get back to potentially next year and beyond. Or","is there something that changes your confidence in that metric?","John Garratt","The comment we made there and I'll start by saying we continue to see ourselves as double digit EPS growers over the long term. That comment just meant to say that we reserved the right in some years to make targeted investments to drive that long term growth and protect that 10% growth.","Rupesh Parikh","And then just on gross margins, I appreciate the color that you provided on Q1. So, it sounds like we should expect, as comparisons get easier that that decline versus what we see in Q1 should progressively get better as the year progresses, is that the right way you guys are thinking about the cadence?","John Garratt","Yeah, I think you're thinking about that the right way. We talked about a couple of pressures at the beginning of the year. One of the things we talked about is changes to inventory replenishment. We've seen a very high correlation between on-shelf availability and sales. And as such, we're making investments beginning of the year, bringing more inventory and to make sure we're right in stock. This will have a Q1 price tag due to the impact on product mix. But as we cycle through that, that'll normalize. The other thing is, as the year progresses, we expect to start to see some benefits from the initiatives we're putting in place like Fresh and others to enhance gross margin. So as you look at the year on a year-over-year comparison, we expect that to improve as the year progresses.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","So if you're successful with some of the initiatives that you're rolling out this year, should we expect you to accelerate the rollout of them next year, such that 2020 would be another year of sub 10% EPS growth?","Todd Vasos","Michael, thanks for the question. As you know, here at Dollar General, we do everything very methodically and we make sure that it has a solid return before we move to a broad scale rollout. In saying that, we really like what we see from DG Fresh early on, and we have great confidence in our Fast Track momentum as well, especially around some of the digital efforts of -- that we have to include the self checkout option that will be coming.","In saying that, as John indicated, we believe that that these initiatives will become accretive as we move into next year. So should help offset some of those pressures, as we continue a broader scale roll out. A little bit of a pay as you go, if you will, type of a rollout schedule.","Michael Lasser","So just to clarify, you're looking at 2019 as more of a transitional year, returning to the algorithm over the longer run this next year.","John Garratt","As we indicated, there are startup costs associated with this, as we start to scale these as Todd said, it\u2019s more as that pays for itself as it goes and we expect these to be accretive as early as 2020.","Michael Lasser","And then could you break down the gross margin from the fourth quarter in a bit more detail. You outlined the promotions, what piece of the gross margin drag was that and then initial markup, so now a drag on gross margin, how did that work?","John Garratt","Yeah Walking through last year, we articulated the specific Q4 drivers that I guess stepping back and taking a broader look, if you look at the full year, our gross margin was down 32 basis points, but we're very pleased with the results where we drove traffic. We took share, delivered very good comps. We did invest the margin in opportunistically and promotional activity at Todd mentioned, but this clearly resonates with our customers, allowed us to take share. There was a very high take rate here and help us deliver the sales and we believe that this will stick and we'll be in a position next year to rationalize these investments. ","The other impact was with SNAP. While that did benefit our sales with that pull forward, there was a mix impact that came with, in general, lower mix of those additional sales. And then the team managed through the headwinds of tariff in transportation costs. As we go into this year, as we said, we believe we're very well positioned that we can throttle back, be even more targeted on our promotional activity, while still driving traffic and sales. We believe we have opportunities to increase margin over time with the new initiatives like DG Fresh and the NCI initiative. Shrink, where we've had nine quarters of year-over-year improvement and the other levers that we talked about. We think we're very well positioned.","Operator","The next question will come from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Keith","I wanted to dig into the comps that you're getting from new stores and from remodels. Historically, that's been in a range of 1.5% to 2%. But it's interesting with the DGTP acceleration and some of the fresh initiatives, it seems like there's an accelerated lift. I'm curious if you're starts with to the high end of that 1.5% to 2% range or even potentially above it, sort of a structural impact to your comp?","John Garratt","Thanks for the question. I would tell you that, we're very happy with not only our new store pipeline, but our remodel relocation pipeline as well. And I think you're thinking of it right in that because of the ramp up of our remodels, especially in the DGTP format to include produce in many of those stores, we\u2019re closer to the high end. I wouldn't say that we have broken out of that range that we talk about, but we're more at the high end of that range with some of the work that we've done.","Peter Keith","And I did want to dig into a little bit on how you're talking about the accretion benefits in 2020 from the growth initiatives. I guess in reality, when you look back at the last three years, the guidance for 2018, you really haven't been at 10% earnings growth for really any of the year, so if you exclude the tax changes, are you saying that you do think you will be at 10% plus by 2020 and that these overall initiatives, as a whole, will be accretive to next year.","Todd Vasos","Yeah. I\u2019d just reiterate that over the long term, we see ourselves as double digit EPS growers. We're not giving specific guidance at 2020 at this point, but we do feel very good about the initiatives and their ability to be accretive next year. As you look at the fundamentals of the business model, we feel very good about what we're seeing from our new store growth with the great returns on the sales from those with what we're seeing on a comp basis with the performance of the initiatives and the comp we\u2019re seeing. ","We see, as we said, a lot of opportunities over the long term to improve our operating margin. We really look at operating margin overall. And we believe, we're making the right investments here to enhance that operating margin. It comes at a little bit of a cost now, but we believe this positions us better for the future. And we continue to generate a tremendous amount of cash which allows us to reinvest in these business as well, paying back significant amount to shareholders through share repurchases. So, we don't see the future differently.","Operator","The next question is from Ed Kelly with Wells Fargo.","Ed Kelly","I just want to start with the clarification, when you talked about the impact of SNAP in February, not having the same dollar for dollar impact, are you saying that the headwind in February was not as big as the benefit that you saw in January?","Todd Vasos","That's exactly what we're saying. We have not seen a dollar for dollar impact. I think that really goes to what I talked about earlier, some of those investments we made in markdown being very sticky and we know our customer very well. And when you get to change her shopping patterns, she sticks with that. And we saw that as we moved into Q1.","Ed Kelly","And then just curious as to, you only have a couple of weeks, but how March has looked, given that things kind of normalize there, refunds seem to be picking up and then just one other question about all those, did you mention that there is some conservatism built into the comp guidance around the back half of the year. I'm not sure if I heard that right.","Todd Vasos","I'll take the first one. But, we really are talking really much about Q1 right now, obviously, but I would frame it this way. We feel very confident in our top line sales, due to all of the initiatives that we have in play, including the investment we made in Q4. And just keep in mind, March has an Easter shift in it. I think that's important towards the end of the month, but for us, we\u2019ll equalize as we move through April. So we're bullish about the quarter, but we have a lot of quarter left to go and John, you may want to address the other ones.","John Garratt","Yeah. Other than the timing impact we mentioned, the overall year comp we guided to reflects our current view of the year.","Ed Kelly","And then Todd, just one quick follow up for you on DG Fresh, why now on this on self distribution and can you just help us understand the benefits, like what type of margin opportunity is here from known as yourself, like, why do in stocks improve with more frequent deliveries and what does it tell us about your plans for fresh?","Todd Vasos","Yeah, so why now? I think the best way to answer that is that we continue to expand our cooler program here. It's been one of the biggest traffic drivers and one of our biggest comp drivers that we've seen. We have a series of distributors out there today across the country and those distributors do a nice job for us, but it comes at a cost and that cost is very high as you can imagine in many cases a full service program. So, we see a real opportunity from a position of strength right now to take that in house and control your own destiny and the way we see sales and margin enhancements here is a couple of ways.","Number one on margin, not having to pay that very hefty upcharge, we're going to build a bank, the majority of that with a little labor that we're putting in the stores to help work the goods again coming off of the full service program, but margins will be very accretive with this program. ","And then the second thing is sales. What you're going to see is our ability one to stay in stock, number two, longer term what you're going to find from us, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is going to be a different assortment that's going to really take into account a lot of our private brand offerings, which will help our margins and our sales, but also on items that we don't carry today because of the distributed network that we have. So we're very excited about this. ","This is probably one of the biggest margin opportunities we\u2019ll have shorter term to really move the needle here.","Operator","The next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","I guess I'm still a little confused on some of the markdown commentary, so I know you guys have talked about the pricing environment being pretty benign and you're comfortable with where your pricing is. So can you help us understand a little bit better why you engage in that promotional activity that you did? Number one. Number two, how does it benefit 1Q, even as you pull back promotions? I guess I'm a little confused on that. Thanks.","Todd Vasos","Yeah, sure. So the way we look at customer and customer traffic again, as I mentioned, we talk to our customer every quarter. What she was telling us is that she was feeling a little weaker than she was middle of the year and we took an opportunity from a position of strength to take share. We saw where we could take share in many different DMAs across the country. And we thought the best way to do that which turned out to work pretty nicely was to do it on a promotional basis, because we feel very confident in our everyday shelf pricing that we have today. ","And so we did it on a promotional basis and we know this customer very well, we know if we can change our shopping patterns, especially in the busy fourth quarter when we have her attention, it is, she's very sticky, she'll stay with us and I think we've seen some of that as we entered Q1, evidence by the not for dollar to dollar trade off back on SNAP as an example. So we believe that it did exactly what we thought and we've said in the past, we reserved the right to go in and make these investments periodically to continue to drive traffic and continue to take share and that's exactly what we did in Q4.","Scot Ciccarelli","And then just curious, was traffic positive kind of throughout the quarter?","Todd Vasos","Yeah. It was pretty stable throughout the quarter, the back half a little stronger than the first, but I would tell you, we're pleased overall with the traffic in Q4.","Operator","The final question will come from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America.","Robbie Ohmes","Todd, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the long term profit outlook of DG Fresh. So can you just sort of create a picture for us, if you do roll this out, over the next three to four years, how does the income statement change, are you expecting a sort of a secularly higher gross margin and kind of permanently higher expense ratio and what are the kind of long term assumptions about what store sales productivity levels have to be to make this all work on a large scale basis. And, you've mentioned some, how you're taking more of your distribution in house a little bit. I mean, does that have to accelerate more significantly to support being -- doing fresh on a very large scale basis, maybe just help us understand the three to five year outlook for how much this could change your entire store base, it's probably more complicated to operate this category as well. Thanks.","Todd Vasos","Yeah, that's a great question. And I would first start by saying that, as we look at the DG Fresh initiative, we see a real opportunity to drive both that top line and the margin. So I would look at it this way, it'll be a significant margin driver as we move into 2020 and beyond. And that's really driven primarily off of the distributor costs that we pay today which has a substantial up charge attached to it, substantial and as we work with our vendors, which we've got relationships with all of them, what we're finding in the first 300 stores and first DC that we put in were substantial reductions in cost of goods to move the product into our own DCs and distributed ourselves. So I think you would need to look at it that way.","On that top line, I think it'll be a meaningful top line contributor as well as we continue to be better in stock because we can -- we know how to distribute goods, fresh, shelf stable, whatever it may be, controlling our own destiny there gives us high confidence that we can execute at a much higher level than we were seeing across the country. We had some distribution voids, quite frankly, across the country. And we still do with our distributor network, because it is so complex and so large by taking into the house, we believe that will simplify our network and be able to execute that much better and as you continue to look out, we see opening these DCs about the same pace as 2019, so an average of 5000 to 6000 stores a year for the foreseeable future until we're built out. And, we believe that these fresh distribution centers, we will be able to leverage as well some of our dry goods that perhaps we can deliver out of there as well, taking some of the pressure off of our larger DCs, so we believe it's a win-win across the board, which should see substantial P&L ramifications on a positive side, as we move into 2020 and then beyond.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation in today's conference call.

My name is Lindsay, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today is Thursday, December 5, 2013. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference.","Mary Winn Gordon","Thank you, Lindsay, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com, under Investor Information, Press Releases.","Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, objectives, predictions, anticipated financial and operating results and other non-historical matters. Some examples of forward-looking statements discussed in this call include our 2013 forecasted financial results and anticipated capital expenditures, our planned operating and merchandising initiatives for fiscal 2013, our share repurchase expectations, planned store openings for fiscal 2014 and statements regarding future consumer economic trends. Forward-looking statements are based upon management's beliefs, assumptions and expectations about future events and operating results.","Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning; our 2012 10-K, which was filed on March 25; our first and second quarter 10-Qs, our third quarter 10-Q, which was filed this morning; and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call.","We will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which as I mentioned, is posted on dollargeneral.com. This information is not a substitute for any GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.","Richard W. Dreiling","Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. Today, we plan to discuss the results of our third quarter, update you on our operating initiatives and share our store growth targets for 2014.","Our third quarter sales increased 10.5% over last year to $4.4 billion, with comp store sales up 4.4%. Both traffic and average ticket increased for the 23rd consecutive quarter, with customer traffic contributing most significantly to our sales increase. As we expected, the addition of tobacco products resulted in strong customer traffic growth throughout the quarter.","Consumables, which include tobacco and perishables, showed the strongest sales gains. For the second quarter in a row, we had comp sales growth on the non-consumable side of the business. Comp sales in both seasonal and home are positive, and we were pleased with our apparel performance. As part of our Phase 5 merchandising initiative to optimize square footage productivity, we reduced the selling space allocated to hanging apparel in over 4,000 stores. And in the third quarter -- excuse me, in the third quarter, and the results for meeting our expectations for both sales, and more importantly, increased profitability.","October Nielsen data indicates that we continue to increase our market share of consumables in units and dollars over the 4-week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week periods. Our market share in dollars continues to grow in the high-single digits.","The third quarter operating profit increased by 8% to $390 million or 8.9% of sales. Our gross profit rate decreased 61 basis points to 30.3% of sales, with the vast majority of the rate compression relating to strong sales of tobacco and refrigerated items. In addition, we leveraged SG&A expenses by 40 basis points as we continued our focus on expense control. Adjusted net income increased 10%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $0.72.","We're pleased to announce that we continued to return cash to our shareholders with an additional $200 million of share repurchases in the third quarter, and we increased our share repurchase authorization by another $1 billion, our single largest authorization to date.","Total inventories, including tobacco, which is incremental year-over-year, were up 11%, and on a per-store basis, were up 4%. We are pleased that we have begun to get our inventory growth back in line with sales growth. This is our lowest inventory growth rate since the 2012 second quarter.","In October, we reached another major milestone: The grand opening of our 11,000th store here in middle Tennessee. Our third quarter results were solid in spite of an aggressive competitive environment. Starting late in the second half of the quarter, we saw increases in the competitive share of voice in both print and electronic media. As has been reported over the last week, item and price intensity increased across all channels.","Before I turn the call over to David, I'd like to take the opportunity to congratulate Todd Vasos on his recent promotion to Chief Operating Officer, assuming the responsibility for store operations, merchandising and the supply chain. This is a very conventional alignment that I believe will strengthen the company and position us as well for future growth.","Since 2007, Dollar General has added almost 3,000 stores and nearly doubled in sales. I'm very proud of what we have accomplished and Todd has played a critical role in this amazing growth story.","I'd also like to welcome Dave D'Arezzo, as EVP and Chief Merchandising Officer. Dave joined the Dollar General team in early November, and brings more than 30 years of retail and consumer product experience across merchandising and operations. I worked very closely with Dave at Duane Reade before I joined Dollar General in 2008, and I'm confident he's a great fit for the Dollar General team.","I will take -- I will talk more about our operating initiatives in a moment, but now I would like to turn the call over to David.","David M. Tehle","Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Rick covered the highlights of our third quarter sales performance, so starting with gross profit, I'll share more of the details.","Our gross profit increased 8.3% for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, gross profit decreased by 61 basis points to 30.3%. As expected, the gross margin rate was impacted by a higher mix of tobacco and perishables, which have lower initial markups.","In addition, our inventory shrinkage rate was higher than last year and we incurred higher markdowns as expected. The margin compression was partially offset by a benefit from transportation efficiencies and lower fuel cost, as well as a favorable LIFO credit.","SG&A increased 8.5%, significantly lower than our sales increase. On an average per square footage basis, SG&A increased about 1%. As a percentage of sales, SG&A for the quarter was 21.4%, an improvement of 40 basis points. Contributing to this favorability was retail labor expense, which increased at a rate lower than sales. In addition, decreases in incentive compensation expense, health benefit costs and workers' compensation and general liability expenses, contributed to our SG&A leverage.","Costs that increased at a higher rate than the increase in sales include depreciation and amortization and fees associated with the increased use of debit cards. Interest expense for the quarter was $21.5 million, a decrease of $6.2 million, primarily due to lower rates resulting from the completion of our refinancing earlier this year.","Our ratio of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at 3.0. The third quarter effective tax rate was 35.6%, and includes a discrete tax benefit of approximately $6 million or $0.02 per share, relating to the reversal of reserves that were established in 2009. This reversal was associated with the expiration of the time period in which additional taxes could've been assessed.","GAAP basis net income increased 14% to $237 million in the 2013 quarter from $208 million in the 2012 quarter. And earnings per share increased 19% to $0.74 from $0.62 last year. Adjusted to exclude the discrete tax benefit in 2013 and certain items in 2012, net income increased 10.5% to $231 million and earnings per share increased 14% to $0.72. Year-to-date, we generated cash from operations of $761 million, a 10% increase over the 2012 period.","Capital expenditures totaled $444 million, including $167 million for upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $103 million related to new leased stores; $86 million for distribution and transportation; $65 million for stores we purchased or built; and $17 million for information system upgrades. Year-to-date, we've open 577 new stores, and relocated or remodeled 534 stores. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our new, relocated and remodeled stores, confirming our confidence in the relevance of our business model.","As Rick mentioned, we repurchased an additional $200 million of our common stock in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $420 million or 7.8 million shares, with approximately $224 million remaining under the existing authorization.","This week, our board approved an additional $1 billion for share repurchases. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we have repurchased 27.1 million shares, with a total cash outlay of approximately $1.3 billion and we plan to remain consistent, as well as opportunistic, in share purchases going forward.","In November, we signed an agreement to sell and lease back 233 of our own stores. This transaction is expected to close in January, and result net proceeds to us in excess of $200 million, which we expect to utilize to fund incremental share repurchases in 2014.","Now let's look at our outlook for the remainder of the year, which is basically in line with our existing guidance, but refined with only one quarter to go. We expect total sales for the full year to increase 10% to 10.5%. Full year same-store sales are expected to increase 4% to 4.5%.","As a reminder, there are 6 fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will likely impact our sales. We're also cautious with regard to the competitive environment and our customers' ability to spend on discretionary items for the holidays, as many continue to face tough economic challenges and uncertainties about the future.","Operating profit, excluding the items identified in our press release, is expected to be in the range of $1.745 billion to $1.770 billion for the full year, raising the low-end and maintaining the high-end of our previous guidance. Interest expense is forecasted to be approximately $90 million.","The full year 2013 effective tax rate, excluding the $6 million discreet third quarter benefit, is expected to be between 37.5% and 38%. Adjusted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $3.18 to $3.22, which is a $0.03 increase on the low-end.","For the full year, our earnings per share forecast is based on approximately 324 million weighted average diluted shares, which assumes approximately $620 million of share repurchases. Our full year operating profit and earnings per share guidance are based on adjustments consistent with those detailed in our earnings release for the year-to-date results.","Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million, that's down $25 million from our earlier guidance, primarily as a result of our efforts to reduce the cost of our new stores and remodels.","We continue to plan to open approximately 650 new stores for the full year or an additional 73 stores in the fourth quarter. Remodels and relocations are expected to total approximately 550 stores for the year, or 16 in the fourth quarter.","We have a proven track record of serving our customers and generating strong returns for our shareholders, and we plan to continue to build on that record.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick.","Richard W. Dreiling","Thank you, David. 2013 has turned out to be another difficult year for our core customer. Consumers are challenged by ongoing high unemployment and underemployment levels, higher payroll taxes, reduction in staff benefits and uncertainties over health care insurance and insurance costs, as well as unemployment benefits. All of these factors are contributing to erosion in consumer confidence. Yet our business model, a strong value in convenient locations, is based on consistently serving these customers in good times and bad, and we will continue to help them meet these challenges going forward.","Last quarter, I updated you on our major 2013 initiatives. We had completed our 2013 goals with regard to Phase 5 merchandising evolution and our cooler expansion, enabling us to expand our assortment of refrigerated foods. We are continuing to benefit from these efforts.","As I said earlier, the addition of tobacco products has had a significant impact on growth in our customer traffic, which I continue to believe is the most important metric with regard to evaluating the success of our tobacco initiative. We're very pleased with the progress we made in building our market share in tobacco. Going forward, we expect both traffic and transaction size to build as customer awareness of tobacco products in our stores continues to grow.","Looking at the fourth quarter, there are many moving parts making the quarter extremely difficult to read. Competition has gotten more aggressive on select traffic driving items, and consumers are overly cautious. All retailers will be dealing with the significant calendar shifts as the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas has 6 fewer shopping days, pushing sales closer to the Christmas holiday.","Thanksgiving, which came a week later than the prior year, was essentially at the end of the month for our customer, a time when she is more pinched than earlier in the month. All that being said, we had a solid Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, both comping positive. I need to also remind everyone that Black Friday was on a payday this year, and would have some influence on consumer spending across all channels.","We have a strong plan in place for the remainder of the holiday season and into January when our customers are restocking their pantries after the holidays.","Looking forward to 2014, we're putting plans in place that build on our commitment to our 4 key operating priorities: Driving productive sales growth, enhancing gross margin, leveraging process improvements and information technology to reduce costs and strengthening and expanding Dollar General's culture of serving others. We will share more details of our 2014 initiatives when we give guidance in March. But for now, I want to share some insight into our store growth opportunities.","We're very pleased with the results of our new stores, remodels and relocations over the past several years. We have continued to evolve our traditional Dollar General store and make this small box model even more relevant. We currently have approximately 900 of our traditional stores in the new DG 13 format, which is a more convenient layout, improved store signage and a refreshed yellow and black color scheme. This design is delivering a comp lift above what we have seen with our previous remodels.","Importantly, our customers are excited about the fresh look and shop-ability of this new layout. We continue to refine our Dollar General Plus model, which is similar to our traditional store, but with wider aisles and significantly expanded coolers.","The Dollar General Plus format works very well as a replacement for an existing traditional store, where customers already know and trust Dollar General and where there is also a demand for expanded refrigerated food offering.","And finally, we are continuing to test new ideas in our Dollar General Market concept. For example, in the third quarter, we added fuel pumps to one of our market stores in Alabama. So far, the store has surpassed our expectations.","At the end of the third quarter, we had 11,061 stores with 81.4 million square feet of selling space in 40 states. This year, we upgraded our site selection technology in order to fine-tune the way we look at opportunities for growth and to help us better understand the long-term potential of our small box store.","Our new model now estimates more than 14,000 additional opportunities for the industry, 40% higher than our previous estimate of 10,000. The sales and returns of our new stores, relocations and remodels are strong, and we believe that reinvesting in our business through store growth remains the best use of our capital.","In 2014, we plan to open approximately 700 new stores and to relocate or remodel approximately 525 stores, resulting in square footage growth of 6% to 7%. Our real estate pipeline is nearly 100% committed, and we are ahead of where we were this time last year. We're looking forward to opening some great new stores in 2014.","In closing, I want to recognize our leadership team and over 100,000 Dollar General employees who serve our customers every day. We're in the midst of the busiest season in retail, and our customers are depending on us for convenience and Every Day Low Prices that we provide them. I want to thank all of our employees for their contributions this year, and encourage them as we embrace the opportunities and challenges of the holiday season with enthusiasm.","Mary Winn, I'll now open the call up for questions.","Mary Winn Gordon","All right. Lindsay, we'll take questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'll start with the sale-leaseback you're thinking about doing. I think this is the first time you've done one. Two questions about it. The first is, kind of what you're thinking about the rate that you're going to get? Is it comparable with what you do when you do a lease directly with a landlord? And then the other question would be, are there more properties that you would be able to do sale-leasebacks on?","David M. Tehle","Yes, great questions, Meredith. I think, we're pretty consistent in terms of the rates. For competitive reasons, I don't want to state numbers out there. But, clearly, as we thought about this transaction and looking at it, we believe it's going to be accretive to Dollar General to do it. And as we said in the release, a large part of that cash will be applied to additional share repurchases. As we look in the future, it's a little too early to call whether we'll continue to do this on an ongoing basis. We spent several years buying stores back and we knew at some point, we would turn them and we would do exactly what we're doing today, have a gain, create cash and then use that to reemploy in the business, to increase the profitability of the business. So stay tuned on that one, and I would just say we'll be opportunistic as we look to the future.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then switching gears almost completely, you've talked about the competitive environment getting much more challenging. Could you talk a little bit about how you're responding, I think you talked about both media spending as well as actual prices that are being promoted. Can you talk about both of those?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I -- Meredith, I am a strong advocate of Every Day Low Price. I think when the market begins to get highly promotional, I think you're renting your sales rather than, really, driving people who are loyal to your operations. What we'll do is what we've always done, we're going to continue to focus heavily on Every Day Low Price, knowing that sooner or later the high promotional activity, sooner or later, runs out of steam. But along the way, we're not afraid to throw a few prices out there that we think will continue to help drive our already good traffic. In regards to incremental share of voice, we currently have a program that we run 2 ads in print through the course of the month. We invest basically all of electronic media back into our cost of goods, and focus on the retail. So we think we have a solid program in place that we intend to stick to. We think at the end of the day, EDLP wins and we're pretty comfortable with what our strategy is the back half of the year -- back quarter of the year.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And I just had one more question. You did get some benefit this quarter from lower incentive compensation. Could you just talk about why the incentive comp was lower? And whether that was a significant benefit to SG&A or margins?","David M. Tehle","Yes, and it's predominantly SG&A where you see that. Basically, the way our incentive comp is set up, we have a budget that we set every year, at the very beginning of the year, that's approved by the board in January. And all our compensation is based off of that budget. So what this -- and it's an aggressive budget, obviously, that's set. And because we're missing that budget, we don't accrue as much compensation because we won't be paying as high of a bonus payout or what we call team share in the company at the end of the year. And yes, to answer your question, the fact that we're spelling it out here, as well as in our filings in the 10-Q, it's significant enough that we felt like we need to point that out.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And it's the sales budget that's being missed?","David M. Tehle","No, it's really profitability. It goes to the bottom line profitability of the company.","Richard W. Dreiling","So in spite of the year we're having -- in spite of the good year we're having, it just kind of tells you that we entered the year with incredibly higher expectations.","Mary Winn Gordon","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Charles Grom with Sterne Agee.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Rick, could you speak to the progression of the comp in the quarter? And any thoughts on November? It sounds like it's been a little bit choppy. And then, Dave, if you could quantify what the lift was from tobacco and also what the corresponding hit was from these apparel reductions?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, as I looked at -- as I look at the quarter, our sales trends, the first part of the quarter, were very solid. I think as traffic driving initiatives in regards to price started to take place. We saw our sales in October a little bit lighter than they were in August and September. However, I still want to, Chuck, bring out that every week of the quarter, we had positive comps and every period we had positive comps. So while we saw an increase in competitive activity, we still felt pretty good where we were at. November, Chuck, I think all of retail is going to be looking at a very, very choppy November and December. We chased the calendar all through the course of the month in November. I think you had Thanksgiving come a week later. I think also, we have to be careful there was a pay period Black Friday. So I think that might have spurred some results on also. But saying all that, we had a good Thanksgiving and we had a good Black Friday. But we're just -- the calendar is very hard to read. And remember what's going on here with those 6 fewer days, everything is getting pushed closer to Christmas. And so we are -- we're optimistic on our plans, but we're being real cautious as we look at the month. And David, I think you should talk about cigarettes.","David M. Tehle","Yes, well, first, on the markdowns, the markdown -- if you remember, we had a timing issue between second and third quarter and we spelled that out that we actually had a plus last quarter from some apparel markdowns that we moved into the third quarter because of -- for weather reasons, we wanted to give the product more time to sell. And basically, those markdowns came in about where we thought they would come in. In terms of the impact, we don't -- Chuck, we don't actually -- we're not going to spell out the exact dollar amount of the basis points, but I will say that, again, they were up there. They were lower than tobacco and lower than shrink in terms of the impact that it had on the quarter. But again, they're high enough for us to be calling out. On the cigarettes around the tobacco, again, we continue to be pleased with what we're seeing there, particularly the impact on transactions, driving people to come into the stores, which we're very happy to see. And again, we're not going to be specific in terms of the impact on the comp. But again, we're pleased with what we're seeing based on our model and what we thought cigarettes would do for us.","Richard W. Dreiling","Chuck, I'll give you one more piece of information on the tobacco. When we started the tobacco journey, 1\/3 of our cigarette sales were by themselves, 1\/3 were what we would call a smoke and a coke, where they would grab a cigarette and maybe a soda or a chip. And then 1\/3 is where the cigarettes were actually going into a basket that was beginning to grow. We're now at the stage of the game that back 1\/3 where cigarettes are going into the actual basket is now at 44%. And cigarette purchases only are declining to 26%. So we're beginning to convert the cigarette customer into a shopper.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And I guess that supports your optimism for continued benefits from tobacco then?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. And remember, we talked, Chuck, about transactions that it drives. It's driving people into the store, then it's our job to convert it.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Great. And then my final question, just -- Rick, you've done a great job and so 7 [ph] improving sales per square foot back with the Phase 1 through 4 programs and on shelf heights and then more recently with Phase 5 on some of your legacy stores. When you think about the opportunities from here and the white space that you have, could you, maybe, flesh out some of your early thinkings for us?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I think as we move into 2014 and beyond, it's now about SKUs and really understanding their productivity. And now what we're doing is we're beginning the process of evaluating not only those SKUs but the categories that we have in the store. And the idea here now, and my favorite example is picture frames. When I got to this chain, I mean, we had 12- to 16-foot of picture frames. We're now down to 8-foot, which has allowed us to add an additional category. And now the challenge for us is where are picture frames going to be in another year or 2? And maybe we want to get ahead of the curve and do something that's more productive now. So now the journey is about maximizing SKU productivity for the next couple of years.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A question on the long-term store opportunity, raising it to 14 additional -- 14,000 additional locations for the industry from 10,000. Can you give us a little more color on what's driving that increase in the potential store count? And are you taking into account changes from what competitors are doing with their stores?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, John, it's a couple of things. Number one, there's no doubt the environment is creating more of our core customer. I mean, that's number one. But number two is we have a new software program that is allowing us to literally identify the corner of such and such where we can locate a store. Historically, we have gone in, and we've had several square box -- blocks where we can go. But now, so, what happens is you have this piece of software that allows us by taking into account competitive positioning where our customer is, being able to go in and take a look at the demographics, being able to go in and look at traffic patterns, how they flow, being on the going home side, not putting yourself at risk and it just, quite frankly, has swelled to 14,000. So a lot more analytics more than just demographics and it allows us to literally pinpoint where we can go. And it's all automated, which is really fascinating. It takes all the guess work out of it.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And as a follow-up to that, you discussed the lower CapEx budget and it sounded like it came out of some of the spend on new stores. Can you just talk about how much it's costing you to open a new store and the efficiencies you're gaining there?","David M. Tehle","Yes, I think -- and again, on our total budget, $25 million isn't a huge decrease when you're talking about the numbers that we're looking at. I think it's just a matter of doing a variety of things differently and driving some better procurement in terms of the vendors that we're dealing with, getting some better deals and things of that nature. So I don't think it's anything revolutionary. It's just doing the right thing every day and driving better relationships with our vendors.","Richard W. Dreiling","And John, if I could piggyback on that, we centralized our procurement operation the back half of 2012, and we're starting to see the benefits of that as we are -- we have one piece of the organization, particularly buying things that don't relate to what the customer is actually purchasing. And then we also have an initiative in place where we're actually taking some of the costs out of our new business -- out of our new stores, which we're very pleased with.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So on the gross margin front, how should we think about this line item longer-term in the P&L algorithm? Any opportunities with shrink and on the discretionary side into next year, just kind of larger picture, how you're thinking about this line?","David M. Tehle","Yes, I'll start and certainly Rick will jump in. I mean, as we go forward, and we've talked about this previously, we continue to believe that our private label, what we're doing in private label, as well as foreign sourcing, will continue to provide benefits to our model. Shrink, clearly, we've gone the wrong way on shrink this year and there is opportunity for that to turn overall. I think tobacco will be a negative next year because keep in mind that we only started selling cigarettes in the second quarter this year and they really started to kick in, in the June and July time frame. So in terms of some pressure, we'll be dealing with that next year, also. But I think we've got a lot of levers that we can pull long term on gross margin in terms of helping increase it and get some leverage out of it.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then on the nonfood side, on the more discretionary, we've seen some more encouraging trends recently, do you guys think this is something that's sustainable? Do you think that part of this is trade-down? Or is it assortment changes that you've made?","Richard W. Dreiling","Matt, I would actually answer it's a little bit of both. I think the trade-down customer is getting more comfortable with the quality of the products we're putting out there. I think so -- also, I think we're doing a much better job on the merchandising selection here. I have to say Todd and his team, our Christmas assortment, as an example, this year, is the best I've seen in 5 or 6 years. I think we're doing a much better job in positioning the product in the store. And I think we're doing a much better job on the labeling of the product, which makes it look a little more upscale and still having that great price in it.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You had mentioned customer concerns over healthcare, specifically. How are you seeing that reflected in your results? And how should we be thinking about the impact of Affordable Care Act on expenses longer-term?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I think, I don't have anything really definitive, where we've done any market search [ph] on it. But I think everything you read and everything you're hearing about is -- the number of customers who have had low coverage policies that are basically more catastrophic, moving into the healthcare network and finding out, while they have more complete coverage, it costs a lot more. That customer that has that catastrophic coverage, a lot of that is our customer. And they're going to be dealing with that going forward. And I think it's one of those new things that has entered into all of this, this dynamic, where people who make $50,000 or less per year are starting to deal with what I'm calling dinnertime economics, right? I mean, they sit down at that dinner table at night and, Steve, they've got -- if you make $50,000 or less per year, you've given up $1,000 worth of disposable income with the change in the payroll tax. Have high unemployment, a lot of the unemployment benefits that we're getting are in higher skilled jobs. And what I've been saying for long periods of time, my concern is underemployment, that people are going back to work, but they're making less per hour and getting less hours. I think there's uncertainty, future uncertainty over unemployment benefits and I think there's uncertainty about the cost of healthcare. And recently, we've had the introduction of the change in staff benefits. And I think, if you think about this, you have our core customer sitting at the dinner table, she still has to put dinner on the table for her family and she's wrestling with all of these things. And I think that is the value that Dollar General brings to the table and always has is that we're always there with Every Day Low Price for our customer, regardless of what's going on. In regards to the Obamacare next year, David, I'll let you [indiscernible] that.","David M. Tehle","We're in the midst of wrapping up our open enrollment period here for healthcare coverage and clearly we will have a headwind from this in 2014, but its bouncing around on us a little bit right now, we have to see how many people sign up and at what levels they sign up on and that sort of thing. So we'll update you more on that. But like most companies in America, it will be a headwind for us next year.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then another quick follow-up on the new distribution center that's opening. Is there any impact that we should be thinking about on the P&L, both in the near-term and then longer-term as it ramps up?","David M. Tehle","Yes, I think in the -- generally, when we bring on a DC, there is some -- again, all this is included in our guidance that we have for this year and will be in next year's guidance when we give it. You do have some impact of inefficiencies when you start up the DC, and it takes a few months before it gets up to capacity and starts operating efficiently. So we'll have a little bit of that. But again, we're pretty good at working through that. We've shown that as we've opened DCs. As a matter of fact, the prior year we opened 2 DCs at once and worked through it pretty well overall. So -- but, yes, absolutely, there are some inefficiencies when you open up. And then, as it gets downstream, it gets more efficient. And then you get -- the real help you get is from your stem miles, you reduce your transportation costs by having this new location.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to circle back on the implied guidance for the fourth quarter and just make sure that I'm thinking about this correctly. Is it fair to say that kind of the midpoint of the top line range is suggesting a similar comp, about 4.5% or so, for the fourth quarter, with gross margins sequentially decelerating? And just also to that, if that is the case, if you can just kind of give some of the puts and takes on gross margins in 4Q versus what we've seen the past 2 quarters. And then lastly, maybe I missed it, but did you reiterate the $600 million for buyback figure for this year?","Mary Winn Gordon","Paul, it's Mary Winn. We actually said $620 million for share repurchases in total for this year.","David M. Tehle","Yes, I'll comment on this and certainly, Rick may want to jump in. As we look at the fourth quarter, there's a lot of ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. And the potential for more promotional and competitive retail and climate that we're dealing with. And as we said at the beginning of the year, the fourth quarter is our toughest comparison. We're going to be lapping the highest quarter, particularly from a gross margin percent point of view that we had last year. The other thing we're up against, and again, this is last year, we had a $0.02 benefit in taxes from [indiscernible] because we had a retroactive impact that we took in the fourth quarter and again, we spelled that out in our press release last year when we released earnings. So I think as we look at it, probably, the best I can say is, look, we think it's prudent to be somewhat cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year. Now, I want to point out we did raise the low end of our earnings per share for the full year to $3.18 from the $3.15 that it was. And again, our range now is $3.18 to $3.22 for the full year.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of door growth for next year, the 700 doors, is there any plans to accelerate the rollout of the Plus or the market format as a part of that?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, the Plus is part of our relocation program. We will increase the number of Plus stores next year. And the Dollar General Markets, Paul, are still very much experimental for us. We want to make sure, when we're dealing with a concept that's a little more elaborate than what we do on a day out and day basis that we're doing it the right way and we're spending our time on Dollar General Market right now, thinking about new things that it doesn't have that we think it might have, like the fuel that we put in, in Alabama.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So the addition of cigarettes and perishables, obviously, benefiting your same-store sales quite a bit, Family Dollar had a similar experience when they rolled that out a year or so ago. But it was interesting, once they reached the 1-year anniversary of cigarettes and perishables, based on their forecast, same-store sales thawed out pretty quickly. So when you think into like the second and third quarter of next year, how should we be thinking about what happens with Dollar General sales momentum, once you anniversary those 2 programs?","Richard W. Dreiling","I actually think that's a very fair question, Dan. We're on our sixth year on the perishable journey and we continue to comp in the double-digit range for 6 years consecutively now. I think that our category management process, particularly on perishables where you're dealing with an outside vendor, is very rigorous because you have to have the right items. And as I think about what we've done in perishables over the last 6 years, we've actually evolved with what I would say would be the grocery channel and mass. I can remember when we had 1 shelf of pizzas, now we have a whole door of pizza. I've watched the evolution of more, what I would call, ready-to-eat quick serve meals, where that's gone from basically a shelf to a whole door and maybe even 1.5 doors. And I think, as you look at us, what we have historically done is taken something and continued to build on it over a period of time. In regards to the cigarette thing, my view on the cigarettes is not what it does for comp sales. It's what it does for traffic. And the fact that it brings in incremental traffic and then it's up to us, through our offering and the way we manage our stores, to turn that into a bigger basket. And again, if you think about it, if you look at our sales per square foot, if you look at our transaction growth and look at our basket growth, we have been very good on building on those for a very long period of time. So I see no reason for caution, the fact that we're lapping cigarettes.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. It's just that -- one other question, on the 14,000 incremental stores for your industry, I'm assuming you're including Family Dollar and Dollar Tree, but not the drugstores?","Richard W. Dreiling","That would be correct. I'm thinking just to the -- talking just about the dollar channel, Dan.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And so out of that 14,000, how many of those would belong to Dollar General? And then also, if you could talk about the portion of those that are going to your virgin markets in the Western states and how much would be fill-in into your legacy markets?","Richard W. Dreiling","A fair question, Dan. The 14,000 -- I mean, that's up for grabs, right? It's our ability to get out there and get as many as we can and what I try to do is to find what the total opportunity is. And obviously, how I would look at this is if Dollar General has opened 700 stores a year, there's a lot of growth opportunity out there for a long time to come. In regards to, is it more in the markets we're in or new markets, kind of -- I would kind of like to leave that one open and what I would rather say is we're continuing to be excited about the new markets we're entering. And a piece of these are in new markets, but a piece of them are also backfill opportunities in the markets we're in.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of David Mann with Johnson Rice.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","If we could go back to a question about shrink, can you just let us know how the rate of increase in shrink in this quarter compared to the last couple of quarters? And given the defensive moves that you've taken, when do you expect the shrink increase to moderate, or perhaps no longer be a headwind?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, the first thing I want to say, while our shrink is up, it's still way below the 2007, '08 and '09 levels. And we're making progress on our initiatives here. Our #1 priority right now, David, is to stabilize the shrink number. We will begin to cycle, in the first and second quarter, the defensive merchandising steps that we have taken. We have gone in and randomly inventoried some of those stores, and to be honest, we have seen some progress there. I don't want to declare a victory here yet. But we certainly have the plans in place. And we're hoping, as we move through the year next year, that we should see -- begin to see, not only it stabilize, but see it begin to move in our favor.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Great. In terms of the macro environment, you called out, obviously, a variety of items that are headwinds. I'm just curious with the lower gas prices that we're seeing, I mean, historically, that's been a nice tailwind for your sector. I'm just curious if -- what your thoughts are about that? And if you're hearing anything about lower gas prices when you're talking to your consumers?","Richard W. Dreiling","We love lower gas prices because it gives our consumer more money to spend. I do think that the consumer today is incredibly value-conscious. And I think they are really and truly looking for many different ways to stretch their budget and I think the gas prices will help them do that -- lower gas prices.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And then, I'm just curious, on the fueling station test, is that something that will likely be confined only to the DG market? Or do you see a white space for that across the entire chain potentially if you like what you see?","Richard W. Dreiling","David, that is actually a very fair question. It's a little soon to tell you that. We got one and I will tell you, it's pumping gas at the rate that a convenience store would. So we're very, very pleased with what we're seeing, but a little soon to lay that one on the table.","Operator","The next question comes from line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions. The first is on SG&A per foot, the growth has been very low, kind of in the 1% range for a number of quarters. What's a reasonable assumption for SG&A per foot growth going forward, assuming a neutral impact from some of these transitory issues like incentive comp? And then secondly, your new store opening growth will be a lot lower this quarter than the last few fourth quarters and I'm wondering what kind of impact that might have on SG&A?","David M. Tehle","Yes, I think the whole SG&A question really has to do with our mining for cost-reduction efforts in the company. And we continue to look for ways to take costs out, whether it be our workforce management, damages, stem miles, procurement, supplies, you name it. I mean, we're working on a whole variety of things and we always will be. Every year we're going to have a mining for cost reduction effort in the company. We like to look at it in terms of what does it take to lever SG&A and we're still locked in at that 3% to 3.5% comp in terms of leveraging SG&A. So in terms of looking at it on a square footage basis, I'd rather answer it by saying that we still see it levering at 3% to 3.5% in a normal environment. So I mean, we'll continue to work on it. We've been very pleased with how we've been able to lever it the past few quarters. We have a lot of efforts going on in the company. And again, we have a lot of levers to continue to pull on SG&A.","Matthew R. Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then in terms of the lower store growth rate, is that a significant item potentially in Q4?","David M. Tehle","I don't think it's that significant overall. And again, we'd be comparing to the same thing for Q4 last year, consistently in terms of the leverage that we'd be seeing. Every year, our store openings are always lower in the fourth quarter. That's kind of a normal thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Montagna with Avondale Partners.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","A question on tobacco. Is it fair to view, and I know it's kind of early, but is it fair to view that tobacco maturity cycle is probably being similar to just your typical store maturity cycle?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I mean, I would think the maturity of tobacco would be like any other category, quite frankly, or you can look at it in terms of store cycle, sure. I think that -- the back half of next year it's going to be about capitalizing on that transaction growth and converting that customer.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then second question, just dealing with hanging apparel, did you face markdown pressure on that, or had you planned those 4,000 stores in advance of the third quarter?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, that was all planned, Mark. That was part of our plan when we announced our initiative, the end of last year, the first of next year about the 4,200 stores.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Could we see further scaling back next year? Or if you do, is it just simply fine-tuning it? And then how do you fuse [ph] those stores?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I think that's a fair question. It's a little soon to tell. We're very happy with what we're seeing in this block of stores and what we're very happy is with the profitability. And I think you have to give us a little bit of time. We're going to continue to fine-tune the initiative. But we'll get back to you the first part of the year next year and let you know for sure.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Were you equally happy with the performance in apparel of the other 7,000 stores?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I think we -- I think the difference between the other stores and the 4,000 stores is the profitability, right? And what we're trying to do is maximize our profitability per square foot.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Brian Cullinane - Wolfe Research, LLC","This is actually Brian Cullinane on for Scott. You guys talked about an increase in the competitive environment. Just wanted to -- maybe a couple of questions on that. Has it picked up at all since the end of the quarter into Thanksgiving and into December? And are you seeing it from a particular channel or a particular competitor, that increase?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I would say the uptick in competitive activity started in October and it's about the same as it was in October. And it's spread across every channel.","Brian Cullinane - Wolfe Research, LLC","Every channel, okay.","Richard W. Dreiling","And again, I want to make sure, Brian, that I reinforce here, that we're seeing it in select items that are designed to drive traffic, like soda, for example. I don't want to lead anybody to believe that I think the market has gotten irrational, because that hasn't happened yet.","Brian Cullinane - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, that's fair. And do you think that the competition is just -- is it more of a -- is it in response to a weaker consumer, I guess, is it the consumer, or is it that people are fighting for volumes. Any thoughts there?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, well, I think the weaker consumer is part of the macro environment and everybody is fighting for sales. It's about driving traffic and that's why people are selecting these high-traffic driving items, right? So again, Brian, as you think about us, I mean, we are intently focused on Every Day Low Price. It's my belief, if you get too promotional, all you do is rent those sales for a matter of time. And we continue to be relentlessly focused on getting the best value every day to the customer.","Brian Cullinane - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then in terms of, maybe just a little bit on inflation, is there any -- what do you guys see for the next few months in terms of inflation? Is there any chance with some of this competition and promotional stuff -- from other people, is there any chance of outright deflation? And what does that do to your model?","Richard W. Dreiling","Right now, I would tell you, we have seen virtually no inflation this year and we're anticipating none next year. And in regards to the competitive activity, I mean, we're going to have to let that play out. I can't give you a view on that one.","Brian Cullinane - Wolfe Research, LLC","Sure. But any view on is deflation in play? I would imagine there's probably some categories specifically that are, but...","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I would look at you and tell you right now there's absolutely no indication of any deflationary pressure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So 2 things. One, discretionary relevance in 2 different areas. When you look at categories or subcategories that you're in, on the discretionary side, are there some that you shouldn't be in because it's hard to be relevant assortment wise, or share-of-voice-wise? And then secondly, this time of year, when you think about what's going on with Black Friday, getting hotter and earlier, how do you maintain a competitive share of voice this time of year, right, with mass and Best Buy and others? Or is that just going to be harder to do over time?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. In regard to the discretionary question, I mean, the name of the game is SKU productivity. And what we're constantly doing, John -- we have a very, very -- under Todd's guidance, a very robust category management process. And the discretionary side, quite frankly, is all about being relevant and the advantage we have, we have a small amount of SKUs, a small SKU base, and it allows us to be a little more surgical in what we choose to promote and we can stay a little more relevant. In regards to your question about Black Friday turning into a week of Black days, which I think is quite fair, I didn't -- the first thing I would say is we're not necessarily a destination for Black Friday purchases. We are -- we're the fill-in to all that. We're the I forgot the stocking stuffer or I forgot this. We do particularly good on the consumables side during the Black Friday process. So -- and again, I still believe, as long as we stay focused to our mantra, being focused on EDLP, all of this chatter and all this noise is going to play out over time.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So you think on discretionary, you can be an item merchant, pick a good apparel item, pick a good home item, and if the price is right, that makes up for breadth?","Richard W. Dreiling","That's exactly right, in fact, by the way, that is our strategy that we've really been trying to focus on in the last 18 months. I need to have whatever the best-selling sweater is if it's blue. But we don't need the red one and the green one and the gray one and the cream one. We just sell the best one and that's the whole idea.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then, I know with Todd's promotion, right, so you're going to spend incremental time on other things. What might those be? And I thought one of them might be DG Market, given your food background?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I think that with Todd stepping in to spend a lot more time on the day-to-day stuff, it gives me the opportunity to spend my time thinking about broader pictures, and more importantly, where we want to be in 5 years. And rather than standing up and saying, this is exactly what I'm going to do, I would say, John, it gives me the opportunity to be a little more reflective and provide a little bit bigger direction for the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","The last call, there was a question on what you thought might happen with the reductions in SNAP assistance. And I think you gave a similar response to what you just said about Black Friday, in that you're not the primary destination for that particular purchase, more of a fill-in. So now that, that has -- and the bigger guys, the grocers, would be the ones that would lose out more. With the reduction having gone through at the beginning of November, I know it was a choppy month, November, but do you feel like what you were thinking would happen has happened there, and that there hasn't been a significant impact from the reduction in food stamp assistance?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I think what we thought was going to happen has happened. The bulk of that shop goes to the big-box retailers and the grocers. I mean, I will -- I do believe, Patrick, we will feel something, but it's going to be minimal compared to everybody else. And the only thing I want to be cautious about, it's one month and you've got to remember, we had Thanksgiving in there. But I would think that I'm very comfortable with what we said.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then, this doesn't come up much, but you do have an e-commerce business. So -- and you've got Cyber Week savings all week, this week, and it is -- I guess it is Cyber Week. And e-commerce, of course, is really in focus right now, as we move in to -- or as we roll through the holidays. So could you just give us an update on what you're seeing with your e-commerce operation? Is there a material impact there to same-store sales? Is it more oriented -- the purchases, are they more individuals or small businesses?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, our e-commerce site has a very small base. So while we were up tremendously on that day, on Cyber Monday and this week, it's on a very small base. And Patrick, it does not affect our same-store sales number. And by the way, in relation to whether it's businesses or individuals, it tends to be more the individual. And the one thing I will say is the electronic items that we have do very well on the e-commerce side.","Mary Winn Gordon","Lindsay, it's Mary Winn. We've let the call go a little bit longer, so I think we ought to just go ahead and cut it off here. I do just want to tell everyone thank you for joining us today. I am around. So if you need anything, please don't hesitate to give me or Emma Jo a call. And I look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Today is Thursday, August 27, 2015. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","Thank you, Brandy, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and John Garratt, our Interim CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open up the call up for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases.","Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions, and other non-historical matters such as our 2015 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures; our planned fiscal 2015 and 2016 operating and merchandising initiatives; 2015 and 2016 store growth and prototype initiatives, our capital allocation strategy and expectations, and expectations regarding future economic trends.","Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2014 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2015, our 2015 second quarter 10-Q filed this morning, and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call.","Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mary Winn, and thanks for everyone joining the call today. This morning, we announced our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Once again, we delivered strong financial performance for the quarter. I believe we have further opportunity to take significant steps to better execute our initiatives to serve our consumers and build on our strong foundation for future growth.","I am excited to say we have strengthened our leadership team with Jeff Owen, EVP of Store Operations, and Jim Thorpe, EVP and Chief Merchandising Officer rejoining Dollar General. Both Jeff and Jim have a proven record of driving results at Dollar General and know our company and our consumer extremely well. Getting this team back together should strengthen our ability to move at an accelerated pace.","With that, let's now turn to our results for the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter sales increased nearly 8% to $5.1 billion. We delivered same-store sales growth of 2.8% for the quarter. Same-store sales started out strong in May with June being weaker and sales strengthening in July. It is my belief that this was reflective of the weak overall U.S. retail sales report for June and mirrors what you have heard from some other retailers. Sales per square foot reached a record $225.","For the 30th consecutive quarter-over-quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket. Gross margin expanded by 36 basis points to 31.2% which follows our strong first quarter margin performance.","For the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $0.95. During the quarter, we returned $265 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.6 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. Given our performance for the first half of the year, we are reconfirming our full-year financial outlook.","Our current expectation is that same-store sales will likely be closer to the lower end of our range of 3% to 3.5% growth. EPS remains in the range of $3.85 to $3.95. We continue to grow transactions and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. We experienced consistent mid-single digit share growth in both units and dollars for the 4-week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week periods.","With that, let me now turn to an update on our key initiatives. As we shared with you last quarter, we're making targeted labor investments to grow market share in a competitive environment while providing for positive financial returns. The labor hour investment in this select group of stores is designed to ensure, we deliver on our customer's expectation in more competitive markets to enhance our in-stock position for a more convenient shopping experience.","Our goal is to further reduce the truck-to-shelf time for merchandise in these stores, providing our consumer with the right product at the right time, at the right price. For each phase, the store operations team has a specific metric and timetable for determining the financial return criteria for achieving results, based on a similar 2014 test-and-learn program. Currently, we have completed the first of three phases of the labor investments. Our phase 1 stores received the incremental labor hours during the second quarter. I'm pleased to report that our phase 1 stores are delivering on our return expectations.","Specifically, the key metrics of same-store sales, transactions, average basket and consumer satisfaction scores are all showing significant improvement. I believe these strong results are driven by a notably better in-stock position post the incremental store investments. With these solid results, we plan to accelerate our implementation of phases 2 and 3 in stores in the second half of the year.","The second investment in labor comes from the realignment of our store operations management structure to optimize the scale of our divisions, regions and districts to improve accountability and maximizing training and teamwork, all while driving stronger more sustainable results. We have reduced the time our district managers spend driving, so they can invest more time mentoring and coaching our store managers on developing and strengthening their teams.","These changes have been in place since February. We expected that over time, this would help both our consumer satisfaction and store manager turnover. We are pleased to see signs that this initiative is paying off. Our customer satisfaction scores are improving and we are approaching our fourth consecutive month of declining store manager turnover rates.","Further, we are moving forward with a number of inventory management initiatives. For example, our sky-shelf program will be completely rolled out across the chain by the end of the third quarter to allow for placement of inventory directly above the respective categories. This allows our teams to get product out of the backrooms to facilitate improved stocking and, ultimately, drive labor efficiencies. Already, we are seeing encouraging results with our receiving room inventory down by about 20% based on the most recent store inventories.","During the third quarter, we anticipate concluding our multiyear rollout of our enterprise resource planning software for our supply chain. Our new supply chain solution provided by our vendor, Symphony EYC, is replacing our legacy system which has limited capabilities to support our growth. This technology platform represents a significant improvement with enhanced integration to allow for demand forecasting from vendor-to-shelf. Going forward, our new system is scalable to support our growth and configurable to support changes in our business.","Over time, we believe this project will benefit our inventory levels at the DCs and in the stores, and our allocation of merchandise on a store-by-store basis. Our overall in-stock position on the shelf should improve as well. This is a significant investment that will allow us to better service our stores and provide much better visibility into our business.","On a combined basis, we believe these labor investments and inventory management initiatives are significant steps to improving our in-stock position, which is a critical component of our overall customer satisfaction and a driver of sales performance.","On the merchandising front, we had positive same-store sales growth across all categories in the second quarter. Growth was generally balanced across consumables and non-consumables. This represents the sixth consecutive quarter for improvement in our non-consumable categories. Strength in consumables was driven by and candy and snacks, tobacco and perishables. In addition, we had broad-based strength across seasonal and home. Our lady's and accessory departments within the apparel group continue to exhibit strong performance, comping above the company average.","Affordability continues to play a key role as we expand SKUs across the store at the sweet spot of $1 to $5. For the second quarter, nearly 50% of our consumers' baskets contained at least one item priced at $1 and these baskets grew faster than our overall transactions.","Shrink improvement has been and continues to be one of our largest gross margin opportunities. We remain committed to reducing our shrink at store level. For the quarter, we are extremely pleased with our shrink improvement. This progress was broad based with shrink declining in 70% of the product departments and approximately 70% of our regions improving year-over-year based on store inventories performed so far this year. Going forward, our teams continue to be focused on leveraging our defensive merchandising tools, technology and training to reduce shrink.","Turning to the second half of the year, including the holiday season, we are capitalizing on our consumer insights to strengthen our merchandising offering across product categories. In turn, this will be supported by a robust print and digital marketing calendar. We continue to capitalize on new ways to wow our consumers. We are focused on expanding high-opportunity categories and giving our consumer the trend-right product she wants at affordable prices.","For instance, we know licensed products resonate with our consumers as they are on trend and communicate value. As a result, we are broadening our reach across categories with more impactful licensed products. At the same time, affordability is as important as ever to our consumers. For 2015, more than 40% of our holiday seasonal assortment is priced at $1.","From a real estate perspective, we remain disciplined and focused on financial returns. We continue to see our new store productivity at around 85% of our comp base, all while driving strong returns. We remain very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2015 and our pipeline is full.","The Dollar General stores in our three new states of Maine, Rhode Island and Oregon continue to ramp up nicely. We have reduced the capital investment required for remodels while also driving strong sales lifts of 4% to 5% and an improved return on investment in excess of 200 basis points. In total, the team has already executed more than 1,000 projects across new store openings, remodels and relocations. This represents around eight projects a day.","The real estate team has continued to build upon its progress for the 2016 pipeline. The planned growth in selling square feet of about 7% translates to approximately 900 new store openings. Our development pipeline is over 80% complete for planned 2016 store openings, and we expect to be 100% complete by the fourth quarter. Our strong track record of delivering exceptional returns in our new store program gives us confidence in our model going forward.","Now, let me turn the call over to John.","John W. Garratt - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our second quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results and our outlook. We are pleased with our second quarter results, given our strong gross margin expansion and our SG&A performance.","Gross profit for the second quarter was $1.6 billion or 31.2% of sales, an increase of 36 basis points from last year's second quarter. As compared to the prior year, the most significant drivers were higher initial inventory markups, improved inventory shrink rate and lower transportation cost, partially offsetting these improvements to gross profit were increased markdown.","SG&A expense increased by 9 basis points over the 2014 period to $1.1 billion or 21.8% of sales in the second quarter. Using disciplined cost management, we were successful in mitigating our SG&A deleverage. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to higher store asset impairments, incentive compensation, repairs and maintenance and fees associated with the increased use of debit cards. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38%.","Moving now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3 billion, up 2.7% on a per store basis. Year-to-date, we generate cash from operations of $557 million, an increase of $70 million or 14%, compared to the same period last year. Total capital expenditures were $247 million.","During the quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares of our common stock for $200 million. We also paid a dividend of $0.22 per common share outstanding, totaling $65 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we repurchased over $3 billion of our common stock. We currently have a remaining authorization of approximately $489 million. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy.","Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our growth. We aim to create lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment grade rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3 times adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR.","Turning now to guidance. We are reconfirming our financial guidance ranges for 2015. Details of our guidance are included in our press release. Highlights include, top-line sales for the year are expected to increase 8% to 9%. Expectations for overall selling square footage growth remain at approximately 6%. And as you model out the third quarter and fourth quarter, please keep in mind that the day of Halloween falls into our fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to our third quarter of 2014. We anticipate this could have a modestly negative impact on the third quarter due to the year-over-year comparison.","For the year, same-store sales are expected to increase 3% to 3.5%, with the expectation that it will be closer to the lower end of our range. Our expectation for diluted earnings per share remains $3.85 to $3.95 for the year. As our long-term track record demonstrate, Dollar General is well positioned to serve our customers in a wide variety of economic conditions and in turn deliver strong results for our shareholders over time.","With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, John. As I approach the conclusion of my first 100 days as CEO, I am as excited as ever about the opportunities ahead of us at Dollar General. I feel great about the team that we have in place, and I am confident that Jeff and Jim will play an important role in Dollar General's long-term success. The team is energized and excited as we look to help our consumers save time, save money every day.","Looking ahead to 2016, the team is focused on driving profitable sales growth. We are deep into the planning process for this coming year. While it's still early, I would like to share with you some of our preliminary initiatives.","Our new store prototype will be rolled out in 2016 for all new stores, relocations and remodels. The format will allow for a more customer-friendly shopping experience and in this prototype, the consumer will be able to and have faster, more convenient checkout, an attribute that is a high priority for our core consumer. We have value engineered the design to be capital efficient and easier to operate for our store teams. Given the early results from our test, we are encouraged about the prototype.","We have a significant opportunity to increase our cooler penetration across our store bases Perishables, drive trips and basket size with our consumer, as she looks for a quick meal solution or a fill-in item; across the chain, a basket with a perishable item is nearly 50% higher than the chain average. This is a big opportunity that we know how to capitalize on, as we have already increased the cooler count on average by just over 50% since 2008. More and more consumers looking to DG for her health and beauty needs. Based on our customer insights, we will look to expand our offerings across segments such as hair care, cough and cold, and over-the-counter meds, skin care and nail care. We are well positioned to capitalize on this trend given our brand offerings and price relevancy. Our ongoing affordability initiative will be front and center with the new fresh approach. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.","All-in, 2016 is shaping up to have meaningful initiatives to drive our performance. I look forward to sharing more details about our plans as we move forward. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. Our team is energized to seize growth opportunities. Our business generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in accelerated store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and dividends.","My personal thanks and gratitude go out to all the 112,000 Dollar General employees that fulfill on our mission of serving others by providing our consumers with convenience, value and service every day.","With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","Okay. Brandy, we'll go ahead and take our first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. So, Todd, can you talk to some of the drivers of the top-line reacceleration in July, maybe what you've seen in August? And then, more importantly, larger picture, just what's the best way to think about the lower gas prices, the wage increases, have you seen any impact? And just the best way to think about it.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Matt, sure will. When we looked at our sales, it really did mirror, I think, what the nation saw at retail out there. What we saw was once we got through the month of June and into July, the weather patterns normalized, the heat returned and those torrential rains in Texas and Oklahoma and other areas subsided. And we saw a return to a little bit of a normal pattern where our consumable and non-consumable businesses both did very well as we moved into the weeks of July to the end of July. So, that's what gives us confidence in our guidance for the full year in sales because we've seen that our sales have rebounded from that dip in June.","And to be honest with you, I think it's way too early to have seen and we really haven't seen any indication that the consumer is spending anything more because she has additional wage money in her pocket. But again, our core consumer is a little different in that before she starts to spend, she really needs to have confidence and see a sustained ability that income will continue to come her way. So, she is a little bit slower on pulling the trigger on spending a little bit more money.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just a follow-up. As we think about gross margins, so two quarters of pretty healthy expansion here. Beyond thinking about the tougher back-half comparisons, what's the best way to think about gross margins on a multiyear basis? And any headwinds that would prevent continued expansion as we think beyond this year?","John W. Garratt - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Well, we do feel great about the margin expansion in the first half with 45 basis points of growth in Q1 and 36 basis points in Q2. And as we look at it, it's very broad-based as we've utilized many levers. We continue to reduce shrink and see opportunity for further improvement there. We continue to grow our non-consumables business which helps our mix. We had six consecutive quarters of growth with non-consumables and we continue to effectively manage the other levers, including category management, private label and foreign sourcing. As we look to the back half of the year, we don't see this structurally changing. We do see it moderating somewhat. And do bear in mind that we also always reserve the right to invest in EDLP as needed to drive units and transactions.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","John W. Garratt - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","All right, Brandy, we'll move to the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Wewer of Raymond James.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. So, Todd, when we saw, been out visiting stores, visiting competitors, one thing that we've seen is a lot of Family Dollar stores that are closing, as they're planning to transition to the Dollar Tree brand. I'm sure that you're getting attention to your stores that are adjacent to see how they performed after they make that change. Are there any insights that you can give us?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Dan, I think it's way too early to really know exactly what's going on. I think it's fair to say with the transaction closing in July, it's in the infancy stages. But what we're squarely focused on is controlling what we can control and we are always out there looking to capitalize on opportunities as we see them. But I'm encouraged on the labor front where we have invested in labor in some of our stores, where the product is getting on the shelf faster. And I can tell you that all of our consumer work in these stores are showing that the consumer is seeing the difference inside of our stores with our in-stock rates increasing. So we feel very, very confident that in any way that we can capitalize, we will as we go forward.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then just as a follow-up, in your prepared comments and talking about Jeff and Jim coming back to the company. You used the phrase, getting the team back together. One of the questions we've been getting from a lot of investors, why did they leave to begin with a couple of years ago? And what has changed that lead them to resume their career at DG?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, I can't exactly tell you why they left, because I'm sure they have their own reasons. I think the interesting thing is that they saw an opportunity as I do here at Dollar General and returned. And really, what I'm excited about is that return, because we have all worked together for many years prior to them leaving, and they know the playbook, they know our customers. And they know how to move quickly and drive profitable sales growth. So we feel very confident that in the quarters and years to come, they'll be huge contributors with the rest of executive management team.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","All right, Brandy, we'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, John.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Two related questions, I think. Smart & Simple, where do we stand and how much do you want to expand that or expect to expand that over the next, I don't know year or two or three? And then DG Market, now that you're in the top spot there, you kind of still look at that as an experimental lab, and are you learning a lot that helps you against Aldi and Save-A-Lot?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Those are great questions, John. On the Smart & Simple side first, affordability is still and will be and continue to be front and center here at Dollar General and Smart & Simple plays a huge role in that. We doubled the SKU count so far in 2015. And we see that pace continuing as we go into 2016. It really does give our consumer that price point that's magical in a lot of cases of $1. And even though some items are over a $1 Smart & Simple, it is a tremendous value.","So, we see that brand growing and we see it as a price fighter to a lot of different disciplines out there across grocery and drugs. So we feel very good about it. And again, remember, our consumer looks to us first for value and price and that's what we deliver with that Smart & Simple brand. So we're very excited about it.","As it relates to DG Markets, we continue to use DG Markets as a test lab, continue to learn in those stores. But also the great thing is, is a lot of the learnings from DG Market, we apply into our Plus stores and our traditional stores. And quite frankly, some of the pieces that you'll see in our new store prototype in 2016 was generated from the Market store concept and the Plus concept.","So we still see the Market store as a real viable kind of a store for us because of a lot of things: one, driving top line sales, giving the consumer a great value with expanded grocery and perishable, but also because of that test bed that it provides the rest of the chain. So we feel good about it.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And then as a follow-up to that, if you're going to add more Smart & Simple, do you cut SKUs, and do you cut maybe branded SKUs, or do you just have less facings for what's out there? And then I assume it would be nice to put traffic-generating perishables in, but I assume you're not going to play around with produce because you can blow yourself up pretty good expanding that. Is that fair?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. That is very fair to say. Right now, we don't have anything on the horizon as far as the perishable side. But you know what, we're always looking. Again, in our market stores, perishables play a pretty important role in those. And we're learning a lot about that fresh side of the business on perishables, but right now no big plans to do anything there.","As it relates to back to Smart & Simple, I think the best way to look at Smart & Simple for us is that what it really provides us and the consumer is it provides that affordability. And then for our consumer, it gives her trial and then from that trial she moves into acceptance of an item, and then she trades in or trades down. So I think it's an important piece.","Now, as we start to put more and more of these Smart & Simple items on the shelf, I think it's fair to say that something has to go. And the great thing about Dollar General is we're very disciplined in our category management approach. So I can tell you, John, that what we decide to eliminate to put in Smart & Simple will be the exact right decision for our customer at Dollar General.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","Great. Brandy, we'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter J. Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Could you just give us a perspective on the comp guidance range, now it's at the low end? Was it simply a result of a slow June, or is there something that's maybe not picking up here as we're getting into the back half of the year?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, (sic) Peter, I think if you look at it, we're very pleased with how our second quarter ended up. We delivered nearly 8% revenue growth and 14% EPS growth. So we feel very strong about it. And that's what gives us the opportunity, Peter, to work and look at the back half of the year and our full-year guidance. And it gives us the confidence that we'll hit that lower end of the range.","Peter J. Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Maybe pivoting (32:43) a question to John. Historically the company has talked about leveraging expenses at 3.5%. So I was wondering with some of the labor investments coming on in the back half of the year and the pickup in the store growth next year, does that leverage point begin to move up for the next couple of quarters?","John W. Garratt - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Yes. You're correct. The SG&A leverage point has been and is around 3.5%. What you will see as you move into the back half as we do accelerate our targeted investments in labor, you will see some deleverage from it on the front end. This payback provides great returns longer term, but it does provide some deleverage to SG&A as it takes a couple quarters for it to pay back.","Peter J. Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","And maybe you're not comfortable talking about 2016, but just on that store growth dynamic too next year, should we be thinking about that as well as another point of near-term deleverage?","John W. Garratt - Interim Chief Financial Officer","We'll be coming back to you later with 2016 guidance later in the year. But right now we're comfortable with our guidance for this year and the model and see this labor investment as a near-term impact that will provide great returns longer term.","Peter J. Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","All right. Brandy, we'll move on to the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Scott.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to kind of go down the same path. I think I asked this last time and the last person was asking questions about, as we think of 2016 and expenses, I know you guys said you're deep in the planning, but labor across your companies is becoming an issue as the labor markets tighten up. Then, of course, we have the overtime rule changes being proposed by the government. Look like they're going to come in. So I specifically want to understand a little bit about next year in labor expenses and how you guys are looking to maybe offset some of this pressure that seems out there.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Scott, it's still a little early with a few of the things that are out there. Obviously, as we said before, we will always in markets pay a competitive wage to attract the right people and retain the right people. So we have been doing that for years and we will continue to do that in 2016 and beyond. But it is pretty early on a few of the fronts, especially the non-exempt and overtime legislation that's out there. It's still in comment period. So we're waiting to see exactly how that affects us, but as you could imagine, only our store managers are exempt today within our store from a salary perspective. So while it will affect us, it'll be also an effect on everyone out in the marketplace. But I think again, it's still a little early, but rest assured, we are watching it very carefully.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Do you actually think maybe since you guys have done a lot of work, that it's an advantage to you just because it's just your store manager, or should we not think of it that way that it's just going to affect everybody and you included, or do you think maybe it affects you guys a little bit less?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I think for right now, again, because it's still early, I would think about it, it's going to affect everybody. But as this becomes clearer as time passes, we'll have a better idea and get back to everyone on it.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then not to kind of keep coming back to the sales trend. I know you've talked about June was soft, July picked up. Pretty much everyone we've been talking to about August is saying things are \u2013 there is a little, I guess, queasiness about August and where that's really going to come in. We're not done with it officially yet. But it does seem like we kind of just go up and down, up and down, and we're really running in place. (36:46) I mean, is some of your cautiousness \u2013 cautious about the back half maybe sales are going to be a little harder to come by even though gas prices are down or am I reading too much into that?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I think the way to look at it, Scott, is that the calendar shift has caused a little angst probably out there with the consumer, only from the standpoint that Labor Day has been pushed back a week, as you know. And most states with schools, they sort of key off of that Labor Day date. So in a lot of cases what we've seen is that the back-to-school has been pushed back in the calendar a little bit.","Now the great thing here at Dollar General that we've seen is that where school has already started, our back-to-school comps are hitting and\/or exceeding our expectation. So we feel very good about that, but we have contemplated where we think we are here in August and where we'll be at the end of the third quarter. And we've embedded that in that guidance that we've given you. We feel pretty confident about that.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions, and it's nice to have the team back. So I look forward to working with everybody. Thanks.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great. Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","Thanks, Scott. Next question, please, Brandy.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Mann with Johnson Rice.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning. Question about the IMU strength that you've been seeing. Can you give a sense on your outlook for whether that would continue in the second half and any expected benefits from the yuan devaluation that might help that into 2016?","John W. Garratt - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Sure. We don't see anything structurally changing in terms of the drivers from the first half, in terms of we (38:30) going into the second half. In terms of the devaluation, there's no immediate impact. The payments to our international vendors are denominated in U.S. dollars to reduce volatility. Of course, we're monitoring the situation, and this could translate to opportunity for lower cost down the road.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","And then as a follow-up, in terms of your comment about the holiday value offering, the 40% comment that you made, what does that compare to, let's say, for last year's holiday offering? And will your overall holiday seasonal investment, how does that compare year-over-year?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. We're, David, pretty bullish on that back half of the year in holiday, because of all the work that the team has done on category management. That 40% I could tell you that it is an increase over last year. And again that was because of the success of holiday of 2015 where we saw our consumers gravitating to that affordability piece. So we've had a full year to make sure that we deliver on the strong affordability for holiday 2016, and we're pretty excited about the lineup that we have coming.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thank you and good luck.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","All right. Brandy, we'll move to the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Meredith.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. A question about real estate. I have one company, now they're based in a neighborhood shopping center, but one company that's talked about lease cost going up. Obviously, your real estate is different, but maybe you could just talk a little bit about the real estate environment and, first, in terms of availability and, second, in terms of cost.","John W. Garratt - Interim Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Great question. We feel great about real estate. We have a phenomenal team that does a great job of finding great sites while holding down costs. We've not seen a change and we've not seen a change to our great returns. We're still averaging about 20% returns on our new builds and less than two-year payback.","So no change to that and we feel great about the pipeline going forward. It's a very robust pipeline. We're going to open 730 new units this year and we're targeting about 900 new units next year and we continue to see these new units perform at about 85% the comp base. And we continue to see them, as I said, deliver great returns. So we feel very bullish about our returns going forward.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And based on those comments, it sounds like there isn't anything in the environment that would make you want to accelerate the pace of growth in markets that are most expensive. I don't actually know how many stores you have in California now, but either like California or the Northeast, is there anything that says, gee, we've got a window of opportunity now that might not last?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Meredith, this is Todd. When we look at it, we are definitely looking at all opportunities that are out there. But as you know us very well, we always take a very measured approach on how we accelerate growth and where we accelerate it. And rest assured, because of that discipline we have in our real estate model, that: one, we're looking for every opportunity; but also on the second side of that, we're making sure that we do it very measured. So as we go out that we continue to outperform our expectations when we open these stores.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","Yes, everyone, we just are hearing there's a little bit of technical difficulty on the sound. So please bear with us, and we'll try to have our speakers speak louder. All right. Brandy, we'll go to the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Ed.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, guys. So Todd, my question for you on the competitive environment. Can you maybe just talk a little bit in terms of what you're seeing there and I did hear you guys say something to the effect that you reserve the right to invest in EDLP in the back half, if necessary. Are you seeing anything out there that leads you to believe that you may need to do something like that?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ed, I have to say that the environment is still very rational. And when we look out, we don't see anything that's structurally \u2013 where that changes. But as you know, anytime that we see it necessary to drive units, we will invest in price to make sure that we protect and grow our market share. So while we don't see anything that's immediate, we are always looking at opportunities to deliver further value to our consumers.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then just one follow-up to something you mentioned on the call. You talked a lot about improving in-stocks. Could you maybe just provide more color on sort of, I guess, historically what you think the issue may have been, if there was even an issue, and what you think you were leaving on the table from a sales perspective to give us some sense as to what we should be looking for in terms of the benefit going forward?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. The fun thing about retail is that there's always opportunity to get better out there, and in-stock is one of those for us that we can get better. We've done a good job over the years on in-stock, but there's always room to improve. And we think that improving in-stock, and we've proven it with these labor investments that we've done here in the second quarter that the consumer reacts very quickly to those in-stock pieces. And she sees the product she wants on the shelf and we deliver a great price every day. We just got to make sure when she comes in that it's there for her and she can pick it up.","So I think between the labor investments that we've made and the ones upcoming as well as our supply chain solution that I talked about, as that now starts to really get fully integrated into the system, it should as well help our in-stock position. So we've got, in my mind, nowhere but up to go on in-stocks.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Well, thank you, guys.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","All right. Brandy, we'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Stephen.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning. I was hoping you could first clarify a little bit on the back half margin guidance. The reiterated range is embedding declining EBIT margin. Can you just walk through a little bit more the puts and takes between both gross margin and SG&A and I have a little bit of longer term follow-up, if I can?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. As we look at the back half, as I've mentioned previously, we do expect to continue to grow or expand our margins in the back half, but given the tougher lapse, we do expect that to moderate somewhat. On the SG&A front, as we mentioned, we're investing in labor and that's ramping up and while that does provide great returns in the long-term, it does deleverage in the near-term. So that would put some deleverage pressure on SG&A in the back half, on the front-end of that investment.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then as you think about the health of the consumer, I know you've been able to segment the base into a couple of different types. I'm wondering what are you seeing in terms of either spending from the trade down consumer or the value focus consumers. Is there any different trends that you're seeing there that you can call out? Thanks.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Stephen. We still continue to see the trade down consumer gravitating toward Dollar General which is great to see. Our core consumer which obviously makes up a big piece of our overall sales and profitability here at Dollar General, while she feels a little bit better, it appears financially, what she tells us and we knew this going in, is that, it takes her a little longer to start spending because she has to feel confident that what she's seen is sustainable in her budget.","And so, it takes a little bit of more time for her to let go of the purse strings a little bit more, but the great thing about Dollar General is that, through our category management work and through our field operators that we have out there, our store managers and their staff, we can deliver a great product to her when she's ready to spend, and I think we've proven that over the years.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. That's it for me. Thanks so much.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","All right. Operator, we'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Taylor LaBarr of Stifel.","Taylor G. LaBarr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Just wondering if you could discuss the apparel category a little bit. That's obviously been a big driver of the shift in non-consumables over the last couple of quarters. That is going to be against a tougher compare for the next year. Just wondering if this kind of mid single-digit growth rate is the range we should expect and if that's part of the more conservative gross margin guidance for the back half?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Taylor, we're very proud of what the team has accomplished in apparel and in non-consumables in general, but also our consumable business. When we look out in the guidance that we've provided, we feel good about both sides of those businesses. As it relates to apparel, it is a key driver of profitability for us and we see that even through the back half of the year going into 2016, our teams have got great products lined up, great values for our consumer. So that we really see that year-over-year, we're going to see and continue to see increases in our apparel businesses.","Taylor G. LaBarr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then one follow-up actually on the private-label brands repackaging, is that pretty much complete? I know you're doing that throughout this summer. And then have you seen a mix shift towards those private-label brands. I don't know if you can tease out any impact from the repackaging versus the focus on affordability more broadly, but just any comments there.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Private brands are really important to Dollar General, very important. So we watch it very carefully. We're essentially complete on our rebranding, the repackaging pieces of it. But as you expect from Dollar General, we're always trying to improve everything we do. So we're now going back to certain SKUs that may not have performed like we thought and are now tweaking those.","So we're in phase 2, I would call it, of the packaging, and right now we're pretty happy with what we see. And, again, private brands, Smart & Simple and the Rexall brands for us are extremely important as we go into 2016. So a lot of emphasis being placed there, and we'll continue to see that grow for us.","Taylor G. LaBarr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Sounds great. Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","All right. Brandy, we'll move on to the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Michael.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank","Good morning, Todd. Thanks for taking my question. How do you feel about the overall store standard and how they've tracked over the last four quarters? These labor investments, these inventory investments would suggest that you've seen something in the business that perhaps has been slipping and you need to address them. Perhaps that's an opportunity for some sales improvement, especially as you've seen the phase 1 performance.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. When you look out across our store base and the beauty of Dollar General is we got over 12,000 stores and working our way to 13,000 stores. And as you can imagine, in some areas, we've got better standards than others, and we're always working to make sure that we better our standards.","And the great thing with the labor investments that you've mentioned is that we've seen betterment, if you will, on both top-line sales as well as store manager turnover rates going down, not only in those stores, but across the chain.","So, we're doing something right here, and we think we're on to something. And when you look at it, that's one reason we want to accelerate these labor investments as we get into Q3 and Q4. As we go into the back half of the year, we think that there's a big opportunity for us. And to be honest with you, by the end of Q4, we should be approaching about a third of the chain with these new labor investments and additional hours in there. So, we feel very good about going into fourth quarter and taking that into 2016 with us.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank","And on the labor investments, you mentioned seeing a lift in sales transaction, a reduction in turnover, but you didn't mention profitability. So are you finding that you're getting a suitable return for these investments from profitability perspective?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. When you look at it, here at Dollar General, the great thing about the disciplines that we've put in place over the years, we do nothing here that doesn't have a return. I can guarantee you this has return metrics in place and they are delivering on those returns.","Now, is every store delivering? Perhaps not, but that's the beauty of us. We look at it by store and we either get those stores to produce or we'll roll those off the labor investments and reinvest those somewhere else. So, we're squarely focused on making sure it returns.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And one last quick question, as the environment does get better and your consumers release their purse strings a little bit, how do you feel about Dollar General's ability to capture that incremental spend? What's the possibility that that customer is going to spend maybe in a mass merchant channel as the gas prices, fuel is cheaper, maybe make it cheaper to drive slightly longer distance (52:59)? Thank you so much.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","When you look at the beauty of Dollar General and the value that we create for the shopper as well as the convenience that we have, you couple that with probably the strongest category management disciplines that you can see out there. And then with our store managers and their store teams squarely focused, we feel that we're in a great position, if not some of the best positions out there to capitalize when she starts to spend. And on top of that, we're always looking at other ways past the consumer to capitalize, and anything that we see, we'll make sure that we get our fair share here at Dollar General.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. Thank you so much.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","All right. Brandy, we'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Binder of Jefferies.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Dan.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You've talked a little bit about the in-stock opportunity. I'm curious if you could comment a little bit about where you've been? What the goals are? And what you think that translates to in terms of a comp benefit if you achieve those goals?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Again, Dan, when you look at it, we've got opportunities just like everyone out there. And our opportunities \u2013 the nice thing about Dollar General because of the disciplines we have, those opportunities that present themselves, we feel very confident. And as we put programs in place, as we've done now with in-stock, we feel that we can capitalize quickly on it.","While I don't want to give you the exact metric around it, rest assured that the focus, the attention and any capital that we're throwing at this will have a return. And we'll definitely make sure that it returns to the consumer. And that's really what this is all about is making sure that our consumer is satisfied when she leaves our store every time.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","I apologize if I missed this, but are you able to quantify the Halloween shift between Q3 and Q4?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. For us, we haven't really quantified it, but we know internally. Obviously, what we expect on that Halloween day, and because of our convenient nature as a retailer, the holiday is always late, right? So it's always those last two days, so the day before and the day of the event. So it's a significant piece of our business the day of the event.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","All right. Brandy, we'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo Securities.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Matt.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on an earlier question on the apparel category. Your sales growth slowed from about 10% last quarter, I think it was around 11% in the fourth quarter down to 5%. Is there anything in particular going on there? Is it mostly a comparison issue?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It is a little bit of a comparison issue. When you look at it, it was seasonally driven. And when we saw the return of the warm weather in the July month and now into August, we saw things normalized. We feel very good about where we are on a sell-through percentage rate. It is right on target. So we don't think there's anything structural there. It was just a little bit of a blip.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, secondly, you mentioned the impact of markdowns to gross margin, and I think that was a fairly sizeable headwind in the second quarter of last year. So, I think you had an easy comp on that front. Can you just square that with your comments that the competitive environment has been rational?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The markdowns were promotional driven and really ordinary course, nothing unusual with those during this quarter. And as you look at it, as far as the competition is concerned, we again really want to deliver value to our consumer. So where we think we need to invest in price, we do. And in some cases, it may come in form of promotional, but the majority of our reinvestment in the price comes at an everyday low price value on the shelf.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","All right, Brandy. Go to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vinnie Sinisi of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. Good morning. Wanted to ask about shrink. You guys mentioned it a few times throughout the call this morning. It sounds like you've been continuing to make some nice improvements on that end. But can you give us maybe a little bit more color around maybe some of the specific initiatives and some of the categories that you are doing. And it sounds like it still is an opportunity going forward, maybe with some of the things that you're doing on the labor investment front. That would be helpful.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Shrink continues to be one of our biggest gross margin levers that we have. And the team has been squarely focused over the past 12 months to 18 months on reducing shrink. And I could tell you that that between the use of our tools that we have available to us, which I think are world class, our defensive merchandising and just the complete refocus at retail on shrink has given us the benefit that we're seeing. We don't see that slowing down.","As a matter of fact, we are putting more ammunition of tools and abilities for our stores, our district managers to reduce shrink, and we'll continue to do that as we move through the rest of this year and into next. The good thing about shrink and the bad thing, quite frankly, but the good thing for us, is shrink has a tail to it. And anything that we work on now pays dividends down the road and into next year. So we feel good about where shrink is headed, and we'll continue to work it hard because it is a big, big opportunity for us.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And maybe just a quick follow-up on the prototypes for the 2016 class of stores. Should we except either just visually looking at the store or in terms of the level of investment that's been needed on a per-store basis with improving checkout, coolers, et cetera, can you give us any further clarity around that at this point?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We're going to come back to you with a little bit more detail, but just a tad bit of color. The store will visibly look different to the consumer. They will definitely see a difference as they walk in the store. The checkout area is a big, big difference and a departure from where we've been, but really is consumer-centric. And I could tell you that all of the work that we've done around this and as you can imagine here at Dollar General, we don't do anything without bringing our consumers along with us. She loves that new front-end, that new prototype.","And the investments will come in areas like cooler expansion and other areas, but rest assured that our team has looked at ways to pull costs out of the build, as well as the investments inside the box, to help offset that. So we feel very confident in maintaining the returns that we currently see today as we go into our 2016 pipeline.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Great. Thanks very much.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","Operator, I know we're at the top of the hour. So we'll go ahead and cut it off here. We may have left a few people in the queue. But Matt and I are around all day, so please give us a call and thank you for joining the call today. That will conclude our call.","Todd J.

Good afternoon and thank you for participating in today\u2019s call which is being recorded by Conference America, no other recordings or rebroadcast of this session are allowed without the company\u2019s permission. ","It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Gordon, Dollar General\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations.","Mary Winn Gordon","Thank you, Jeff and good afternoon everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO.","A couple of things before Rick begin, this afternoon we filed a preliminary prospective supplement relating to a potential secondary offers by several of our existing shareholders of up to 25 million shares of our common stock plus up to an additional 3.75 million shares to cover over allotment. No shares would be followed by the company. This offering is pending and we can see no assurance as to when it may be completed if at all. We will not comment further on our prepared remarks regarding the offering, nor will we address in the Q&A session that follows. So, (inaudible) thank you for not asking about this topic.","Next I\u2019d like to remind you all, our upcoming investor conference in Nashville on June 25 and 26. If you would like to register please feel free to call me or send me an email and we will get you the information.","Now to the first quarter results. We will go first through our prepared remarks and then we will open up the call for questions. Let me caution today\u2019s comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, objectives, anticipated financial and operating results and other matters. For example, our 2012 forecasted financial results and initiatives, expectations regarding potential debt and share repurchases, debt refinancing and capital expenditures and comments regarding expected consumer economic trends are forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements because they do not relate solely to historical matters or they contain words such as belief, anticipate, project, plan, expect, forecast, guided, intent will likely results or will continue.","Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements are included in our first quarter earnings release issued this afternoon, our 2011 10-K which was filed on March 22, and in the comments that are made on this call. You should not unduly rely on these statements which speak only as of today\u2019s date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call.

This information is not a substitute for the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other company.","Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you, Mary Winn, good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today. We had another record first quarter and we are on-track for a great year at Dollar General. David will provide more details on our financial results in a moment, but I want to share just a few highlights from the quarter. ","Our total sales increased 13% over last year to $3.9 billion. Same-store sales grew 6.7%, both customer traffic and average ticket increase for the 17th consecutive quarter. Operating profit excluding a $13 million litigation charge in 2011 and a secondary offering expenses in 2012 increased 15% to $385 million or 9.9% of sales. ","Interest expense was down $28 million and adjusted net income increased 29% to $215 million. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 31% to $0.63 per share. Sales were strong in every department in our consumables and seasonal category. And the positive sales momentum in home continued. ","We are very pleased with the sell through of our holiday, seasonal merchandise including Valentine\u2019s Day and Easter. Spring and summer seasonal sales had a strong and early start due to warmer weather and or improved product quality and assortment from our global sourcing initiatives. ","I\u2019ll talk more about our operating initiatives in a moment, but now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to David.","David Tehle","Thank you, Rick and good afternoon everyone. Rick covered the highlights of our first quarter sales performance, so I will start with gross profit. Gross profit dollars increased 13% for the quarter with a 2 basis point decrease in gross profit rate or essentially flat year-over-year at 31.5% of sales. This performance was better than we had anticipated going into the quarter for a number of reasons. ","First, we leveraged distribution and transportation cost, even though average diesel fuel rates were up about 7% and we brought two new distribution centers online in the quarter. Also year-over-year shrink was favorable and markups on beginning inventory were higher than last year. Finally, the LIFO provision in the quarter was $1.6 million compared to $3.6 million in the 2011 quarter, about 6 basis point favorable impacts. These factors were offset by higher markdown and a greater mix of consumables; in part the increased markdown resulted from our new apparel strategy and were anticipated. ","We were very pleased with the gross profit rates for the quarter. Our two new distribution centers ramped up more efficiently than we anticipated and our category management processes have continued to be very effective. ","SG&A expense was 21.6% of sales in the quarter a 20 basis point improvement after excluding $1 million in secondary offering expenses in 2012 quarter and $13.1 million related to certain litigation settlement in the 2011 quarter. The 20 basis point improvement was primarily the result of our increased sales in more effective utilization of store labor which was due to benefits from our workforce management system. Also our mining for cost reductions mindset continues to pay benefit. For example, our cost reduction efforts effecting store rent and other expenses contributed to the overall decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sale. ","Several expense items increased at a higher rate than our increase in sales including fees associated with the increased use of debit cards, cost associated with opening our new distribution centers and higher worker\u2019s compensation and general liability insurance and advertising cost, even though our worker\u2019s comp cost increased year-over-year due to more stores and labor hours and higher medical cost, our incident rate continues to decrease, thanks to safety efforts in our stores in DC. Again we are pleased with our ability to effectively balance sales, gross margin and SG&A resulting in strong operating profit growth.","Interest expense decreased to $37 million in the 2012 quarter compared to $66 million in last year\u2019s first quarter as a result of our debt reduction and refinancing. The effective income tax rate for the quarter was 38.2% compared to 38.1% in the 2011 quarter. ","First quarter net income increased 36% to $213 million compared to net income of $157 million in the 2011 quarter. On an adjusted basis net income increased 29% to $215 million compared to $166 million last year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.63 per share a 31% increase. We generated $193 million of cash from operating activity down $31 million from last year\u2019s first quarter. Net income was higher partially offset by higher income tax payment. In addition, there were timing and mix differences and our domestic merchandise payable. There were no policy changes or significant business trends that caused this shift. Partially offsetting these items were reduced bonus and interest payment. ","Our 53 week fiscal year in 2011 in also affecting certain of our working capital accounts, but we expect [income tax] to be minimal by the end of 2012. As of May 04 total inventories were $2 billion up 13% in total and 7% on a per store basis in line with our sales growth. Our inventory turns were 5.3 times. We have seen improving in stock levels even as we continue to focus on inventory reduction. ","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $146 million including $33 million related to new fleet stores, $36 million for stores we purchased or build $41 million for upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores, $31 million for distribution and transportation and $4 million for information systems upgrade. ","During the quarter we opened 128 new stores and remodeled or relocated 224 stores. ","On April 2, we purchased 6.8 million shares of our common stock to $300 million concurrent with the closing of the secondary offering funding the repurchase with $300 million in borrowings under our revolver. Given the seasonality of our cash flows and ability to execute additional share repurchases, we currently expect (inaudible) Board of Directors for additional authorization in the fourth quarter of this year. ","At the end of the quarter we had outstanding long-term obligations of $2.88 billion down $382 million from the year prior with a much lower average borrowing rate. We continue to take steps to positively manage our debt structure and maturity ladder. ","On March 30, 2012 our term loan facility was amended and restated to extend the maturity on $880 million of the total $1.96 billion facility to July 2017 from July 2014. In addition, the new terms provide for the ability to refinance our existing senior subordinated notes with senior notes and provide additional capacity to make investments, restricted payment and debt prepayment.","Further, in April S&P rates our credit rating to BBB minus the first level into investment grade. There are numerous benefits of the investment grade rating which should favorably impact our borrowings, rental rates and our collateral and covenant requirement.","Now to guidance, we\u2019ve had a strong start to the year. Based on our first quarter results, we are raising our full-year earnings guidance by $0.03, earnings per share adjusted is now expected to be approximately $2.68 to $2.78 based on approximately 336 million weighted average diluted shares. Previous guidance was $2.65 to $2.75 based on 335 million shares.","We currently expect total sales to increase between 8 and 9% over the 53 week 2011 fiscal year or between 10 and 11% on a comparable 52 week basis.","Same-store sales based on a comparable 52 week period are expected to increase 3 to 5%. Adjusted operating profit is now expected to be in the range of 1.62 to $1.66 billion compared to previous guidance of 1.60 to $1.65 billion.","Interest expense is still expected to be in the range of $145 million to $155 million based on our intent to redeem our senior subordinated note for refinancing at the first scheduled call dating July 2012.","The full-year 2012 effective tax rate is expected to be between 38 and 39%. For the year we plan to open approximately 625 new stores and to remodel or relocate a total of approximately 550 stores. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of 600 million to $650 million.   ","As our first quarter performance indicate, I believe we are well positioned for future growth. Our employees are executing on our plans to win with our customers as we state through to our EDLP strategy. This results in a bright financial outlook for 2012 allowing us to continue to invest in the business for sustainable growth drive returns and generate significant operating free cash flow.","I look forward to seeing everyone and sharing more insights about Dollar General at our upcoming Investor Day. With that I will turn the call back over to Rick.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you, David. We had yet another great quarter and we are focused on growing and improving everyday as we continue to build loyalty with our customers. ","In our investor conference later this month we intent to share some new insights into our customer for spending habits and a few things that have changed in recent years. But the ultimate measure of customer trend shows up in our continued strong market share performance as measured in syndicated data. ","Over the last 12 weeks, 24 weeks and most importantly 52 weeks, our consumables consistently gained share in both units and dollars against food, drug in the mass retail channel. In our year-end conference call, we discussed our most significant operating initiatives for 2012 and here is the quick update. ","First, store growth. To the first quarter we opened 128 new stores including eight Dollar General market and seven Dollar General pluses with our new larger format stores. The DG plus stores have an expanded cougar section for convenience, wider aisles for shopability and increased linear space for better in stock position. This larger format layout is driving a higher basket as we continue for customers both value and convenience. ","In addition, we remodeled or relocated 224 stores in the quarter including 12 Dollar General market remodels and 20 Dollar General plus stores. We opened 11 new stores in California and also added our first store in Massachusetts. These new states are all off to a great start. At the end of the first quarter, we had 10,052 stores in 40 states.","To support our stores we opened a new distribution center in Bessemer, Alabama and another in Lubbock, California in the first quarter. We are very pleased with how well these DCs are performing. ","Currently, we are shifting approximately 700 stores out of Bessemer and 100 stores out of Lubbock. Later this year, we plan to begin construction on our distribution center to support our store growth in the Northeast. ","Our category management efforts are ongoing. We made great progress on implementing Phase 5 our initiatives aimed at optimizing shelf space to reflect demand in the stores based on geography, demographics and actual customer experience. In typical DG fashion, we began a test and learnt of this concept in 2011 and have already impacted more than 5,000 store specific [plantogram] changes out of the potential for 40 to 50,000 opportunities. This is a multiyear initiatives designed to drive productive sales growth that our store managers and teams are excited about implementing for our customers. ","We continue to move forward with adding items at a $1 price point. Currently about 26% of the items in our stores are $1 or less. That\u2019s up 150 basis points from the beginning of 2011. We are very pleased with the results of our cougar expansion. Most of our new stores have been built with 16 cougar doors and we expanded the number of cougars in over 500 of our traditional stores in the first quarter.","As I mentioned earlier, we had strong performance in many of our non-consumables departments in the quarter including hardware, toys, summer seasonal, house wears and domestic. Apparel sales overall continue to struggle but there were several positives in the quarter including infants and toddlers, ladies sleep wear and under garments and accessories. Hanging apparel in particular continues to be an area where we believe we can improve our results. We are executing our fresh approach to apparel pricing as we are adding in season promotional events and we are flowing new apparel to the stores more frequently, so that our customer sees fresh merchandised more often.","We are making further progress and improving our in-stock levels contributing to enhanced customer shopping experience overall. Out of stocks in the first quarter were down 30% from a year ago. This is an ongoing effort and we believe that our focus in this area can continue to drive sales growth going forward. we believe the initiatives is contributing to the positive results we are seeing in our customer service scores. ","The success of the Dollar General business model has always been based on everyday low price commitment and we are unwavering in that commitment. We are convinced that the EDLP strategy is one of the things that distinguish Dollar General in the mind of a loyal customers. With only 10,000 SKUs we believe that our customer is incredibly sensitive to all of our price movements. We have used our price optimization tool in support of the EDLP strategy since 2009 to help us deliver our margin targets while also maintaining that strong competitive price position. But we are very careful in the way we use this tool. In support of its own pricing the tool generates both price decreased and increases, but we always make sure we ultimately protect our unit growth. So, that is the critical measure of success of our pricing approach in the long run. ","We currently have eight zones for pricing and generally our approach to its own pricing is to keep it simple, supporting a consistent price and need to cross our stores. As David mentioned our store workforce management system has been instrumental in helping us more effectively manage labor cost while improving our store execution and overall customer experience. We are continuing to improve the quality of reports and communications between the store managers and the district managers. We believe we have additional opportunities to utilize this system, to help streamline work in the stores. ","We are also moving forward with the implementation of our new supply chain system which we expect to complete over a multiyear timeframe. As we said before this project spans the entire organization with the goal to reduce cost, increase efficiency and improve margins. From master data management, merchandising assortments and in-store operations to forecasting and replenishments, distribution and supplier management, we will have an end-to-end capabilities for our supply chain.","In summary, we are improving our operations across the board and believe we have long run way for continued success. While it's still early I\u2019m pleased with the start of the second quarter. We are building our systems and our teams to support to long-term consistent and sustainable growth. ","Before we take your questions, I want to thank our over 90,000 Dollar General employees and our new teams in Bessemer, Alabama and Lubbock, California. We have a great team now for coast-to-coast. Now we will take your questions. Mary Winn.","Mary Winn Gordon","Great. Thank you. So, Jeff, take first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenhiem Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenhiem Partners","If you look at SG&A, so the run rate had been in the high single-digits bumped up here to 12. So, how about your value do you look at as timing and were transitory versus something that\u2019s more structural. And I guess how much of that was the growth initiatives in the DC in California?","Rick Dreiling","Definitely a piece of that has to do with the growth initiatives both in terms of incremental advertising cost that we had in the quarter that we will continue to have in the second quarter to support our California effort and then the cost as we mentioned before as the distribution centers come up to speed before they start shipping piece of that cost goes to SG&A because it can\u2019t be capitalized into inventory. And that\u2019s definitely hitting in the quarter also. For the full-year our goal remains to leverage SG&A as we told you before and again we don\u2019t give specific quarterly guidance on that, but clearly there are few items hitting there that we mentioned that are causing SG&A to be a little bit higher that won\u2019t be there as we get on an ongoing basis more back to average run rate for the business.","John Heinbockel - Guggenhiem Partners","Nothing has changed when you look at the various expense items, nothing has changed structurally. ","Rick Dreiling","That\u2019s correct. Nothing has changed structurally.","John Heinbockel - Guggenhiem Partners","And secondly, Rick can you talk about DG plus versus DG market in terms of differences in returns. How you think about where you put a plus versus a market; distinguish types of locations between the two. And do you think DG plus has more potential when you looked out over 5 to 10 years than market would.","Rick Dreiling","It's still really early as far as the returns are and we are continuing to work our way through them. I will tell you I\u2019m pleased with the progress we are making on both the plus and the Dollar General market. I view the Dollar General plus, John, as the opportunity where we anticipate doing larger volume. I think if you think in terms of the 7300 square foot store that store gets really constrained when you start doing a 1.7 million, 1.9 million a door in the DG plus, [look forward] to see opportunity with incremental refrigerated space, wider aisles of two carts can get by and of course, an additional linear footage to help us with our in-stock. The DG market we are still very excited about. We think I get to see opportunity to differentiate ourselves in rural markets as well as perhaps the urban environment down the road. So, what we promise to do is keep you guys at the data as we move through the year on all of this. ","John Heinbockel - Guggenhiem Partners","When you look at non-consumables, do any categories jump out where you think you need to increase assortment where you think there is a market opportunity, be it house wares or toys is there something that jumps out as unique opportunity to add assortment.","Rick Dreiling","I\u2019d say, John, as I look across the non-consumable side I\u2019m very pleased with where we are going in seasonal. We are doing a lot of hard work on and again as much improvement as we made getting it really hard again toward the end of the year. And you have to say what we are seeing in home d\u00e9cor what we are seeing with window treatments items like that, I\u2019m pleased with what I\u2019m seeing there. Our struggle continues to be hanging apparel and we are still working on that. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Grom from Deutsche Bank.","Charles Grom - Deutsche Bank","What you guys think the market potential is for plus stores. And just to clarify are those remodels or they actually new stores that you guys are opening.","Rick Dreiling","Ts actually a combination of both. We have remodeled some higher volume Dollar General, see if we get a bigger leap with the additional space or relocate it them rather, then of course some of them are out of the ground. And in terms of what is the long-term potential we really haven\u2019t called that out yet other than to say, Chuck, we are pleased with what we are seeing at this stage of the game.","Charles Grom - Deutsche Bank","And on the comp just a little bit of clarity of the traffic and ticket during the quarter and also have a trended. And my follow-up, given the strength why not raise the comp guidance for the full-year and keep it to 3 to 5?","Rick Dreiling","We saw traffic and ticket both increase through the quarter. It came through the quarter as you can imagine with the shift in Easter. We had a good start in February, had a great March and of course it slowed a little in April. If I add March and April together and divide it by two you state yourself you had a really good April and March.","Charles Grom - Deutsche Bank","And follow-up on that, any major changes on the competitive landscape whether with FDO or with Wall-Mart?","Rick Dreiling","If I look at the overall competitive landscape, I\u2019d say it's actually a little calmer than we have seen in previous couple of quarters. You look at our numbers that we posted in the first quarter where we are certainly controlling what we can control.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deborah Weinswig from Citi.","Deborah Weinswig - Citi","What do you think you are in with regards to improving out of stock?","Rick Dreiling","I\u2019d say first quarter.","Deborah Weinswig - Citi","And then can you update us on your new apparel strategy?","Rick Dreiling","We started the apparel strategy, we are doing compared the more promotional pricing, we are pricing very much like you see when you would go into a more traditional seller of product. I can say that we have seen some traction in the infants and toddlers, we are doing little bit better than men\u2019s. The important thing is that we are seeing units improved, while we are still struggling on the overall sales number. We start to sell more of it. And I think we are going to have to give it a few more months to unwind and our new [VP] stuff doesn\u2019t really start to show up until September.","Deborah Weinswig - Citi","How should we think about the current margin benefit from global sourcing?","David Tehle","We continue to work on our sourcing effort overall receipts grew in the first quarter versus the year ago. It continues to be one of our largest items in terms of where we are going to get long-term margin growth. We have opened up, we are in the process of opening office in Turkey and one in Northern China. We continue to work on ways to increase that effort. So, I think we are getting a little bit more into consumables also on sourcing. So, we are pretty pleased with that effort right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aram Rubinson from Nomura Securities.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities","Two questions. First, if you can give us some line of sight into fresh and how the supply chain is perhaps being reworked to allow that overtime to find its way into the 10,000 stores that you got out there?","Rick Dreiling","In regards to the fresh items we are still using the outside companies that we have dealt with before. While we are moving a lot of product overall, it's still a small amount of product on the store-by-store basis. And we used two companies to help us, we use (inaudible) in the base stores in the plus stores and we use (inaudible) on the DG market.","Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities","And then just a follow-up, if you can give us a little line of sight in the LIFO that was little bit more favorable than it's been. Any idea on how we should think about full-year there.","Rick Dreiling","The LIFO charged in the quarter was $1.6 million versus $3.6 million in the prior year. And right now again this changes obviously every quarter and changes depending upon what vendors are doing on prices, but our best thought process is somewhere between 8 and $10 million in total for the full-year.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","You guys mentioned earlier that the mix of $1 price point items has increased to 150 basis points since 2011, what would be the total mix today and what\u2019s the initial impact on the overall basket.","Rick Dreiling","It's right about slightly north of 26% now. And in terms of the change in the basket, I don\u2019t know what that is off the top of my head. I can\u2019t tell you this though that we added the $1 items and we are not suffering any kind of cannibalization what are the items we added in. So, to give you an example, we put in anywhere from 12 to 16 foot with a $1 HBA and assorted items, and it didn\u2019t wrote our margin and it didn\u2019t cost us any sales. So, it's all incremental. So, our feel is it's a purchase we weren\u2019t getting.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","And then second question, can you talk about the initial performance from your California store, be it California store rollout.","Rick Dreiling","Yes. We have right at 10 stores in California and they are exceeding our real estate performers, so we are doing much better than we thought we would be doing.","Operator","Next question comes from Dan Wewer from Raymond James.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","Wanted to follow-up on your comments about that market share capture from the drug stores, big retailers and mass market. So thinking about the drug stores, you are obviously winning on pricing advantage. I\u2019m assuming breakeven on the convenience niche. On the other hand when you are taking share from the mass market you are probably winning on convenience breaking even on price. Is that the way you think about it, and are those three channels, which one do you think is the most vulnerable to yourself and your competitors.","Rick Dreiling","I think you called it perfectly. If you look at the Neilson data we are gaining share from grocery first, drug second and mass third. ","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","So, grocery winning on the convenience niche?","Rick Dreiling","I\u2019d think on grocery you are winning on price and convenience to be honest with you. I can see both.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","How do you see those three channels responding to your success. I can\u2019t imagine they just kind of sit there and not do anything to defend their market share.","Rick Dreiling","I think the issue is we deal if you look at all consumable retailing it's in $800 billion pie. And I think what\u2019s going on is that, Dan, we are taking a little bit from a lot of different spot and it's really hard to really focus on just us. So, I think as long as we (inaudible) which is everyday low price and convenience and don\u2019t get into the trap of going high low. I really believe that we are going to be able to move the business.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","The last question I have is on the sales productivity as a plus on the market stores. When you think about the extra 2 or 3,000 square feet in a DG plus, are you seeing any diminishing return on sales per square feet or is it actually increasing because the space you are devoting is primarily in consumables. ","Rick Dreiling","Yes, the sales per square foot is going up and it's a question now thus managing our way through what to build them and the marketing team is continuing to work on the mix so it's a matter of fine tuning the vehicle. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Parkhill from Morgan Stanley.","Joe Parkhill - Morgan Stanley","I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about your comps accelerating over the last 12 months, where do you think from income level perspective that\u2019s coming from. Are you seeing incremental trade down from a higher income consumer or do you think the lower income consumer is feeling a little better and maybe talk about paycheck cycle if you are seeing how that compares to the prior years?","Rick Dreiling","I\u2019d say we are still growing our share of wallet with our existing customer. And there has been no change in the fastest growing customer segment we have is $70,000 or more per year. So, I\u2019d say you are continuing to appeal to your core customer and at the same time the changes we made over the last four years are continuing to be recognized by the trade down and trade in customers. I apologize I forgot the second part of your question.","Joe Parkhill - Morgan Stanley","And if you could comment on the paycheck cycle if you are seeing it.","Rick Dreiling","I will tell you the paycheck cycles or as pronounced as they have been in the last 18 months and there has been no change in that. Every indication is that our customer is still very much affected by what\u2019s going on. And there has been no change in their sentiment at all just to be straight.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meredith Adler from Barclays Capital.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Just following on last set of questions about the consumer and the paycheck cycle. Do you accept food stamps in most of your stores, are you seeing any increase in the utilization of food stamps.","Rick Dreiling","We accept food stamps in all of our stores and the growth we have seen in food stamps mirrors the growth that\u2019s taking place in the country. It's not like growing significantly faster than anything else in the stores today.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","And then you talked a little bit about store specific planograms, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that. I\u2019m wondering whether you are talking about this allocating space differently to the same product maybe not having some products in stores. Are you or are you actually buying unique products that will only go into some source. And what do you think that means for the efficiency especially the distribution centers and the buying process.","Rick Dreiling","And to answer your question is one and two and not a lot of three. We are going in and I used the example of when you fill the store in a more matured neighborhood you would expand (inaudible). Basically the bulk of it sets the same, you know that\u2019s slower moving out and expand on the faster moving and perhaps even add just a couple of additional SKU. We are also looking at the fact that there might be some categories that we don\u2019t need in certain stores. But in terms it's going in and altering the mix and really change in the number of SKU that would be a logistics nightmare .","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","And can you comment on customer reaction. I guess to some extent this must go with the in-stock efforts you have got, right?","Rick Dreiling","And actually where we are seeing where it gets done is in improve in in-stock numbers, that\u2019s exactly right. The fun about it all is that the store managers are excited about it. Every time I go into a store it's been done, the store manager is like, why it take it so long to get it done. It's pretty neat.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Final question is just about, [we ever state] in California are you seeing any changes is it difficult to get some high store that you want. It sounds like you do buy some real estate and build your own stores is that more the case in California or less maybe just comment on changes in cost as well.","Rick Dreiling","Yes, I mean the real estate program the supplies we\u2019ve had in California has been the price of real estate. I said we said the couple of times. And in terms of build-to-suit programs and all that is very typically in what we are doing in other market there is no significant difference there.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","When you say [prices] and the pricing mean high.","Rick Dreiling","Low. There is abundance of real estate out there that\u2019s small, which is what we want.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","Can you talk about any changes in your inflation expectations, getting conversations with vendors at this stage.","David Tehle","It's definitely come down if you remember in fourth quarter we were like 200 basis point hit on inflation and now it's more like 50 basis points or for the full-year like 0.5%. So, it's definitely come down.","Rick Dreiling","We are seeing it broad across the water commodities sugar, and flower and oil everything is coming down.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And your reaction will you actually, how will you react. Are you trying to lower the price point or increase the value to the consumer\u2019s? ","Rick Dreiling","That\u2019s a case-by-case item, but I will tell you when we reinforce we are really committed to EDLP. So, we will do what we need to do.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","Second question is regarding the [UTCs] in the quarter. Were they a drag on a net basis and as they ramp up how should we think about the financial benefit as they should deliver?","David Tehle","Yes, clearly anytime you are opening up a new distribution center there is going to be somewhat of a drag because it's just not addition when you first start out. As we get down the learning curve and as we add more stores to each of the distribution centers they will get more efficient and ultimately obviously the reason we did it, it helps us particularly on our transportation cost cutting down the transportation, cutting down stem miles. So, yes it will absolutely help us in the long-term once we get with our initial startup period.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets","And how long does that typically take?","David Tehle","It varies by individual DC as we go, yes probably six to eight months. And again we believe in the February, March timeframe.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Zolidis from Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis - Buckingham Research","Two questions. One is you just mentioned that inflation seems to be coming down, yet comps have been accelerating for five consecutive quarters. What do you attribute the sequential improvement in comp.","Rick Dreiling","We have been relentlessly focused on unit growth. I think it's translating into more customers. I\u2019d tell you this time last year we made a pretty big call and I think it's worked out as they look back to last year.","John Zolidis - Buckingham Research","And by unit growth you mean the items that people are putting in their baskets?","Rick Dreiling","Well, what I mean is if you go back and you look at the last year, you had all of this inflation taking place and people were passing it all on to the customer and it slowed their unit growth. You recall we took our price increases a little bit at a time and actually didn\u2019t have some on and we kept our unit growth going and what you created more market share for us.","John Zolidis - Buckingham Research","And then my second question is on SG&A. I don\u2019t know if you can give us any more color regarding some of these other items you decided in the press release the debit card usage, the pre-opening cost, the higher worker\u2019s comp, general liability insurance, advertising all of these items that serve to dampen the SG&A leverage in 1Q. I don\u2019t know if you can quantify those. And then secondly going forward are there any of those that don\u2019t continue?","David Tehle","Again we really don\u2019t get that granular in terms of quantifying individual line items with SG&A. When we started the year we made the comment that for the full-year our goal is to leverage SG&A and that remain to be our goal as we go through the year, we don\u2019t see that changing. So, one item that goes away in SG&A is those DC cost that we talked about. Again as you are starting up the distribution center and you are not shipping yet SG&A does take a bit of it for that and that will go away.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Nemer from Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","Couple of questions; one your seasonal business had a nice acceleration and you call that it's a non-consumables categories like summer seasonal and toys. How much this you think is attributable to the weather and maybe how much could be the early results of Phase 5?","Rick Dreiling","I think the weather no doubt affected particularly the summer seasonal sales, we had a good Easter we had a good Valentine\u2019s but I will tell you there has also been a serious change in the product mix again this year not only in terms of what we have got but the quality and we have been managed the whole the retail on it. We are still seeing really good seasonal sales as we move through the quarter.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo Securities","And then secondly, could you give us an update on some of your new merchandised categories, maybe an update on beer and wine and the tobacco test in Las Vegas market. And one of your competitors announced the deal today a rollout of video rental machines in the stores and I\u2019m wondering if there is an opportunity for vending or type machines in the front of the stores.","Rick Dreiling","We are actually doing some work with red box as we speak also. And we have been working with it for few months now. We are happy with what we see, it does take a lot of transaction to make the red box thing work. I can\u2019t tell you that. In regards to beer and wine we are at about 3900 stores with a goal of trying to get to 5000. It's on-track we are still pleased with what we see in regards to what happens to the basket and we are pleased with what we see how it affect store comp. regards to cigarettes in Nevada, I\u2019d say it's unchanged we are seeing what we have seen since we have been doing it in November, we continue to work with it, but again we will wait until it plays out a little longer.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Mann from Johnson Rice. ","David Mann - Johnson Rice","Couple of questions. Comment you made earlier about SG&A, can you just clarify in terms of the advertising deleverage. Was all of that due to the increases spend in California or you doing some other spend throughout the company?","David Tehle","The vast majority is due to what we were doing in California.","David Mann - Johnson Rice","And at what point in time would you expect that to not have the deleveraging impact?","David Tehle","Well, we continue to grow California and experiment, so I guess it's little early to make that call yet. ","Rick Dreiling","David, when you enter a new market the money you spend out of the chute is going to be the least expensive long-term. And we really want to come out, we have a lot of thoughts on California, we are trying to come out of the box really stronger. ","David Mann - Johnson Rice","And then in terms of gross margin, on the last call you talked about seeing a slight gross margin contraction in the first half, given the results in the first quarter how should we think about that comment now with second quarter ahead of us","David Tehle","Yes, still a valid comment. For the full-year again our goal remains to leverage gross margin, I want to be clear on that. We don\u2019t see that happening in the second quarter because f the depreciation and some other expenses for the two new DCs that are going to impact the margin in Q2. And again as we talked about on the call in Q1, some of these expenses hit SG&A because they were pre-opening expenses from a timing perspective. Also for Q2 there will be a full quarter of depreciation hit for the DCs they weren\u2019t opened the first quarter they will opened second quarter. So, we will have somewhat of an impact there. As you want to stress again, once the new DC is get up to a full capacity their efficiency improves quite a bit and ultimately this will be a positive for Dollar General down the road, but we clearly still see that margin hit the first half of the year.","David Mann - Johnson Rice","One last question on gas prices, obviously in the latter part of the quarter you saw there is continued ramp up now they are coming down. Can you just elaborate any change in consumer behavior as that was going on that you could parse out or is it been not impact you too much?","Rick Dreiling","I\u2019d say I have looked at this really hard over the last four years trying to ascertain that when gas prices go up does this affect our business or when they go down. And all David and I can come up with is when gas prices are high people need us more often and when they come down they have more to spend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Emily Shanks from Barclays Capital.","Emily Shanks - Barclays Capital","I have one question, around the hang apparel mix, where do you think it's is that you guys are missing. I recognize it's been a volatile category for you for a number of years. Do you think it's a competitive issue, do you think that your consumer this is a fine. What are your views there?","Rick Dreiling","I think that we are going to need a little help with the economy before we really get that piece going. I can\u2019t tell you when we look at our market research, our customers buys for their child first, their husband second and themselves third. And I think since we are seeing a little bit of improvement now infants and toddlers and men\u2019s and boy\u2019s that might actually be varying out.  ","Operator","Our next question comes from Trey Schorgl from Credit Suisse.","Trey Schorgl - Credit Suisse","We were just wondering we have been seeing one of your primary competitors doing a lot of promotional activity, lot of buy one get one, 50% off. So we were interested in your comment about the competitor\u2019s intensity. I was just wondering do you think you have different price message as far as your focused on EDLP versus hi low. Do you think it's making your value proposition more meaningful for your customers.","Rick Dreiling","We are really committed to everyday low price. That\u2019s been the backbone of this company for all of the years we have spend here and I think if you listen to customers today, while they do recognize certain prices they are getting a little armory about not knowing what the price is going to be when they come in because they are promotional activity. So we are focused on EDLP, we think that\u2019s the right way to go and we think our numbers in the first quarter show that a successful strategy.","Operator","We are taking a question now from Joe Feldman Telsey from Advisory Group.","Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group","Just one more thing I wanted to ask was about freight cost actually, have you guys seen any issues there in terms of increased freight expenses and is there any pressure that you are seeing or is it just being offset by the distribution infrastructure?","David Tehle","Our freight cost have actually been down if we look at where we are as a percentage of sales. Some of that is due to our efforts reducing stem miles, improving cartons for load and things of that nature, but we have also done a very good job in negotiating our contracts and feel pretty good about where we are in freight right now.","Mary Winn Gordon","Well, thank you everyone for joining us today and always we appreciate your interest and hopefully we will see many of you in Nashville at the end of the month, and please come in if you have any questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Today is Thursday, March 13, 2013. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company earnings press release issued this morning. ","Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com, under Investor Information, Press Releases.","Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions, and other non-historical matters, such as our 2014 forecasted financial results and financial expenditures, our planned fiscal 2014 operating, merchandising and store growth initiative, our share repurchase expectations and statements regarding future consumer economic trends.","Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those reflected in or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning; our 2012 10-K, which was filed on March 25, 2013; our 2013 first, second and third quarter 10-Qs, and in the comments that are made on this call.

Today we reported results for the fourth quarter 2013 and the full year. 2013 had many successes for Dollar General, representing our 24th consecutive year of same store sales growth.","As you have heard from other retailers, the fourth quarter was a challenging time for our industry. While our sales results fell short of our expectations, we did successfully manage the business to deliver better than anticipated gross margin, SG&A expense control, and inventory growth in line with sales growth. We also delivered earnings per share at the midpoint of our guidance range.","Overall, the three most important factors in packing our sales in the quarter were one, the severe winter weather that the country experienced from Thanksgiving through January. Two, aggressive competitive promotions that we selectively did not participate in, and three, a pull back in our core customer spending, due to a number of factors, including reduced government assistance.","Turning first to the weather; across all of retail, much has been said about the weather in the fourth quarter. We experienced persistently adverse weather during the weather that was far greater than normal. As a result, we experienced significantly reduced selling hours, driven by a combination of stores that were closed, due to the inclement weather, and stores that operated on reduced hours.","There is no doubt that winter weather negatively impacted us across the country. When our core markets, like the mid-south and the Southeast get hit by severe winter storms, the communities are simply not well equipped to handle the snow and ice, and it takes a while for these markets to return to normal. As you can imagine, our distribution network was also significantly disrupted, in terms of inbound as well as outbound freight movement.","January is typically a strong period for us, as customers restock on the basics. Unfortunately, the last two weeks of January were the most severely impacted by extreme weather across a significant portion of our markets.","To sum up the weather impact, we estimate that in December 1,000 store selling days were impacted by weather, and we estimate that 7,000 selling days were impacted in January. Another way to look at this, is that 34 out of the 91 days in the quarter had a negative impact from the weather.","Second, competition was and continues to be aggressive. Not only in share of voice, but also on the key items being advertised, and the promotional pricing of these items. Promotional activity was particularly heightened during the crucial selling days going into Christmas, and pricing was aggressive across all channels of retail during the fourth quarter. While we made a conscious decision to selectively in this arena. Overall, we stay true to our everyday low price strategy, which our customers trust, and have come to depend on from us.","Finally, our core customer doesn't feel that she is out of the woods yet, economically, and continues to be cautious with her spending. All-in, the record ice and snow across many of our key markets, the shortened and more promotional holiday season, and the continued economic uncertainties for our core customer presented significant and greater than anticipated headwinds in the fourth quarter.","In our third quarter earnings call in early December, we shared with you our expectation that we would be chasing the calendar during the fourth quarter, due to the loss of six selling days between thanksgiving and Christmas. With the added impact of the weather, we simply were not able to close that gap, in spite of cycling our easiest comps of 2012.","As you most likely have personally experienced, some of the weather issues have continued into fiscal 2014. Our sales trend, starting out so far in the first quarter have been impacted by the continued weather volatility. But I am pleased to report, that on days when mother nature is more cooperative, we are very happy with our sales performance.","In spite of the quarter four headwinds, we remain focused on the long term growth and health of the company, and believe that we have plans in place for 2014 to control what we can control.","We continue to increase our overall market share of consumables in both units and dollars, across all markets, over the four week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week period ending February 15th, according to latest available news and data.","We still were able to increase both our customer traffic and average ticket for the 24th consecutive quarter, although, at a slower rate. We also leveraged our SG&A expenses and generated significant cash flow from operations, with an increase of more than 7%. During the fourth quarter, we returned $200 million to shareholders to the repurchase of our common stock for a full year total of $620 million or 11 million shares.","David is going to talk about the details, but I'd like to share the highlights of the year and our fourth quarter. Full year sales increased 9.2% to a record $17.5 billion, and sales per square foot increased to $220, compared to $216 a year ago. Same store sales were up 3.3% for the year, and 1.3% in the fourth quarter. Both average ticket and customer traffic were positive for the year, and for the quarter.","For the year, our gross margin rate decreased 69 basis points and we leveraged SG&A, excluding certain discrete items detailed in our press release by 31 basis points. For the quarter, our gross margin rate decreased by 58 basis points, which was somewhat better than we had expected. While there are always puts and takes on our margin performance, net-net, tobacco with the largest negative impact, and we leveraged SG&A expense by 14 basis points.","On the bottom line, net income in the fourth quarter increased 1.5%, with earnings per share up 4% over last year's fourth quarter, and for the year, our adjusted net income increased 6.5% to $1.04 billion, and adjusted earnings per share increased 10% to $3.20.","Looking back, we accomplished a great deal in 2013. We hit our upwardly revised target of opening 650 new stores, and exceeded our combined remodel and relocation target with 582 stores, increasing our selling square footage by 6.6%. In the fourth quarter, we opened our 12th distribution center in Bethel, Pennsylvania, to help us serve our growing store base in the northeast.","On the merchandising front, we continue to innovate and maximize the sales productivity of our stores. The biggest change to our merchandising mix in 2013 was the addition of tobacco products. We completed this effort in the second quarter, and tobacco sales are continuing to have a positive impact on our sales and store traffic. A key metric is the attachment rate, and we are continuing to see this grow, as 68% of our tobacco transactions include one or more additional items. In fact, 41% of tobacco transactions now including three or more items.","In the first half of the year, we expanded coolers in over 1,600 stores, giving our chain average to about 12 cooler doors per store. Perishables had delivered strong growth over the course of the year.","As part of our ongoing effort to maximize store productivity, we completed our Phase 5 optimization in 3,000 stores in the first half of 2013, and reallocated square footage from hanging apparel in 4,000 stores to health and beauty aid, with a focus on high margin private brands in the third quarter. Most of these changes were in our older legacy stores, where we continue to see opportunities for growth.","Looking at gross margin overall, we are very pleased with how the year progressed. Although, I am disappointed with our shrink performance for the year, we remain optimistic that the changes we implemented in 2013, will have a greater impact this year. For example, we installed defensive fixtures in about 2,600 of our higher risk stores in the first half of the year, and we began the process of eliminating some of the less productive, higher cost items, mainly in health and beauty later in the year.","I think this is an area, where we may have both overestimated our customer's willingness to purchase these higher ticket items, and underestimated the risk of shrinkage. Our SKU rationalization efforts to adjust this are well underway, with more than 300 SKUs eliminated in 2013, and an additional 300 identified or already eliminated in 2014, to ensure that we meet our customers needs, while also reducing our shrink risk.","From an expense reduction standpoint, we continue to benefit from the capabilities of our workforce management system. This system provides our store managers with a tool to assist them, as they prioritize and manage work, allowing them to be more effective in how they manage their staff and their stores.","Several work elimination initiatives were introduced in 2013, to help reduce or streamline the work in our stores. Approving efficiencies in our store has been, and will continue to be a significant priority for Dollar General. This is a cross functional initiative, to remove non-value added work and reinvesting in activities that allow our store managers and their teams to better serve our customers.","For instance, we are now supporting our rolltainers\/planograms to eliminate resorting and reduce the number of steps and rolltainer moves required to stock shelves. We have also established a new stocking program, that incorporates both training and productivity tracking.","We made further inroads with regards to hiring and developing employees. In 2013, over 60% of our management positions were filled by interim [ph] candidates. This represents continued strong improvement during the past two years, as we have made this a high priority.","As Dollar General grows, we want our employee to have the opportunity to build the careers and grow both personally and professionally with the company. We are constantly striving to feel the needs to meet the changing demand of our customers.","What we saw in 2013, was that our customer needed us more than ever. While much of the economy seems to have improved, many of our core customers are continuing to struggle, giving the well publicized headwind, such as reduced government benefits, continued high unemployment and underemployment, higher taxes, uncertainty around the healthcare costs, and a reduction in unemployment benefits, just to name a few.","So we are executing on our detailed plans for 2014. I think its fair to say that we plan to reach out to our customer and fill her everyday needs for basic consumable merchandise. Whether we are her first stop or a regular fill-in shop, we know that having the items our customer is depending on, at price points that meets her budget requirements, is crucial to our success and hers.","Of course, we are always looking for new items and new categories, that make her life easier, so you will see some of those in 2014 as well. Tough initiatives, supporting our four operating priorities in 2014 includes the following; leveraging category management, eliminating more, that is non-value added in the retail stores; continuing our mining for cost reduction program, with a target of over $50 million, which allows us the ability to reinvest in the business, offset other costs or drive our profitability. The testing of a lifecycle remodel program to build our brand positioning in the marketplace; continuing our focus on reducing shrink, and finally, enhancing our customer service program.","We talked about our new site location technology in our 2014 store growth plans in last quarter's call. We plan to open 700 new stores in 2014, and we are confident that we have substantial opportunities for store growth in both new and existing states for many years to come, as our new model estimates 14,000 current opportunities for the small box value retail sector in the United States.","We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2014 and our 2014 pipeline is full. We are excited about our plans, and I am confident that we can meet our operating goals. We continue to be cautious, regarding the economic outlook for our core customers, but we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they have come to expect from Dollar General.","Now David, will share a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial performance and our 2014 guidance.","David Tehle","Thank you, Rick, and good morning everyone. As Rick has reviewed the highlights of our performance, let me now take you through some of the financial details.","Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 31.9% of sales, a decrease of 58 basis points from last year's fourth quarter, and somewhat better than our updated 2013 guidance. Sales growth of tobacco products and perishables, both of which have lower gross margins, outpaced our other categories across both consumables and non-consumables. As expected, our shrink rate increased. These margin pressures were partially offset by a favorable LIFO credit, and a favorable impact of net purchase costs.","Total SG&A improved by 14 basis points in the fourth quarter. At the company, we did not meet the financial performance threshold for our annual team share incentive compensation. However, we made the decision to provide a modest discretionary bonus to employees, excluding officers, who are eligible for our team share bonus plan. This reduction in incentive compensation contributed 45 basis points to SG&A leverage in the fourth quarter. Primarily as a result of our sales performance, we delevered most of our other operating expenses.","Consistent with our performance throughout the year, bright spots included favorable results in workers comp and general liability, as well as employee benefits. Interest expense was $22 million for the fourth quarter, a reduction of $5 million from last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to our debt refinancing. Our tax rate for the quarter was 37.5% compared to 35.9% in the 2012 quarter. The prior year quarter included a $6.5 million or a $0.02 per share benefit related to the first three quarters of 2012 for the retroactive reinstatement of the work opportunity tax credits.","Turning to our cash flow; we generated more than $1.2 billion of cash from operating activities for the year, an increase of over 7% year-over-year. Total capital expenditures were $538 million, including $124 million for new leased stores, $76 million for stores purchased or built by us, $112 million for distribution centers, $187 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocation of existing stores, and $28 million for information system upgrades and technology related projects.","As of the end of the year, total inventories, at cost, were $2.6 billion up 6.5% in total, and less than 1% on a per store basis. As we had planned, we were successful in getting inventory growth in line with our sales growth, as we move through the year.","Regarding our share repurchase program, we repurchased an additional $200 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter. For the 2013 fiscal year, we repurchased $620 million or 11 million shares. So far in 2014, we have repurchased an additional 3.5 million or $200 million, using the majority of the cash proceeds from the closing of our sale leaseback transaction, leaving us with a remaining authorization of approximately $824 million.","Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we repurchased 33.8 million shares with a total return of cash to shareholders of $1.7 billion. We plan to remain consistent as well as opportunistic in share repurchases going forward.","Now for an overview of our guidance for 2014. We expect top line sales for 2014 to increase 8% to 9%. Overall, square footage is expected to grow 6% to 7% and same store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%.","With regard to expenses, we have significant headwinds in SG&A, that will result in us delevering SG&A in 2014. The most significant is a planned increase in our cash incentive compensation year-over-year. In recent years, we have met or exceeded the threshold for our team share annual cash incentive plan, making 2013 an anomaly. Based on our budgeting process, bonus targets have been established for 2014, and our quarterly approval will be based on our outlook as we move through the year.","Compared to 2013, this impact is estimated to be about $35 million or $0.07 per share, and an 18 basis points headwind to SG&A. Also we are facing increased costs in SG&A due to the implementation of the affordable care act. While we have made progress in minimizing the impact, this will likely be a headwind of about $10 million to $15 million or $0.02 to $0.03 per share, and five to eight basis points headwind to SG&A.","As a result of our sale leaseback transaction that closed in late January, we will be facing a modest increase in SG&A of approximately five basis points. The sale leaseback will have a negative impact to both operating profit and net income, however, this project is accretive to earnings per share, as we have already used the majority of the proceeds to repurchase shares.","In total, these three SG&A expense items, will likely negatively impact this by $55 m n to $60 million or 28 to 30 points of SG&A deleverage in total. The anticipated earnings per share impact is about $0.09 to $0.10 for the combined incentive comp and SGA [ph] headwinds.","Post 2014, we would not expect year-over-year increases of this magnitude, but rather that these costs would be normalized into our operating performance going forward. We do expect that healthcare costs will continue to be subject to increases, depending on enrolment and our claims experience.","Adjusted operating profit is forecasted to be in the range of 2% to 5%. Profit growth is forecasted to be in the range of 2% to 5%. The anticipated SG&A headwinds are impacting this growth rate by approximately three percentage points. We are forecasting net interest expense for the year to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million.","We are committed to maintaining our investment grade rating, while managing to a leverage ratio of three times adjusted debt-to-EBITDA. At the same time, if circumstances in the debt and equity market were such that we deem it prudent to temporarily increase or decrease our debt levels, we may do so.","We expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 38%. We expect diluted earnings per share for the year to be $3.45 to $3.55, the growth rate of 8% to 11% on an adjusted basis over the $3.20 in 2013. Please keep in mind, the anticipated combined impact of incentive compensation in the affordable care act is approximately $45 million to $50 million or $0.09 to $0.10 per share. This is about three percentage points of growth on our adjusted earnings per share.","We are assuming in the range of 306 million to 307 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year, which assumes the anticipated repurchase of approximately $1.1 billion of our common stock, including what we have already completed in the first quarter. In total, this repurchase activity represents approximately 5% of our current market capitalization.","2014 capital expenditures are forecasted to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million. Specifically for the fiscal first quarter, we are forecasting a total increase in sales of 7% to 8%, same store sales growth of 2% to 3%, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 to $0.74. There are several factors that are weighing on our first quarter results. As we mentioned, the adverse weather impacting sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 has continued into the first quarter this year. Gross margin will continue to be impacted by our tobacco introduction, as this product category was not fully launched until the second quarter of 2013.","On a quarterly basis, the anticipated impact of the incentive compensation and SGA [ph] on earnings per share is weighted to the second half of the year, due to timing, year-over-year.","As you build your quarterly models for the remainder of the year, please keep in mind, that we will still be facing the negative gross margin rate impact of the 2013 introduction of tobacco in Q1 and Q2.","As has been the trend, for the last several years, we believe our customer's discretionary spending will continue to be constrained in 2014. As our long term track record demonstrates, Dollar General is well positioned to serve our customers, regardless of how the economy plays out.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Rick.","Richard Dreiling","Thanks David. Dollar General is a strong and growing business with tremendous high return, store growth opportunities that we intend to capture. Our long term commitment to growth in shareholder value are unchanged. We have a business model that generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases.","My sincere appreciation goes out to more than 100,000 Dollar General employees for all they do to fulfill our mission of serving others, in the more than 1.5 billion annual customer transactions.","With that Mary Winn, we'd now like to open it up for questions.","Mary Winn Pilkington","All right. Operator, we will take our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Richard Dreiling","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","But I wanted to ask a question about operating income growth? Certainly understand that these factors, particularly the incentive comp, is very specific to 2014. But as we look beyond this upcoming year, I mean, are you stating that operating income growth can be back to at or better than top line growth going forward?","David Tehle","Well Paul, we are not giving specific guidance beyond 2014. But I did say in my prepared comments, that we do think we have got some headwinds in 2014 that won't reoccur as we get out, 2014 and in 2015 and beyond. Specifically, we talked about the team share of the incentive comp being $35 million or $0.07 a share, 18 basis points on SG&A. We talked about the affordable care act, that's $10 million to $15 million or five to eight basis points, $0.02 to $0.03 earnings per share, and then the sale leaseback, although it doesn't hit earning per share, it does hit the basis point on SG&A, and that was about $10 million.","So we have some discrete items here that are impacting 2014, and again, as we get beyond 2014, we see these being more normalized and not being an impact as we get into 2015 and beyond. And again, we are just not giving specific guidance beyond 2014 at this point in time.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Fair enough. And then just moving to the top line; in addition to the weather, it was mentioned that there is consumer headwinds, taxes, healthcare, etcetera, along with some competitive headwinds, with Walmart and others being promotional, and also trying to open up small stores. Can you just go a little bit deeper into the top line initiatives, and help us be comfortable with your ability to steal comp 3% to 4% in 2014. What are you expecting from the D2 remodels, and what kind of lift are you seeing, as you make these planogram changes? That color would be helpful.","Richard Dreiling","Yeah Paul. I will take that one. A couple of things here. First of all, our remodel, relocation and new store program continues to be as healthy as ever. Our new stores continue to open up at 85% to 90% of our average cost number. I have looked at some real estate numbers just yesterday, redoing the 2013 projects, and they were tracking at almost 101% of our projections. So continue to be very-very healthy.","As I have historically laid out on this call, all of our initiatives going forward in a lot of detail, and I have elected this year, because of the intensity of the competitive environment out there, to choose to whether come back to you and tell you how we are doing, once we get them done. But I will tell you, that we are focused on SKU productivity. We actually believe we can do more in 2014, with less SKUs. We have examined a lot of categories, and we have discovered there are categories we can expand, and categories that we are going to contract, as we move through the year.","We have become highly focused on not just work simplification, but work elimination in the retail stores, which will free up our store managers and district managers to be more involved in the merchandising in store standards.","We are also, which I will report on, as we move through the year had developed what we were calling a lifecycle remodel. And the majority of these stores are undersized by our current standards, they are in the 5,700 to 6,500 square feet, and these are stores that historically we might stand up and say, hey let's relocate them, but they are in cheaper sites now. They are in good spots. We don't have the opportunity to expand them, and we have done some experimentation with going in and working the smaller store, and is costing us about 30% less to remodel them, and we are generating a return that's 25% to 40% higher. And really what this evolves is going in of rushing the store up in terms of our new [indiscernible] package, and then making the commitment to the light categories that are in there, rather than trying to play in every category, really focusing on those that are most productive. Then of course, we are going to continue to stay focused on category management. ","And I know Paul, that's kind of much broader than we historically have given you, but I would rather report you this year on how we are doing, versus laying it out on the table upfront.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","All right. Thank you. Best of luck.","Richard Dreiling","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Richard Dreiling","Good morning Peter.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Operator, we seem to be having a delay before the lines come on. So if we could just see what we could do about that, we would appreciate it.","Richard Dreiling","So Peter, we missed the first part of what you were saying.","Peter Keith - Piper Jaffray","Sure. I will restart. First up, good morning. When I look at the comp guidance for Q1 in the context of the full year guide. You are guiding two to three, so the full year guidance of three to four implies some acceleration, at the same time, they are going to be lapping [indiscernible] out of the second quarter. So assuming you kind of have an easy compare in the fourth quarter, but I wanted to get some comfort around, how you're thinking about the acceleration, quarters two through four?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah. Great question. Actually, we are feeling very comfortable about the merchandising initiatives that are starting to roll out. We are actually getting ready to do our spring road show, where we go out Peter, and lay all those out with the store managers. We are very comfortable there. And we are also, I think the competitive environment is going to settle down. And really intense competitive environment has a habit of coming and going, and when that does happen, I believe the role of EDLT is going to be even more important, than the promotional activity that we have seen recently.","And I also think, I fall back to what we said in our comments, when mother nature is not interfering with what's going on, we are pleased with what we are seeing, and I know the groundhog is getting every bit they can out of seeing their shadows this year. But we think the good spring weather is coming.","David Tehle","I just want to jump on the weather piece of it, that in -- so far in first quarter, we have continued to have a weather impact, and that plays a big role in how we set our guidance for the quarter.","Peter Keith - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Very good. On the weather, certainly you guys are going to have a disruption with closures. I was curious more on the backdrop of energy costs. Have you seen sort of an overhang at some of the cold weather impacted markets of lower comp, as maybe a discretionary income of your customers has come down a bit?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah, I can't tell you. I took -- it's interesting you brought this up. We took the 1,000 stores, put the bottom 1,000 stores that were the hardest hit in regards to temperature, and compare them to 1,000 stores, that were in areas that weren't as severely impacted by the weather. And Peter, the significant change in the comp -- is a significant difference in the comp.","I attribute that to two things. Number one, the weather. I do think, that we do know that natural gas and propane are both going to be up [ph] significantly for the consumer, and we might be seeing some of those higher eating bills working their way through now. So it\u2019s a little bit of both.","Peter Keith - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Very good, and good luck in this coming year.","Richard Dreiling","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Richard Dreiling","Good morning Ed.","Judah Seidman - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Its actually Judah on for Ed. Just want to first follow-up on just the operating margin guidance. I think even X the items that you called out, the growth is a little lower than we expected, which seems like there may be some gross margin impact that's more than we anticipate. Can you talk a little bit more, beyond tobacco, about what's going on with the gross margin, you called out kind of the macros hurting that a little bit also.","David Tehle","I will take it off, and please, jump in Rick. As we look at our gross margins for the year, clearly, the first half of the year is being impacted by the back of -- particularly the first quarter, but also in the second quarter. and then as we get to the back half of the year, that mitigates, and right now we are actually forecasting, but as we get into third and fourth quarter, we should start seeing some leverage in gross margin. So I don't think there is a whole lot besides the tobacco impact, talk about here. On the first -- we talked about shrink. We see shrink improving, as we go through the year, and again, that will be more second half based than first half based. We are still dealing with that a little bit here in the first half of the year. But besides those items, I don't think there are many other items in gross margin that would have an impact.","Judah Seidman - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then just a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about the comments out of Walmart, that they are going to be expanding their small store rollout. It's clearly not a huge number of stores, whether it's focused on that Express format, that may be competes a little bit more with you guys?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah, I mean, Walmart is a fabulous competitor, there is absolutely no doubt about it. I think though, Judah, if you look at it, their primary focus is the neighborhood store. They are talking about adding 100 Express stores I think this coming year, and primarily, their focus is on the neighborhood market. And we are going to open up over 700 stores. So I think we have got a significant lead here, and we will just have to see how that one plays out.","Judah Seidman - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan.","Richard Dreiling","Good morning Matt.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan","Good morning. So as we think about your model beyond 2014, is it fair to think about at 3% comp or so, flattish gross margins and a low single digit leverage point, is kind of a baseline. Any color you can kind of give us on how to think about the model over a multiyear basis would be really helpful?","David Tehle","I have to go back to my earlier comment, that we know we have items in 2014, the team share, the affordable care act, and the sale leaseback that are having an impact, particularly on our SG&A and our operating [indiscernible] as you go to the bottom line, that should be more normalized as we get outside of 2014. But again beyond that, we are just not giving guidance over and beyond 2014 at this point in time.","Richard Dreiling","Matt, I would say is, what David is calling on is spot on. I would say to you, that we have a long track record though of really good results. So I wouldn't let 2014 influence me looking forward.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan","Right. On the same store sales front, the 3% to 4%, I think you [indiscernible], you basically get 200 basis points just from the store opening, waterfall and relocations. Just kind of trying to plug the delta between the 3% to 4% and the two, I guess that's some of the merchandising initiatives that you said are still to come?","Richard Dreiling","That's exactly right. We call off historically 1.5% to 2% on the real estate program, and then the rest is what we are going to do, going through the course of the year to drive traffic and sales.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan","And then, last question, on the square footage front. So last call you raised saturation target, about 40%, 14,000. Have you seen anything competitively that would relate to the availability of sites, and one thing I was wondering is, would you guys consider acceleration? Is that an opportunity, if a key competitor were to slow the growth for a few years here?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah I think the issue of accelerating the new store growth is one that David and I wrestle with all the time. We are very much into organizational capacity, and if you think of that, at every year that we have been together here as a team, we have upped the number of new stores that we have opened. And what we don't want to do, is get ourselves into the jam the company got itself into several years ago, where it actually had to come in and close 400 stores; because in the rush to open new stores, we were more focused on quantity, rather than quality. And I would rather guys open 700 stores and open them right, than open 850 and be marginal.","So its something we wrestle with all the time, it\u2019s a very fair question. But right now, we are very comfortable with the number of stores we are going to open.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan","Great. Good luck.","Richard Dreiling","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenhiem Securities.","Richard Dreiling","Good morning John.","John Heinbockel - Guggenhiem Partners","Good morning Rick. So let me start with, strategically, when you look at the discretionary categories, which you've struggled for a couple of years here. How do you think about that business longer term? In terms of -- I think you have cut back a little bit on apparel. But really thinking about, giving a major change there in terms of space allocation, what you carry in terms of SKUs, maybe you cutback toys? Categories that are hard to compete in, beyond convenience. How do you think about revitalizing that business, or is it just a matter of the economy getting better?","Richard Dreiling","Actually John, it\u2019s a combination of both. We said all along, that we are really comfortable with these tests we have taken in non-consumables, in terms of the branding, how the product is positioned in the stores, the quality, the fact that we may be able to improve the quality and reduce the price to the consumer, and we are going to need some help with the economy.","Having said that though, Phase 5 is a perfect example of how we are looking at everything. And we are saying that every category has to carry its own water in the store. And if you look at the fact that we have reduced hanging apparel in some areas, we are committed to getting the store balanced properly. But having said all that, we think the non-consumable side of the business is incredibly important. We are today's general store, and getting that offering moving, we think is incredibly important to the overall mix, and to our planned proposition. So we are very committed and we are still committed to it.","John Heinbockel - Guggenhiem Partners","All right. Then two final things. We had talked I think on the last call or the one before that, may be migrating some of the learnings from the DG market into the rest of the box, particularly something like produce. Any updated thought on that, and then secondly, how aggressive do you think in -- and how much of an opportunity do you think it is, going after the CBS tobacco customer? Big opportunity to go after that aggressively, or is that just kind of whatever falls into your lap, happens?","Richard Dreiling","Yeah, two good questions. We continue to experiment with Dollar General markets. You know John, I grew up selling produce and meat, and its pretty easy for me, but its very difficult teaching somebody how to sell it, when they are not used to selling it. In terms of rotation, how you order it, how you market down, how you keep it fresh. And right now, I don't see a lot of movement like moving produce items into the traditional DG. I will tell you, Todd and his team have based some learnings on the perishable side. On the cooler side, that we have been able to move into this traditional Dollar General stores, that are beneficial.","In regards to CDS thing, I think what happens when someone gives up a category like that, those sales just tend to go where they are going to go. I think we will get our share of it, but I don't think its going to be more than that.","John Heinbockel - Guggenhiem Partners","Okay. Thanks.","Richard Dreiling","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Richard Dreiling","Good morning Meredith.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to start by just talking a little bit about the gross margin; and, I know there has been a bunch of questions about it, but I actually want to be a little backward looking, and you had a very tough comparison this fourth quarter, and clearly shrink was a negative, the mix wasn't particularly a positive, and yet the gross margin was much better. Can you talk about may be what the factors were? You talked about the cost of product, but is that about global sourcing, or something else?","David Tehle","Our IMU was definitely better and our net purchase cost, ultimately was better in the quarter than we had in our original guidance forecast. And I think there are a whole variety of factors that go into that narrative, and quite honestly, it's a little hard to dissect and say exactly how much is due to what? You are definitely hitting on it there. A piece of it would be a little better activity going on in our foreign sourcing. We continue to expand products that we are sourcing in other places. We now do trash bags out of Thailand, crackers out of Colombia. We have $1 pasta out of Italy. We are doing some $1 lotions out of Mexico. It goes on and on. So we continue to be very-very innovative with what we are doing with our foreign sourcing.","Then I think just the merchants and the buyers did a better job overall, in terms of how they were able to partner with the vendors, and the types of deals that they were able to get for Dollar General. So I think it's a whole variety of things.","Richard Dreiling","And I think Meredith, I will throw out one thing too. I think it was our feeling, the environment was incredibly price competitive, and people were throwing prices during extreme weather conditions, that I don't think people will respond to anyway; because they couldn't get to the store, or they had already stocked up. We chose not to play in that, and we focused ourselves on taking care of the inventory we had in the store.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Okay. And I guess David, back to what you were saying, is there any reason to believe that sort of tailwinds you have in the gross margin, aren't going to continue? You didn't use up all the opportunities you had?","David Tehle","We still have a lot of opportunity in our private label, our foreign sourcing, and our shrink. Again, let's not forget, shrink unfortunately has been going the other way now for several quarters. So again, we continue to work those areas, and I think the question we have, Meredith, and we have talked about this before is, how much of that do we invest in price, staying true to EDLP, driving units through the box and growing margins, versus letting fall to the bottom line. As we have said publicly several times, that the most important thing for us, is making sure we have the EDLP operator, and that we continue to grow our market share. So we will have decisions to make on those private label sourcing, etcetera, the pluses we get there. How much of that do we let fall through and how much of it do we invest in price?","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Okay. And then I have another question, you actually said something and it surprised me a little bit about changes that you have made with the wall painters and how stuff that goes in, and I was under the impression that the wall painters were already sorted by aisle. That was the whole point of having rolltainers. Is that not true?","Richard Dreiling","That is 100% true. We have taken it and refined it even further, where the product actually comes out, how its laid out on the shelf. So imagine, all of the detergent used to show up for the detergent aisle, and now we are trying to lay the rolltainer outward actually matches to the shelf by the planogram.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Wow. That's great. And then I just have one other quick question. You did a sale leaseback, and I believe that you have been buying -- doing fee development for a while now. Is there significantly more owned real estate that you would consider monetizing, and presumably if you did. Not that you [indiscernible] shortage, but that you would also use that to buy back stock?","David Tehle","There are other opportunities in our real estate to do that, if we wanted to. We don't have any plans right now to capitalize on that at this point in time. So I would say just, stay tuned and it may be something that we will do in the future, as we evaluate doing incremental share buybacks. I do want to stress, when we do something like that, and we demonstrated this with what we did when we closed the deal in January. The main reason for doing that, is buying back stock, taking that cash, and buying back stock, and that's exactly how we funded the $200 million that we have already bought back in the fiscal first quarter, came from that -- the funds from the sale leaseback.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital","Great. Thank you very much.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Operator, we will move on to the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee.","Richard Dreiling","Good morning Chuck.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Hey, good morning. So we have obviously observed some irrational pricing in promotional incentive from your friend down in Charlotte. I am just wondering, how you characterize the environment today? And I guess more importantly, how do you react, I mean, to David's points a couple of months ago, you guys have been great about investing in price to drive units. Do you feel like, because of that activity today, that you need to step up your investments to continue to accelerate the traffic in your stores?","David Tehle","Yeah, I think Chuck, that is a very fair question. We do a lot of work on our sensitive items every month. We do a full book every quarter. And to be honest with you, the gap between me and the guy you mentioned, has not narrowed at all, and I do think they have been more promotional, and I think they have publicly said they want to back out of that.","I will tell you that we have responded on promotional items that we think are important to the consumer. But we are staying focused, true blue to every day low price, because we think long term, that always wins.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Great. Okay, great. Then I hopped on a couple of minutes late, but given the weather choppiness in the fourth quarter, I didn't know if you went through the monthly cadence throughout the quarter? And as a follow-on to that, the spread between the 1,000 good stores and the 1,000 bad stores, there has been a lot of retailers that have talked about that guy being somewhere in that 700 to 900 basis point range, the sort of delta. Is that fairly consistent with what you guys saw, when you look back?","David Tehle","I will say this, we didn't talk about the cadence of the quarter, but I will tell you, January was the day -- or January was the period in which the most affected days were there, that we experienced. And the gap between the bottom 1,000 and the high 1,000, why we didn't call out a specific number, I will tell you, it was significant.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Okay. And then just last question, a follow-up on Paul's from earlier, when you take a step back and you do heat maps on the productivity within the store by category, where do you feel like the biggest opportunity is to improve the sales productivity by category?","David Tehle","Yeah. I would tell you Chuck, probably the non-consumable side, and believe it or not, not the apparel side, but the hardware, the automotive, the steps where we think we really can't play well in, and we are pleased with the assortment. We just think we need a little bit of more help from the economy.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Okay. Good luck guys. Thanks.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Thank you. Operator, we will go to the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Richard Dreiling","Good morning Dan.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","Hey Rick. How are you doing?","Richard Dreiling","I am good sir. Thanks.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","I wanted to follow-up on your answer to Peter Keith's question regarding accelerating same store sales growth. Tobacco has been adding roughly 150 basis points to the same store sales. So taking that into account, your guidance implies comps maybe at 5% or better during the second half of the year. And yet, these non-tobacco categories have been struggling. You did indicate that you thought that the competitive pressures will be easier, this year than last year. But what if that doesn't happen? What if anything that becomes a bit more intense --?","David Tehle","I think, when I reflect back on, we had a pretty solid quarter two, quarter three. I think, I don't want to take quarter four, where we obviously suffered some severe, severe weather issues. And I think as we reflect on quarter four, we have to remember that when the weather is bad, people don't come to Dollar General to stock up, they go to the more traditional retailer, and they stock up there, and they go there for a number of reasons. Number one, we are a limited assortment, and more importantly, they can get what they want, right? There is broader depth. You can't do a Dollar General to buy sugar, with another 15 or 16 people, and then all of a sudden, there is no sugar, and then we don't deliver for another full week. So I don't think that you can necessarily look at everything that happened in quarter four, and push it out going forward.","I do think that tobacco, the point you are raising, is that it is adding to our comp line, and its doing exactly what we want. We are not looking at the comp number, we are looking at the transactions its driving. And again, if you look at the fourth quarter, we are one of the very few retailers who called off of that, that we still have transaction growth. So I feel, as we move through the back half of the year, that tobacco is going to continue to do what it has been doing. Its going to deliver transactions, and then more importantly, the attachment rate is continuing to grow.","So I feel pretty solid, feel pretty good about the back half of the year. Particularly, when I roll in what we intend to do on the initiative side.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","And then also, just wanted to make sure I understood your answer regarding pricing at Family Dollar. I guess, our understanding that their management believed the high low pricing strategy was probably competitive against Dollar General, and hence they are moving to a pricing strategy very similar to yours. Do you think that makes them a stronger competitor against Dollar General, or are you actually seeing opportunities that evolve from that transition on their part?","Richard Dreiling","I mean, as I look at our pricing studies that are conducted on the most sensitive items, I continue to see a gap that was very similar, to what it was five and six months ago. I do think that -- I do think when you deviate from EDLP, it takes a while to get that notion back into the customer's head. The customer is used to coming in and getting these one time prices right, and then its hard to reestablish that, hey, my price of Tide is good, day in and day out. So I don't want to really speculate on someone else's pricing strategy or what they are doing, I am just kind of saying, we are very comfortable with where we are today, and where we have been.","Dan Wewer - Raymond James","Okay great. Thank you and good luck.","Richard Dreiling","Thank you very much.","Mary Winn Pilkington","All right. Operator, we will go to the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo.","Richard Dreiling","Good morning Matt.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo","Good morning guys. So its very tough to gauge the category performance, given the weather issues. But in markets where weather wasn't or isn't a factor, do you see the spread between consumables and non-consumables growth getting narrower or wider?","David Tehle","I would say, about the same that we have seen historically. I would not say, that non-consumables is getting better, but I would also tell you, its not getting any worse. And we have tobacco in there too, Matt, which kind of just sorts the consumable side.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo","As you look at your 2014 guidance, is it fair to say that you don't have a non-consumables categories comping positive, and if not -- do you think that that's something that we could potentially see in 2015 or 2016?","David Tehle","Actually, we are quite bullish on the non-consumable side, and we are looking to see some solid comps on that side of the table in 2014.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo","And then, just lastly, if you look at the 2014 class of new stores, how would you characterize the mix between new and existing markets, and does anything change versus recent history?","David Tehle","Almost all of it will be in existing markets. We are going to add somewhere 50 and 60 stores in California. However, we are looking at California as an existing market now. But we will probably not enter in any new markets in 2014.","Matt Nemer - Wells Fargo","Okay great. Thanks. Good luck this year.","Richard Dreiling","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Montagna with Avondale Partners.","Richard Dreiling","Good morning Mark.","Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners","Hi. Good morning. Just a question on your apparel strategy. You cut back on those 4,000 stores. Does that change your -- given the results, does that change your outlook on may be other 7,000 stores perhaps coming back there?","Richard Dreiling","That's actually a very fair question. We are actually -- those 4,000 stores, very pleased with the numbers we have seen. Now those stores were more face constrained than our traditional store, and we made the decision there Mark, not trying to be everything to everybody on every category. So I would look at you and tell you, we haven't really arrived at that conclusion yet. I will tell you, as we look at apparel, so far into this quarter, we are actually -- I wouldn't say pleased, but we are seeing some rays of hope in our apparel strategy.","Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners","That's good. Then just a question, I know you don't like to comment so much on the current quarter. But what I have heard from other retailers this February, was actually even more weather impacted than January. Wondering if you are seeing that, when I think about that, when I look at your comp guidance for the quarter, first quarter versus the fiscal year and so I am wondering if you are seeing the same thing?","David Tehle","Yeah. I mean, I will tell you, the first 15 days of February were very tough. I will also tell you, the first 10 or 12 days of March were tough.","Mark Montagna - Avondale Partners","Okay. Yeah. That was -- appreciate that. Thank you.","Richard Dreiling","Thanks Mark.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Operator, I think we got time for one more question please.","Operator","Your last question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Richard Dreiling","Good morning Scott.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Actually I had some bigger picture questions for you. The first one goes to the plan changes for over time rules, that I think President Obama is going to lay out today. I think they are going to increase the 24,000 threshold. How should we think about that for you guys?","David Tehle","I got to tell you, I have heard all kinds of speculation on it. Where it's going to go, how significant it is. But I think, where we are right now, is we are kind of waiting to see what the President is going to do. I would be remiss if we didn't tell you, that we aren't evaluating several scenarios in looking at what the impact is going to be. But again, I don't think it will necessarily impact 2014, and its going to impact everybody. And I will tell you what I have always said to everybody on these calls, we are just a retailer, and whatever costs you can't remove from the system, eventually gets passed on.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Okay, great. I may follow-up with you guys offline about that in a little more detail. I want to actually move to a second one, as we are long on the call. Just wanted to understand, as you view it, Rick, the kind of the competitive advantage of just basically the Dollar business. It has always been about convenience, but also certainly price. It seems that the price component is fading a little bit. I know you talked to Meredith's question, talked a little bit about gross margin you didn't chase. But its hard not to notice, that people like Delhaize, down like with the Food Lion, their volumes are now strongly positive, and then from our own proprietary pricing surveys, we don't show the Dollar business necessarily, generally being priced much lower than some of the other competitors out there, that also offer convenience.","So just like from your point of view, I mean, where does this lead? I mean, it seems like everyone is kind of around the same place right now, and how does the Dollar business generally fit in, with this new environment?","Richard Dreiling","I think the competitive landscape has suddenly decided that the Dollar channel is a viable channel, that can't be ignored any longer. And I think there is a lot of work being done on that. I will tell you though, at the end of the day, what we bring to the table, is the true value proposition. And the beauty of our model is, is national brand is a national brand, and we have the ability to trade in and out of brands, and always have the best value in front of the customer. And I also tell you, the work that we are going to do in 2014, is all focused around that value proposition, and giving the customer even more choices, on those particular items.","And again, I would look at everybody and say, the environment has gotten very competitively intense. That does not sustain itself for a long-long period of time. Again, I fall back to, where everyday low price, every day of the week on the basic necessities that the customer needs, and I think that's going to serve us well into the future.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Thank you for taking my questions.","Richard Dreiling","You bet sir.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Operator, thank you very much, and thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. Emma Jo and I are around, if you have any other questions and we look forward to speaking to you soon. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

My name is Brandy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dollar General's Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Mary Winn Gordon, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations, you may begin your conference.","Mary Winn Gordon","Thank you, Brandy, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com, under Investor Information, Press Releases.","Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, objectives, anticipated financial and operating results and other nonhistorical matters. Some examples of forward-looking statements discussed in this call include our 2013 forecasted financial results and anticipated capital expenditures, our planned operating and merchandising initiatives for fiscal 2013, our share repurchase expectations and statements regarding future consumer economic trends. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning; our 2012 10-K, which was filed on March 25; our fourth -- first quarter 10-Q, which was filed on May 3; and our second quarter 10-Q, which was filed this morning; and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call.","We will also reference certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this morning's earnings release, which I mentioned is posted on dollargeneral.com. This information is not a substitute for any GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.","Richard W. Dreiling","Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. I'm pleased to report that our comp store sales accelerated to 5.1% in the quarter. This was on top of a 5.1% comp in the second quarter last year and a 5.9% comp the year before. I really want to emphasize that the acceleration of our traffic in the second quarter above our already strong traffic trends.","Both traffic and average tickets have increased for 22 consecutive quarters. Total sales grew 11.3% to $4.4 billion. While consumables showed the strongest gains, I was pleased with the overall sales growth across our non-consumable categories. Operating profit, excluding certain items, increased by 9% to $421 million, or 9.6% of sales, which was down just 24 basis points from last year as we managed the impact of lower-margin sales growth through strong SG&A leverage.","Our gross profit rate of 31.3% of sales was 65 basis points less than last year's second quarter, with the majority of the rate compression resulting from our very successful launch of tobacco products across the chain. Tobacco sales contributed nicely to our sales growth and SG&A leverage.","GAAP earnings per share increased 17% to $0.75. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased to $0.77, giving a strong double-digit growth.","We continue to return cash to our shareholders through $200 million of share repurchases in the second quarter. We had a strong second quarter and remain on track to meet the full year expectations we shared with you last quarter. We continue to increase our overall market share of consumables in units and dollars over the 4-week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week periods.","Our recent share gains according to Nielsen data actually accelerated during the second quarter. We see this as a clear sign that we are serving our customers' needs and playing an increasingly important role in their shopping routine.","I'll talk more about our operating initiatives in a moment, but now I'd like to turn the call over to David.","David M. Tehle","Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Rick covered the highlights of our second quarter sales performance, so starting with gross profit, I'll share more of the details.","Our gross profit increased 9% for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, gross profit decreased by 65 basis points to 31.3%. As expected, the gross margin rate was impacted by a higher consumables mix and lower initial markups, primarily due to the rollout of tobacco and the growth in the sales of perishables. In addition, our inventory shrinkage rate increased, although at a lower rate than in the first quarter. This margin compression was partially offset by a benefit from transportation efficiencies, lower markdowns, primarily due to the later timing of apparel markdowns and a favorable LIFO credit.","SG&A expense was 21.9% of sales in the 2013 period, or 21.8%, excluding an $8.5 million legal settlement. Our SG&A rate improved by 41 basis points, excluding certain items as detailed in our press release. Further improvements driven by our workforce management system resulted in strong retail labor expense leverage in the quarter. In addition, the year-over-year SG&A improvement reflect the decrease in incentive compensation expense, improved leverage on utilities costs and lower workers' compensation and general liability expenses.","Costs that increased at a higher rate than our increase in sales includes repairs and maintenance, debit card fees and depreciation and amortization. Interest expense of $21 million represents a $15 million decrease from the 2012 second quarter, the result of our favorable refinancing transactions over the past year.","The second quarter tax rate was a more normalized 37.4% compared to last year's effective tax rate of 34.1%, which reflected a $14.5 million favorable income tax audit resolution. Please keep in mind that in the second quarter of 2012, we called out this tax benefit of approximately $0.04 per share. Excluding this adjustment from last year, our 2013 effective rate was lower than last year's rate due primarily to federal jobs credits, which were not in effect in last year's quarter.","On a reported basis, our net income increased 15% to $245 million, or $0.75 per share in the 2013 quarter from $214 million, or $0.64 per share, in the 2012 quarter. Excluding the $8.5 million legal settlement, second quarter 2013 earnings per share was $0.77, in line with our internal expectations when we revised full year earnings guidance in our first quarter earnings call.","Adjusted earnings per share in the 2012 quarter was $0.69, as reconciled in our press release for that period. If you additionally subtract the $0.04 benefit resulting from the tax adjustment in the 2012 period, underlying second quarter 2013 earnings per share increased 18%.","Year-to-date, we generated cash from operations of $484 million, up $111 million from last year. Capital expenditures totaled $309 million, including $127 million for upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $66 million related to new leased stores; $52 million for stores we purchased or built; $49 million for distribution and transportation; and $12 million for information systems upgrade. Year-to-date, we have opened 375 new stores, which puts us well ahead of last year's base. We have also relocated or remodeled 377 stores, and we've made significant progress on our new distribution center in Bethel, Pennsylvania. We continue to be pleased with our performance of our new, relocated and remodeled stores.","As previously announced, we have repurchased $220 million of our common stock this year, including $200 million in the second quarter. We have approximately $424 million remaining in the existing authorization. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we have repurchased approximately $1.1 billion, or 23.6 million shares of our common stock, and we plan to remain consistent, as well as opportunistic, in our share repurchases going forward.","Looking at the balance sheet as of August 2, total inventories were $2.53 billion, up about 11% on a per-store basis. We made good progress from last quarter's inventory growth of 14%, even as the second quarter includes more impact from our tobacco rollout.","Higher inventory balances over the last couple of quarters have resulted in a modest decline in inventory turns to 4.9x. However, the quality and aging of our inventory continues to be in good shape, and we expect the year-over-year inventory growth rate to decrease as we move through the second half of the year.","As of August 2, we had outstanding long-term obligations of $2.87 billion, in line with last year's balance, although with much better rates and terms. We're very pleased with our current capital structure and the flexibility that it affords us. Now, to guidance.","We continue to expect total sales for the year to increase 10% to 11%. Same-store sales are expected to increase 4% to 5%. As a reminder, there are 6 fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will likely impact our sales to some extent in the fourth quarter.","We're forecasting gross margin contraction for the full year to be approximately 90 basis points. As you model gross margin performance in the third and fourth quarter, it's important to keep a couple of factors in perspective. As I mentioned, we had lower markdowns in the second quarter, primarily due to the timing of markdowns in apparel, given the way the summer weather played out. Year-over-year, we're forecasting a shift of some of these markdowns into the third quarter. The shift in weather gave us the opportunity to be nimble and maximize our sales of full-priced apparel items.","And finally, last year, we had our best gross margin performance in the fourth quarter, and we expect that comparison to be challenging. Adjusted operating profit for 2013 is expected to be in the range of $1.73 billion to $1.77 billion.","Interest expense is forecasted to be approximately $95 million. The full year 2013 effective tax rate is expected to be between 37.5% and 38%. Adjusted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.22. Our EPS forecast is based on approximately 324 million weighted average diluted shares, which assumes approximately $600 million of share repurchases for the full year.","Our full-year operating profit and earnings per share guidance are based on adjustments consistent with those detailed in our earnings release for the year-to-date results.","Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million. We now plan to open approximately 650 new stores for the full year. That's an increase of 15 stores from our previous guidance. Remodels and relocations are expected to total approximately 550 stores for the year.","In summary, our outlook for the year is solid. We remain excited about our organic growth opportunities. We are committed to returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and building on our proven track record.","For now, I'll turn the call back over to Rick.","Richard W. Dreiling","Thank you, David. We had a strong second quarter, and while it is still early, the third quarter is off to a solid start, and I believe we have a great plan for the remainder of the year. We remain cautious on our consumer and our spending in the second half of the year, as we have been all year. But as the result of our customer-focused initiatives, we are starting the quarter with momentum. Let's start with tobacco, our single largest undertaking in the second quarter.","We began the tobacco rollout in mid-March, halfway through the first quarter, and we exited the second quarter with the rollout of tobacco complete. This was a tremendous undertaking, and I would like to commend the entire Dollar General team for a remarkably successful implementation of tobacco across nearly 10,500 stores in a period of 3 months.","With the rollout now complete across the chain, coupled with the experience we have in our stores that have been selling tobacco for several months now, we're gaining greater insight into the tobacco category and our customers. As I said earlier, we are seeing a significant increase in our traffic, and tobacco has been a key driver.","Our experience so far reinforces my belief that traffic is the most important metric to watch as we measure the overall success of our decision to add tobacco products in our stores. Our sales and our traffic are continuing to build each week, along with our customers' awareness.","Tobacco sales are consistently running about 1\/3 tobacco-only, and the remaining 2\/3 are tobacco plus one or more items.","Next, during the second quarter, we completed Phase 5 of our evolution in merchandising. The focus of Phase 5 was to optimize productivity in our legacy stores, many of which are less than 7,000 square feet.","We went into these stores, about 3,000 of them, and reset various planograms to better utilize shelf and floor space by adding more productive items and eliminating less productive items, such as hanging apparel in some of the smaller stores. We are pleased with the sales comp lift from this initiative as our customers realize we've expanded our product assortments in key categories.","As a result of this project, we've identified additional opportunities for future productivity gains in these legacy stores. We continue to be pleased with the results of our cooler expansion for perishable items. Through the second quarter, we have added over 7,000 cooler doors, expanding coolers in over 1,600 existing stores. Most of these stores are now consistent with our new store standard of 16 cooler doors.","Through the second quarter, we opened 375 new stores, including 15 Dollar General Market and 21 Dollar General Plus formats. We're well ahead of where we were this time last year in the number of stores and operating weeks. Our new stores are continuing to deliver strong performance.","We now have 69 stores in California, stretching over 600 miles from north of Sacramento to south of San Bernardino. As we enter our second year in California, we're continuing to refine our market entry strategy to better optimize our overall performance. We are currently utilizing all 3 of our store formats in California, and we are pleased with our sales results.","As David mentioned, our current store development pipeline is robust, and we're raising our new store outlook for this year to 650 stores. We have remodeled or relocated 377 stores so far this year, including 65 Dollar General Plus stores. The Dollar General Plus format is a great tool for relocations, and the expanded refrigerated and frozen food assortment in these stores is driving a higher basket.","We're continuing to learn and test new ideas in our Dollar General Market, particularly in how to best serve our customers in the fresh meat and produce areas. In many of our market locations, these stores are providing a much needed option for a broader Dollar General shopping trip.","In our ongoing commitment to helping our customers save time and money and our own journey of elevating sales performance, we have continued to update the appearance and layout of our customer-centric store model. Freshening the look of the store is something I believe all great retailers should do periodically. This year, we have rolled out a new fresh look to further enhance our customer shopping experience. We've implemented the new format in more than 550 stores, including new stores, relocations and remodels. The updated 2013 design has new in-store signage and branding, with a refreshed look that leverages our yellow and black color scheme. We configured sections such as apparel and seasonal and yet again, improved the category adjacencies in these stores. We believe this well-designed format really makes sense and is proving to resonate with our customers. To date, we're excited about the comp sales lift in our remodels and relocations, and we're hearing great feedback from our customers on the new layout and fresh look.","At the end of the second quarter, we had 10,866 stores in 40 states, well on our way to reaching our 11,000 store milestone in October. And the good news is that we continue to see significant, exciting opportunities for organic growth.","Our customers are depending on our convenience and everyday low prices more than ever. We're focused on meeting their needs with the right merchandise selections at the right prices throughout the entire store. We're continually expanding our footprint and improving our operations and believe we have a long runway for continued success in both existing and new markets.","Before I open for questions, I want to thank our employees from coast to coast, serving our customers and representing the Dollar General brand in our communities every day. Now, Mary Winn, I'll open it up for questions.","Mary Winn Gordon","All right, Brandy, we'll start out with our first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","So our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you speak to the monthly progression and drivers of the traffic acceleration that you spoke to? And also, give us a little bit more color on August, both total sales and maybe some of the discretionary versus consumables? It sounds like you mentioned it was off to a pretty good start.","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. The -- quarter 2, the sales accelerated as we moved through the quarter. The really encouraging thing was not only did sales accelerate, but unit growth and market share growth accelerated as we moved through the quarter also, which is kind of how we called it and how we anticipated as we move through the balance of the year. In regard to August, I don't want to really get into where we are in the third quarter other than to really say that we feel pretty comfortable with where we are and where we're heading.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wow. That's great. And then secondly, can you speak to the rationale behind raising the new store growth target for this year, what you're seeing from some of your younger stores and then how we should think about the growth profile ahead. Any changes to your thinking?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. Actually, I think, as I look at the fact that we raised the number of new stores, it's driven primarily by the robustness of the store pipeline right now. As you guys remember, last year, we got a little bit behind on it, and we had to work our way through it. So we feel pretty good where we're going this year. And I should also throw out, too, as I sit here and think about the question, we're getting the stores open earlier this year, which I think is helping.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Brian Cullinane - Wolfe Research, LLC","This is actually Bryan Cullinane on for Scott. You highlighted -- you showed -- your comps were accelerated, and you highlighted that you're gaining share. Who do you guys think that, that share is coming from?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. When I look at Nielsen share data, it's coming from drug, first; grocery, second; and mass, third. And I think the other, Brian, wonderful thing about our format is we compete in that great, big world of consumable retailing, which is well over $800 billion. So we're able to go in and take a little bit from a lot of different spots, and we're kind of one of those guys you don't really feel.","Brian Cullinane - Wolfe Research, LLC","And then the second question -- we saw some good share repurchase activity. Can you just, maybe going forward, prioritize your uses of cash from where you stand now?","David M. Tehle","Yes, absolutely. It really hasn't changed from what we've articulated previously. Our #1 priority for cash is investing in the business, as evidenced by adding to the store count for this year. We're going to open new stores, we're going to do remodels, we're going to do relocations, and then we're going to make sure we have the infrastructure in the business to support the stores because that's our #1 priority, and we think that's the best return for our shareholders. And then with the cash that's left over, we'll buy back stock with that, as evidenced by the stock buyback you saw in the quarter, the $200 million buyback which we did at $51.28. So obviously, we got in there opportunistically, and we were able to get a nice slug of stock bought back. So those are really our priorities for cash.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the last one. Any sense for what you think the appropriate leverage point is in the business?","David M. Tehle","Yes. Right now -- and again, we've mentioned this before -- we believe it's best for us to be investment-grade, which implies a debt-to-EBITDA of about 3.0. And if you look at our statistics over the past several quarters, that's where we've been, and that's where we ended up in Q2. So that's the general leverage point that we're aiming for.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And would you be averse to taking on additional debt as you continue to generate excess cash as it comes in kind of above your plan or even within your plan?","David M. Tehle","Well, certainly, if we need to take on additional debt to stay at 3.0, we would definitely consider doing that. Yes.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one on -- just more fundamental question, which is when you think about the traffic that's being driven by tobacco, do you have any sense for -- if that's a new customer versus the existing customer just taking an additional trip?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I think it's actually a combination of both. And I -- we don't have a card, so it's really kind of hard to go in and measure, Stephen, what's going on. But our belief is that the customer that's coming in, that's primarily buying just tobacco, is probably the newer customer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up actually first on the last question on the leverage ratio and the appropriate level of business. Can you just maybe remind us why you think investment grade is so important? You've obviously operated at levels below that historically.","David M. Tehle","Yes. Well, I think we demonstrated that in the last refinancing that we did in terms of the interest rates that we were able to get on the debt. And you heard in my opening comments how much lower interest is this year than what it was last year. I mean, it's really adding to our overall bottom line. So it gives us access to the credit markets in a way that I think is very flexible and healthy for the company. It also helps us with our vendors and on the real estate front being investment grade in terms of the types of deals that we're able to do. So we take a hard look at this several times a year and discuss it. Rick and I discuss it with the board. And clearly, we feel like right now, that's the best place for us to be.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And, Rick, just a bigger-picture question for you strategically. I was hoping maybe you could just give us your updated view on sort of organic growth versus growing via acquisition. You've obviously favored organic growth historically. Why is that, I guess? And could -- what would change that going forward? And this doesn\u2019t even necessarily apply to large deals because there are smaller guys out there too that potentially could make sense. So I'm just curious as to what your thoughts are there.","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, it's a really good question, Ed. I -- we still have over 10,000 opportunities out there in the marketplace today, in the United States today, for Dollar stores. And we have a very proven format that generates the best returns in retail that I have ever seen in my career. And it's much easier to manage that than it is to try and manage an acquisition. And my love of organic growth is the fact that when you go into a new market, you understand the market but more importantly, you understand the player set that's going to launch that for you. So I've always been a lover of organic growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Taking on the kind of new store pipeline, can you talk about what 2014 looks like? And based on raising your new store activity for this year, does the competitive landscape look any different in terms of looking at new stores and what the markets look like?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. Our 2014 pipeline is actually ahead of schedule, exactly like '13. And this is the second year in a row where we'll be able to be in a much stronger position as we enter into the new year. David and I like that 6% to 7% square footage growth. It's more, Deb, about organizational capacity than it is anything else. And this company got itself in trouble 7 years ago about opening too many stores too fast, and I -- we would rather open a handful of stores that perform well and drive a great return than get ourselves out there and overextend ourselves.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And another question on this topic, are you utilizing a different team? Are you utilizing better technology? Is there anything differently that you're doing in terms of getting sites?","Richard W. Dreiling","No. Actually, everything is exactly what it has been. We're just doing a better job of getting ahead of the pipeline curve. And quite honestly, it's like everything else we do at Dollar General. I'm surrounded by a team that continually improves on the processes that have been established over the years.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then in terms of the beat this quarter not rolling that in terms of raising guidance for the year, can we just dig into that a little bit deeper?","David M. Tehle","Yes. In terms of our -- and we generally don't talk about our internal estimates. But actually, the quarter came in pretty much as we expected it in our internal guidance that we had given last quarter. So from our perspective, it wasn't really a beat. We performed how we thought we would perform. So there really isn't anything to increase for the rest of the year as we came out. Now we did tweak our -- some of our assumptions on interest and tax rate and share count and things of that nature. I'm looking forward -- given the uncertainty and the macroeconomic environment, we're trying to make sure we're prudent in the things we're doing above the line. So again, we're pleased with where we are, and we're pleased that, again, we're pretty much on where we said we would be when we updated our guidance last quarter.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then one last quick one. Rick, when you look into the market share gains by category, is there anything there that's surprising to you?","Richard W. Dreiling","Actually, no, there's not, Deb. What's interesting to me, what has surprised me, it's relatively -- it's even across most of the categories. It was interesting, I was talking to Mary Winn yesterday, and it was one of those quarters in which the boat was rising on all of the sides. Everything is -- reminds me very much again of 2008 and 2009, where everything is starting to rise evenly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne Agee.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a few things, David, for us on just for modeling. I guess, first, would be can you quantify the list of sales from tobacco? What do you think the incentive comp accrual reversal was in the quarter? And then could you quantify the mark down shift between the second and third quarter for us?","David M. Tehle","Yes. I don't think we're going to give granular quantification on those, Chuck. I mean, obviously, the tobacco had a meaningful impact on the quarter overall in terms of what this performance was on the comp sales and particularly in driving traffic into the stores. It's more than what we've seen in beer and wine overall, which is very positive for us. And then again, on the expense side, it was meaningful enough that we wanted to spell out the incentive comp overall. But again, not going to give specifics on that or the markdown. Except on the markdown, I will say, again for modeling purposes, the reason we bring that up is that is something that was a benefit to second quarter that's going to hit third quarter. And we want to make sure everybody's aware of that as they start putting their third quarter models together.","Richard W. Dreiling","Chuck, I'd say one thing on the tobacco that we are really focused on here in the company. It is not about the comp sales it's driving, it's about the transactions it's driving. And what we are totally focused on is how we could take that tobacco purchase and lever it up with incremental items when that transaction takes place in the store.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Makes sense. And then I guess it's kind of impressive that you roll out tobacco and you see the shrink rate improve. Can you kind of flush that out for us?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I think the rate of decline and shrink is what has improved, Chuck. I will tell you, in regards to shrink, we've installed a lot of defensive merchandising over the course of the last 6, 7, 8 months and had the chance now to go in and reinventory those stores. And while it's still soon, we're very pleased with what we're seeing with the defensive merchandising that's been put in place.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just my last question, just a follow-up on a previous one. When you sort of think about capital allocation versus store growth, and you talk about the 6% to 7% square footage growth number that you want to keep, as the law of large numbers starts to catch up with you, do you think the next 3 to 4 years we continue to see 6% to 7% store growth? Or does organization capacity make you want to think -- maybe ratchet that back a little bit and increase the buybacks? I mean, how do you kind of think about the whole pie?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I think -- again, you're raising a great question. We're very comfortable right now at this stage of the game with 6% to 7%. But again, I want to come back to how I answered the question previously. We want to open stores that are productive out of the chute in generating a return. And we would rather open stores that are complete, that the customer has an experience when they come in, rather than just come in and look at you all and say, \"Hey, open a bunch of stores.\"","David M. Tehle","I said go back to Rick's comment on the continuous improvement we've seen in the real estate area, which helps us, again, to reach that 6% to 7% the way real estate's performing.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right. So you guys are like basically tracking new store productivity and store manager turnover to make sure that you don't sort of outgrow, which was a problem, I guess, 10 years ago?","Richard W. Dreiling","That's exactly right. And we, Chuck, actually look at new store growth productivity every week.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Siler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's actually Matt for Paul. I just had a question. In terms of the competitive environment, we've seen some of the mass guys put up some disappointing results lately. Just wondering if you saw any kind of change in rhetoric or anything in the marketplace throughout the prior quarter and thus far, into this one?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I look back on quarter 2 much like quarter 1 and look at -- and would tell you that the share of voice is obviously up. There's no doubt there's more print advertising out there, more pages of print even within the usual weekly vehicles. However, it's fair to say that the price competition is not any more intense in quarter 2 than quarter 3.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So if you look at kind of the 2-year stock comps on the discretionary front, at least the way we calculate it, it looks like seasonal and home were basically flat year-over-year versus the first quarter, but apparel improved pretty nicely. But then you mention there are some markdowns, particularly in apparel, that we need to think about for the third quarter. Can you guys provide us a little bit more color on the discretionary front and specifically on the apparel, and kind of what your expectations are for those categories going forward?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I mean, I, quite frankly, was pleased with what happened on the discretionary side of the ledger in the second quarter. And quite honestly, very proud of the team on the apparel side. I think it's definitely too early to declare a victory. I think that, in all honesty, we still need a little bit of help on -- with the economy. And I think it's fair to also say that our consumer is still a little hesitant out there. But I think as we move through the third quarter, we anticipate the trends will not change significantly.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then just a clarification. Did you say all of the gross margin decline in the second quarter was from tobacco?","Richard W. Dreiling","No. Actually, what David said was the bulk of it was, but not all.","David M. Tehle","Tobacco, its mix and its shrink were probably the 3 biggest negatives.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Let me ask you, DG Market and DG Plus, when do you think, if ever you begin a more aggressive rollout -- I guess it would be plus. And then is there a merit to, as you learn from DG Market taking, I don't know, Top 20 produce items, top 5 or 10 meat items and migrating those into DG Plus?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes, I think the -- if I were to look at you and tell you right now -- over the course of the last year, we've made more progress on the DG Plus side. I think that, particularly as a remodel or relocation vehicle -- and remodel meaning we can knock into a wall next to us, John -- what we're really excited about on the Dollar General Plus is the change in the basket size. And it comes back to the wider aisles, the shopability of the stores. And when you start with a relo or a remodel, you start with a significantly higher base, which gets you moving in the right direction faster. The Dollar General Market, the team is doing, I think, a great job of really understanding produce sales and meat sales, which I think -- by the way, those are living things that we have not had to deal with before. And I've got Todd and Greg Sparks here, who are helping to manage the team through that. So I -- again, I think it's a little soon to declare victory there. I do think we are moving in the right direction on the Plus side. Your comment on perhaps making -- taking the Top 20 produce items and eventually getting those into the regular Dollar Generals, that is something we're actually talking about. Now whether or not that'll ever happen or not, it's still too soon to tell. But oranges and apples and potatoes, things like that, grab-and-go stuff that a consumer forgets on the way home, could play out down the road.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So along those lines, what's the biggest challenge to doing that? Is it supply chain, being able to do that -- keep it fresh? Is it something else? And then secondly, where would you get the space for that?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I mean -- actually, you nailed it. The supply chain is the issue. And not only that, on that kind of an item, we have to introduce a middleman because we don't warehouse our own produce and you run the risk of having an item that's a little bit higher and depletes your -- your customer doesn't understand that it's coming from somewhere else, and it kind of depletes your price image. In regards to -- what you should also remember, if we were ever to do this, it wouldn't be like there would be a whole isle of produce or an end cap of -- It would be a very small, manageable display.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. Then lastly, you mentioned shrink, and I know that dovetails very close with turnover. So where is turnover today? And then do you think turnover will be in a good enough position where shrink actually comes down next year?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I'm actually -- the team, John, has done a good job with turnover over the last 2.5 years. And I have to tell you, our turnover is, in essence, flat the last year. And we're having our -- our best year was 2012, by the way. And to be flat against 2012, I think it's a pretty good mark. And I do agree that turnover is a big component of shrink. And I think that we're working really hard on the turnover, and I think the shrink numbers are starting to move our way again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","We totally agree, totally support your view to use your capital for our organic growth rather than acquisitions. I want to ask about inventory productivity. Regardless of how you measure that based on GMROI, or the amount of gross profits generated from $1 of inventory at peak last year and, again, to weaken as the company began to add 11% to 15% more inventory per store, is this a signal that your buyers did it right, that the first $210,000 of inventory they bought for our store was the most profitable, and that the incremental $20,000 that you've added this year is -- it's profitable but not as productive as that initial $210,000 investment?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. Actually, I think that's a pretty accurate assessment, to be honest about it. I think it really tells you the power of category management. The team came in here several years ago, rationalized the SKU base, got the SKU base right. As we continue to broaden our appeal, it means we need to add selective, other SKUs. And I think quite frankly, we got a little overzealous in quarter 1. And what we're doing now is we're spending a lot of time -- the product, by the way, while I say we got a little overzealous, there's nothing wrong with the product that's in the store base. And the decision we've made is we're going to go in and reevaluate it and, over a period of time, take some of those SKUs, Dan, that you were talking about, that aren't quite as productive, and just work some way back out of the system.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then -- just as a follow-up, it was definitely 3 or 4 quarters ago when the tobacco discussion began. The company was estimating that every 1 percentage of comp sales growth from tobacco would negatively impact gross margin rates by about 20 basis points. It looks like the algebra has changed based on the comps that you're getting in tobacco and what's happened with gross margin rates?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I don't recall giving you that. If I did, I did. I would look at you and tell you that the tobacco, the tag-along purchases with tobacco are a little bit better than we thought they were going to be. How's that? I don't know if that helps or not, Dan.","Daniel R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","The 65% of the customers that are buying something else has turned out to be higher than what you were expecting.","Richard W. Dreiling","Exactly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Mann with Johnson Rice.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","I was curious, just elaborating on the comment you just made about some of the SKUs that you added, I know last quarter you talked a lot about the gross margin hit when the mix between national brands and private brands sort of got a little bit out of kilter. So I'm just curious, were you able to -- since -- were you able to re-pivot into this quarter such that you -- it didn't even become a comment? I mean, is that what you've been working through?","Richard W. Dreiling","I'm sorry, Dan. Actually, Dan, our private brand penetration is actually back up, moving north again. So that would tell you that we're doing a better job in managing the mix.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And then in terms of tobacco, I know in the past you've given us what that average ticket might be. Can you update on that? And also, I don't know if you specifically talked about what the shrink experience is in tobacco is relative to what you expected. If you could comment there as well?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. It's really too soon, Dan, on the shrink. Right? I have -- we'll have to cycle a whole year tobacco. Right now, I will tell you the supply chain system that keeps track of the tobacco, how it flows from the supplier to a point where it gets stocked on the shelf, is working quite nicely. We've had a couple of issues and have been able to identify them immediately. In regards to cigarettes, the average -- our average basket is approximately $10.77. And when cigarettes are in there, that basket goes up to almost $13.75.","David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then, David, one other question on the buyback. I think the math would suggest that you might be in the market for up to $400 million for the rest of the year. I'm just curious, when you made that $200 million purchase, it seemed like you didn't buy anymore in the rest of the quarter. Any comment you can make about that?","David M. Tehle","Yes. Quite simply, we wanted to keep our debt-to-EBITDA at 3.0, and that's exactly where we came in. Again, we're managing that ratio because of our investment-grade status.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Zolidis with Buckingham Research.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A lot of questions on tobacco. I have one question, which may sound a little bit counterintuitive, but is there any sense at which having tobacco in the stores is causing customers to substitute their spend to tobacco from something else? Is there any evidence of that occurring?","Richard W. Dreiling","That's actually, John, a very, very good question. I would look at you, there's no way I can tell that. But what I can tell you is that our customer index is at about 135% on cigarettes. So, John, they're buying those cigarettes somewhere else.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then on a different topic, on the new stores, can you talk a little bit about the real estate prices for new stores? Are you seeing a lot of pressure? Is there any change or any intentional change in the quality of the locations you're going into with the new stores?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. Our -- the real estate strategy in regards to locations, everything -- I would call it status quo over the last couple of years. There's been no major uptick in commercial real estate at all that we have seen, and we're still committed to the site selection process that we've always had. We don't put it on the corner of Maine and Maine, and we're very happy with a C Plus, D Plus site.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So the biggest call-out with regard to new stores over the last couple of years is probably California entry and expanded DG Market, DG Plus?","Richard W. Dreiling","That's fair.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","A question on your urban market stores now that you have, I guess, more exposure to urban markets, having grown in urban markets more aggressively over the past several years. Did you see any notable performance differential between urban and more overall stores during the quarter?","Richard W. Dreiling","To be honest with you, no. I mean, they tend -- the urban stores tend to have a higher sales volume and a little bit higher cost of operation. And at the end of the day, they net-net out to about the same.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","But there's -- is there any sense that maybe the urban store performance is improving? Also, what about tobacco sales in urban markets? Is it higher than rural markets? Or is that kind of netting out as well to be pretty neutral.","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I've got to tell you that it's pretty much neutral. I don't see any particularly bigger things in the metro stores, the urban stores, versus the rural.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just another quick one on tobacco, just to go back to what David was saying. So tobacco, the comp lift is more than beer and wine. And I think you said in the past that beer and wine had about a 100-basis-point positive impact? Is that correct?","Richard W. Dreiling","That's correct, sir.","Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Somewhere north of 100 basis points then?","Richard W. Dreiling","That's correct, sir.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Trish Dill with Wells Fargo Securities.","Trisha Dill - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on your Phase 5 initiative. Just wondering if the comp lift that you're seeing in legacy stores is greater or maybe less than 100 basis points like you've previously disclosed? And then if you could maybe just...","Richard W. Dreiling","Is that -- I'm sorry.","Trisha Dill - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then if you could just elaborate on the additional opportunities that you mentioned, you've identified for productivity gains in those stores.","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I apologize, Trish. Number one, the comp lift is actually a little bit greater than we thought it was. And you've got to remember, we're very new into the cycle here. So as the customer realizes you have the expanded selection in core categories, we anticipate the comp lift will continue to move up as we move through the year. In regards to the additional opportunities, it's more stepping back and going, \"Oh my gosh, these categories did so well. Now, we need to go in and look at these other categories within the same legacy stores.\" So we're going to begin to tweak them again as we move through the year. And we think what we're doing actually has ramifications that maybe -- perhaps we can run at a smaller box store, which will put us, you think, in the urban environment, put us in a little bit better position.","Trisha Dill - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one more quick one on whether or not you're seeing any food price deflation and how we should think about that as a potential headwind to comps in the back half of the year?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. That is actually another good question. We are seeing food deflation at this time. You have to remember that we have a smaller depth in our category, and -- while we have breadth. And we anticipate the deflationary pressure to continue as we move through the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.","Joseph I. Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","I wanted to ask -- go back to the health of the consumer a little bit and just drill down a little more there. Is there anything you guys have seen lately? Any changes with like maybe the pay check cycle or volatility in the week-to-week trend? Or maybe, as you look at the consumables business even, what people are buying? Is it a little more branded versus the private label? Anything that would give you any inkling to the health of the consumer there?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. My view on the consumer is no different than what it was, Joe, at the beginning of the year. I think our core customer has never come out of the recession. I think our core customers has continued to manage their way through, for years, multiple points where money is a little tight. I mean, the average consumer out there who makes $50,000 a year has $1,000 a year and less in spendable income now due to changes that have taken place in the payroll tax. Albeit I say all that, I think the beauty of our model is we continue to focus on transactions in units, and our customer is responding to the options -- the value proposition that we have. And as long as transactions and units are moving north, we believe we're satisfying their needs. It is going to be an interesting back half, and I think that we're being -- we're keeping our eye on the consumer and what they're buying.","Joseph I. Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Got you. That sort of leads into the next question we have, which was, as you do think about the back half, and I know you don't like to give quarterly guidance per se, but how should we think about the cadence? I mean, there's been a lot of debate about whether sales have actually slowed or going to slow for this back-to-school period and into the holiday. I guess how are you guys thinking about the back half?","Richard W. Dreiling","We got our guidance between 4% to 5% as we look through the total year, which would indicate that comps will accelerate as we move through the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Montagna with Avondale Partners.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","A question. I have read recently that government data is showing that commodity inputs for food are up 10%. Wondering if you think that's accurate? And if so, when does that type of thing flow into retail prices for food?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I think -- when you look at that, Mark, I think that would probably be focused on meat and produce and more dairy-type items. And my view of how soon it flows in depends on how much pressure are retailers under in regards to their margin, right? So we certainly haven't seen anything of that magnitude here yet, but I would think that's probably more on the true perishable side of the business.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then it sounds like the phase 5 planograms are done for this year, and I thought the goal for this year was 2,000 stores. But then, Rick, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned 3,000. So wondering how many did, and is the whole chain complete now? Or is there more to come?","Richard W. Dreiling","We got 3,000 done. We originally thought it was going to be -- yes, we got 3,000 done.","Mary Winn Gordon","Mark, that was our -- that was always our goal. We had completed 2,800 after Q1, and then we ramped that up in Q2.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So do you plan more phase 5 for next year? Or is this...","Richard W. Dreiling","Really next year. And actually, what we want to do now is go back into the 3,000 stores which we called out and refine additional categories within that 3,000 -- those wins we've done.","Mark K. Montagna - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","But looking out to next year, will there be another group that is phase 5?","Richard W. Dreiling","And the answer is probably so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dutch Fox with FBR Capital Markets.","Dutch Fox - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So just a quick question and not to beat to death tobacco, but when you see those 2\/3 of baskets that are buying tobacco and some other item, is that typically a discretionary item? Or is it more of a consumable item? In other words, you had a very good discretionary quarter in 2Q. How much of that do you think was driven by tobacco? And do you think that's sustainable going forward as tobacco continues to ramp up?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I think, Dutch, that cigarette purchase tends to gravitate towards the consumable side of the ledger, particularly when you only have 1 or 2 items going out the door with the cigarettes. That tends to be a soda or a Gatorade or a chip. I think the health of the -- I think it is fair to say -- one could make the leap, and I can't prove this, that the incremental traffic might be helping the nonconsumable side. I don't think there's any kind of a connection between cigarettes and non-consumables.","Dutch Fox - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So it's fair to say that your -- the improvement we saw in discretionary categories in 2Q, that was largely the result of standalone initiatives within your efforts towards discretionary, not necessarily just driven by tobacco?","Richard W. Dreiling","That's correct. I think the improvement in the discretionary side is driven by good old-fashioned category management.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Denise Chai with Bank of America.","Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to get a little bit more color on what you're seeing with cooler items? Could you talk a bit about trip frequency and also baskets, when people are buying cooler items? And also, you're approaching 70% penetration of your stores. Where do you think that can go?","Richard W. Dreiling","70% penetration on coolers?","Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. You said that you've got over 7,000 stores with coolers?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. We -- well, we actually installed coolers in over 7,000 stores. So we still have more cooler upside there. I will say this, Denise. The perishable side of the business, the frozen food, refrigerated is insatiable. It seems like the more we put in, the better we do. The basket -- I'm sitting here trying to think on the basket. There's no doubt the basket goes up. I cannot remember, Mary Winn, off the top of my head how much it goes up. And what I'll do, Denise, I'll have Mary Winn call you and give you that number. But we do see a bump in the basket when frozen food's in there. It's more of a complete shop in the $10.70 shop.","Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just one more question. You used to talk about having, say, a 1.5% to 2% embedded comp lift from remodels and your various optimization initiatives? Could you perhaps update that and just let us know how much of that has already cycled?","David M. Tehle","Yes, that's really new stores, remodels and relocations all together that -- that figure and that's still reasonably accurate overall.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So a question that hasn't come up yet is kind of what do you think happens when SNAP benefits get reduced? Now I know that it's not a huge piece of your revenues, but clearly, it takes money out of the pocket of the lower income customer and could have some impact on, presumably, sales of discretionary, rather than sales of consumables. But I was wondering if you have any thoughts about that?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I think one of the interesting things that I've observed since I've been here is our percentage of sales that are on SNAP run about 5% to 6%. In spite of the fact that the government has increased the amount of SNAP benefits that are out there, we still run at 5% to 6%. It's my belief right now, Meredith, that -- which we've said before, our customer spends the bulk of their wallet somewhere else before they come to me. That somewhere else is going to be where the impact is if there's a pullback in SNAP. At least, that's my view. But your point is also very well taken in that the impact will probably not come on the consumable side. It would come on the nonconsumable side. That would be my bet as where we would all feel it?","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And do you think that those discretionary sales are being done at the retailers that redeemed the most SNAP benefits, or is it spread out?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. See, my belief is you have to remember, we're the fill-in shop. We're the place you go when you forgot your T-shirts or you forgot your socks. We're not the fashion-forward carry place. We're the place you go to when you forgot a couple of Christmas decorations or you didn't get all the Christmas lights you need. My belief would be the impact we probably felt, probably where you go for the initial sale, to begin with.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I -- I'm sorry to keep the call going on, I just have one more question. When we think about -- I know you've said that your real estate strategy really hasn't changed at all. But I think there was kind of a goal of the company to move into more middle income areas, to the extent that you could or to be able to have more transitional areas where you served customers of multiple income levels. Is that true? And have you had success in terms of -- to the extent you know -- attracting customers from a more middle income area?","Richard W. Dreiling","Yes. I think there is -- it's fair to say that we have elevated the quality of the site that we've chosen, which would tell you that we tend -- we're getting a little closer to that middle income strata that you're talking about, Meredith. And I would tell you that the peel of the box in those particular areas where we've chosen to do that, is as strong as when we go into the lower income areas.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Does that increase the potential of stores that you could open?","Richard W. Dreiling","Someone can certainly make that leap. Yes.","Mary Winn Gordon","All right. Operator, that wraps up our call from our end. Everyone on the call, thank you very much for your time and attention. I'm around all day if anyone needs anything, and I look forward to seeing you later. And thank you for your interest in Dollar General.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"7179":["Dollar General Corp.

On the call today are Todd Vasos, our CEO; and John Garratt, our CFO. We will first go through our prepared remarks and then we will open up the call for questions. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under Investor Information, Press Releases.","Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other non-historical matters, including but not limited to, our 2016 forecasted financial results and capital expenditures, our planned fiscal 2016 operating, merchandising, store growth, prototype and other initiatives, our capital allocation strategy and expectations, our long-term financial growth models and statements regarding future economic trends or conditions.","Forward-looking statements can be identified because they are not statements of historical fact, and they use words such as outlook, may, should, could, believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, forecast, goal or intent and similar expressions that concern the company's strategy, plans, intentions or beliefs about future occurrences or results.","Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those projected or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2014 10-K, which was filed on March 20, 2015, and our most recent 10-Q filed on December 3, 2015, and in the comments that are made on this call.

Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure included in this morning's earnings release, which as I just mentioned, is posted on dollargeneral.com in the Investor Information, Press Releases section.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Today, we reported record results for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the full year. 2015 was an exciting year for Dollar General as we reached over $20 billion in sales and celebrated the milestone of opening our 12,000th store location. Today's announced 14% increase in our quarterly cash dividend reaffirms our continued confidence in our long-term growth prospects. For the year, we had our most balanced financial growth since 2011 and delivered results that are in line with the long-term financial model that we announced today. The team is energized by the strong performance in 2015 and is focused on capturing the significant long-term growth opportunities that lie ahead.","Let's recap some of the additional highlights of 2015. Full year net sales increased 7.7% to a record $20.4 billion and sales per square foot increased to $226. Same-store sales for the year increased by 2.8%, marking our 26th consecutive year of same-store sales growth. Our same-store sales for the fourth quarter increased 2.2%. In the quarter, same-store sales growth was balanced across both consumables and non-consumables.","For the year, operating profit increased about 10% with diluted earnings per share up 13%. Earnings per share improved 11% in the quarter to $1.30 per share. For the 32nd consecutive quarter-over-quarter, we increased both customer traffic and average ticket. During the year, we returned nearly $1.6 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 17.6 million shares of common stock and the payment of dividends.","We opened 730 new stores, increasing our selling square footage by 6% and exceeded our combined remodels and relocation targets with 881 stores. For seven years now, our real estate projects have had strong performance. The class of stores in 2014 and 2015 continued to run ahead of our projections, and we are pleased with the performance in the new states we entered in early 2015. Our distribution center in San Antonio, Texas was completed in January and started shipping to stores in February. We also broke ground on our 14th distribution center in Janesville, Wisconsin to help us serve our growing store base in the Midwest. These investments are key to driving the efficiency and speed of our network and to support our growing store base, all while reducing our stem miles (7:03).","In 2015, we accomplished the multi-year rollout of our enterprise resource planning software for our supply chain. This technology platform represents a significant improvement with enhanced integration to allow for demand forecasting from the vendor to shelf. Importantly, the team executed this initiative without disruption to our business. The rollout of our targeted labor investment has been implemented across more than 3,100 stores. Since the rollout of this initiative, in the second quarter, we have continued to see same-store sales growth for our stores gain traction.","Phase 1 and Phase 2 stores have been on the program long enough to see an impact. We are pleased that they are delivering on our return expectations. Specifically, in these stores, the key metrics of same-store sales, transactions, average basket and customer satisfaction scores, all are showing significant improvement.","We also had continuing success in improving our shrink performance. Shrink improvement has been and continues to be one of our largest long-term gross margin opportunities. We remain committed to reducing our shrink on a store-by-store basis. This progress continues to be broad-based, with shrink declining across nearly 70% of our product departments for the year. Going forward, our teams continue to be focused on leveraging our defensive merchandising tools, technology and training to further reduce shrink.","We are constantly striving to fill the needs to meet the changing demands of our customers. We continue to increase our overall market share of consumables in both units and dollars across all markets over the 4-week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week period ending January 29, 2016. In the 2015 fourth quarter, we had very solid same-store sales growth of 2.2% particularly considering the 2014 fourth quarter same-store sales growth of 4.9%.","In consumables, growth was driven primarily by candy and snacks, tobacco and perishables. Growth in the non-consumable categories was broad-based with notable strength across seasonal and home, offset by a modest decline in apparel. Even as apparel had a modest decline given the unseasonably warm weather, we had strong growth across holiday events, housewares, home d\u00e9cor, toys and stationary. Our offerings in non-consumables are on trend and priced right for the key Christmas holiday season. This represented the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in our non-consumable categories.","Everything we do at Dollar General is centered around our customers. The good news is that our customers are noticing the improvements we are making in our stores, especially as it relates to our on-shelf availability. As we exited 2015, we had our highest customer satisfaction scores in two years. As these results indicate, we made excellent progress on a number of fronts in 2015.","As we move into 2016, we have updated our customer segmentation to gain deeper insights into the most relevant groups as the consumer continues to change at a rapid pace. This customer segmentation helps guide our strategies to grow with each of our core customer segment. This was the first re-cut of our customer segmentation since 2012.","The new segmentation of our customer, one of the most exciting findings is that we are growing with our most productive customers. These are exciting developments that confirm we are improving our core shopper productivity while also attracting new key segments, and, importantly, retaining our trade-down customers. These updated customer segmentation findings are integrated across merchandising and pricing, marketing, site selection and store operations and design. We look forward to sharing more insights at our upcoming Investor Day. The goal is to grow transactions and item units which continue to be key to our market share performance.","Our operating priorities continue to include: driving profitable sales growth; continuing growth opportunities; enhancing our position as a low cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage.","Our first priority is continuing to drive profitable sales growth. As we look to attract and grow new customers and trips and capture share with existing customers, the insights gained from our customer segmentation work are incorporated into our disciplined approach to category management. In this process, we have assessed the expansion of categories that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores. Health and beauty, perishables, party and stationery are areas where we are expanding in 2016.","For 2016, the team is very focused on implementing these sales-driving initiatives across not just new stores, relocations and remodels, but also to our mature store base to a greater degree than we have in the last several years. Our ongoing affordability initiative will be front-and-center with a refreshed approach.","We will also leverage operational initiatives, such as improving our on-shelf availability. We have ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion through improvements in shrink, global sourcing, private brands, distribution and transportation efficiencies and non-consumable sales.","Second, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Examples include our accelerated square footage growth in 2016, with a new store layout that we started utilizing in February for all new stores, relocations and remodels. The layout is designed to expand high-growth traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. While it's still early, the results of this DG16 (13:57) layout are very encouraging as our sales performance is meeting our expectations.","In addition, we have been conducting a test and learn for our smaller format store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. Currently, we have opened approximately 30 stores with selling space of less than 6,000 square feet, or about 20% smaller than our traditional stores.","Sales productivity and returns based on the early results are very encouraging. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our urban customers, we believe this smaller format store will allow us to have higher capture rate per site selection. Additionally, we believe this smaller format will work in rural locations with lower household counts. With this smaller format, we have even greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower household rural sites.","Looking ahead, we anticipate opening 900 new stores, including about 80 of the smaller format stores, and relocating or remodeling an additional 875 locations in fiscal 2016. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth, with a proven high-return, low-risk model. We are disciplined and focused on financial returns. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2016 and our pipeline is full.","Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low cost operator. We recently adopted zero-based budgeting to proactively improve our efficiencies and reduce expenses over a multi-year timeframe, all while giving us the flexibility to reinvest savings to drive growth. Our zero-based budgeting approach is a refreshed commitment to removing costs from our business.","Our 2016 budget was built through a zero-based budgeting perspective with a clear and defined process to address spending. All of these actions are filtered through three lenses. One, is it customer-facing? Second, does it align with our strategic priorities? And finally, third, how does it impact our risk profile?","Over the last several years, our SG&A leverage point on comp sales has been running at approximately 3.5% and was trending at a rate that would have been higher in out years if we had not taken action. Today, our zero-based budget initiatives, we have lowered the SG&A leverage point on comp sales to about 2.5% to 3%. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low cost operator.","Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are a competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great on-boarding and training, and open communication.","In 2015, we had our lowest level of store manager turnover in three years. To build on these improvements going forward, we have been focused on aligning our talent with the right skill set required for success based on store characteristics in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink, and improved store associate turnover.","For our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions but acknowledge that it is always challenging for our core consumer given the pressures on her income and spending. Regardless of the economic outlook for our consumers, we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General.","Now, let me turn the call over to John.","John W. Garratt - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. While Todd has taken you to the highlights of 2015 and our strategic initiatives for 2016, let me now take you through some of the important financial details of the quarter and year. I will also spend some time discussing our long-term financial growth model and our guidance convention going forward.","Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.8% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 12 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Lower transportation costs and improved rate of inventory shrink were the primary factors of the improved performance, while increased markdowns were a partial offset. This quarter represented our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in gross margin. For the quarter, total SG&A as a percentage of sales was even with last year's fourth quarter at 20.2%. The 2015 fourth quarter results reflect increases in incentive compensation expenses, retail salaries and occupancy costs, offset by lower utility costs and administrative salaries as a percentage of sales.","The 2014 quarter results reflect expenses of $6.1 million or 12 basis points as a percentage of sales related to the acquisition that was not completed. Our tax rate for the quarter was 36.1% compared to 34.8% in the 2014 quarter. This included a $16.5 million or $0.06 per share benefit from the reenactment of the Federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit which is retroactive to January 1, 2015. The fourth quarter of 2014 also benefited from the deductibility of expenses incurred in prior quarters associated with the acquisition that was not completed.","Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, cash and cash equivalents at year-end were $422 million lower than the prior year as we did not buy back shares in the second half of 2014 due to the pending acquisition. Merchandise inventories were $3 billion at fiscal 2015 year-end, up about 4.3% on a per store basis year-over-year. Key factors impacting this increase included our on-shelf availability initiative, the load in for the new distribution center in San Antonio and the timing of receipts due to an early Easter, coupled with our sales performance. Even with this increase, we believe our inventory is in good shape and we are comfortable with the quality. Near-term, we would expect our ongoing on-shelf availability initiative to impact our inventory level.","Going forward, however, our goal remains to ensure inventory growth is in line with our total sales growth over time. In 2015, we generated cash from operations of $1.4 billion, an increase of $63 million from the prior year. Total capital expenditures were $505 million in 2015 and included the majority of the cost for our new San Antonio distribution center. For the quarter, we repurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock for $290 million. We also paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per common share outstanding totaling $63 million.","Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we have repurchased $3.6 billion or 62 million shares of our common stock. We have a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $920 million under the repurchase program. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth. Our goal is to create lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately three times adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR.","We are modifying our guidance convention going forward to more closely align with how we are managing the business for a long-term shareholder value creation. This is a tremendous business. We have compelling new store economics with significant runway for growth across channel, customer and product segments that we intend to capture. From our vantage point, the gross mile we announced today is more of an articulation of how we have been managing the business to deliver consistent profitable growth and not a change in strategy.","In addition, we have heard from our investors that they would like to know what we think our business is capable of over the long-term. We believe that this long-term focus is the best way to model our business. Key components of the model include the following annual targets.","Net sales increase of 7% to 10% with square footage growth of 6% to 8% and same-store sales improvement of 2% to 4%. Operating profit growth of 7% to 11%, diluted earnings per share growth of 10% to 15%, cash from operations to be 7% to 8% of sales, capital expenditures to be 2% to 3% of sales and annual shareholder returns of 11% to 17% defined as EPS growth plus dividend yield. In 2016, we anticipate share repurchases of approximately $1 billion. This represents about 5% of our market capitalization as of today.","Since the inception of our share repurchases in December of 2011, we have reduced our outstanding share count by about 15%. Given that fiscal 2016 is a 53-week fiscal year for us, we expect the 53rd week to contribute approximately 200 basis points to our net sales performance and $0.09 per diluted share to EPS.","Including the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, we expect our net sales and diluted EPS results to be at the high end of the growth ranges provided in our financial growth model as I just outlined. We anticipate that same-store sales growth will be near the middle of the model's 2% to 4% growth rate.","As we move into 2016, please keep in mind our most challenging sales overlaps are in the first and second quarters. We do pick up two additional sales days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Also for 2016, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million. At the beginning of today's call, Mary Winn outlined our intentions with respect to updating our 2016 guidance. This information is also in our earnings release issued today. We are confident that we are positioning Dollar General for profitable, long-term growth to drive shareholder returns.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Todd.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, John. In summary, 2015 was a great year for Dollar General. We were able to deliver record financial performance while positioning the company to capture accelerated square footage growth. We continue to have significant opportunities for high return, low risk organic growth. I look forward to sharing more details about our long-term strategies at our Investor Day scheduled for March 24 here in Nashville where we plan to further discuss our growth drivers for the long-term.","Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value is unchanged. Our business generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and dividends. I would like to thank the more than 113,000 Dollar General employees for all their hard work during the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015, all while fulfilling our mission of serving others. As a team, we are looking forward to 2016 as we build on our performance from 2015.","With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","All right. Josephine, we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Congrats on a great quarter.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So on square footage growth, 6% to 8% growth in the long-term algorithm is definitely an uptick. Can you talk about productivity levels, four wall return profile that you are seeing in some of the newer stores? And is the key here the smaller store format and the metro store opportunity? Is that the driver to include 8% at the top of the range now?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Matt, this is Todd. So just real quick, I think the way to look at this is a couple of things. Number one, we're very confident in our real estate model as we go forward. As a matter of fact, our returns are still some of the highest that I've seen at consumable retail at 18% to 20% and still running there. We don't see that changing in the near-term at all. As a matter of fact, I believe you hit on it, some of the newer opportunities that have been unlocked in metro and in smaller rural areas with smaller household counts, because of our new smaller store, it gives us the confidence as we go forward that we can actually expand that square footage growth if we think we need to as we go forward. So not only are we confident about where we've been, but where we're going with new store growth.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just a follow-up on margins. Todd, you laid out, I think, four to five drivers of continued gross margin opportunity here going forward. And the fixed cost hurdle rate, as you called out, is now reduced to 2.5% to 3% \u2013 3.5%, yet the long-term model calls for very little in the way of EBIT margin expansion. Any structural headwinds I'm missing that you can't potentially beat given these targets that you just laid out?","John W. Garratt - Chief Financial Officer","No, we don't see anything structurally changing, Matthew. And as you alluded to, we really look to manage our gross margin and SG&A in tandem and we continue to have numerous levers within gross margins. We were delighted with the performance this year on gross margin, delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And we continue to see benefits from the numerous levers. We continue to drive shrink rates lower over the quarter. We continue to see transportation efficiencies. We continue to grow our non-consumables business eight quarters of consecutive improvement, which, as you know, carries a higher margin rate with it and we continue to effectively manage all the additional levers of category management, private label penetration, foreign sourcing penetration and distribution efficiencies.","And we continue to see opportunities for growth on the gross margin side and on the SG&A side, with the introduction of zero-based budgeting, we've always had a very disciplined cost management process here with work elimination, but with zero-based budgeting implemented from a position of strength, that's one more tool at our disposal to manage that.","So as we look at the two in tandem, we continue to see operating profit margin expansion growth over time. That's contemplated in our model. And as you look at the opportunity to drive total shareholder returns of 11% to 17% each year and the potential and we're really focused on the long-term growth as well. So the ability to drive those types of returns in a consistent manner and deliver long-term value creation is really what we're focused on and what we've built into the model.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Great quarter and I'll see you guys in a couple weeks.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vinnie Sinisi from Morgan Stanley.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Vinnie.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question and congratulations as well on a very nice release.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Wanted to, I guess, first ask \u2013 just go back to the small format store commentary. Can you just give us a little bit more of a sense for, with the initial, I guess, you said 30 or so today, how close to urban markets \u2013 what's the definition of urban for you? Are they literally in cities or are they just closer to those areas? How far from your core stores? Maybe just a little further color there would be helpful.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure. The 30 obviously are dispersed in many different locations because we wanted to make sure we tested it in a lot of different urban settings. But I think the key here is it is in urban areas. So not satellite city as much as true urban-type areas where dense populations, condominium-type living, those type areas. And that's where we've tried to test this and we've seen that success.","And again, what this also unlocks for us is it unlocks some real estate for us, because again, the 7,400 square foot box, while very, very productive, it's a little tougher in metro, true metro areas, to get that size of a location. And this gives us the flexibility to also get into some smaller spaces in some of those densely-populated areas. So it's really been a win-win on both sides, both from our sales and productivity and as well as from our real estate side.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up to that, with the store plans for 80 of these things out of the total next year, at this point, do you think that's kind of the \u2013 at least the proportion of the new stores that would be in the smaller format going forward?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, the 7,400 square foot store is still going to be our workhorse. I want to make sure you realize that. That is still the most productive box that we put out there and will continue to be. So I would think it would be fair to say that that proportion is probably pretty close over the next couple years, where it's at today. And if that changes, we'll definitely let everyone know.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And if I can just slide one fast one in there, regarding shrink, you continue to have very nice improvement there, yet it's of course fairly consistent commentary that it's one of your real opportunities still going forward. Can you tell us if there's anything overly different that you are doing today, whether it's types of things in store, category work, just anything further there?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Vinnie, you know that shrink at retail for sure is always a challenge and a battle, right? It never ends. But I have to tell you that our team, both on the operational side of the equation and on the merchandising side of the equation, are very focused on working together to make that box not only productive from a sales standpoint, but also to make sure that we have as much defensive merchandising tools in place that we can have. Not only some of the cabinets that we put in, but also where we place product.","And as we go into 2016 and beyond, what you're going to see from us is more of an opportunity in high, high shrink stores, to take our merchandising mix and maybe change it a little bit, especially as it relates to where you place product in these higher shrink stores to ensure that we can continue to show some type of shrink progress. But again, make no mistake, it's always going to be a challenge and we continue to work it from all sides.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thanks very much, best of luck.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","Thank you, Vinnie. I am going to ask if you could please keep it to one question and maybe a follow-up question. We've got a lot of people in the queue that we want to make sure we get to as many people as possible.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Zolidis from Buckingham Research.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, John.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I'm also going to ask about the stores. And I noted that in the press release, you talked about some of the stores being financed by leases and others being built by the company. I was wondering if you could talk about your approach going forward to capital investment in the stores and how that potentially impacts the return on invested capital going forward. Thanks.","John W. Garratt - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Our strategy is really unchanged there. We're predominantly lease. We're less than 5% owned and so that will continue to be our vehicle is the build-to-suit lease stores, no change there.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, great. So then for a follow-up, could you just talk a little bit more on the labor pressures that are out there in the market? I know that's a concern of many investors. And we'd like to hear a little bit more about how you're seeing that impact your hiring of employees at the store level. Thanks.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We're monitoring, and we always have, our wages, both from our hourly rates as well as our store managers. And while we remain very committed to ensure that we pay competitive rates out there, and we'll continue to do that. But I have to tell you, what we have seen as we exited 2015 and now entering 2016, our critical staffing at the hourly level is at the highest levels that we've seen in a couple years. And that's very good because what that shows is that our pool of candidates coming in are very, very robust.","So while we'll always monitor it and we will definitely pay competitive wages, which we have and will continue to do so, we haven't seen the overwhelming pressure as of yet that some have been talking about. But at the end of the day, for our hourly folks, the great thing about it is that they can quickly move up from being an hourly associate to being a key carrier and even an assistant manager in very short order. And we like to say here and when we recruit people that we can actually take someone from a job to a career in less than a couple years. And you don't really find that very often, especially in consumable retailing.","John Zolidis - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks and good luck.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Meredith Adler from Barclays.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Meredith.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Hello. Two questions for you, if I could. The first is just to talk a little bit about as you continue to grow somewhere square footage growth of, let's say, 7%, you are opening a lot of stores and I know you've said you need to open a distribution center pretty frequently. I think it used to be you were saying every year, now maybe you are saying every 18 months. Have you done anything to improve the productivity of the distribution centers so that you don't have to open as many as frequently?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we have, Meredith. And we have done that over the years. I think what we have said in the past that about every 1,000 stores to 1,100 stores give or take, we would need to open a DC. But we've seen that grow over the last few years, maybe now 1,200 stores, 1,250 stores. So the productivity and size of that four-wall continues to improve. And so we see that probably it's going to average out to almost one a year based on our current square footage growth. But again, that's because of that probably closer to 1,200 stores to 1,250 stores.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just a quick question about SNAP, which I know is not a huge piece of your revenues. But I think the FDA is talking about making some changes to qualifying for SNAP. And I'm wondering if you guys are looking at that and kind of what you think that means for your business.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Meredith, yeah, we are watching that and we \u2013 as you know and you mentioned earlier, SNAP for us is approximately 5% of our sales. So it really has \u2013 it's not a huge piece of the business but yet our core consumer does rely on SNAP benefits in a lot of cases. But in saying that, the great thing here about Dollar General and we'll continue to monitor it, is that we offer her a great value proposition at the price. So whether she's pinched a little bit with SNAP or not, she can definitely come here to Dollar General and get all her needs. And we'll continue to deliver on that promise to her because she actually comes to us to make sure we can deliver on it.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So you'll adjust your offerings if you need to, to satisfy any new rules?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely. We think that we're in pretty good shape right now and if we need to add an item or two, a couple lines, then we're very willing to do that. As you know, we've got our Plus store and our market stores out there and they're a great test bed for all that. And so we know exactly what sells in there and if we need to add some things into our traditional stores, we'll add the best items based on those sales that we already know in our existing stores.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Ed.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys, and good quarter. So my question for you \u2013 one question here just on the cost side and zero-based budgeting. Could you just talk a little bit about sort of what you've learned as you've gone through the process here? And then your guidance of leverage on 2.5% to 3%, is that what you think is now like a reasonable place to be? Or is there opportunity to do more than that or do better than that, I guess, long-term? Or is that just like you are a responsible retailer today, that's what the environment sort of brings?","John W. Garratt - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I can say that the zero-based budgeting has really been embraced by the team here. It's an extension of our culture where we've always had a robust budgeting process and cost discipline. But by undertaking this from a position of strength, it really enabled us to go deeper and to uncover additional savings opportunities that we're able to capture in our bottoms-up budget. And again, as we went through this and because we did it from a position of strength, we were really able to go through it with the filter that Todd mentioned of moving out those costs that didn't touch the customer, that weren't aligned with our strategic priorities and didn't present risk and allowing us to put it in the most productive places. And the team has really rallied upon that.","It's really changed the mindset in terms of how we look at the business and people apply this filter in everything we do and we're delighted with having actions in place coming into this year built into the budget that allows us to move that leverage point from 3.5% to 2.5% to 3% while allowing for some targeted reinvestments in the business to keep that consistent growth going. We think that's a good place to be. We see in our ability to continue that the team is very hard at work, working on the future pipeline of savings projects to keep that leverage point low, and we'll get it as low as we can.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then just one quick follow-up. Todd, I heard you mention expansion of perishables or focus on perishables. Could you just maybe give a little bit more color on what you are talking about there?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Our core consumer continues to tell us that one of the main drivers for a trip to Dollar General is the frozen and refrigerated offerings that we have. So what we have planned for 2016 is in all of our new remodel and relocation stores taking our cooler count from about 16 doors up to 20 doors to 22 doors. Along with that, we had put together a very strong backward-compatible program to add additional coolers into our existing same-store base. Now, it won't be all of our stores right away but we see this as probably a two-year to three-year horizon as we go back to add more coolers to our existing base, all while adding up to 22 doors in all of our new stores. So it's really a combination of both refrigerated and frozen offerings that we can put forth to our consumer.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Excellent. Thanks, guys.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Keith from Piper Jaffray.","Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, Todd and John.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","I want to focus in on the outlook for same-store sales at the midpoint of that 2% to 4% range. So it kind of implies 3%. Just looking at the last two quarters you guys were running in the low 2%s, so the guidance suggests some acceleration in 2016. I guess I was hoping you could expand upon that, if you think some of the company-specific initiatives will help get you there or do you see something on the macro front or even near-term that looks encouraging?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think as you look at this, first of all, I want to say our merchandise initiatives should gain traction as it goes through the year. The laps are a little tougher in the beginning of the year and get a little easier towards the back. But make no bones about it, our initiatives that we've got this year are the strongest that I've seen here in the last two years to three years. Not only the perishable that I just talked about but as I talked about in my prepared remarks, our health and beauty initiative as well as our party and stationary pieces really should help drive some of those initiatives as we go forward.","You couple that with the work that our operators are doing on on-shelf availability and making product available when the consumer comes in the door at a very high rate, we think that guiding in where we did makes a lot of sense. But we feel very confident as we go forward this year into 2016 where that comp is headed.","Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful. Maybe on a related note too, so Walmart had closed a number of the Express stores over a month ago. Those look to be quite close to a lot of Dollar General stores. I was wondering if you could provide maybe or even quantify if there's been some benefit or anything that you think actually might move the needle on a total company basis for 2016.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, any time you have a competitor that leaves the space, you do get some benefit. The one thing that we're squarely focused on is making sure that any dislocation that happens from those closings that as they come into Dollar General, we have got a superior box to offer her the right products at the right price and have it available when she needs it. So we're working real hard on that. But keep in mind, it's only about 100 stores plus or minus that they've closed and with our vast now 12,000 stores, almost 12,500 stores, it is a smaller number on our total store base but we are really looking to control what we can control and that is if she comes in, we've got an offering that we hope that will keep her for life.","Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Sounds great. We will see you guys in two weeks.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Paul.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning and congrats. Want to just go back to margins. I look back and I don't think you guys have leveraged expenses since 2013 perhaps. So getting that leverage threshold down is quite an accomplishment. But I did want to be very clear on how we should be modeling this year. As we look at your comps accelerating in the back half of the year, should we be thinking that you will have the ability to leverage expenses? Or maybe you can just give a little bit more clarity around gross margins versus SG&A expectations for this year?","John W. Garratt - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And again, I think the best way to look at it is in terms of looking at operating margin, looking at gross margin and SG&A in tandem as that's the way we manage it, managing all the levers within that. And I think the best thing I can point you to is, again, our annual target of the operating profit growth. We're going to work both those levers to deliver that operating profit growth and we feel comfortable with where we sit right now with the continued opportunities around gross margin with where we've lowered the leverage point on SG&A to deliver that operating profit growth, which is a very strong operating profit growth this year and in the foreseeable future.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Got it. It's dangerous leaving these types of things to our imagination, but I will run with that. Just following up also on the top line, in addition to the expanded categories, you mentioned, I believe, a refreshed affordability initiative. If perhaps you can just give a little bit more color on what we should expect to see there. And also just give us an update on what the results have been in that value valley.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And, Paul, that is the real piece there and that is the value valley area. In our new remodels and relocations, we have got a new fresh approach there; expanded the section, but also moved it to the front of the store, so it's more prevalent and can be seen a lot more and also signed it a little differently for the stores. And then what we'll do is some of the best of the best of that expansion, we'll start to put it into our same-store sales base as we move further into the year to ensure that we can take advantage on a same-store sales base as well.","Now, the key for our value offering that we have is it really \u2013 what it does, it gives the consumer trial. You have to remember, our core consumer can ill afford to make a mistake. So she can't afford to take a flyer, if you will, to go out and buy something on a national brand basis that may be a little larger size without ever having tried it. But if we can offer her a national brand offering, as an example, at a very small size that she can afford, say at a $1, it gives her that trial. And once she has the trial, what we've seen is it becomes then, it migrates into acceptance, and she moves from that $1 offering and actually trades up to the larger sizes. So our national brand folks really like what they're seeing there, and of course, we do as well, and it's great for our consumer.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you and I look forward to the barbecue.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","We will have a barbecue, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Wewer from Raymond James.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Dan.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, Todd. On the 6,000 square foot prototype, you noted that you would be eliminating less productive inventory for that smaller box, presumably that's apparel. Have you considered making that same change in the 7,400 square foot store?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, again, it's more than apparel, Dan, as you can imagine, but apparel does get pulled down somewhat in this model. But to answer your question, we consistently and constantly look at every year going in with our robust category management system what areas we need to contract and what areas we need to continue to expand on. And the great thing about apparel, at least in the last couple years, is we've seen some nice growth in apparel. Now, obviously, we had a little bit of a weather hiccup here in Q4, but we don't see our apparel business slowing down as we go into 2016. Matter of fact, we're pretty bullish on apparel. Cindy Long and her team have done a real nice job in giving us a very competitive offering there, but again, we'll continue to monitor all categories. And if we feel we need to contract at times and expand in other areas, we'll definitely do so.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","It looks like the sales per square foot in the 6,000 square foot store could be considerably higher, given the difference in the merchandise mix and the more densely-populated markets. What would be the offset? Is it a lower margin rate because you have less apparel or do you expect expenses to be higher, particularly in the urban locations?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think you've hit on a couple of things, Dan, is that expenses are a little higher there because of that urban nature. But again, because of that 6,000 square foot box, we can keep that also from getting too far out of bounds, because again, trying to manage 6,000 square feet versus the 7,400 square foot workhorse that we have is a little less complex. Then you couple that with the changing of the mix and, depending on the area that we put these stores, the consumable mix does increase a little bit, which does put a little pressure on gross margin rate. But again, when you look at overall return, because of the smaller box, it costs less to get into it, costs less to \u2013 or it doesn't cost as much to operate it from a lot of different areas, and then couple that with some good sales and sales per square foot, which is higher than our normal box, then the whole equation works pretty nicely.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And just real quickly, of the 80 (54:04) you opened this year, how many will actually be in the very small rural markets?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I don't know if we really have talked about that, but I could tell you that it's going to be a nice balance because what we want to do is really look at how it works. And of the 30 that we have opened, I can tell you that we've got a few open in, in the rural markets and we've got the majority of them right now open up in the metro markets. And so that balance is probably going to still be heavily weighted right now to metro, but as we go forward, we're seeing some real opportunities in the rural markets with those lower households. And again, that's why we're guiding long-term upwards of 8% square footage growth because there could be some real benefit as we go out in outer years.","Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Stephen.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning. So you mentioned the expansion in coolers, but can you also help us size the expansion in health and beauty as well as perishables and maybe where the space is potentially coming from? And also address how the expansion in these areas are being balanced with the shrink initiatives you cited, given some of the challenges inherent with these categories?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. As we look at health and beauty, it is one of our categories that we're the least penetrated in today. And with that said, there's really a lot of opportunity. And again, because of our convenient nature, our consumers are asking us for more and more of our health and beauty offering. Now in saying that, as we look at our new stores, where a lot of the health and beauty initiatives will be put into place, the new store design opened up some opportunity for us in that we didn't have to take out a lot of product to be able to put some of that health and beauty initiative in.","It's somewhere in that six feet to eight-plus feet. It depends on the store. It could go upwards of 16 feet in some areas, but what we're doing is we're not \u2013 this isn't a one-size-fits-all either. We're taking a look at shrink, we're taking a look at where the stores are located. And the other nice thing about this is it has a healthy balance of private brands. And as we all know, private brands, very good profitability, but also doesn't shrink near as much as your national brand. So I think when you couple all that together, I think this should be a real win for our consumers at Dollar General.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up, if I may. You had talked about the Digital Coupon platform, I think, last quarter. Can you just provide us an update on what you are seeing there and the potential opportunities to maybe leverage that platform as you've re-segmented the customer?","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we've been pleasantly surprised. My goodness, we're up to now over 2.5 million subscribers, if you will, users, and we continue to see sign-ups very robust. The great thing that we're seeing here is that the basket size is significantly larger than our normal basket size without using digital coupons. And the other thing that our marketeers along with our IT department have recently done has made sign-up at the store very, very, very easy. As a matter of fact, we went from \u2013 to over three minutes to four minutes to sign up to now we can sign up in a minute or less. And that has really helped propel the sign-ups at store level.","So we're very bullish on what that will bring us into 2016 and beyond. And you have to remember some of this newfound money that our consumer has gotten over the last year to year-and-a-half between going back to work and less gas \u2013 and the gas prices being a little lower, she's reinvested some of that findings for her into smartphones, and we have seen that our smartphone usage from our core consumer has gone up a lot. As a matter of fact, it now has crested over 85% where just a few short years ago we were in the 40% some range on usage. So you couple all that, she is now ready to really go digital and we're on the forefront of that for her.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All very helpful. Thanks so much. Look forward to seeing you all in a few weeks.","Todd J. Vasos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Mary Winn Pilkington - Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations","So we have hit the top of the hour, so I think we'll call it a day right here, but we do look forward to seeing everybody in Nashville in a couple of weeks. If you have any questions, please let me know and we're around all day for questions. Thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference call.

Good morning and thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call, which is being recorded by Conference America. No other recordings or rebroadcast of this session are allowed without the company\u2019s permission.","It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Gordon, Dollar General\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations.","Mary Winn Gordon ","Thank you, Linsey, and good morning everyone. Linsey, are you there?","Operator","Yes, ma\u2019am.","Mary Winn Gordon","Okay, just we heard a noise here. So, thank you and good morning everyone. On the call today are Rick Dreiling, our Chairman and CEO; and David Tehle, our Chief Financial Officer. We will first go through our prepared remarks and then we will open the call up for questions.","Let me caution that today\u2019s comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, objectives, anticipated financial and operating results and other matters.

We will be sending out invitations with more details in the next couple of weeks. So, please call us if you think you are not on our list to get the invitation.","Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you, Mary Winn and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. 2011 was another great year for Dollar General. We were very pleased with our financial results for the full year and for the fourth quarter. The results indicate that we are becoming even more relevant to our customers as we once again saw increases in our overall market share in consumables in both units and dollars.","David is going to talk about the details of the fourth quarter, but I would like to quickly reflect on our financial accomplishments for the year. Full-year sales increased 13.6% to a record $14.8 billion. Excluding the 53rd week, full-year sales increased to 11.4% and sales per square foot increased to $209 compared to $201 a year ago. Sales for average store topped $1.5 million.","2011 marked our 22nd consecutive year of same-store sales growth. Same-store sales were up 6% for the year, with all of our operating regions again turning in positive comps. Our adjusted operating profit grew 17% over last year to a record $1.5 billion and a record 10.2% of sales.","Gross margin rate contraction of 31 basis points for the year was more than offset by strong adjusted SG&A leverage of 62 basis points. Although the rate is down year-over-year, I should remind you that a 31.7% gross margin rate represents expansion of 246 basis points over 2008, just three years ago. This is a significant accomplishment during a sustained difficult economic environment.","Interest expense was down $69 million for the year as we made additional progress to reducing our high interest rate debt. On the bottom line, our adjusted net income increased 26% over 2010. In addition, we produced over $1 billion of cash growth from operations, a 27% increase over last year, and we further strengthened our balance sheet to significant debt reduction.","For the year, we generated an impressive return on invested capital of 22.1%. Our financial results continue to be a testament to the strength of our business model. It is clear that our strategy of small box convenience combined with great value resonates with consumers.","In addition to our impressive financial results, we accomplished a great deal in 2011 on the business side as well, laying for groundwork for 2012 and beyond. We continue to strengthen our infrastructure and upgrade the systems and technologies we use to operate the business. Across the board, we are better equipped to grow than we were a few years ago. We hit our target of opening 625 new stores and remodeling or relocating 575 stores in 2011, increasing our selling square footage by 7%. Most of this growth was in our existing 35 states, but in 2011, we expanded our footprint into Connecticut, New Hampshire and Nevada, our first new state since 2006, and we also launched our e-commerce site.","We expanded testing of our Dallas Dollar General market concept, remodeling an additional 25 market stores and opening 12 new locations, including seven in Nevada. We ended the year with 69 markets and are pleased with the preliminary results from our new and remodeled stores. This concept is a significant part of our initial California strategy.","Next weekend, we will celebrate the grand opening of our 10,000th store, a Dollar General market in Merced, California. This is our fifth store in the state and we expect to have 50 stores in California by year end. These stores as well as our stores in Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico will be served by our new distribution center near Bakersfield beginning in April.","To support expansion of our existing markets, we also built a new distribution center in Alabama, which began shipping to stores earlier this month. On the merchandising front, we continue to enhance our category management efforts and expand our merchandise offerings at the dollar price point, with a focus on health and beauty in 2011.","We increased the number of coolers in approximately 500 stores by adding four cooler doors on average, bringing our chain average to nine cooler doors per store. According to syndicated data, we continue to grow our market share in consumables by high-single digits in units and 10% to 12% in dollar share over a four-week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week basis.","As part of our ongoing efforts to increase our gross margin rate, we added 16 seats of core health and beauty products in 2011, with a big push in our Rexall proprietary brand and continue to expand other private and proprietary brand in consumables. We now carry nearly 1,900 private brand SKUs in consumables, with strong sales growth in food, perishables, candy and snacks, carbonated beverages, home cleaning and healthcare. Throughout the store, nearly 2,900 SKUs are a Dollar General private or proprietary brand now.","Overall, sales of seasonal items were strong for the year. We had great success in party supplies, balloons and arts and craft. We have also seen sales growth in novelty items, seasonal candles and holiday storage. Our focus on being trend relevant while maintaining great value is continuing to pay off for us.","Sales growth in house wares and domestics have been encouraging. We have been focused on improving product quality and better meeting our customers\u2019 needs. Sales in the second half of the year were very good, once many of our merchandising improvements became more visible to our customers. Areas such as bedding and bath, which had been slow for sometime had a comeback late in the year and that trends have continued into the new year.","We believe that our improved quality as well as improved branding and packaging and presentation have contributed to our overall growth in home sales. Through focused initiatives, we have improved our in-stock positions throughout the chain, which is very important to our customers. For the year, the number of items that our customers couldn\u2019t find in the store shelves was down 14%, gaining significant traction in the third and fourth quarters, which has continued into 2012. This effort has dramatically improved the customer experience in our stores as indicated by record-high customer satisfaction scores.","From an expense reduction standpoint, we implemented a workforce management system in our stores, which contributed significantly to our ability to leverage store labor in the second half of the year, by helping us better align customer service with our customers\u2019 needs and shopping trends. This new system provides our store managers with an electronic system that assist them as they prioritize and manage work, allowing them to be smarter in how they manage their staff and their stores.","We also made further inroads with regard to hiring and developing our employees. In 2011, about 55% of our positions were filled from internal candidates. The investment in our employees is an important investment in our future. As Dollar General grows, our employees have the opportunity to grow both personally and professionally with the company. And finally, our strong cash flow for the year allowed us to pay off our 10.625% Senior Notes, reducing our interest expense and further strengthening our balance sheet. We also repurchased 4.9 million shares of our common stock.","Before I turn the call over to David, I wanted to provide some color on our fourth quarter sales, which were up 20% from the prior year, or an increase of 11.8%, excluding the 53rd week. Same-store sales increased a strong 6.5%, a further acceleration of trends during the year exceeding the 5% expectation that we shared with you on the third quarter call. Comps in the month of January were very strong in part due to the better-than-expected weather compared to January of 2011. Consistent with the rest of the year, fourth quarter sales were primarily driven by consumables, with snacks, beverages, and perishables leading the way.","Additional coolers and the expansion of $1 items contributed to the increase in perishables. Sales of convenience items such as carbonated beverages, salty snacks and candy, including both seasonal and core were strong in the quarter. Health and beauty grew year-over-year as well, in part due to the addition of more $1 price point items and the expansion of this area to the 17 inch profile in early 2011.","In addition, refits in our pet category implemented earlier in the year generated solid results and stronger trends in our high penetration home cleaning and paper categories were driven by our merchandising strategies. We were very encouraged by the continued positive comps in our home category. Comp growth in house wares and domestic such as bedding, bath, floor coverings, exceeded our overall comp percentage for the quarter.","Apparel continued to struggle. We are comfortable that the decision that we made last year to focus more on infants and children and men\u2019s apparel was prudent, but without a doubt apparel, especially women\u2019s remains our toughest category to manage and we were disappointed with our overall results.","As you have heard across various retail channels, holiday seasonal sales were challenging as consumers remain cautious with their discretionary spending. Pricing and promotions were very competitive during the holiday season, and like most retailers, we responded to the market and took some early pricing actions on our seasonal merchandise to drive sales in our stores.","Other items included in our seasonal categories such as stationary, pre-recorded CDs and DVDs and automotive all performed well. All in all, we were very pleased with our fourth quarter sales.","Now, David will share a more detailed review of our overall fourth quarter financial performance and our guidance for 2012.","David Tehle","Thank you Rick, and good morning everyone. As Rick said, we had a great year and we had very strong financial performance in the fourth quarter, with sales above our expectations.","Fourth quarter sales were again driven by consumables, which generally have a lower gross margin than non-consumables. Our fourth quarter gross profit rate was 32.2%, a decrease of 25 basis points from the 2010 fourth quarter, which as a reminder was the highest gross margin performance we have ever achieved. Purchase costs were up year-over-year, particularly on some of our food items such as sugar, coffee and nuts, resulting in a likely charge of $22 million for the quarter, much higher than we had anticipated at the end of Q3 as inflation continued at a higher rate than expected. Overall though, we are pleased with our gross margin results for the quarter.","SG&A as a percentage of sales was 20% in the 2011 fourth quarter compared to 20.7% in the 2010 quarter. Excluding adjustments detailed in our press release, our SG&A rate was 19.8% in the 2011 quarter versus 20.6% in the 2010 quarter, a 79 basis point year over year improvement, primarily due to increased sales, including the Easter week and a significant increase in store labor productivity resulting from our new workforce management initiatives. To a lesser extent, lower incentive compensation expense resulting from a more aggressive bonus target and lower employee benefit costs along with other cost reduction and productivity initiative also impacted SG&A favorably. Excluding secondary operating expenses from both years, operating profit increased 26% to $519 million or 12.4% of sales compared to $413 million or a 11.8% of sales in the 2010 quarter. We are very pleased with this improvement and with our ability to balance gross margin and generated expense leverage as we accelerated our investments in new store developments. Even without the leverage benefited the 53rd week in 2011 we had strong operating profit performance.","Interest expense was $40 million for the quarter, a reduction of $26 million from last year\u2019s fourth quarter primarily due to our debt reduction. Excluding adjustments for comparability detailed in our press release, net income increased 33% to $299 million, including an estimated $0.06 for the 53rd week in 2011. Adjusted earnings per share increased 34% to $0.87 in the 2011 quarter compared to $0.65 in the 2010 quarter.","Turning to our cash flow. We generated more than $1 billion of cash from operating activity through the year. That\u2019s an increase of 27% year-over-year. Total capital expenditures were $515 million, including a $120 million for distribution centers, $114 million for new lease stores, $80 million for improvements and upgrades to existing stores, $80 for stores purchased or built by us, $73 million for remodels and relocations of existing stores, $28 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects, and $15 million for transportation-related capital. As of the end of the year, total inventories at cost were $2 billion, up 7% on a per store basis, just slightly above our same-store sales growth with inventory churns of 5.3 times for the 53-week year. Total outstanding debt at the end of the year was $2.62 billion, a decrease of $670 million from 2010. Net of cash, our ratio of long term obligations to adjusted EBITDA was 1.4 times at the end of fiscal 2011, compared to 1.8 times at the end of 2010.","On March 15th, our revolving credit facility was amended and restated increasing the maximum amounts permitted to be borrowed to $1.2 billion and extending the maturity of the facility from 2013 to 2014. In addition, we have recently commenced efforts to amend our term loan facility to extend the maturity of a portion of the facility from 2014 to 2017. We continue to deploy capital efficiently with our top tier return on invested capital of 22.1% in 2011.","To summarize, we have continued to deliver strong financial performance in a volatile environment including exceptional cash flow generation and return on capital.","Over the last several months we have finalized our plans for 2012. We are anticipating another strong year and we are very excited about making key investments to grow the business for the long term, while still delivering top tier financial results. We expect top line sales for 2012 to increase 8% to 9% or 10% to 11% excluding the 53rd week from 2011. Overall, square footage is expected to grow approximately 7% in 2012 and same-store sales on a comparable 52-week basis are expected to increase 3% to 5%. Operating profit is forecasted to be between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion excluding certain adjustments comparable to 2011.","In the first half of the year, we expect modest contraction of our gross margin rate and higher expenses related to strategic investments including cost associated with the opening and ramp-up of operations of our two new distribution centers and start up cost related to our initial entrance into California. In the second half of the year we expect these headwinds to moderate as our new distribution centers become more efficient.","New stores expansion into new geographies and an expansion of our distribution network are solid example of investing to drive productive sales growth for the long term. We are forecasting net interest expense for the year to be in the range of $145 to $155 million as we intend to refinance our senior subordinated notes on or after the first call date in July of 2012. We expect our full-year tax rate to be in the range of 38% to 39%, although it may likely vary quarter to quarter.","Finally, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.65 to $2.75. We are assuming about 335 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year which assumes the repurchase of $315 million of our common stock under our remaining share repurchase authorization.","2012 capital expenditures are forecasted to be in the range of $600 to $650 million with approximately 65% for investments in store growth and development, including new stores, remodels, relocations and purchases of existing store locations. Approximately 15% for transportation, distribution and special projects, the remaining 20% is for maintenance capital. Our capital expenditures are increasing this year as we take advantage of opportunities to test additional potential avenues of growth. Rick will share more details about those opportunities with you in a minute.","Again for 2012 reflects another growth year for Dollar General. While we're seeing some indications of positive trends in the economy we believe our customers\u2019 discretionary spending will continue to be constrained in 2012. As our track record demonstrates, Dollar General is well-positioned to serve our customers regardless of how the economy plays out. We are starting the year off on the strong note with same-store sales growth coming in very nicely in February and to date in March.","Now I would like to turn the call back over to Rick to summarize our 2012 initiatives that support our guidance.","Richard Dreiling","Thanks David. We outlined some of our 2012 initiatives for you in our third-quarter conference call. So I'd like to expand upon those today. But first I would like to reiterate our four operating priorities, driving productive sales growth, increasing gross margin, leveraging process improvement in information technology to reduce cost, and strengthening and expanding Dollar General\u2019s culture of serving others. We believe that adherence to these priorities and our focus on multiple leverage to drive sustainability of results will continue to separate Dollar General from the competition and allow us to provide our customers with the consistent low prices that they trust.","Let's start with our first priority of driving productive sales growth. The returns on our new stores remain some of the best in retail, thanks to the disciplines we have developed in our real estate model. In 2012, we expect to open approximately 625 new stores. We also plan to continue our remodel and relocation program including an additional 550 stores in 2012. In total, we expect square footage growth of approximately 7%. I should point out that a higher percentage of our new stores next year will be in our newer states, including an estimated 50 stores in California. The vast majority of our new stores and relocations will be traditional Dollar General stores. However, our plans also include in addition of approximately 40 new Dollar General Markets which will take us to more than 100 market stores by the end of next year. We have dedicated resources for further development and ongoing assessment of the Dollar General Market concept. We are excited about the opportunity to introduce the concept in both new and existing markets with a focus on the many food desert areas that are far away from the traditional grocery store. The results of the market remodels we have completed to date and of our 12 new market stores are encouraging. Albeit, still very early.","We are continuing to make tweaks in our product selection, store design and capital investment and we expect that 2012 will provide many helpful earnings.","In addition we plan to expand our test of the larger format Dollar General store that we refer to internally as DG plus. This format has expanded coolers but no fresh meat and produce. These stores have about 10,000 square feet of selling space and while it is still very early, customer response has been very strong to this format. We are excited about the potential growth opportunities for both this larger Dollar General and Dollar General Market as we continue our work to maximize profitability and returns on both of these formats.","We will continue to enhance our category management efforts and are focused on optimizing our planogram productivity. We have embarked upon Phase 5 of our evolution in merchandising. In Phases 1 through 4 we have raised the shelf height across the stores increasing our shelf space. In Phase 5 we plan to use this space even more effectively by developing region or demographic specific plants to ensure that we have the right balance of offerings based on the population demographics and the stores sale logistics. We expect to continue to expand our merchandise offering at the $1 price point and plan to add more items in food, in snacks, as well as seasonal in 2012.","Additionally, we plan to future expand our cooler presence. Currently, our new stores are opening with 14 to 16 coolers and we plan to install 4 additional cooler doors in approximately 1200 existing locations to better serve our time conscious customer. Fresh and refrigerated foods help us drive customer traffic and increase basket size by serving a greater share of our customer\u2019s needs. Across non-consumables, our strategy is continue to be trend relevant as price points our core customer expects from us. We have a fresh approach to apparel pricing, adding more in season promotional events. Based on our focus group research, we believe this approach is more consistent with how our customer purchases apparel.","Also, we plan to flow new apparel to the stores more frequently, so that our customer sees new fresh merchandize more often. We will continue to take an aggressive stand towards improving our in stock position. This is a never ending effort, which requires focus on store level perpetual inventory accuracy as well as improved execution across ordering, fulfillment, delivery and stocking.","With regard to expanding our gross margin, we expect our mix to continue to be pressured by macro economic factors. However, we believe we have additional opportunity to capture margin in 2012 from further shrink reduction, expansion of foreign sourcing and the addition of private ran SKUs as we move into new category. We intend to take additional steps in our price optimization efforts and expect to utilize multiple price zones while remaining true to our EDLP strategy in 2012.","Our third priority is to leverage process improvement in IT to reduce cost. We expect to continue to leverage our new workforce management system that was completely rolled out in 2011. We are making a multiple year investment in our supply chain system. Over the next few years we expect to benefit incrementally from the phased rollout of our supply chain solution. This is more than a IT project. It impacts our people, our processes, and our systems, helping us to ensure that we have the right product at the right place at the right time and most importantly in the right quantity. Over time we believe this project will benefit our inventory levels at the DC than in the stores, our allocation of merchandizing the stores and our overall in stock position on the shelf.","We expect 2012 to be another strong year for Dollar General. We look forward to our expansion into California and our learnings from Dollar General Market and we believe that we have the right plans and the right team in place to achieve our goal.","We continue to strengthen our financial position and importantly we are building loyalty with our customers. Our customer research indicate that our base of loyal customers is growing as we retain a greater percentage of our non-traditional or higher income customers. Both trips and dollars spent per trip have increased with our shoppers and we are outperforming the channel in customer spending growth among both our routine shoppers and new shoppers. In summary, the data shows that our stores are meeting the needs of an expanding customer base.","As a team we are excited to welcome Greg Sparks to Dollar General as our new Executive Vice President of Store Operations. I have known Greg for over 20 years. He is a strong leader, an exceptional operator with a proven background given his more than 36 years in retail. He will be a great addition to Dollar General. Finally, my personal thanks to over 90,000 Dollar General Employees who are committed to serving our customers every day. Dollar General is a strong company because of our employees. We have a solid foundation for growth and we are continuing to innovate and lead the channel in order to capture multiyear growth opportunities on both the top line and bottom line with the investments we are making. Our strong track record of executing our key initiatives gives me great confidence that the Dollar General team can successfully execute our 2012 goals and can continue to deliver long-term sustainable growth.","With that, Mary Winn, I would like to open it up to questions.","Mary Winn Gordon","Great. Operator, we will take the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mark Montagna with Avondale Partners.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Montagna \u2013 Avondale Partners","Hi, good morning. I was hoping to just kind of get a feel for your cost increases that you are facing in 2012 in the first half, how would that compare to the cost increases that you faced in the first half of 2011? Is it less of an increase, more or about the same, perhaps?","Rick Dreiling","That\u2019s a great question, Mark. We are actually seeing inflation moderate in the first quarter. I would guesstimate that it\u2019s about half of what it was in the first quarter of last year. So, around 1% reducing right now.","Mark Montagna \u2013 Avondale Partners","All right. That\u2019s fantastic. Is there a great pressure on the discretionary or the non-discretionary product?","Rick Dreiling","It\u2019s about the same, I would say. It\u2019s about the same on both sides.","Mark Montagna \u2013 Avondale Partners","Okay, that\u2019s great. I will jump out. Thanks.","David Tehle","Thanks, Mark.","Mary Winn Gordon","Operator, we will move to next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenhiem Securities.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, John.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenhiem Securities","Hi, how are you? Couple of things. When you think about the discretionary part of the mix, and you are clearly doing some things to tweak that and generate some sales. When you step back and think about the store and those categories longer term, how do you think about how much space you are dedicating to those categories? Should there be a pullback in some of those categories in terms of your commitment to them? How do you think about the longer term?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, great question. One of the things we work very hard on, John, is not to be a 7,600 square foot grocery store. We believe the non-consumable side to us is as important as the consumable. Now, as I look back over the last four years, we have made some decisions, made some changes and pulled back on some of the non-consumable categories. We are very encouraged with what we have seen on just about all of the non-consumable categories with the exception of apparel, and we still think that has a long term, but we heat map [ph] the store, we understand how the categories are performing, and as we walk through the year, we will make the necessary decisions we need to make.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenhiem Securities","Okay. Secondly, just on DG Market, it\u2019s early yet, but when you think about the changes you have made, how close do you think you can get the ROI on that to a traditional Dollar store? It will probably never be as good, but how close can you get it? And I have always thought of it as being complementary, do you think we ever get to a point we are opening several hundred DG Markets a year?","Rick Dreiling","I will take the back half of that question and let David take the front half.","David Tehle","Yes, I think, John, you are right. I mean, we don\u2019t ever see the returns equaling what we have in the traditional stores, but as we work on the merchandise mix and as we work on the capital that we have invested in, we see that gap closing somewhat from where it is today. Again, the play on that, if you remember, is we are going into food desserts where we think we can drive a lot of volume, and then they generate a lot of raw profit dollars in terms of generating EBITDA for the model, which certainly is something we are very happy to see.","Rick Dreiling","And regards to the back half, we believe it\u2019s a part of our future, it\u2019s a little early to stand up and say how many stores we think it\u2019s going to be, but I will tell you, John, the ones that we have opened and the ones we have remodeled, but we have got a lot of work to do, yet. We are very pleased with what we are seeing.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenhiem Securities","And then, just one final thing, when you look at the moderation in the comp you guys have guided to, is the bulk of that disinflation or if not, is it a guess price-related or something else?","Rick Dreiling","What we always try to do is put our best view on it. It\u2019s a little early yet, to be honest. And what I will promise you, we will do what we have done for the last two years, every quarter we will give you an update based on the results we have.","John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenhiem Securities","Okay, thanks.","Mary Winn Gordon","All right. Operator, we will go on to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, Deborah.","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi","Good morning. Congratulations.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you very much.","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi","If you look back at 2011, what were the biggest surprises?","Rick Dreiling","What a great question. I think the LIFO charge to me, having to work with inflation, I will tell you I was very pleased with sales, and the way sales ramped up through the year, which I think is really \u2013 I think that\u2019s very telling and that it says that we are broadening our appeal to a broader customer base and still growing our share of wallet with our existing customers.","And I got to tell you, as far as the organization goes, I would say that we continue to demonstrate that we have multiple levers that we can pull. If you think about the LIFO charge we took in the fourth quarter and we were still able to manage the business and exceed the Street\u2019s expectations.","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi","Great. And then, one last question for you. I know it\u2019s very early, but can you talk about your experience thus far with e-commerce?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, it is a little early, yet. We are continuing to expand a number of items that are on there. I think we have almost two-and-a-half times the number of items we had before. So, we are approaching 3,000 items. We are getting some hits. We are measuring the re-hits where people come back to us. We are pleased with what we see, but it\u2019s a little early, yet.","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi","And are you finding that those are customers, are those people who are in existing markets, or are those people on new markets?","Rick Dreiling","Believe it or not, all across the United States. It has been very interesting that we have had hits from states we are not in.","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi","Great.","Rick Dreiling","But not Hawaii, by the way.","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi","Not Hawaii, not yet.","Rick Dreiling","I am sorry.","Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi","Thanks so much and best of luck.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you.","Mary Winn Gordon","Operator, we will take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Rick Dreiling","Hi Dan.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Hi Rick, how are you doing?","Rick Dreiling","Good.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","So, you noted that your operating margin of 10.2% is a lifetime high in the year just ended. You are also guiding to a little bit of operating margin pressure during the first half of 2012. With your operating margins now at record levels, but also mindful, this is discount store retailing, it\u2019s not Williams-Sonoma, do you think we are at a point now where DG has to start reinvesting some of that operating margin to grow market share at a faster rate thinking that future operating margin gains from this point forward to be very difficult to achieve?","Rick Dreiling","I look at it, Dan, we still have opportunities in sourcing private brands, shrink, warehouse and transportation. There is a lot of room there, and the one thing I think it\u2019s a real key takeaway for us the improvement that we have driven has not been from raising prices, it\u2019s been by doing a better job around the acquisition and the moving of products. So, I feel comfortable there is still some room. David, I don\u2019t know if you would like to add anything to that?","David Tehle","Yes, I think particularly as we look at private label and sourcing and we know we have got a long run rate to go in both of those. And sourcing anyway is something we tell we control obviously private label customer has to vote on it. But the things internally sourcing, and shrink, and distribution and transportation, those are things that we have total control over, and we know that we have room for advancement in those areas.","Rick Dreiling","And you know, Dan, I would tell you this, too. If you look at the syndicated data, I mean, on a four-week, 12-week, 24-week, 52-week, I mean, we are growing our share 10% to 12% now.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","That\u2019s right. I mean, totally fine with sacrificing some margin if it\u2019s more than an ample payback in market share. One other question I would ask, this is a very significant growth in the number of coolers that DG is adding whether to hit the market, the DG Plus stores or even your core stores. Yet, the company still does not have any refrigerated distribution capacity. At what point do you start rethinking that part of your supply chain?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, I think that\u2019s a really fair question, Dan. Even though we are adding a lot of cooler doors, we still, we are not \u2013 it\u2019s not a big case business for us yet, the growth is phenomenal, but the people we are using deliver by the piece for us, which makes it much more better for our inventories. It is something that we are watching, something that we are monitoring, something we are thinking about to be honest, and I will give you an update when we decide to make that move.","Dan Wewer \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, great. Thank you.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you, Dan.","Mary Winn Gordon","Operator, we will move on to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carla Casella with JPMorgan.","Rick Dreiling","Hi, Carla","Paul Simenauer \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, this is actually Paul Simenauer on for Carla.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Simenauer \u2013 JPMorgan","Good morning. First off, when you look at the assortment of brands at the Dollar stores, we are starting to see more brands out in the past, guys were not selling through that channel. Have most of the CPG companies overcome this aversion to the channel?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, I mean, actually if you look at it, we are in the top 10 with most of the CPG companies out there now. And the advantage, Paul, to national brands for us, it gives us relevancy with the trade down and the trade-in customer. And the merchandising team has been able to develop a very strong private brand program and a very strong national brand, but works out good.","Paul Simenauer \u2013 JPMorgan","Got you. And are there any brands that you would like to carry that cannot at this point?","Rick Dreiling","I am very pleased with the selection overall. When you think about the national brands that we carry, we really focus on the ones that our customers can afford and relate to.","Paul Simenauer \u2013 JPMorgan","Got it. And finally, what are the biggest CPG partners for you today in terms of growth and adding to your mix?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, I would look out to you and tell you, you could pick any one you wanted to on that. We enjoy the same relationship with them as all of the bigger players do.","Paul Simenauer \u2013 JPMorgan","Got it. Okay, thank you very much.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you.","Mary Winn Gordon","All right. Operator, we will move on to the next question.","Operator","The next question comes from Wayne Hood with BMO Capital.","Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital","Yes, good morning everyone.","Mary Winn Gordon","Hi, Wayne.","Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital","A maintenance question I guess before I get to an ROIC question, what is the LIFO accrual that\u2019s embedded in your guidance for the coming year?","David Tehle","Yes, we have \u2013 I am not going to give you an exact number there, Wayne, but we have what I would call moderate amount of LIFO played into the number, our guidance is $2.65 to $2.75. Certainly not as large as what we saw in 2011, something more moderate than that.","Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital","Okay. And my second question relates to return on capital on the 10,000 square foot store kind of capacity you have in DG Market. Can you speak a little bit about how you are trying to lower the capital investment spread between the $180,000 you might spend on a traditional store on what you are spending on these, and what level of capital does it have to come down to, to make the return on investment non-dilutive to the overall capital that you might be deploying?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, I think it\u2019s more than just looking at the capital. As we look at, you certainly have to look at the revenue that\u2019s coming out of that box and the mix of products, because the product mix is skewed a little heavier towards the consumables. So, we have to work the top part of the equation as well as the bottom part of it on the capital. So, I think we are working all sides of it right now. It\u2019s still early, we are still learning, we are doing a lot of value engineering in the stores in terms of trying to figure out what makes sense from a capital point of view.","Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital","When you talk about meaningfully above the $180,000, are you talking twice that or can you put some parameters around the magnitude of the difference and again how you get more specifically how you are bringing that down?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, I think until we really put a stake in the ground on the model and are willing to say we have it perfected, we are still experimenting and we would rather not lay a number out there and certainly, when we feel like we have got it where we want it, we are willing to get a little more guidance on that.","Wayne Hood \u2013 BMO Capital","All right, thanks guys. Great quarter.","Rick Dreiling","Thanks Wayne.","Mary Winn Gordon","Thanks Wayne. Operator, we will move on to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aram Rubinson with Nomura Securities.","Edgar Roesch \u2013 Nomura Securities","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s actually Ed sitting in for Aram. First of all, congrats on 10,000th store mark. Quite an achievement.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you. Ed, actually I am going there myself to see that one happen.","Edgar Roesch \u2013 Nomura Securities","Excellent. Having been in one of these Plus stores, just one observation I had is it seemed to be a bit removed from the heart of the retail trade areas, at least anecdotally, and I was wondering if that\u2019s part of the strategy or is that just a one-off observation?","Rick Dreiling","I would tell you, it\u2019s just a one-off observation. I didn\u2019t see where that store was at the time when we were going to remodel it, and we took advantage of it.","Edgar Roesch \u2013 Nomura Securities","Okay. And then, how many of the 2012 openings would you think might be these Plus DGs?","Rick Dreiling","Approximately 80.","Edgar Roesch \u2013 Nomura Securities","Approximately 80, okay. And then, last question related to it, do they include any produce items? I don\u2019t recall that part of it.","Rick Dreiling","No. The Plus store is a major commitment to just to refrigerated and the frozen and then some expanded sets within the store.","Edgar Roesch \u2013 Nomura Securities","Okay. And is the DG market giving you lessons on produce that might lead you to want to expand that category throughout the chain to any degree?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, actually we are learning a lot about produce and meat, and again, it\u2019s too soon to stand up and make a commitment on that. You got to remember that\u2019s brand new for us, and we are not new in our Dollar General Markets, but really understanding the quality, the selection, the variety. So, we have a lot to learn there, yet, but we will stay tuned, we will see down the road.","Edgar Roesch \u2013 Nomura Securities","Alright, thanks.","Rick Dreiling","That number on the DG plus includes relocations and remodels by the way.","Edgar Roesch \u2013 Nomura Securities","Okay, terrific. Thank you.","Mary Winn Gordon","Alright. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, Matt.","Teresa Dillon \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning. It\u2019s actually Teresa Dillon for Matt.","Rick Dreiling","Well, good morning, Teresa.","Teresa Dillon \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you.","Teresa Dillon \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Just a few quick questions. I am just curious on your plan to add more merchandize at the $1 price point. You have talked about it for the past couple of calls and just wanted to dig into this a little bit more. How big do you expect this to be and how should we think about the profitability of these items, particularly, if they are skewed more towards consumables?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, that\u2019s a great question. Actually, not only consumables but we are also doing a lot of work on the non-consumable side. We introduced many SKUs of $1 HVA items in the course of the year. In terms of the profitability, they still carry a very solid profit and that\u2019s equal to the stuff we are actually selling -- the merchandize we are selling in the store. The real key takeaway on the addition of the $1 merchandize is that it\u2019s not eroding the category, it\u2019s become incremental. So we actually believe that was a sale we weren\u2019t getting that we are now getting.","Teresa Dillon \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And then outside of the supply chain initiative you mentioned on the call, I am just wondering what sort of left on the agenda or the wish list from a technology perspective?","David Tehle","Yes, I think as we look at that several things. Certainly the supply chain is the biggest one as we move forward and we think that will do a lot for us in terms of inventory churn in stock, demand forecasting. We have got some enhancements, we will be making to our handheld in the stores which is kind of the lifeline for the stores, again in terms of managing inventory and helping increase our sales. Two new distribution centers this year, obviously there is a lot of IT work involved when you open a distribution center. We are doing some pricing system enhancements with the demand tech and again, we think as we refine our pricing that will have some major benefits for the company. And then we have got some things going on in transportation and distribution, including expanding our transportation routing. So, kind of a whole bunch of different things, touching many different parts of the business and we still think there is a lot of technology that we can inject in the business to help drive more sales and drive more profitability.","Teresa Dillon \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Alright. Thanks very much.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you.","Mary Winn Gordon","Operator, we will move on to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, Chuck.","Charles Grom - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, thanks. Just on the acceleration of your comps in January and then so far into February and March. Just wondering, how much that\u2019s been driven by traffics versus ticket and how broad-based that\u2019s been by category? And then, how would you expect the pace of comps to look in 2012 in light of the 3% to 5% comp that you guys gave this morning?","David Tehle","Yes, traffic is definitely \u2013 has been trending higher than the basket. However, the basket is still contributing. I don\u2019t want to mislead you, we are so happy with what we are seeing in basket, but traffic clearly is the bigger piece of that, particularly in the more current (inaudible).","Rick Dreiling","And in terms of the comps through the year, I mean, we are looking for a pretty consistent role through the year Chuck, not that\u2019s going to be heavier at one end or the other.","Charles Grom - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Fair enough. Could you just quantify for us these investments that you are making here in front half of the year, both the DC investments in California? And then when you think about store capacity, once you get these two DCs up and running, what does it look like for the total company? In other words, are you going to be looking to open up another couple of DCs in the out years or is it set for a few years?","David Tehle","We are not going to be that granular in terms of actually quantifying it. I think what we have said is that we do see some pressure on the gross margin percentage in the first half of the year and one of the big reason is because of the inefficiencies as we have two new distribution centers coming up. We do have a little bit more SG&A, also in some of the startup cost hits that and then we have the investment in California that we mentioned. So we do have a moderate impact related to that. I think as we move forward in our model we see ourselves adding a distribution center every 1000 stores. So, as we open 1000 stores it\u2019s probably time to add a DC. I will also say as we look at our five-year strategy on distribution in transportation we look at where we are today and we look at where we see ourselves in five years, we see these investments that we are making being positive and being accretive to that line item. When we look at DC in trans where we are today versus five years from now, we see ourselves leveraging that. So I think these are great investments that we are making for the long term growth of our business.","Rick Dreiling","I think Chuck the way to think about it is we expect both gross margin and SG&A leverage for the full year.","Charles Grom - Deutsche Bank","Got you. Okay. And then just on the total capacity, where you guys are today and where these two DCs position you?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, I think a fair question. This will obviously give us some room for a period of time. We really like the run of our DC that is at 85% capacity. That gives us the fluctuation to deal with incoming fees and all that. So that\u2019s why the 1000 stores is a real good rule of thumb.","Charles Grom - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Alright, great. Congrats again.","David Tehle","Thank you.","Mary Winn Gordon","Operator, we will take the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets","Good morning, guys. How are you?","Rick Dreiling","Good.","Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets","Good. First, you guys talked about you think you are retaining more of your non-traditional customers, that certainly makes sense to me, but how do you actually know that or how do you measure those, that\u2019s just kind of a belief?","David Tehle","Yes, actually it\u2019s exit research where the customer comes out of the store right, I mean, we also use Nielsen Panel data. So it\u2019s not a guess. There is some rigor around it.","Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets","Perfect. Okay. And then, presumably, stores in new markets aren\u2019t nearly as profitable as opening up the existing marketing. As you move into places like California, a little bit different market obviously for you guys, is that a noticeable drag on profits for some time and so they kind of ramp-up to a more mature level or what\u2019s the right way to think about that?","David Tehle","Yes, there is definitely some drag when we go into a new market. Again, keep in mind we still have a lot of opportunities in our existing markets when we talk about the number of stores long term that we can open. So of course, part of our goal is to try to balance that out in terms of our store openings and where we open them. Yes, clearly there is a little bit of a startup when you go into a new state.","Rick Dreiling","Scot, I would also throw out to that. The real estate team has taken a much different approach to entering a market. You think back into the old days we put a store in Northern Arizona, Southern Arizona, Eastern Arizona and Western Arizona and wonder why no one knew who we were. The team real estate team here now is going in putting the stores together where the merchants can effectively put a marketing and merchandizing strategy around to make bigger impression quicker and get the sales moving faster.","Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you.","Mary Winn Gordon","Thank you. Operator, our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Denise Chai with Bank of America.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, Denise.","Denise Chai - Bank of America","Hi, good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter and a great year.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you.","Denise Chai - Bank of America","Just wanted to dig a little bit more into your planogram optimization with phase 5 coming on now. So can you kind of give us some examples of what different demographic segments you will be targeting, when the rollups is going to be complete and how much of the mix source due count will this affect?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, let me give you the easiest example. Think in terms of a younger demographic versus an older. So traditionally today we have an incontinent set that is the same in every store in the chain and a diaper set that is the same in every store in the chain. What we will be able to do based on age obviously is go in and alter the size of those sets. So I might say that\u2019s a very easy example. Think in terms of seasonal, Halloween for example does very well in rural, doesn\u2019t do quite as well in urban environment and we will be able to go in and adjust those sets. It will ultimately over time affect every store in the chain and every market and every category.","Denise Chai - Bank of America","Okay, that\u2019s great thank you. And then I also wanted to ask \u2013 I know that you are increasing coolers, that\u2019s a big commitment, but when do you expect to see an inflection in the sales mix. Now that the consumer is getting a little bit better, when do you think that non-consumables will start to go a little bit faster than consumables?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, I think the non-consumable side of the table Denise is being driven by the macroeconomic environment out there. We are very comfortable with the decisions we are making on the non-consumable side. As I said on the call, we are starting to get some traction in a lot of areas, you know, home and stationary. We are very very pleased with the changes we made on infants and toddlers. We still have some work to do but we are not willing to give up on it yet. So, I think it will help when the economy will get us going in the right direction.","Denise Chai - Bank of America","Great. Thank you.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you.","Mary Winn Gordon","Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Emily Shanks with Barclays Capital.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, Emily.","John Connor \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi, this is John Connor filing in for Emily. Thanks for taking the question.","Rick Dreiling","You bet, John.","John Connor \u2013 Barclays Capital","What factors did you consider when evaluating whether your free cash flow or new debt to refinance the senior notes?","David Tehle","I am sorry, can you repeat question?","John Connor \u2013 Barclays Capital","Sure. I was wondering if you could just let us know what factors did you consider when evaluating whether to use free cash flow or issuing new debt to refinance the senior notes?","David Tehle","Yes, I think as we look at it right now, we are pretty satisfied with our current debt level. We had mentioned that our goal was to drive our debt to EBITDA below 3.0, which we did in the quarter, it\u2019s either at Q8 or Q9 depending upon if you put cash in there. So, our belief is that it\u2019s a buck holding ownership comes down we should become investment grade. So we are about where we want to be in terms of the debt level. So our current thought process is that we will refinance the $450 million sub-debt sometime around the July call date or thereafter. And certainly we\u2019ll get much lower debt since that\u2019s at a (inaudible) and you know what the going debt rate would be for a company of our nature. So I think our current thoughts is that we\u2019ll definitely use debt to and keep that debt out there.","John Connor \u2013 Barclays Capital","Great, thanks. If I could ask one more question to circle back on inflation. Can you give us the rate of inflation you experience in 4Q \u201911 and which category specifically had the highest rates?","David Tehle","Yes. It was approximately 2% in the fourth quarter. Nuts come to mind, peanut butter, a lot of basic commodity items.","Mary Winn Gordon","Okay. Operator we\u2019ll go ahead and take the next question please in the interest of time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, Colin.","Colin McGranahan - Bernstein","Good morning, guys. One of the focus on gross margin and first just looking at the fourth quarter, I know you talked a little about LIFO but the $22 million charge was certainly more than I think we expected more than you had expected and just seems all the coffee, sugar, nuts would drive that much of it. So maybe if you could just give us a little bit more detail about that? But then also if we exclude that charge, that looks like the other line gross margins were up 25 to 30 basis points, which should be a very good performance give the negative mix in consumables. So, if you could give us a little bit more detail on what some of the drivers were there, how much shrink might have contributed, etc.?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, obviously we continue to make good inroads in shrink. Remember, our warehouse and transportation is in the margin line and we are working very hard on that also. And so you know, remember there is a lot of levers here that we are working on. Our margin improvement is not coming from raising prices, it\u2019s doing a better job of managing the overall business. And I think as you guys think about it that\u2019s our story, that we have multiple levers to pull which is why our growth is so sustainable. It\u2019s funny \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you look at the can and nuts on the shelf but I believe the 60 ounce can is down to about 8 or 9 ounces now, where everybody is really downsizing that type of product. Peanut butter, I mean a jar of peanut butter is $6 now. Coffee, I believe we saw some increases there. Creamers we saw increase. So it\u2019s just a lot of broadbased items.","David Tehle","Yes, I think Colin, it was items that we also have a lot of inventory if it\u2019s a good item for us and we sell a lot of them and that has an impact on the life of calculation as how much inventory you have in the items of coffee, battery, peanuts, peanut butter, egg, motor oil, some paper products, charcoal. I mean, you name it, we just had a lot of products. Yes, it did \u2013 it came in a little bit higher then we had planned and clearly a little bit deeper than we had planned. If you look at the margins for the quarter, a couple of things to keep in mind, the LIFO was clearly the biggest factor but also you have that mix faster that we talked about where our consumable business in the quarter was higher than it was in the previous quarter, 71.4% of the business versus 69.6% last year. So we continue to have a bit of a negative impact on mix. And then transportation, the fuel prices again are something that hit us in the quarter overall versus the last year. As we look forward on it we still have some headwinds there in terms of \u2013 as we mention, we got a certain amount of LIFO played in, we still see the mix being an issue and we still seeing the fuel cost being an issue as we move forward in the model.","Colin McGranahan - Bernstein","David, thank you. I mean, that was exactly my point, you had those headwinds and you had LIFO. The gross margin is still up nearly 30 basis points. So, I guess my second question is looking forward, as you look at the first quarter especially, I know you have the DC costs in there and you have these other headwinds, but you are anniversarying it down 63 and I believe at the time you said the most significant factor in that was the markdowns from last spring, obviously the weather is very unfavorable, discretionary was weak on high gas prices. The conflict is the first quarter is off to a great start so far, so I would expect markdowns to be dramatically better year-over-year. And then as you move through the year, you are going to be anniversarying these increasingly large LIFO charges. So, I was just trying to get a better handle on the outlook for gross margin through the year.","Rick Dreiling","Yes. We are calling out that we will have some margin improvements for the year. And again, I would turn it over to David here. I don't want a short change that ramping up of two distribution centres in the first quarter of the year. They don't come out flying shipping to 1,000 stores and then in terms of markdowns, what I would like to say about markdowns is we have a new apparel strategy in place in which we are focused on selling apparel more like the customers used to buying it. So, we do believe we are going to get SG&A leverage for the year. We do believe we are going to have margin expansion for the year.","Colin McGranahan - Bernstein","Okay. Great, thank you very much.","Rick Dreiling","You bet.","Mary Winn Gordon","Operator, we will take the next call, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Exstein with Credit Suisse.","Rick Dreiling","Hi, Michael.","Trey Schorgl \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi. This is actually Trey Schorgl for Michael today. Thanks for taking the question.","Rick Dreiling","You bet.","Trey Schorgl \u2013 Credit Suisse","We are just wondering, it looked like apparel trend is a little bit better in the fourth than it is in the prior couple of quarters and we are just wondering if there was anything that was driving that?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, we have reallocated space in the department and 50% of that now is infants and toddlers. There is a real focus in the organization on basics and cohesion, but I don\u2019t want to mislead you that we think we have figured it all out and the trends are heading in the right direction. We have got a lot of work to do there, we have got a great team in place there now and we are going to let that play out.","Trey Schorgl \u2013 Credit Suisse","All right, well, thank you very much.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you.","Mary Winn Gordon","Operator, in the interest of time, we will take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from David Mann with Johnson Rice.","Rick Dreiling","Good morning, David.","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question under the wire.","Rick Dreiling","My pleasure, David.","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice","Couple of things. I don\u2019t think you talked about beer and wines. So, can you just talk a little bit about that initiative and what you expect from it in 2012?","Rick Dreiling","Yes. We have almost 3,500 stores complete now. We continue to be pleased with what we are seeing, not only in regards to the basket, but also what it does to the comp in the store. What has been really exciting for us is, we have launched our private brand wine, and it is doing very good, very pleased with what we are seeing there, and of course, as we move into California, it is in Las Vegas why we are working our way into it, we will also be selling spirits.","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice","That\u2019s great. In terms of the remodels that you are doing, can you just update us on the performance that you are expecting to see from them in terms of self business [ph]?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, we have been pretty consistent with what we have been seeing out of both of our remodels and relocations on sales with the relocations somewhere around 20% to 25% sales lift and then the remodels were somewhere around 5%, and as like I said that has been fairly consistent for us.","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice","Great. And then the last question related to the gas prices that we are continuing to see go up. Obviously, you are talking about a strong start to the quarter, any sense that you are seeing any kind of impact from the gas price on the consumer and when you might expect that to happen?","Rick Dreiling","Yes, my observation, I have tried really hard to try and correlate what happens to our sales and our customers with spikes in gasoline prices, and I always come back to we have completed 22 consecutive year of same-store sales growth. There has been high gas prices, low gas prices, there has been rough economy and bad economy, and I think what happens when the gas prices get higher, more customers need it. Now, I do think the gas prices put pressure on the non-consumable side of the business, but I think that is more than offset by other people coming in on the consumable side.","David Mann \u2013 Johnson Rice","Great good luck in \u201912.","Rick Dreiling","Thank you very much. Mary Win?","Mary Winn Gordon","Operator, thank you very much and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I know we have left many people in the queue.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. This call is being recorded. Instructions for listening to the replay of the call are available in the company's earnings press release issued this morning.","Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Winn Pilkington, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Relations. Ms. Pilkington, you may begin your conference.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Thank you, Hope, and good morning, everyone. On the call today are Todd Vasos, our CEO, and John Garratt, our CFO. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call for questions. Please remember to keep your questioning to one line of thought. Our earnings release issued today can be found on our website at dollargeneral.com under investor information and press releases.","Let me caution you that today's comments will include forward-looking statements about our expectations, plans, predictions and other non-historical matters, including but not limited to, our fiscal 2016,2017 store growth, fiscal 2016 initiatives, capital allocation strategy and related expectations, our long-term financial growth model and future economic trends or conditions.","Forward-looking statements can be identified because they are not statements of historical fact and use words such as outlook, may, should, could, believe, anticipate, expect, looking ahead, focused on, estimate, forecast, goal or intend, and similar expressions that concern our strategies, plans, intentions or beliefs about future occurrences or results.","Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those projected or implied by our forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release issued this morning, our 2015 10-K filed on March 22, 2016, and our most recent 10-Q filed today, and in the comments that are made on this call. We encourage you to read these documents. You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today's date. Dollar General disclaims any obligation to update or revise any information discussed in this call, except as follows.","We previously outlined - model and certain 2016 financial guidance in our press release issued on March 10, 2016. As noted in that release, we plan to update our diluted EPS guidance only if we no longer reasonably expect diluted EPS to fall within the 10% to 15% range outlined in the growth model, and we generally do not intend and specifically disclaim any duty to update our expectations regarding where in the range of guidance net sales, same-store sales, or diluted EPS may fall, or to update any component of the growth model, other than diluted EPS, as just referenced.","As we noted in that press release, we also do not intend and specifically disclaim any duty to update our dollar range for expected fiscal 2016 capital expenditures, unless otherwise described by applicable securities laws. Our comments today will be consistent with the approach we just outlined. We will not discuss and will not answer any questions regarding the quarter's results as related to the long-term growth model or the specific 2016 financial guidance first given on March 10, 2016. However, due to our accelerated store growth plans during this call, we are discussing our square footage growth targets for 2016 and 2017.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you Mary Winn, and welcome to everyone joining our call. As we noted in our press release, we had a very good start to the year and are pleased with our results. For the first quarter, the team executed well, as we were keenly focused on ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of every aspect of our business.","Let's recap some of the highlights for the first quarter of 2016, as compared to the 2015 period. First quarter sales increased 7% to $5.3 billion. We delivered same-store sales growth of 2.2% for the quarter.","In an environment where many retailers struggled, we delivered good performance. Same-store sales growth was positive for both consumables and non-consumables, with growth stronger across our consumable categories.","Growth in non-consumables was due to seasonal and home products. For the 33rd consecutive quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket year-over-year.","Gross margin expanded by 16 basis points to 30.6%. We levered selling, general and administrative expenses by 26 basis points as our zero based budget initiative started to contribute to our results.","Operating profit increased 12%, with operating profit margin expansion of 42 basis points. Net income in the first quarter increased 17% to $295 million. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $1.03, including a $0.03 benefit from a lower tax rate, which John will discuss later.","During the quarter, we returned over $300 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.7 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. In the first quarter, we made notable progress against our key initiatives for 2016.","As I will discuss in more detail a bit later in the call, the team has done a great job of developing compelling initiatives across merchandising, store operations and supply chain to help drive our business in 2016 and for the long-term.","Additionally, we continue to grow transactions and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced relatively consistent mid single digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4, 12, 24 and 52-week periods.","Now I would like to turn the call over to John to go through more details of the quarter.","John Garratt","Thank you, Todd, and good morning everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our first quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results, starting with gross profit.","Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.6 billion, or 30.6% of sales, an increase of 16 basis points from last year's first quarter. The most significant drivers were higher initial inventory markups and reduced transportation costs, partially attributable to lower fuel rates.","This was in part offset by a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which have a lower gross profit rate than non-consumables, increased inventory shrink and higher markdown.","SG&A expense decreased by 26 basis points over the 2015 quarter to $1.1 billion, or 21.5% of sales, in the first quarter. The majority of the SG&A decrease was due to lower utilities costs, administrative payroll, incentive compensation, travel expenses, workers compensation costs, and advertising costs, as well as higher volume of customer cash back transactions, resulting in increased convenience fees paid to the company. Partially offsetting these items were our retail labor investment and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in sales.","Our zero based budgeting initiative contributed to our robust results. This process leverages our cultural heritage of thrift and further solidifies our leadership as a low cost operator.","We implemented zero based budgeting proactively and thoughtfully as we developed our fiscal 2016 budget using three filters: the customer, our strategic priorities, and risk mitigation. The team is now actively working on a pipeline of additional future savings opportunities across the company.","Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.4%, as compared to 37.7% in the first quarter last year. As we detailed in our press release, the effective income tax rate was lower in the first quarter of this year due primarily to early adoption of amendment to existing guidance for employee share-based payment accounting and the recognition of incremental benefits from the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.","The income tax benefit of the employee share-based payment accounting change in the quarter was approximately $9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. Because the majority of our stock-based awards typically vest in the first quarter, we do not expect this accounting amendment impact to reoccur to this degree over the balance of the year.","As you may recall, the WOTC was retroactively reenacted in the fourth quarter of 2015, which resulted in a significant portion of our 2015 annual benefit being recorded at that time. Due to Congress approving the WOTC through 2019, we will be able to recognize greater amounts of each quarter's benefit in the respective quarter in which it is earned.","Now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3.07 billion, up 8% in total and 2% on a per store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape, and we are comfortable with the quality.","Our longer-term goal continues to be inventory growth in line with our sales growth. We generated cash from operations of $404 million in the quarter, an increase of 9% or $34 million, compared to the first quarter of 2015.","During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our common stock for $231 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding, totaling $71 million.","From December 2011 through the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased $3.8 billion or 64.7 million shares of our common stock. As of the end of the first quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $693 million.","We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases.","Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately three times adjusted debt to EBITDA.","In closing, we feel really good about delivering a strong first quarter. We remain committed to focusing on profitable growth, reinvesting in our business and capturing cost savings through our zero based budgeting program.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.","Todd Vasos","Thank you, John. Now let's turn to an update on our initiatives for 2016. Our customers are the starting point and center of all we do at Dollar General. We recently did the first re-cut of our consumer segmentation in four years to provide shopper insight that impacts decisions across the entire company.","This research helps us know who our customers are, where they shop, how they shop, what they buy, how much they spend and most importantly, their attitudes and their behaviors.","The exciting news is that we are improving our core customer productivity and retaining our trade-down customer, all while we expand our reach. New segments shopping with us include an older male middle income consumer and a millennial female shopper.","The millennial shopper is a segment that I was particularly excited to see emerge as a core consumer for DG, as this segment is so important to the future of retail and Dollar General.","Today, she represents about 12% of our shoppers and 24% of our sales. On average, she is shopping our stores about three times a month. One of her money-saving strategies is to utilize technology like our Dollar General digital coupon app to make lists, find deals, and save money.","She wants healthy food items, and likes to be on the cutting edge and try new products. While national brands are important, she also trusts our private brands, she utilizes the entire DG store as a way to stretch her budget. These insights will help us serve her even better going forward as we strive to ensure she becomes an even larger consumer segment for us over time.","I believe our deep and actionable understanding of our consumers is a core strength. As we implement and refine our initiatives, we have incorporated this knowledge of our consumers across merchandising and pricing, marketing, site selection, and store operations and design. The primary goal is to grow transaction and item units, which continue to be key to our market share performance.","Our operating priorities continue to be, first, driving profitable sales growth, second, capturing growth opportunities, third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator, and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage.","Our first priority is continuing to drive profitable sales growth. As we look to attract and grow new customers and trips while capturing share with existing customers, the insights gained from our customer segmentation work are incorporated into our disciplined approach to category management.","In the process, we have assessed the expansion of groups that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores. In 2016, we are expanding perishables, health and beauty care, party and stationery.","These 2016 sales driver initiatives are being implemented across not just new stores, relocations and remodels, but also into our mature store base at a greater degree than we have in the past several years.","We are adding a total of 23,000 cooler doors across 9,000 existing stores. In the first quarter alone, more than 20% of these stores received a new cooler expansion, which allows for the extension of cold beer, more immediate consumption items, and greater product selection.","Additionally, more than 7,000 existing stores will see planogram expansions across health and beauty care, party and or stationery, with many of these stores getting all expansions.","Our ongoing affordability initiative is front and center, with an expanded $1 offering, including a greater selection of national brands. Increased penetration of national brands at the $1 price point gives us the opportunity to increase trial with our consumers, which leads to brand acceptance. Acceptance drives loyalty, which tends to encourage trade up over time. Currently, nearly 60% of our baskets contain a $1 item or less.","Our private brand portfolio plays a key role in driving profitable sales, as these items continue to - both sales and enhance our gross margins. Private brands offer exceptional value to our core consumers, and they offer lower opening price points, which is especially important to our customers.","We continue to have private brand opportunity, as our penetration is below both mass merchant and grocery segments. Our plans include engaging our store associates as private brand ambassadors.","In addition, we will continue to communicate with our customers the unparalleled value our private brands offer. In the first quarter, we launched a new private brand line named Heartland Harvest to expand our better for you offerings, which really resonates with our millennials. By September, we anticipate over 15 new SKUs under this better-for-you brand. We will also be expanding our private brand offerings in health and beauty care.","In about 160 Dollar General Plus locations, we are testing limited assortment of the best-selling fresh fruits and vegetables, as we look to gain more experience in this category and capitalize on our customer\u2019s desire for fresh options.","Our Fast Way to Save digital coupon offering continues to gain traction since we first brought this innovation to the channel in September of 2014. The program provides consumers exclusive savings available only as Dollar General Coupons. The compelling offers, which include national brands, private brands, and instant savings are helping to drive enrollment.","We are seeing higher average basket and greater trip frequency for those enrolled in the program. Our recent limited market test across about 300 stores captured 30,000 new enrollees in just two weeks.","Additionally, we have made system changes that simplify enrollment. We are on track to more than double enrollment in the program by the end of this fiscal year, allowing for greater shopper analytics and targeting.","The store operations team is aggressively improving our on-shelf availability. Across the board, we are seeing progress as our third party audits indicate that our stores have improved their in-stock position by more than 100 basis points.","In addition, we continue to optimize our labor investment in our more competitive markets and are pleased with the returns. Notably, these stores continue to show significant improvements in customer satisfaction metrics and same-store sales growth along with operating profit gains.","Across the chain, our customers are taking note of the improvement in in-stock position with recent customer satisfaction scores for our in-stock position at the highest level in two years.","Our first quarter results indicate we are aggressively pursuing opportunities for continued gross margin expansion through global sourcing, cost management and supply chain efficiencies. We believe we will be able to improve both product quality and value for our customers over time.","Second, we are focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth and a proven high return, low risk model. Our long-term growth model contemplates 6% to 8% square footage growth annually.","We anticipate accelerating our square footage growth in 2016 to about 7%, with 900 new stores and increasing this to 7.5% in 2017 with about 1,000 new stores. Our new DG 2016 store layout is being used for all new stores, relocations and remodels.","The layout is designed to expand high growth, traffic building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. We believe this layout can drive both existing and new store - new consumer trips to Dollar General as we place a greater emphasis in the store on value, affordability and convenience. While it\u2019s still early, the results of this DG16 layout are encouraging.","For instance, we are seeing stronger perishable sales, a double-digit lift in our new front end items. Overall, our sales performance in stores using the DG16 layout is meeting our expectations.","In addition, we are utilizing a smaller format store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. Currently, we have opened approximately 45 stores with selling square footage of less than 6,000 square feet, about 20% smaller than our traditional stores.","Based on the early results, sales productivity and returns are very encouraging. This smaller footprint store has all of our strategic initiatives, but with added assortments. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our metro market consumers, we believe this smaller, more flexible format store will allow us to have a higher capture rate for site selection.","Additionally, we believe this smaller format will work in rural locations with a lower household count. With this format, we have greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower household rural sites. In total, we anticipate about 80 of the smaller format stores for the 2016 fiscal year.","We have an active remodel and relocation program designed to keep our brand relevant, as we utilize our most current store layout and in-store communication of value to drive same-store sales and returns.","About 875 locations are expected to be relocated or remodeled in fiscal 2016, with around 900 locations slated for 2017. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2017, as our 1,000 store pipeline is already 50% complete.","We remain disciplined and focused on our new store program continues to drive compelling returns with low cost to build and a low cost to operate. To support our new store growth and drive productivity, we are making investments in our distribution center network.","Since 2012, we have opened four distribution centers. Construction is on track for our newest distribution center in Janesville, Wisconsin, with a goal to begin shipping in early 2017.","Most recently, we purchased land in Jackson, Georgia, for our 15th distribution center. In conjunction with the real estate team, we are proactively planning where our next distribution centers will be located to support growth across merchandising initiatives and store base.","Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. As evidenced by our first quarter performance, our zero based budgeting process contributed to our results, as we successfully leveraged our SG&A expenses on same-store sales growth below our 2.5% to 3% leverage target. Our underlying principles are keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.","Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are our competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great on-boarding and training, and open communication.","We continue to make improvements as our store manager turnover decreased both sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2015 and quarter-over-quarter. To build on these recruitments going forward, we have focused on aligning our talent with the skill set required for success based on store characteristics, in addition to revamping our store manager training.","We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate turnover.","Looking ahead, we are addressing the implementation of the Department of Labor's change to the overtime exemption regulations. We have been anticipating there would be changes since the proposed regulations were first announced and have been evaluating ways in which a change like this could be addressed once it was effective.","Between now and the effective date of December 1, we will continue to refine our analysis and determine the course of action that best serves the needs of our employees, customers and shareholders.","As for our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions, but acknowledge that it is always challenging for our core consumer, given the pressure on her income and spending. Regardless of the economic outlook for our consumers, we do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General.","As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are very pleased to have delivered a strong first quarter. The senior team is aligned and energized across merchandising, store operations and supply chain.","Our multi-year strategic planning process is much further along than typical for this time of year, and we are optimistic and confident in our opportunities going forward. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient.","Our business generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and a competitive dividend.","Over the summer, we will celebrate a significant milestone the opening of our 13,000th store location. With this type of new store growth, we continue to provide significant opportunities for our employees to develop their careers, as we anticipate adding nearly 17,000 new jobs between 2016 and 2017.","My appreciation and thanks goes out to the more than 115,000 Dollar General employees that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our customer with convenience, value and service every day.","With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the call for questions.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Thank you. Operator, we will go ahead and start with the first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.","Todd Vasos","Hi, Stephen.","Stephen Grambling","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, first, can you maybe quantify the potential impact from the recent minimum overtime ruling and how you can potentially mitigate that specifically?","Todd Vasos","We are still evaluating right now all the different options. As you can imagine, we've been working very, very diligently over the course of the last few months in anticipation of the regulation. And now that we have the actual regulation, we are actually refining that so that we can ensure that we, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, really take care of our employees, our customers and our shareholders alike.","But the one good thing that, you know, about Dollar General particularly, and retail in general, is that we have a lot of leverage our disposal, Stephen, to really take a look at how we can mitigate a lot of what may be an expense here to us.","But again, we're looking at it and we're going to do the exact right thing for our employees, customers and our shareholders. Stay tuned. We will give you more clarity as we get a little closer to December 1st.","Stephen Grambling","Okay. And then on the guidance, I know that you had said that the first quarter was supposed to be kind of the weakest growth rate of the year due to the comp comparison. Given the strong start to the year, should we be just assuming that it could be that much better in the back half, given the cost control? Thanks.","John Garratt","Well, I'll start by saying we're very pleased indeed with the Q1 results, as we delivered on all elements of the growth model. But bear in mind that growth model is a long-term model and what we are really focused on is putting the actions in place to drive that model for the long-term.","And we have a lot of great actions in place. We feel great about real estate. We are on track to open 900 units this year, and as Todd mentioned, over 50% full, the pipeline, to open 1,000 next year.","The great thing here is the economics are as compelling as ever. We continue to see our IRRs exceed our 20% target; continue to see a payback of less than two years, sales are indexing above expectations.","As we mentioned at our investor day, a lot of exciting things with sales comps in terms of product assortment, store format, operating initiatives. That will be fully - many of them will be fully implemented as we get into the back half of the year as you gain momentum.","And then in operating profit, as evidenced by the Q1 results, the team is very effectively managing all of the levers to deliver that 42 basis points of expansion, with growth in both gross margin and SG&A.","And the newest lever, zero-based budgeting, we are really seeing that start to contribute very rapidly and really become ingrained in the fabric in which we operate here.","And then lastly, we feel great about the amount of cash that this business continues to kick off, allowing us to reinvest in this low risk, high return new unit growth and the infrastructure to support it, while continuing to pay a competitive and over time, growing dividend, as well as consistent, robust share repurchases.","So, the model is working great, we think, as evidenced by the Q1 results and feel great about the long-term impact of this and the ability to continue improving it.","Stephen Grambling","That's all very helpful. If I can sneak one other, more specific one in there, can you just help us size the global sourcing opportunity that you referenced in gross margin? Maybe giving us a little bit of a sense for what that percentage is now, that\u2019s being sourced globally direct, and what kind of categories may be under penetrated? Thanks again.","Todd Vasos","When you look at it, Stephen, we still have a pretty large opportunity for our global sourcing efforts, and we've been working very diligently over the last many years. We just opened an office, a new office in mainland China. We continue to open satellite offices really all over the globe and the opportunity is still very big.","I could tell you that, when we started this journey 8 years ago to really look at exactly how much opportunity we had. We always weighted that, depending on also where the consumer was going.","And we still think that the consumer is looking for national brands, in a lot of cases, but also great value in our private brand offerings, which really goes toward that import piece.","So we think where we still have a tremendous opportunity and we're working that each and every day overseas, and we feel very, very good about that as we go into the rest of this year and then into the long haul here.","Stephen Grambling","Thanks again, best of luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.","Peter Keith","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just circling back on the overtime rule change question, I guess, if you are giving a pay increase across your store manager base, we would get some back of the envelope math of about $90 million.","I guess, just to size that up, is that where we are going to shake out or what specific moves would you be able to take to perhaps mitigate that impact as you look out to 2017?","Todd Vasos","Peter, that's a great question. As we look at it and we've done, as I indicated, many different scenarios. And I can tell you that none of those scenarios are even close to that $90 million; substantially less. And that\u2019s exactly what we're working on now, is to get that impact down even further, and looking at every lever that we have in our business to make sure we can lessen the impact.","But we think its much, much less than the number that you just indicated, and with a big opportunity to lower it even further. The great thing about this business, we have a lot of flexibility, as John indicated.","We're hitting on all of the elements of the growth model and we feel that - and in fact as we look out longer-term, we definitely have the ability to offset a lot of the pressure that this may put on that SG&A line.","Peter Keith","Okay. Very good. Thank you. And then maybe sticking on the SG&A topic, so the leverage was abnormally good in Q1. You mentioned you kind of came in below your 2.5% to 3% leverage target.","Were there some dynamics in Q1 that were abnormal or one-time in nature or are you perhaps going to see some continuation of this through the year?","John Garratt","Well, I'll start by saying we feel great about the progress of zero based budgeting thus far, and we're very pleased to be able to leverage SG&A 26 basis points at that completed, which, as you indicated, was even better than the 2.5% to 3% that we had indicated previously, which had come down from the previous 3.5% level.","With that said, there were some, there was some timing in there. There was some benefit from mild weather that helped, but you know, utilities. But all in all, we are off to a great start on zero-based budgeting. It's really taking hold. It's contributing very quickly.","And I'll say it is also really becoming ingrained in the fabric of how we operate. I see people at all levels of the organization now looking at everything they do through the lens of zero based budgeting and the filters we have talked about with the customer, our strategic priorities, risk management, and looking at things in terms of return on investment.","So, I'd characterize it by a very strong contribution from zero based budgeting. We feel good about our ability to continue to leverage at the rates we mentioned before going forward. And feel the team is well on its way to building a pipeline of future savings to sustain that. So we feel we are in a great spot on zero-based budgeting, as evidenced by the results.","Peter Keith","Okay, thanks a lot. And great execution on that.","John Garratt","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Wewer with Raymond James.","Todd Vasos","Hi, Dan.","Dan Wewer","Hi. Todd, how are you doing?","Todd Vasos","Good. Thanks.","Dan Wewer","During the past year, Dollar General has successfully reduced shrink. At the investor day, you had called that out as one of the potential sources of gross margin rate going forward.","But it sounds like shrink moved in the wrong direction in the first quarter and typically that's never just a one quarter event when you see that reversal in direction. Can you talk about what's changed with the shrink accrual?","Todd Vasos","Yes, so as you look at shrink, and I do want to say, over the long haul we feel good about where we're headed with shrink and all of the initiatives that we have in place to continue to reduce our shrink. And it is our number one gross margin opportunity.","In saying that, though, we did see a little bit of an up-tick in Q1. And the majority of it was really due to our on-shelf availability efforts, to be honest with you. And we like that trade-off right now. We're not happy with it. We're looking at ways to mitigate that exposure on shrink.","But what we felt that was even more compelling was to make sure that the customer, when they came in our store, had the product they needed on the shelf to purchase. And that was really the key driver.","But rest assured that our operating team and our merchant marketing teams are working very, very hard, along with supply chain to reduce that shrink number as we go forward.","We still have a lot of levers to pull, still putting a lot of defensive merchandising tools and other tools for our district managers and our store managers to be able to monitor shrink even closer to the actual event.","So we feel good that about the long-term, but still need to continue to work hard. And I dare to say that, in the years to come, we will always be talking about shrink, because that\u2019s just the nature of this business.","Dan Wewer","And just as a follow up, back at the investor day, the long-term growth algorithm had one scenario where same-store sales could be as strong as 4%. When you look at the timing of the market share initiatives revolving around the customer segmentation work, what is a realistic time frame from when the type of same-store sales growth could become visible, is that a 2017 or a 2018 time line?","Todd Vasos","Dan, when we looked and we put this algorithm together, we felt very confident over the long-term that we could stay within those guardrails of 2% to 4%. And the initiatives that are just now rolling out in 2016, the majority of them are just now starting to roll out and will continue to rollout in Q2 and into Q3 and start to come to fruition even greater in the end of Q3 and Q4.","And then, as I indicated, we're further along on our strategic planning right now than we've been in the last 8 years here. And that gives me great solace that, as we continue to move into 2017 and beyond, that there will be a very robust initiatives going forward to drive that top line.","So we are very confident in that 2% to 4%, and there will be ebb and flow in there. But we feel that we have all of the initiatives we need to make sure we deliver that.","Dan Wewer","Do you think that the current economic environment for your core customer is sufficient for Dollar General same-store sales to get in a 3.5% to 4% rate or does some macro improvement -- will that be needed to get to that kind of objective?","Todd Vasos","When you look at our core consumer today, she is always under pressure, as I indicated. Her income and her spending rates are usually under pressure. The great thing about our model is we do very well in either of those two scenarios.","Where she has a little bit more money, she spends a little bit more almost non-consumable goods. And when she doesn't have as much, she may pull back there but then utilizes us more on consumable and everyday staples that she knows she can get at an everyday low price.","And the great thing that just came out of this segmentation work, Dan, that we're really encouraged about is this millennial shopper that is already making up about 24% of our sales line. And as we continue to learn more about her over time and be able to service her better, we again feel confident on that sales line and be able to deliver that as we move forward.","Dan Wewer","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Todd Vasos","Hello, Mike.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It was mentioned that the weather provided a benefit to the expense line during the quarter. Do you think that the weather provided a benefit to the sales line as well, maybe you could just talk about the flow of the quarter, given all the noise and volatility that we have heard out there?","Todd Vasos","The cadence of the quarter really worked exactly like we thought it was going to work, with the shift of Easter into the second period, March, out of the third, which is April last year, obviously March was a better months than April.","And - but when you looked at February, March and April combined, the cadence was exactly the way we had anticipated it coming into the fiscal year. So, while there is always weather and different phenomenon\u2019s that happen, we've got a lot of great initiatives here to continue to try to ensure that we capitalize on whatever those phenomenon\u2019s are, and we felt that we did a pretty good job here in Q1.","Michael Lasser","And Todd, as my follow-up, Walmart talked about the beginning to implement its price investments, and that is going to accelerate over the courses of the year. So, what have you seen in the marketplace as far as pricing and promotions and how are you prepared to respond?","Todd Vasos","As we look at pricing overall, macro, so taking into account mass, grocery, and drug, we see still a very rational pricing that is happening in the marketplace today. In saying that, there's always retailers that at times will try different things.","But the one great thing about our robust pricing model that we have here, we check prices every two weeks on our top items, and we also every quarter check it on the full book. So we know exactly where we stand and we today feel very confident in where we sit on pricing.","And if we see folks moving, you will see us move, because this is all about ensuring that we continue to drive units out of our stores and of course drive traffic into our stores. So, anywhere that we may see where we need to be sharper on price, we'll take action.","The great thing about Dollar General is, again, we've got the levers to enable us to do that. And so, when we look at this, we also look at it from the standpoint that our vendors help us a lot as well.","We are in the top 10 of all CPG companies out there and quite frankly, we are in the top five of the majority of them. And that gives us a great partnership with our vendor community, that enables us to ensure we are right-priced anytime we need to be.","Michael Lasser","Just to clarify that thought, does that mean you haven't seen any major changes? And if you do, you think you'll get support to match those changes from the vendor community?","Todd Vasos","I didn't say we didn't see anything, but I did say that we will continue to take appropriate action when we do see it. And rest assured we have and will continue to do that if we see any retailer moving on price that we feel that our consumer - because she looks to us to be a leader there as well, and we will make sure we do everything we have to do to keep units moving through the box.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Good luck.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Todd Vasos","Hi, Dan.","Dan Binder","Thank you. Dan Binder. I had a couple questions on, first, on the labor investment that you've been making all through last year. Is that - do you feel like you're getting that payback in comps across all of the different phases that you rolled out last year?","And is there any more color you can put on how that comp differential looks versus the rest of the base? And then lastly, if there are more stores identified to get that labor investment?","Todd Vasos","Yes, Dan, you know, we watch this very closely, and as you know Dollar General pretty well, we don't do anything that doesn't have a return attached to it. And we don't just shelve it after we roll it out; we really monitor and watch.","So, what I can tell you is that we are very pleased on all levels, from our price, excuse me, our labor investments into these stores. Now, over the time, we have over the course of the last few months, we've taken some stores off of that and we've added additional new stores onto it, depending on those returns, and we will continue to do that.","So we will always continue to add new stores if we see the need and the benefit that will be there. But we also will take stores off if we see that the benefit is not meeting or exceeding our expectations or they don't need it any longer for whatever other reason. But, we're continuing to really like what we see here, and looking at ways we can continue to expand that as we go forward.","Dan Binder","And just one other question. On the small formats, as you look out to markets that can support it, what do you think the small format opportunity looks like longer-term? And when you look at your broader store expansion plan, how many markets do you look at as effectively one store markets, where there would be room for essentially Dollar General and nobody else, given the size?","Todd Vasos","This is really new for us, still. We've got 45 stores up and running. We've got approximately 80 planned in total to be open by the end of the fiscal year. And so, as you can imagine, we are out looking now on - as we are very happy with what we see so far, is where those next stores will be as we go into 2017 and beyond.","But again, because of the nature of it, one being in these more metropolitan type areas, and then secondly in these very rural areas, we got our arms around pretty close to about how big that is. We are not really going to say exactly how big it is, because what we're doing is making sure that we can refine the model appropriately with, again, only 45 open, but we've got a good idea.","The important thing here is we are concentrating a lot, though, in those rural areas where there is only room for one store. And that\u2019s why you see us moving very quickly in a lot of cases, with our growth of 900 stores this year and up to 1,000 next year.","And a lot of those areas are in these towns or even crossroads that can only support one retailer, and I sure would rather it be Dollar General, and that's how we are going about this. So, we're moving pretty quickly there and feel good about where the pipeline is for 2017 already.","Dan Binder","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ed Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Ed Kelly","Hi. Hello, everyone. So I just have a follow-up for you on the [Technical Difficulty]. And I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, how do we think about comp leverage at the end of the year? And do you think you will be able to achieve 2.5% to 3% target despite this or should we plan for some temporary pressure as we think about our model?","Mary Winn Pilkington","Ed, we had - it's Mary Winn, we had a real hard time understanding your question. Do you mind repeating that?","Ed Kelly","Yes, sorry about that. I'm sitting in an airport.","Mary Winn Pilkington","Much better, thank you.","Ed Kelly","Okay, good. I just had a follow-up question on the wage pressure. My question is, as this headwind grows at the end of the year, how do we think about your ability to achieve the 2.5% to 3% leverage point?","Is that something that you think you're going to be able to manage through as we look at next year or as we think about our models, should we be planning on some type of temporary pressure even though it's not usually material?","John Garratt","Yes, what I would say is that, in terms of the FLSA, that\u2019s new breaking news, but conversely, we had the tax benefit that wasn't contemplated when we spoke with you last. So we continually have puts and takes.","And I would point back to the number of levers we have to - and the track record we have of successfully managing through and mitigating the various puts and takes as we move through.","Ed Kelly","Okay. And then just maybe one quick follow-up for you, can you maybe give us a little insight in terms of what you think you are seeing from the consumer at this point?","We've seen out of Walmart that the big box stock up trip seems to be okay, but others have complained about fill-in. Just your general thoughts about what you are seeing out there today in your business from a traffic standpoint?","Todd Vasos","Yes, when you look at it, the consumer is probably about the same as they were coming out of Q4, to be honest with you. We're seeing about the same trends. There is no doubt that she is still watching what she spends, but again, that is the nature of our core consumer.","And she is always looking for the ability to make sure she can deliver to her family at the lowest price. And so, that\u2019s what we're concentrated on mainly, is to ensure that we have got the right item at the right price at the right time for her, and we've been delivering that.","But, the consumer right now, overall, I would tell you back to work for the most part; probably feeling a little bit more confident; but - and spending a little bit more on her non-consumables and we're still seeing our non-consumable growth, but still being cautious.","So, we look at that as an opportunity for us, especially for fill-in, because if she is cautious, that stock-up trip is not always in her eyesight, if you will, and at times she may be a little bit more reticent to stock up and a little bit freer to fill in. And again, with our offering and our prices, we offer a compelling reason to come to Dollar General when she does that.","Ed Kelly","Great. Thank you.","Todd Vasos","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vinny Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.","Todd Vasos","Hello.","Vinny Sinisi","Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions and congratulations on a nice quarter.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Vinny Sinisi","I wanted to go through the zero-based budgeting. You guys mentioned that you are certainly starting to see some nice traction so far. Could you give us all maybe just a little bit more color in terms of kind of the bigger learning\u2019s thus far, where the opportunities have come from?","Then I think, John, you mentioned seeing more opportunities going forward, if you can give us a little more sense around that.","John Garratt","Sure. I think one of the biggest learning\u2019s is just the additive effect it has as people really embrace this mentality. I think we had everybody very thoughtfully looking at everything they do. They are spending through those filters: of the customer, of the strategic priorities, of risk mitigation.","It really focuses our efforts and focuses - and our resources towards the highest returning, mission-critical activities. There is a lot of power to that and it really has a compounding effect.","In addition, we have teams. We have 23 different cost packages teams, with senior level folks on the teams, cross functional engagement, interaction. And we have a pretty rigorous routine now: monthly meetings with the senior leadership team, where we go deep and wide through all the costs. And with that increased learning, with that sharing across the company, it really drives best practices that feeds on itself.","And we're going after cost in process improvement. We're going after cost in efficiencies. We are going after cost in just good old-fashioned prioritization of spending, working very closely with procurement to go deeper and wider on those activities.","So, it really cuts across the entire P&L. It really is the power of the teams working together to uncover, but we've always had good cost management here and it's been a strength of ours.","But with this zero based budgeting, it really allows us to go that layer deeper, to get those costs out of the baseline that are hard to wring out and really drive an ownership type of mentality. Where it is not a use it or lose it budget that rolls over, but really, everything has to pay for itself.","Vinny Sinisi","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just one quick follow-up. You've mentioned quite a bit about different category expansions, including the private label testing, some more perishables.","How should we think about, like, is there anything notable in terms of an overall assortment standpoint, in terms of some of these new things that are going in? Is anything notable coming out, how you are shifting the shelves around, anything to call out there?","Todd Vasos","When we - the nice thing about Dollar General and our category management system that we put together years ago, we have a very robust category management process that looks at, each year, every single category, and then every item, with only 10,000 SKUs, it's a little easier, every item within those categories.","And we adjust, each and every year, depending on where the consumer is going, whether it is her economic condition or her attitude and how she feels about her economic condition, we are able to move left and right, if you will.","Now, in saying that, at times we do reduce items inside of our store and reduce square footage on some categories and increase others. So this time - this year, we've really worked hard to increase our perishables, our health and beauty areas, our party and stationery areas. And in many cases, a lot of the reductions were coming out of a mix of both consumable and non-consumable areas.","I think I gave an example before, but right now the - a lot of the dry cereal business is in a secular decline. So, what we do there is we reduce some square footage, so we can increase square footage of other dry grocery areas.","So, we are very attuned to what is happening in the marketplace, and the great thing about us is we are very nimble and we are able to take advantage of that very quickly.","Vinny Sinisi","Okay, that's helpful. Best of luck going forward.","Todd Vasos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi.","Alvin Concepcion","Hey, good morning. Congrats on a great way to start the year. I am wondering if you could talk about second-quarter same-store sales trends to date. It sounds like there was a lot of noise in April with Easter shift and weather. So I am wondering if we can get a sense of how things are currently looking.","And related to that, I think you previously expressed confidence that you could accelerate comps to the 3% range for the year, is that still your view?","Todd Vasos","Again, when you look at it, the quarter ended up exactly the way we thought it would from a shape perspective, exactly the way we planned it. And again, we really feel confident long-term, and we look at this long-term, that in fact we have the initiatives in place and we have the strategic planning already moving forward to ensure that we can keep those comps moving, as we go through this year and in the years to come. So again, we're confident in that 2% to 4%, that guardrail that we put up, and we want to just continue to move through that.","Alvin Concepcion","Very good. And unrelated to this, I am wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the produce test in the 160 locations; just some more color on the strategy there. Wonder if you get a sense of the price points relative to discounters or even conventional grocery.","And if you could, what kind of margin profile did you construct for that, relative to the overall consumables category?","Todd Vasos","So, when we look at it, keep in mind today we've got fresh fruits and vegetables in about 160 of our market stores today. And so, we've been in this business for a while. We understand it. We know what the sales and margin levers look like there.","In these stores that we are talking about, these 160 or so and we internally call them Dollar General Plus stores, because they have a larger expansion on coolers, on perishables already, but now the introduction of fresh fruits and vegetables will be a nice addition.","But keep in mind, this will be just limited amount of SKUs. So this will not be like a market store, where we have a lot of different SKUs. This will be a core 10, 12 item type of an arrangement right now, where some of the basics, right, apples, bananas, oranges, onions, tomatoes, those type of things. But really what [Technical Difficulty] to do is address what that consumer is looking for. They are looking for fresh opportunities.","And for us, to be able to give her that at a very convenient time in her shop, and again, we are very convenient-based, we think it's the right thing. And we are able to leverage our market stores and the cost profile we have from those stores into these.","So we feel good about where our costs will be, retailers will be, and what our profitability will be on that. It will be a small piece of the business, though. This is not meant to be a big driver of sales, but it is meant to be a driver of traffic.","Alvin Concepcion","Got it. Thank you very much.","Mary Winn Pilkington","We've hit the top of the hour, so I think we are going to end the call now. But thank you very much for your interest in Dollar General. Both Matt and I will be around to handle any calls. So please, look forward to speaking to you soon. And thank you for your interest.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
