My name is Shelby, and I'll be your operator for today's call. I'd like to remind everyone that all participants all lines have been placed on listen only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. John Turner, our Chief Executive Officer, will provide highlights of our financial performance; and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through an overview of the quarter.","A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and earning supplement are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","Our forward-looking statements disclosure and non-GAAP reconciliations are included in the appendix of today's presentation and within our SEC filings. These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of today's call.","With that, I will now turn the call over to John.","John Turner","Thank you, Dana. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying that we are pleased with our second quarter results. Our performance clearly demonstrates that we are continuing to successfully execute our strategic plans, building long-term sustainable growth while delivering value to our customers, communities and shareholders. Our reported earnings from continuing operations of $362 million reflected an increase of 21% compared to the second quarter of the prior year. Importantly, we delivered solid revenue growth while maintaining a focus on disciplined expense management.","Of note, adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income increased to highest level in 10 years. In addition, this marks another very strong quarter with respect to asset quality, as virtually every credit metric improved. In terms of the overall environment, we remained encouraged by improving economic conditions as well as continued improvement in customer sentiment. We remain focused on generating prudent and softer loan growth, while also meeting the evolving expectations of our customers.","Once again, we are proud of our robust capital planning process. Our plan of capital actions received no objection in the recent CCAR results, and we're set to deliver a robust return of capital to our shareholders, while maintaining appropriate levels to meet customer needs and support organic growth. With respect to our business strategy, we are committed to the diligent execution of our plan and are making notable progress with respect to our Simplify and Grow strategic initiative, while much has been accomplished, the process is ongoing, and we currently have approximately 40 initiatives underway, ended accelerating revenue growth, driving operational efficiencies, expanding use of technology and ultimately further improving the customer experience.","Through this continuous improvement process, we aim to deliver consistent and reliable results over the long-term. For a while now, we've been speaking about four key strengths we believe to provide considerable momentum for Regions. First is our asset sensitivity and finding advantage, driven by our low cost and lower deposit base. This provides significant franchise value and a competitive advantage, particularly in a rising rate environment. Second relates to asset quality. We experienced another quarter of broad-based improvements in credit quality and continue to expect modest improvement throughout the remainder of the year.","Further, we believe the de-risking and portfolio shaping activities we have completed, combined with our sound risk management practices that positioned us well for the next credit cycle. Third, our capital position supports additional capital returns as we move towards our target Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. The execution of which was again validated through the recent CCAR process. And finally, we expect additional improvements in core performance overtime through our Simplify and Grow strategic initiative, which is well underway as evidenced by our actions today.","As we look ahead, Regions is well positioned and we're building momentum every day. We have clear plans and a strong team, and our focus on effectively executing our plans while adapting to the ever changing environment remaining steadfast. We do not anticipate major changes to the Company's strategic direction. Going forward, we will build on the solid foundation already established, delivering consistent and reliable financial results, and creating a culture of continues improvement our priorities. Providing best in class customer service and unwavering commitment to our associates and communities will not change.","Grayson Hall led the Company through one of the most challenging periods in our industry's history. His leadership and commitment has positioned the Company well for the future. On behalf of our associates, we thank Grayson for his 38 years of dedicated service, and I personally want to thank him for his guidance, counsel and support.","With that, I'll now turn it over to David.","David Turner","Thank you, John, and good morning. Let's begin with average loans. Adjusted average loan balances increased $382 million over the prior quarter, driven by modest growth in both the consumer and business portfolios. Growth in the consumer portfolio was driven primarily by our expanded point of sale partnerships as well as residential mortgage and indirect vehicle lending. Average loan growth in the business lending portfolio was again driven by C&I lending, primarily from our specialized lending areas.","Consumer lending should continue to produce consistent loan growth across most categories, and C&I should continue to lead growth within business lending. Headwinds associated with previous de-risking efforts in our investor real estate portfolio have slowed, and as a result, we have begun to see a loan growth on an ending basis largely in our term real estate product.","Let's move onto deposits. We continue to execute a deliberate strategy to optimize our deposit base by focusing on valuable, low cost consumer, and business services relationship deposits while reducing certain higher cost brokered and collateralized deposits. As a result, total average deposits declined modestly during the quarter; however, average consumer segment deposits experienced solid growth of over $1 billion consistent with our relationship banking focus.","Our deposit advantage has generated from our granular and loyal deposit base. During the second quarter, interest-bearing deposit cost totaled 38 basis points by total funding cost remain low at 52 basis points illustrating the strength of our deposit franchise. Cumulative deposit betas through the current rising rate cycle are only 14%, and importantly, consumer retail deposit betas remained low at approximately 1%. As expected, commercial deposits have been more reactive with a cumulative beta of approximately 44%, driven primarily by large corporate and brokered deposits.","We believe our large retail deposit franchise differentiates us in the marketplace. As such, we are in a position to maintain a lower deposit beta relative to peers. Our customer base is also highly engaged with over 55% of consumer checking customers utilizing multiple channels and more than 75% of all interactions are now digital. The number of active mobile banking customers has increased 12% compared to the prior year, and active mobile deposit customers has more than doubled. We continue to focus on being our customers' primary bank as 93% of our consumer checking households include a high-quality primary checking account.","So, now let's look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income increased 2% over the prior quarter and net interest margin increased 3 basis points to 3.49%. These increases were driven primarily by higher market interest rates and prudent deposit cost management. With respect to full year 2018, the current market expectation for the fed to continue increasing rates combined with better than forecasted deposit pricing will likely push NII towards the upper end of our 4% to 6% guidance on a non-fully taxable equivalent basis.","Specific to the third quarter of 2018, current market expectations for our rate increase in September along with similar deposit betas to what we have experienced in recent quarters are expected to result in another solid quarter of growth in net interest income along with modest net interest margin expansion. Remember, the third quarter will have one additional day that will benefit net interest income, but reduced net interest margin. We also experienced a good quarter as it relates to fee revenue.","Adjusted non-interest income increased 2% with growth across most non-interest revenue categories during the quarter. Keep in mind, the first quarter benefited from net gains associated with the sale of certain low income housing investments, and a positive valuation adjustment associated with a private equity investment totaling $13 million that did not repeat this quarter. These gains were included in other non-interest income.","With respect to corporate fee revenue categories, the Company's investments in capital markets continue to pay off as a business delivered another record quarter. Revenues totaled $57 million with all businesses within capital markets contributing. The second quarter increase was led by merger and acquisition advisory services and the customer derivative activity. Consumer categories remain an important component of fee revenue.","To that point, service charges and card and ATM fees grew by 2% and 8% respectively. This growth has been aided by year-to-date checking account growth of approximately 1.2%. In addition, revenue growth was supported by an increase in debit transactions of 9% and an increase in credit card spending of 10% during the second quarter. Mortgage income remained stable during the quarter despite seasonally higher production due primarily to a 25 basis point reduction in gain on sale. While production is lower across the industry, we continue to expect better performance relative to peers due to our historically higher mix of purchase versus refinance volume.","We continue to evaluate opportunities to grow our residential mortgage servicing portfolio, and during the quarter, we reached an agreement to purchase the rights to service approximately $3.6 billion of mortgage loans, with an expected close date of July 31, 2018, and it's subject to customary closing conditions. Increasing servicing income is expected to help offset the impact of lower mortgage production. Wealth management income was up modestly in the quarter driven by 12% increase in investment services fee income.","Let's move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expense increased approximately 2%, attributable primarily to increases in professional fees and expenses associated with Visa Class B shares sold in the prior year. Excluding the impact of severance charges, salaries and benefits decreased approximately to 1%, reflecting staffing reductions and lower payroll taxes, partially offset by annual merit increases.","As a result of our efforts to rationalize and streamline our organization, staffing levels declined by 340 full-time equivalent positions compared to the prior quarter and approximately 1,100 full-time equivalent positions compared to the second quarter of the prior year. Year-to-date, full-time equivalent positions have declined by approximately 700 positions. Further salaries and benefits expense reductions are expected in the third and fourth quarters as approximately 500 additional position reductions will benefit the run rate. Keep in mind, these numbers do not include the 644 position reductions associated with Regions insurance.","In addition, we continue to take a hard look at occupancy expense and will exit approximately 500,000 square feet this year benefiting 2019 and beyond. This amount does not include another 200,000 square feet of reductions associated with Regions insurance. The adjusted efficiency ratio was 60.4% down slightly from the prior quarter, and through the first six months of 2018, the Company has generated 2.7% of adjusted positive operating leverage. For full year 2018, we continue to expect adjusted positive operating leverage of 3% to 5%, relatively stable adjusted expenses and adjusted efficiency ratio of less than 60%.","Let's shift to asset quality. Broad-based asset quality improvement continued during the quarter. Non-performing, criticized and troubled debt restructured loans, as well as total delinquencies all declined. Non-performing loan excluding loans held for sale decreased to 0.74% of loans outstanding, the lowest level since 2007. Net charge-offs totaled 32 basis points of average loans and 8 basis point decline from the prior quarters adjusted ratio. The provision for loan losses approximated net charge-offs during the quarter and included the release of our remaining hurricane specific loan loss allowance of $10 million. The allowance for loan losses totaled 1.4% of total loans outstanding and 141% of total non-accrual loans.","Let me give you some brief comments related to capital and liquidity. As John mentioned, we are pleased with our CCAR results and remain committed to maintaining prudent capital ratios while possibly investing in our businesses for future growth and delivering a solid return of capital to our shareholders. On July 2nd, we completed the sale of our Regions interest subsidiary, the after-tax gain associated with the transaction was approximately $200 million and Common Equity Tier 1 capital generated was approximately $300 million.","Our capital plan incorporates the capital generated from this transaction, and it is included in our board authorized share repurchase program for up to $2.03 billion in common shares over the next four quarters. Subject to our board's approval, the plan also includes a 56% increase in Region's quarterly common stock dividend to $0.14 per share beginning in the third quarter. Regarding 2018 expectations, our full-year expectations remain unchanged and are summarized again on this slide for your reference.","So in conclusion, we are pleased with our second quarter results and believe our Simplify and Grow strategic initiative along with other opportunities and competitive advantages position us well for the remainder of 2018 and beyond.","With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I'll turn it back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, David. As it relates to Q&A, please limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. We will now open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","On the loan growth front, I want to see if you can give us a bit more color on the, where you see shift of the drivers of loan growth through the back half coming from, and your full-year outlook of low single-digits and it seems like at this point you might be trending at the lower end of that. Do you see it that way? Or do you think you can break to the upside a little bit through the back half?","John Turner","Well, I would say first of all, we are affirming our current guidance for low single-digit loan growth excluding the run off this targeted and indirect portfolio and the TDR sales obviously. By focus on the consumer side of the business, we feel pretty good about our forecast and we look at mortgage, we expect it generally to be flat. I think we see raw in the HELOC portfolio and the balance of our consumer business should grow modestly, we believe across most of the sectors and the remaining part of the year.","On the corporate side of the business, our pipelines are good. They have improved since the first quarter and they continue to be pretty solid. Our customers are optimistic, but I would say there is still a bit cautious. We're seeing customers use a lot of their liquidity to fund their additional borrowing needs or what would have traditionally been additional borrowing needs and you can see that in some of our deposit balances. But generally if you think about our business in the three segments that we think about them, the corporate banking business, I think will grow modestly through the balance of the year largely as a result of activity within our specialized industries group and more narrow targeted focus by our diversified industry's bankers, and we've seen both of those teams have some success in the first part of the year.","In the traditional middle market commercial banking and small business banking, we have renewed focus there that we are beginning to see really get some traction. Owner-occupied real estate which have been running off at a pretty rapid rate through I guess over the last 10 years has really begun to slow and that will help us, we believe see some additional loan growth through the balance of the year. And then finally in real estate, we had indicated we thought in the second quarter we would begin to see some modest growth.","You remember that we have been de-risking that portfolio exiting many of the multifamily construction when loans that we have in the books and that has been successful I think, term lending was very competitive, it has begun to have a positive impact on our portfolio. So, we saw some nice loan growth at the end of the quarter and in real estate banking, and so all-in-all, I think our guidance is solid. I would not say that at this point we guide towards the upper end of range, I think it would be lower end to the middle of the range. But we do believe that, we will achieve those objectives, and if, we do we will meet all of our other targets as a result to that.","John Pancari","Then in terms of your margins, I saw some pretty good expansion again this quarter and probably would have even been higher, it\u2019s not for the leverage lease transaction. But just wondering are the impairment that is, I want to get your updated thoughts on the sensitivity to the ongoing fed moves, but also rising betas? What's your updated sensitivity to each incremental 25 basis point that hike?","David Turner","I think John, so our -- this is David. Our expectation for the year is -- our beta thus far is 14% as I mentioned earlier. We do think that picks up with the back half of the year, but if we look at 2018, we think the beta in 30% ranges is what's baked into the guidance that we've given you. Thus far, we've outperformed our expectation on beta, and rates have come in faster than we had anticipated as well. And so, we are reiterating our guidance on net interest income growth this year to the higher end of that 4% to 6% range, we think we can get the higher end of that. As it relates to next quarter, we think will have another solid quarter of growth in NII, and we think our margin will grew modestly because it has overcome about two points of for the next quarter. So, I think that we feel very good about our expectations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust.","Jennifer Demba","Just wondering, if could clarify what you're M&A interest and capacity is at this point?","John Turner","Sure. We have an M&A team they are charged with finding both bank and non-bank opportunities, and we've had some success acquiring non-bank businesses, mortgage servicing rights and other loan portfolios in fact we point to BlackArch Partners and that investment is being a real half point in the quarter in terms of their contribution. And we will continue to look for those kinds of opportunities because non-bank opportunities help us fill gaps and our capabilities meet customer needs and importantly row and diversify revenue.","Bank M&A is a good bit more challenging, and we think about where Regions trades relative to our peers, we are trading relative to targets I would say, likely targets. We are trading at a discount, and as a result, the economics just don\u2019t work for us. We look at our plans and our opportunities and we think they're significant. We benefit from rising rates. We have a good plan to return capital to our shareholders which should generate outsize returns. We think through our Simplify and Grow initiatives that there is a real opportunity to improve our core business.","And so, we're just not going to do a transaction that would be significantly dilutive to our shareholders and in this environment. Let\u2019s not say that we\u2019re not going to continue to look, we will do that. We learn as we do. We\u2019re going to be very conservative, very thoughtful. We will seek to build relationships with potential sellers. We will watch the market, but we\u2019re going to be very disciplined in that regard, principally because again, we have the opportunity we think to take advantage of a number of other levers that will drive outsized returns for shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","In terms of the balance sheet mix, you haven\u2019t had a lot of earning asset growth, which is allowed you to be I think in part so disciplined on the deposit side. How much more shrinkage do you think you could see in terms of the interest-bearing -- sorry, the non-interest-bearing deposit side? And at what point do you think that you might have to just go out into the market and just to keep up, with hopefully is -- now a better trajectory on loan growth side?","David Turner","Again, this is David. So you mentioned us being disciplined on pricing on the deposit side, but I would tell you, we've been very disciplined on the left side of the balance sheet. We want to grow loans. We did grow loans this quarter, but we\u2019re going to remain very disciplined, making sure that when we layout capital to our customers to serve their needs that we paid and we have an appropriate return on capital that we put out. We have a low loan to deposit ratio relative to our peers. And staying disciplined unless on the left side of the balance sheet, let\u2019s us be even more discipline on the right side.","You are correct to see that not interest-bearing deposits have been put work, a lot of that has been on the corporate banking side where corporate banking customers are looking for alternatives to generate yield. Some of that's gone into interest-bearing accounts with that. Some of that's been utilized as John mentioned earlier to fund capital expenditures and put the excess cash to work, and but at some point we believe, those actions will dissipate and we'll be to grow loans. We are constantly looking for relationship deposits, whether it'd be on the consumer side of the business service side. That will always be important to us. But we don't see any need in the near-term to have to go out and bid up deposits from a cost standpoint.","That being said, we do have promotions like others do and we will look at opportunities to strengthen the market, leveraging that, but wholesale changes in our deposit structure is not in the order at this point.","John Turner","Yes, I will just make another maybe two points, Ken. One is, if you look at growth in consumer deposits, we grew demand deposits in the consumer business by 6.4% year-over-year and continue to see good growth in checking accounts and household. And so, we believe that we will see nice steady growth on -- in consumer deposits. The second thing I would say is. We are again reiterating our guidance for low single-digit deposit growth through the -- end the year. And so, we do expect that will continue to grow deposits and finish the year with little growth.","Operator","Next question comes from Steve Moss of B. Riley FBR.","Steve Moss","On the commercial real estate growth, here, I was just wondering we\u2019ve heard more comments around competition and tighter spreads. Wondering, what you guys are seeing as relates to that? And what types of properties are driving growth?","John Turner","Yes, so a great question. We are seeing a lot of competition particularly in that term lending product. Spreads have compressed 50 basis points or more since to the beginning of year. We've had to be very selective in seeking out opportunities in the space. The growth we've had, though modest, has been in multifamily and office primarily where think we have a good expertise. This audience that -- we have been managing that portfolio very actively for quite some time and today it represents about 7% of our total loan portfolio down from, at one-time bar in the 30% range back during the crises.","So, we believe it's a business that we can and will continue to grow modestly and provide really nice fee income opportunities for us, and you see that in our capital markets business and improving. Also presents an opportunity for us to grow deposits as we begin to develop more relationships with the owner operator customer who is the term lending customer. So we will grow it modestly, but carefully and again manage it I think very judiciously.","Steve Moss","And then on the securities portfolio here, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on the balances going forward as the yield curve has narrowed? And what are your thoughts, if they convert in the next couple of quarters?","David Turner","Yes, so in terms of the level of securities or the percentage for earnings assets, we don\u2019t anticipate any significant change there. If we do get some liquidity, LCR relief, we may change out some Fannie Mae securities and put them to work more effectively. But right now, we think that we just continuing to manage the book like we are with the same duration. We have a lift coming from fixed price lending and our securities book, even if rates stay flat to where they are right now as we re-rate some $12 to $14 billion worth of assets over a given year. So an inversion that you spoke, we think would be more central bank driven than a precursor to a downturn. And even with that and if rates have shifted up and re-pricing comes through, we still have a very significant tailwind in help us to continue to growing NII.","Operator","Your next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS.","Saul Martinez","I wanted to ask about loan yield. Your C&I yield obviously picked up with the higher rates, but significantly less I think than a lot of other banks who benefited from this blowing out of LIBOR relative to the fed funds rate and maybe the leverage lease trend right down had maybe on the margin something to do with it. But I'm curious, why you're not seeing a bit more of a yield pickup as some of your yield or some of your competitors have? And does it have to do with hedging strategy? Does it have to do with the structure? But it's been over the last few quarters about 10 bps sequential with every rate hike. So I'm curious, why if there is something there that is different about your C&I growth or how you manage through the portfolio?","John Turner","I'll take a shot and maybe David can follow. Typically when our C&I business has been very much of the relationship oriented business going back a very long time is generally built around our core markets Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee where we have very long and deep relationships. We enjoy a significant demand deposits associated with those relationships in that business, and while we don't -- as we look at our peers typically don't get the same yield on the loan side of our business.","We enjoy we think a greater demand deposits and so we view it from a relationship perspective. We think that there's a fair trade-off there that\u2019s part of it. Another part of it is that we have been seeking to grow both our government and institutional banking business, which is a little more competitive, and yields are narrower, and separately, we've been working hard to stem the tide runoff in our owner-occupied real estate portfolio. And so, deals there have been compressed a bit to.","David Turner","I'll add other thing and really you got to look at the whole relationship first, taking apart loan side versus deposits. But we didn't have the leverage lease impairment $5 million you pointed out, that's about three basis points of that change too. So that\u2019s other piece of this.","Saul Martinez","Yes, it's just kind of hard to triangulate though, if some of your peers having 30 bps to 30 plus bps, yield pickup sequentially pointing to the higher LIBOR, and you guys have been pretty consistent at 10 basis points for quarter when you have a rate hike. So, everything you said make sense, but I want to know if there is anything -- it has anything to do with how you -- because hedging strategy and structure of the loan because it seems like there's a bit of a disconnect versus what we've seen some of the other banks reported.","John Turner","So, you got to look at mix, you have to look at everybody's hedging strategy. But if you look at our assets sensitivity, 25% of its on the short-term, 25% of its on the middle term and 50s on the long end. So that will have a little bit of the dampening impact in terms of rate increases that move up. And so, I think that it's really hard to compare peers to peer. There are a lot puts and takes on it.","Saul Martinez","If I could just get in a quick one, the indirect other consumer obviously growing pretty, pretty well the green sky. But where do you think -- can you remind us, where you think that book can grow to in terms of absolute size over the next year or two?","John Turner","So, we do have limits in terms of how much we want, our indirect other get to. Right now, our indirect other consumer about a 7 billion, we\u2019re looking at that number to be in that $2 billion range. So, some growth there, but not a extraordinary growth.","Saul Martinez","2 billion by year end.","John Turner","I would say overtime, yes.","Operator","Next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Maybe following up on the earlier discussion on M&A. Can you kind of outline both on the non-banks side and the banks side either from a product point of view or geography points of view, other areas where if the prices rise and the economics will rise you be particularly interested from a strategic perspective?","David Turner","With respect to non-bank, I think our focus has been on, as I said earlier, adding capabilities so whether it'd be in capital markets or in wealth management as an example, adding products capabilities that help us fill gaps to meet customer needs. We've been acquiring loan portfolios, mortgage servicing rights, and those things and we'll continue to do. We have capacity within our mortgage servicing operation. I think we do that well and so we will continue to likely add to that portfolio.","On the bank side, typically our interest is going to be in footprint. We talk about size and I think that ranges, but our conversations have been in the $3 billion to $15 billion kind of range. We're not interested, as I said earlier, and doing the transaction that would be a significantly dilutive intangible book value and earned backs are important to us. I hope that gives you a little bit of perspective.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then, a quick one on the CCAR, it looks from the CCAR results like there is some preferred issuance baked into the ask, as I think there was last year as well. Could you discuss a little bit what those you confirm that's the case? And then discus the circumstances when you'd be expecting to issue preferred?","David Turner","So, Geoffrey, originally, we had a preferred issuance build in, but that was in 2019. We do need to continue to watch changes regulatory changes with regards to the SAB in terms of how that might impact our capital ratios, in terms of will it have us, have more common and therefore negate the need to have preferred stock overtime. There is more to come there, but we want to make sure that so we have an appropriate amount of capital Tier 1 and Common Equity Tier 1. Our focus right now in the short term has been to get our common equity down to our 9.5% target range, and as we do that, we need to make sure we backfill appropriately for Tier 1. And if we don't get relief through the SAB, then we'll a preferred issuance in their right now baked in '19.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","I was wondering if you can talk about the kind of relationship of provision expense to charge offs, look at the next few quarter obviously this quarter, I was very close to matching after a couple of quarters of released, but with loans starting to grow again here. I'm wondering if you give some color on that.","Barbara Godin","Yes, I think you will continue to see a match provision to charge off and there could be a slight build relative to the loan growth as one would expect.","David Turner","Okay, and in terms of the loans that you are adding now, say the indirect consumer which is in that bag, but the growth that you are getting their in terms of some of the other portfolios. Are they given the lost content of what's being added as higher than what's lending off? Or is it still some kind of underlying de-risking, I would say whole back we runs off of things like that?","Barbara Godin","I think we're going to see some modest improvement in our numbers across all of our portfolios over the balance of the year, definitely, and what we are putting on the is that very high quality, very happy with it. What we're seeing with those loans is in fact they are performing very well and we would expect them to continue to perform well, including better than those that are paying off.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","I knew that there is -- you've mentioned briefly some, what trajectory is Simplify and Grow is. But maybe can you give us a little bit of color to the kinds of actions that have been taken pass quarter or so? And how you expect the operating leverage trajectory to shift from here, as at the run rate that we been seeing over the last year or so? Or do you feel that we\u2019re moving into a peer where there could be a little bit more acceleration in that trajectory?","David Turner","John Owen is leading that work. I asked him to answer your question and you maybe David could follow on as well.","John Owen","Good morning everyone. We\u2019re making good progress on Simplify and Grow initiative is. We said earlier we got about 40 initiatives that are underway. We started this about seven months ago and I think we're off to a really good start. Let me give you a couple of examples of products we have underway. I think that might provide some color and background. First, let focus on to be our consumer lending space, we got a team working on how we take all of our consumer lending categories and make them fully 100% digital, meaning a customer can come in and start a digital channel whether it's a mobile device, iPad or laptop, start there and face that loan complete digital.","We\u2019re going to do that for all consumer loan categories for well down the road in that process. I will tell you by the end of 2018, we will have the majority of that work done. There will be something we will spill over into 2019, but example of some of the changes we've made, I take the mortgage application process. If we reengineered that process, we\u2019re going through second half about half of the day requirements for the application. That's taking the application time, down from over 15 minutes under 5 minutes. The other thing seeing is a huge shift in adoption in terms of filling out your application in digital format.","In December only about 20% of our apps were filled out in the digital space. We\u2019re now about approaching 60% of our application still down the digital space. The other one I would point out, the other initiatives is on our commercial lending process. We've gone through and really put a dedicated team focus at, how do we reengineer that process really with the goal being for us to get a faster answer back to customers. So from applications time to, yes or no to a customer, we drop that by about 70%. And so team has done a great job of making banking much easier for our commercial customers.","The last one I would point out would be in our contact center area. We've gone through and used IBM Watson in our contact center really to provide some assistance to our reps, so they can better assist our customers. Couple of use cases that we have deployed, the first being, for certain call types Watson actually take the call, handle the call with the customer, and service that call right there with Watson. We've had about 700,000 calls already year-to-date that Watson has handle that call from start to finish. That\u2019s equivalent to about 55 contact center reps in that initiative alone.","The other thing we've done as we gone through and really tried arm our reps with to be able to have quick fast answers back to customers, and we have Watson so that almost in a chat mode. So a customer -- I mean, a rep can actually ask Watson questions when they have a customer on the phone. They have done that 700,000 times year-to-date. And so, a lot of good work there, a lot of good energy. As David mentioned earlier about headcount, and one of the things that if you think about headcount and also corporate real estate, those are two big indicators that you can watch to see us while we're making progress on our Simplify and Grow strategy.","We\u2019re down about 770 positions through June and that's a direct result of management actions that had been taken with these 40 plus initiatives that are out there. Also Regions insurance closing on July the 2nd, that's about 644 positions eliminated there. And in the balance of the second half of the year, you will see Simplify and Grow impact probably another 500 positions in the second half of this year. That's over 1,900 positions and what I would tell you is, that will really show up in 2019 when we get the full run rate. The last point I would make would be on a real-estate side. We've got a good opportunity to continue to reduce our space across the bank. We will be down about 700,000 square feet this year. We expect that trend to continue.","David Turner","So, Betsy, I'll add to that. So, operating leverage today is 2.7%. We are reiterating our guidance of 3.5% for the year. We get there both by having improvements in revenues whether it'd come from rate balance sheet growth, Simplify and Growth initiatives helps through revenue, and then continuing to watch our cost for the remainder of the year. You will see the benefits that as John just mentioned really ramp up in the third and fourth quarters, such that, gives us confidence that, not only we're going to meet our operating leverage target, but we're also getting our efficiency ratio below the 60% level.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. That was a really helpful color. It sounds like you are well prepared for that question. Yes, exactly one other just a separate topic, but David on the capital, I know we talked a little bit about capital and capital return already. Just especially sense the insurance acquisition -- or insurance I sorry, sale is happening this year. Is there any opportunity to do a mid quarter task or a de minimis as well in terms of capital return?","David Turner","Well, so, we had baked into our submission to the extent we generate the capital that we were also going to be able to include that and that is in the numbers that you see. So that $300 million has already been asked for. So, there is no need to go back. There is always an opportunity to do back on the de minimis. The de minimis is a fairly small number now and we will have to see circumstances changes. We do not anticipate that, but it's always an option.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Winter of Wedbush.","Peter Winter","I just wanted to follow up on the efficiency ratio looking out longer term, if you're still targeting, bring it down to the mid-50s. And over what timeframe, do you think you can get there?","David Turner","So, we've been pretty focused on our '18 to just kind of make sure we meet that. It's the third year of our three-year plan we laid out at Investor Day in November of '15. Now, we are going to have our Investor Day in February of '19 where we will have our scorecard on what we told we are going to do. And that we're going to be laying out expectations for the next three years. You've heard me I mentioned before, I think our industry is going to have to begin more efficient overtime, and I think we will certainly do that. And I think targeting something in the 50, mid 50s to maybe even better than that overtime is on the table.","I think you should see us through Simplify and Grow initiatives to get just a little better each quarter, but when can we hit that mid 50s, we haven't really gone out and said that. You're going have to wait and show up in February to here. But I think in the not too distant future, we could actually get there.","John Turner","Yes, I would just reiterate that. I think we\u2019re very focused on continuing to improve the efficiency of our operations. And we'd make the point there our Simplify and Grow initiative, we try to be clear that is not a program, it's really about making a cultural shift here at Regions. It's about developing a culture of continuous improvement. We've got to always be looking for how we do we make it easier for our customers and banker do business? How do we improve our processes? How do we drive efficiency to be more effective and deliver more value for our shareholders? So, we are very committed to doing that.","Peter Winter","And just a follow up, if I look last year, the share buyback coming out of CCAR. You frontend loaded that buyback. Should we expect kind of similar type trend this year?","David Turner","Well, we haven\u2019t led out our timing, Peter, but we have a pretty, pretty tall order to get that done as soon as possible and that's our goal. We are carrying excess capital right now that's really been an anchor from a return standpoint and we would like to get back capital right size, sooner rather than later. So I'll leave it back.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Just one follow-up question for me. You've mentioned that 93% of our container deposits have high quality checking accounts tie to them. Obviously, the consumer beta stands at 1% on accumulative basis. I guess I just want to make sure I am understanding the message correctly a lot of your peers are starting to die towards more aggressive betas going forward. Is it that a lot of your consumer retail accounts are transactional and don\u2019t have that excess cash that potentially could rotate away from Regions into some of these online offering? Are we reading that correctly?","David Turner","That\u2019s a big piece of our deposits base and that\u2019s why it's been fairly stable, that\u2019s why it was our beta was low last time, that\u2019s why we think it will be low this time. And we have the core checking account of our consumer base. And that is really, really important, very granular average deposit of about $3,500 in account. So, that\u2019s what makes us unique and that\u2019s how we win from a beta standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Marinac of FIG partners.","Christopher Marinac","Thanks David. I had a similar question as Erica, but just want to look at it from the angle of the non-metro markets. To what extent does that keep working for you as we get further along in the right cycle? Is that still a benefit that you have?","David Turner","Yes, absolutely. We think it's foundational to who we are and non-metro markets, that\u2019s a big part of our deposit base. It's not just deposits but as a whole relationship that we have these customers that are very loyal to us, and we dominate in those market. So it's important for us to continue to provide good solid customer service and we will retain those deposits, which we think again is foundational and really is a differentiator.","We've had this strategic advantage for a long time, but without rates rising someone, we couldn't extract value until now. And so, we think that continues on -- in the future. Now offset to that is, our growth relative to some of those smaller markets is it as robust as some of the major metro, which is why you see us -- you've have seen us make some investments in major metros like Atlanta where we can capture some of that faster growth, but we don\u2019t want to abandoned that core customer base in the smaller markets. So, that's really our strategy on both sides.","Christopher Marinac","Is there a way to pinpoint the rate advantage between metro versus non-metro even in just on the big picture context?","David Turner","We can get back to you on that Chris.","Operator","Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","David, can you share with us -- in the securities portfolio, I think, you said that about $12 billion to $14 billion is reinvest every year. Did I hear that correctly?","David Turner","That's total assets. Gerard. It's probably 2 billion to 3 billion in the securities book and about 10 to 11 in the loan book.","Gerard Cassidy","In the securities book, what yields are you giving up when it rolls off? And where do you reinvesting? And what is the duration in that portfolio as well?","David Turner","Yes, so our duration really can't change overtime. We are in 4 to 4.5 years in terms of duration what's rolling off is in the 250 range and what's going on is about in 315 range. So, that was one of the benefits of operations stay here that reinvest on the maturities again both in securities and loans is a big benefit to us.","Gerard Cassidy","And then, circling back to deposits, one of your peer banks talked about they are seeing their commercial customers using their cash to -- for capital expenditures, which is one of the reasons they felt their commercial loan growth was a bit modest. Is there any evidence with your corporate and commercial loan book in talking to our customers that they are drawing down on their deposits for capital expenditures? And down the road you might see the loan growth as they use up those excess deposits?","John Turner","Gerard, this is John. Yes, we think that is exactly the case and we would point to $500 million is more or less and deposits decline that we think have been directed related to the customers putting that to work It's sort of a -- that's a more specific number than it ought to be more of a round number I guess. But that kind of the runoff that we've seen has I think largely been we believe use our customers to invest in their businesses. And as a result at some point, we think that will translate into additional loan growth.","Gerard Cassidy","And then lastly, David, you mentioned that you're outperforming on the beta. Have you guys figured out why the beta so far this year has just moved so slowly? Is it just the nominal rate of interest rates being so low or is there another factor?","David Turner","Well, I think for us, if you look at our retail base betas of 1% gets back to the makeup of our deposit base and who customers are which was really the Chris' first question I was trying to answer. We go to the business side, we've had a cumulative beta of about 44%. Those are often times large corporate customers that are looking everything rates go up for their fair share, and I think that we have to be prepared for that just like we are on competitiveness from a loan pricing standpoint. But what differentiates us is our intent intense focus on relationship banking, whether it would be on the consumer side or to the businesses side or the wealth side. It's really important for us to maintain the relationship and have all the products and services delivered to our customers and we think that's what helps keeps our data down as well.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to John Turner for any closing remarks.","John Turner","Just thank you all for participating today. Appreciate your time. Thanks for interest in Regions.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Paula and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.","M. List Underwood","Good morning,  everyone. We appreciate your participation on our call this morning. Our presenters today are our President and Chief Executive Officer, Grayson Hall; our Chief Financial Officer, David Turner; and also here, and available to answer questions, are Matt Lusco, our Chief Risk Officer; and Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer.","As part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","With that said, let me remind you that in this call, we will make forward-looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical information, but rather, are related to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. These statements are based on general assumptions and are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found on our forward-looking statement that is located in the Appendix of the presentation.","With that covered, let me turn it over to Grayson Hall.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Thank you, List, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Regions and your participation in our second quarter 2012 earnings conference call.","Regions delivered another quarter of improved financial results, building on our momentum from earlier this year. In short, the company reported prudent and profitable growth, driven by solid business performance and we continue to see broad-based improvements in our asset quality.","Second quarter pre-tax pre-provision income was $503 million, 15% higher than in the first quarter, and earnings from continuing operations were at an improved level of $0.20 per diluted share. As you're aware, earlier in the quarter we repaid the U.S. Treasury's preferred stock investment, and therefore, incurred accelerating accretion charges. Excluding these charges, and the final preferred stock dividends, earnings from continuing operations would have been $0.25 per diluted share.","While our results reflect some encouraging and positive trends, the U.S. economy continues to improve on an uneven and slow pace. The economy continues to work through structural headwinds, including de-leveraging, high unemployment, a weak housing market and fiscal consolidation at the local, state and national levels. Within Regions' markets, job growth has been approximately on par with the U.S. as a whole. Importantly, with respect to housing, we are seeing modest and incremental improvements in most of our markets. In particular, the Florida metro markets. While housing remains soft in many markets, there are signs of recovery. We are pleased that we're able to deliver solid business results despite the challenging economic landscape.","Looking at several important metrics, our second quarter results demonstrate that we are executing well against our business priorities. Despite the persistent challenge of a low interest rate environment, our margin expanded for the third consecutive quarter. The improvement largely reflects lower deposit cost, declines in nonaccrual balances and a reduction in excess cash reserves at the Federal Reserve. There's still an opportunity for further improvements in deposit cost which will largely support a stable margin, even if market interest  rates remains at these levels. And while our long-term debt levels are low, relative to our peers, we continue to evaluate liability management opportunities.","Although total outstanding loan balances were down less than 1%, total loan production increased a healthy 15% linked-quarter. We experienced improved growth in our commercial and industrial portfolios, which helped to offset the favorable decline in investor real estate portfolio. Our loan-to-deposit ratio remains conservative and provides considerable flexibility to continue to take advantage of profitable lending opportunities that will benefit future revenue growth.","Our mortgage loan production and related fee income improved significantly this quarter, as customers continue to take advantage of historically low interest rates and HARP opportunities. We experienced growth in both refinancing and new home purchase.","We continue to be disciplined and rigorous in our focus on improving operating efficiency. At the same time, we are continuing to invest in new technology and people where appropriate. In the second quarter, we began implementation of new technology in our banking offices that will enhance our cross-sell capabilities, streamline and enhance our customers' experience and reduce our overall operating expenses. We also posted another quarter of broad-based improvement in asset quality, exceeding our own internal expectations, confirming what we believe was a pivotal turn in the first quarter.  Importantly, improving asset quality is enabling us to focus more of our resources and energy on executing strategies that profitably leverage our opportunity for revenue growth.","With respect to capital, our improved ratios, bolstered by recent capital actions, position us well for the future. We're still reviewing the latest notices or polls [ph] we're making, regarding  capital. We expect to be fully compliant well before the rules are officially phased in.","The first half of 2012 has been transformational for Regions, and with several quarters of solid results and continued successful execution against our plans, we believe Regions is better positioned for ultimate out-performance.","I'll now turn the call over to David Turner who will discuss second quarter financial details. Afterward, I'll come back and make a few closing comments. David?","David J. Turner","Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin on Slide 3, with a quick snapshot of our second quarter 2012 financial results.","We reported net income available to common shareholders of $284 million or $0.20 per diluted share. Income from discontinued operations totaled $4 million, primarily related to the gain on the Morgan Keegan sale. Early in the second quarter, we repaid the Series A preferred stock investment made by the U.S. Treasury. In conjunction with this repayment, earnings were impacted by the acceleration of the accretion of the discount. And along with preferred dividends, totaled $71 million or $0.05 per diluted share.","Pre-tax pre-provision income from continuing operations, or PPI, was $503 million. Net interest income increased $11 million or 1% linked-quarter and the resulting net interest margin increased 7 basis points. Noninterest revenues decreased 3% on a linked-quarter basis, while noninterest expenses were down 8%. From a credit standpoint, net charge-offs were down 20% and the total loan loss provision declined 78%.","Let us get into the details, starting with the balance sheet.","Average loans for the second quarter were down $498 million or less than 1% linked-quarter. Despite a low interest rate environment, our loan yields remained steady. Balances were impacted by a decline of $664 million or 7% in the investor real estate portfolio. At quarter end, balances stood at $9.4 billion, down almost $4 billion from one year ago. This portfolio now comprises only 12% of our total loan portfolio compared to 17% a year ago. We expect this portfolio to continue to decline at a moderate pace over the next few quarters.","Commercial and industrial loan demand remained healthy in the second quarter, driven by our specialized lending groups. On an ending basis, commercial industrial loans grew $892 million or 4% first to second quarter. The growth in this portfolio was aiding to offset the decline in the investor real estate portfolio. While growth was broad-based geographically, we experienced particularly strong growth in healthcare, asset-based lending and the real estate corporate banking division which provides refinancing.","Pipelines remain solid and are slightly above the same level at this time last year, as our clients funded capital expenditures, working capital needs, and increasingly, M&A activity. Lien utilization on commercial industrial loans was up 130 basis points linked-quarter to just over 44%, and commitments have increased 11% over the last year.","And moving on to consumer services, average mortgage balances declined 1% linked quarter, reflecting our continued strategy to sell fixed-rate conforming mortgages. The company also experienced additional loan declines in the home equity portfolio, as consumers continue to refinance and\/or de-leverage.","At the end of the second quarter, we started our rollout of our new credit card product line and an enhanced Relationship Rewards program. Additionally, we will convert these cards onto our system in the third quarter, which will allow us to better control the customer experience and should enable us to increase sales production going forward.","Indirect auto continues to be an area of growth, as loan production in this portfolio increased 15% over last quarter, and average loan balances increased 6%.","Notably, total consumer loan production totaled $2.8 billion in the second quarter, up 24% linked-quarter. Total loan balances for the remainder of the year are expected to remain relatively stable with second quarter's balances.","Let's move on to deposits. As shown on Slide 5, deposit mix and cost continued to improve in the second quarter. Average loan cost deposits increased $1.7 billion from last quarter, and over $5 billion from one year ago. Average higher cost CDs declined almost $2 billion linked-quarter and $5.3 billion from last year. Total average deposits were relatively steady, linked-quarter, and year-over-year. Average time deposits fell to just 18% of total deposits, down from 23% a year ago, as a result of our continued success in growing low-cost deposits. This positive mix shift resulted in deposit cost declining to 32 basis points for the quarter, down 5 basis points for the first quarter and 21 basis points from one year ago. We expect to drive additional improvement in deposit cost. We have approximately $2.9 billion of CDs that are scheduled to mature in the third quarter, that carry an average interest rate of 1.2%, and an additional $3 billion at 2.1% that will mature in the fourth quarter.","Now looking ahead to 2013, we currently have $6.5 billion of CDs that will mature. Of that, $4.6 billion mature in the first half with an average rate of 1.8%, and $1.9 billion in the second half, with an average rate of 0.8%. Now this compares to our current average going-on rates for new CDs of approximately 20 basis points.","Our total funding cost improved 5 basis points, linked-quarter, to 60 basis points. And we will continue to evaluate the capital and liquidity benefits of our 2 outstanding trust preferred securities, as well as other liability management opportunities.","Let's turn to net interest income on Slide 6.","For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income was up $11 million or 1%. The resulting net interest margin was up 7 basis points to 3.16%. The net interest margin benefited from reductions in overall deposit cost, reduction in nonaccrual balances and a decline in low-yielding cash balances at the Federal Reserve. Last quarter, we deployed some of our excess cash into higher-yielding corporate and consumer mortgage-backed securities, thus decreasing the negative impact of the excess cash reserves by 5 basis points to 8 basis points in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, cash at the Federal Reserve totaled approximately $1.8 billion, which is in line with our target operating level.","The negative impact of non-accruals on the margin declined 3 basis points to 7 basis points in the second quarter. Now currently, our investment portfolio amounts to $27.2 billion or 25% of average earning assets. The future size of the investment portfolio will largely depend on the dynamics of the rest of the balance sheet. Loan demand remained somewhat soft relative to the availability of stable deposits, and we expect to continue to sell conforming mortgages to the agencies in favor of retaining that exposure within securities.","In the latter half of the second quarter, long-term rates declined to record lows. And should rates persist at these levels, growing net interest income in 2012 will be challenging, as fixed rate securities and loans are prepaid, or mature, and are replaced by lower-yielding assets. However, as previously noted, the opportunity to continue to improve deposit cost will be an important factor supporting net interest income and the resulting net interest margin. Consequently, we do expect net interest income and the resulting net interest margin to remain at relatively stable levels.","Let's turn to noninterest revenue on Slide 7.","Second quarter noninterest revenues were down 3% linked-quarter. Mortgage banking revenue was particularly strong in the quarter, driven by new home purchases and refinance activity aided by the government's HARP 2 program, which is serving to increase refinance volume.","Mortgage revenue was up $13 million or 17% over the first quarter. Mortgage loan production of $2.1 billion during the second quarter reflects an increase of 28% from $1.6 billion in the first quarter. While we estimate that HARP 2 will add over $1 billion to our full year 2012 mortgage refinance volume.","As we evaluate the mortgage refinancing opportunities, we believe our capacity to handle refinancing activity more expeditiously is enabling us to take market share. In fact, almost half of our HARP 2  loan applications are new mortgage customers.","Account service fees and charges were down $21 million linked-quarter, due to the establishment of a reserve for certain customer fee refunds resulting from a change in our non-sufficient funds policy. Excluding this item, total service charges would've been consistent with the first quarter.","And moving to expenses on Slide 8.","Noninterest expenses were down 8%, linked-quarter, and 12% year-over-year. During the quarter, credit-related expenses were down $31 million. Notably, other real estate expenses declined 57%, linked-quarter, and 73% year-over-year. Within held-for-sale, we incurred $26 million in net gains related to property sales. Also, staffing was down during the quarter. And over the past year, we have experienced a decline of 544 positions or 2%.","Looking ahead, we expect overall 2012 expenses from continuing operations, excluding goodwill impairment, to be down from the 2011 level as a result of our continued, and disciplined focus, on cost control.","Let's move to our credit metrics on Slide 9.","For the second quarter in a row, we experienced broad-based asset quality improvement, with virtually all credit metrics improving. Net charge-offs were down significantly, resulting in a decline of $67 million linked-quarter or 52% year-over-year and exceeded the loan loss provision by $239 million. Inflows of nonperforming loans declined to $315 million or 17% from last quarter. This is down 81% from the peak, which was in the second quarter of 2010. Inflows have now reached what we would characterize as a normal range, somewhere between $250 million and $350 million. Nonperforming loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased $236 million or 11% linked-quarter. This is the first time since the first quarter of 2009 that our nonperforming loans have been below $2 billion, which is down 48% from the peak in the first quarter of 2010.","Total nonperforming assets declined $1.3 billion or 35% from the prior year. Much of this improvement was driven by resolutions rather than charge-offs, another favorable indicator of future trends. Notably, Business Services' criticized and classified loans continued to decline, with criticized loans down 9% or $543 million from the first quarter, and down $3.4 billion or 38% from the fourth quarter of 2009, which was the high point.  As a reminder, criticized and classified loans are one of the best and earliest indicators of asset quality.","Our coverage ratios remain strong. At quarter end, our allowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans stood at 120% or 1.2x, up 2 basis points from last quarter. Meanwhile, our loan loss allowance to loans remained strong at 3.01% at the end of the second quarter. In light of the backdrop of an uneven and slow economic recovery, forecasting asset quality improvement with certainty is difficult. As Grayson previously noted, our improvement in asset quality exceeded our own internal expectations. And each quarter will have its own unique characteristics and some volatility should be expected. However, our credit quality indicators continue to be encouraging.","Now, let's look at our capital liquidity on Slide 10.","Early in the second quarter, we repaid the U.S. Treasury Department's $3.5 billion preferred stock investment. This transaction follows the completion of the sale of Morgan Keegan and a highly successful common equity offering. In connection with the repayment of Series A preferred stock, the company repurchased the outstanding warrant for $45 million. As a result of these capital actions and events, our estimated Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter stood at 11%, and our estimated Tier 1 common ratio increased 40 basis points to 10%.","And we continue to review the capital NPRs that were published on June 7. The proposed minimum capital levels, and definitions of capital, are largely in line with Regions' expectations. However, we are working to understand all of the proposed changes to risk weightings and are collecting the data to quantify the impact. Based on our interpretation of the NPRs, we estimate our pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will be approximately 8%. The NPR comment period ends in early September, and changes could be made, and those changes could result in materially different capital ratios from what we have estimated.","Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company remains solid, with a loan to deposit ratio of 80%.  Lastly, based on our interpretation, we are well-positioned with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio.","Overall, this quarter's results demonstrate the continued progress that we have made on several important fronts. Our operating results continue to improve, driven by solid business performance. We delivered another strong quarter of substantial improvements with respect asset quality, and we further strengthened our balance sheet from a capital standpoint.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Grayson for his closing comments.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Overall, this quarter's results really demonstrate the continued progress that we've made in entering the second half of 2012, with both positive and encouraging momentum. While there's still work to be done, we are successfully executing our business plans, making substantial progress in taking actions that positions us to maximize our opportunity for out-performance.","We continue to make progress even in the face of challenging markets. In the second quarter, we completed the sale of Morgan Keegan, and as a result, we are a simpler organization focused on the fundamentals of serving our banking customers. We're now able to offer our Wealth Management customers segment enhanced banking, trust and investment products with outstanding customer service. On the Business Services and Consumer front, we have been taking steps that expand and enhance our product offerings, as well as simplify and improve the delivery of customer services, and the customer focus is central to our business model. Our associates are working hard to ensure Regions is providing competitive products and services to satisfy customers' individual needs. We have a competitive team that consistently provides award-winning customer service, which we believe is a differentiating factor in today's marketplace.","With this in mind, we are continuing to manage efficiency and selectively add to our team. For example, recently hiring additional bankers for growing specialized industries. We continue to invest in people and technology to build the best foundation for delivery and execution of our business plans and to take advantage of opportunities present in our markets, and in this economy. Although economic growth is expected to remain modest over the balance of the year, Regions has levers in place to continue to strengthen our financial performance and deliver improved returns by shareholders.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just first on the Basel III NPR. I understand you are still reviewing it. Can you just give us a little more detail on some of the moving parts? And maybe you can talk about some of the areas that there could be further mitigation and how big those can be.","David J. Turner","Sure, Ryan. As I've mentioned -- this is David. The biggest change for us came in the form of risk-weighted asset changes. And more specifically, within that, those consumer products that are tied to real estate, in particular were our resi mortgage and our HELOC book. And I will caution this is still an NPR, there are changes that can be made and I'm sure will be made, that we need to incorporate. That being said, we will look at starting to analyze our business and changes that we need to think through, in terms of how that would impact going forward. Clearly, as is, you will be holding more capital for those 2 products that I just mentioned. And those, holding more capital clearly would have an impact in terms of the availability of that credit at the prices that we have today. And so we will look at restructuring those if we have to, to minimize the capital impact to us. I would also tell you that the changes in the risk weights don't take effect until 2015, as proposed. That, too, could change. But we have time to overcome and will modify our business, such that we have an appropriate amount of capital at the date that is implemented.","O. B. Grayson Hall","What's in line is, as we look at the NPR and we're studying this very carefully to make our comments and recommendations for change. When you look at our balance sheet, most material impact, as David said, is on the Consumer segment. And in particular, the real estate-related products. Obviously, as these rules are passed in the form they're in today, or in similar form, it will require some adjustments to our products and will also change somewhat in how we approach that market with those products. And so even though they won't be implemented until 2015, as it stands today, I do believe that the industry and ourselves in particular will start making business model adjustments as soon as we know what the definitive rules will be.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, just on credit. It seems like the provision came in a lot lower than I think a lot of us expected. And with NPL migration now back in a more normal level, I recognized credit can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. But is it your expectation that we could see the provision running at these levels for several quarters as the reserve begins to come down? It seems like you had some positive comments on housing and it seems like disposals of assets are coming in at better prices than I think we would have expected. So can you give us a little bit more color there on the provision and the reserve?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes. I think, clearly, when you look at our credit metrics, we're continuing to see favorable trends. As a result of our conservative nature, we have clearly communicated that we think that recovery can be uneven. Although in the metrics, we continue to see our metrics perform really at levels better than we had internally forecasted. But we continue to see an improving landscape from a credit standpoint. We have seen some recent recovery in some of our markets that relate to housing. These have been modest recoveries, but been more widespread than we would have anticipated at this juncture. But I do think, that when you specifically look at our division, our charge-offs remain elevated above normal levels, although continue to improve. But when you look at the provision, that provision obviously will also normalize as our asset quality normalizes. And I'll ask Barb Godin to make a few comments, if you will, on the same subject.","Barbara Godin","Yes. If you look at the impact of our provision, really there's 3 factors: One is the reduction in our overall charge-offs that came down quarter-over-quarter; the second would be in the number of resolutions that we saw. And by that, I mean we had a number of payoffs. So substandard loans and even nonperforming loans, where the entire loan was paid-off, we were able to reduce or release the reserve on that, on those loans; and lastly, the mix shift, which is, as we're putting on much better quality loans, we need less reserve than those that we're taking off the back end. So all in, that led to just a $26 million provision. I would not call that a normalized provision level. Clearly, it's going to be somewhat above that. But again, it'll be in line with what happens with our charge-off.","O. B. Grayson Hall","And if you look at it, clearly, nonperforming loans were down quarter-over-quarter or 11%, about 48% from the peak. If you look at migration, and migration was down 17% quarter-over-quarter and 81% from the peak. So clearly, improving numbers from what we had seen historically. But if you will, the migration is starting to fall in what we'd categorized as normalized rate.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","The question on the deposit service charges. David, you were saying that if you take out the reserve that you put in place for the customer refund, but that would put you back in line with the first quarter. But typically first quarter is seasonally depressed and you would typically get about a $15 million to $20 million uptick. So would we still expect to see a level that would be higher than the first quarter level as we move into the third and fourth quarters?","David J. Turner","Yes. I think that what our guidance was there to try and give you information that would guide you for the rest of the year, that we felt would be fairly consistent with that first quarter number or the as-adjusted second quarter. Clearly, from deposit rate policy changes that we've made, there will be some impact going forward. It's in the $3 million to $5 million per quarter. Not a big number, but we expect that to be fairly consistent with what you see as-adjusted.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then on the net interest margin, 2 things: One is, we have the CD repricing that's coming through, especially in the fourth quarter. Should there be -- we had kind of been looking for a little bit of further improvement. We've got a little bit more this quarter than we expected, but maybe a basis point or 2 as you kind of went through the end of the year. The bias maybe why you're saying stable, still towards a little favorable move in that interest margin?","David J. Turner","Marty, I'll tell you that we did have a little bit of a more favorable move in the quarter due to our improving our credit metrics. So there are 2 or 3 points there, and we wanted to guide to the consistency or stability of the margin from where we are right this minute. Because of that, we'll see if things of that nature, the improvement in nonperformance continue in the third and fourth quarter. You're right to point out that our repricing in the second half is very strong from a deposit standpoint, but we also are looking at historically low 10-year and the reinvestment rates will serve to work against us. The question is, how long will this remain? And so we've been a little cautious and wanted to kind of guide towards the stability of where we are right now. And if it's higher than that, then that will be a plus.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Marty, we continue to see, and as we said earlier, our loan yields appear to be stable and we think that will continue. But we think there is also still room for improvement in the deposit cost or deposit pricing itself. The question we have, as David just said, is where do reinvestment rates go on our investment portfolio? But when we net all of that together, we still are indicating that we believe we will maintain a fairly stable margin.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","The last thing is, David, as you kind of move in the mix of deposits, is the CD runoff just customers taking their money and shifting it into the lower cost? So it's really a transfer of deposit balances or is it an influx of new balances into the lower-cost deposits and then exit of the CDs going to try to find higher yields someplace else? Or is it something that as soon as rates change, you'll see a kind of shift back to the CD level once you can get reasonable rates there?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Marty, what we're seeing is, is that when CDs renew, we're retaining about 70% of those CDs in the CD product. The other 30% of the CDs, some of that is migrating into other depository accounts or migrating outside our bank. But clearly, we've seen a strong improvement in our low-cost balances, deposit account balances. And believe a healthy portion of that money is being retained by the company. And I'll also point out that a lot of our liquidity and deposit accounts is with business customers, and we continue to see above-normal levels of liquidity in our business checking products.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Levin of Citigroup.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Some of your peers have suggested that over the last month or so customers are becoming a bit more reticent about investing in their businesses and borrowing, given all the macro uncertainty. Are you hearing that or detecting that from your customers?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I would say that the numbers don't appear to support that. When you look at our numbers, our sales pipeline still remains strong, still above this time last year. And if you look at our numbers in terms of growing our commercial industrial loans, we saw good growth in the second quarter. That being said, anecdotally, I would say you're correct. What we've heard from our customers, as we meet with them, is that risk appetite of our commercial customers has softened. I think we have some of the uncertainties here in the marketplace today, and all are well-described in the media each and every day. I think a number of our customers are taking a less aggressive risk appetite position. And anecdotally, we're hearing that. Numerically, it hasn't quite shown up in our business yet.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then also, one of your peers said last week that it's going to close up to 5% of its branches. As you think about navigating through this very challenging environment for banks, is closing branches -- is that on your radar screen?","O. B. Grayson Hall","We were fairly aggressive early on in branch consolidation and branch rationalization. If you recall, we closed over 46 branches in 2011. That's embedded in our expense run rate today. We have consolidated 7 branches in 2012. But I would tell you, in summary, when you look at it from the top of the bank, we were aggressive early in branch rationalization and took some pretty strong steps over the last 3 years. We believe, in large part, our branch franchise today is going to be fairly stable. We will make some moderate changes, but you shouldn't expect anything of a major level in that regard. It'll only be making moderate adjustments to our business model. That being said, we are seeing transaction volumes of monetary transactions in our branches decline, but we continue to see improvement in sales transactions. And we are trying to transition our offices with more focus on sales and meeting customers' needs and realizing that monetary transaction volumes will continue to slowly decline through that channel. We're investing an awful lot of money in our other channels. We're seeing some remarkable growth in our mobile channel. But also in our web-based product offerings. So we're trying to invest in those channels that the customers want most. But quite frankly, our branches continue to be one of our most effective sales channels that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jefferson Harralson of KBW.","Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I want to ask a question about normalizing expenses. The explicit credit-related expenses have come down all the way. We think about OREO expenses. But I guess can you kind of point us in the direction to think about the further benefit that can come in maybe in the personnel line or the other line as the credit-related expenses, the environmental expenses come out? Can you do it in number of employees or just type of business types of things that are going to naturally shrink down over time?","David J. Turner","Jeff, one of the things we try to guide to is looking at 2012 expectation over '11, which we are confident that we would have lower, and this is excluding last year's goodwill impairment, we'd be lower in 2012 than in '11. Now we clearly have improvement in our credit cost, our environmental-type expenses, which are OREO and held-for-sale expenses. And we reported the net gain that we had in held-for-sale. So you should expect some unevenness relative to that. As our nonperforming loans continue to come down, and a number of loans in our special asset group comes down, we certainly have cost saves that we get there. That being said, we also have an increasing compliance environment where we have to shift and hire people to cover the compliance cost. We have a new regulator in as well. And so, I think our best guidance right now is to stick with really kind of global year-over-year where we are. That being said, we focus on expenses intently and intense focus on expenses. We are down year-over-year about 544 positions. Salaries and benefits is our #1 expense line. We continue to watch that, we watch occupancy cost in our furniture and fixture expenses, the top 3, very closely. Where we have opportunities to tighten up, as credit improves for instance, we will take advantage of that.","O. B. Grayson Hall","And Jefferson, this is a topic that we spend an awful lot of time on. Clearly, as we're looking at what we believe our future earnings potential will be in a low-rate, slow-growth environment, we continue to believe that we have to have a very rigorous and disciplined approach to expense management. We're doing a number of things. There's a number of initiatives across the organization to improve efficiency. Part of that is people. Clearly, a big part of our expenses is in salaries. But we really are trying to focus on processes that we can change and improve that allow us to do things more effectively. We've got new technologies rolling out into our branch systems, that allow us to reduce a considerable amount of overhead expenses in our operating environment. We don't necessarily have a named program, like many of our peers do. But don't misinterpret that. We've got a very distinct and clear focus on trying to reduce our expense base. That being said, I would agree with David. Part of our expense savings are to fund headwinds that we're facing, as we're having to add stamping and adding technology to make sure that we are effectively managing all of our compliance risk, and so there are some offset to our savings.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I could just follow-up on the service charge. Just to be clear, as we think about the back half of the year, we should look at the 1Q level, the $254 million, and that would include the $3 million to $5 million drag?","David J. Turner","That's right, Matt. We've kind of guided to roughly equal that. Maybe slightly up from there, but not a large change from that quarter.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And the change that you made, did that relate to the sort order, the highs to low [ph]?","O. B. Grayson Hall","No, Matt, what we've done is, really, we try to focus on our funds availability policy, as well as our non-sufficient funds policy to ensure that, one, it is in concert with our focus on service quality. And as we've looked at that, we continue to challenge ourselves every month as we analyze customer activity and customer responses to make sure we're taking the appropriate steps. This particular adjustment we made to our processes are not around sort sequence, but really around the way we handle customers who have come in and preestablished overdraft protection lines, and how we handle transactions that come in that exceed the capacity of those preestablished lines.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then just separately, on the reduction to capital, the Basel III under the NPR. I don't know if you have a sense of how much of that 200 basis point reduction is from the undrawn lines. I guess I'm hearing from some folks that there's a lot of confidence in mitigating the impact of the undrawn home equity lines and commercial lines over time. I'm wondering if you have any of those numbers at this point.","David J. Turner","Matt, I don't have the precise numbers. I can tell you that the impact on unfunded commitments is going to impact some of our peers a lot more severely than us. And it has to do with the proportion of unfunded commitments that are 365 days, and shorter, versus longer. So there is an impact related to that, but it is not the major mover, the major one is related to our risk-weighted assets on resi mortgage and the HELOCs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just first starting out on NIM. I'm just wondering, if you think about this mathematically, where your loan yields are stable, your securities yield have some depression but there's actually very significant deposit repricing in the second half of this year. What's actually going to hold the NIM down, not allowed to go up? Is there any swap off we should think about or maybe any large changes in the securities and liquidity portfolio?","David J. Turner","No, Craig, the primary driver is just the reinvestment risk that we have in this low rate environment. Currently, we have about $500 million rolling off of our -- is cash roll-off of our investment portfolio and having to reinvest that as the lower yields continue to drag that down. So we don't have anything that really sticks out other than that. Again, we caution a little bit on the stability of the margin because we had about 3 points that we picked up in the quarter related to better-than-we-had-anticipated improvements on nonperforming loans. If we get that kind of improvement in the third, fourth quarter like we had then that 3 points would be there. But we're trying to guide to a little more stable -- stability there.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","David, your securities yield only declined by 3 bps in the second quarter. So it's actually much smaller than we thought. Any commentary there would be helpful. And then, do you expect a much sharper decline in the third quarter? And I wondered if you can share with us your new money yield for securities acquisitions.","David J. Turner","Yes, we didn't expect there to be some added pressure on the investment portfolio in the quarter. Our going-on yield, today for securities, is in that, right just below 2%, 1.70%, 1.75% for the mortgage-backed security products that we would be purchasing. So over time, you would see that that's going to put more pressure in the third and fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","On the securities portfolio, I mean, it looks like your duration is probably around 3 years, is that correct?","David J. Turner","A little shorter than that, it's closer to 2 years.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Closer to 2 years. And what type of -- because we've seen different companies have had different prepayment rate speeds across-the-board. What type of prepayments are you getting off that?","David J. Turner","About 20. In the 20 range.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And you're reinvesting I guess. You're reinvesting at the 2-year level or the 3-year level?","David J. Turner","Yes. Closer to the 3-year level, we'd be reinvesting.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","That's about like a 1.7%, 1.8% level?","David J. Turner","That's right. We said about 1.75%. Just...","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","1.75%. Yes, okay. Just following up on the last question is, is that do you think your deposits can reprice down? You do have some room in deposits to offset that. So I'm guessing that, with rates where they are and you're guiding to stabilized NIM, that you're depending on the deposit rates to reprice along with this to offset that.","David J. Turner","Yes. We have a fairly significant amount of deposits repricing in the second half of the year and that's a big part of how we are confident in the stability of our net interest margin. And one other follow-up, in terms of the investment portfolio, we talked a couple of quarters ago about trying to invest in more corporate securities. We've kind of isolated about 10% of our portfolio in those type nonindustry mortgage-backs. And those are going on the books in the 3.25% range, which also will help stabilize a little bit of the investment yield. But our biggest benefit that we see in the back half is that deposit repricing on the CD book.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And along with corporate security, are you taking a look at munis? There are some banks that look at munis and increasing that portfolio also.","David J. Turner","No. We used to have roughly 5% to 7% of our investment portfolio in munis before we got into the economic environment we're in today. And so we divested all of those and we're a bit reluctant to go back into the muni market thus far.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala of Bank of America.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is a follow-up to Ryan's question on the provision. I recognize that this dollar run rate is going to be quite lumpy as you continue to work through the credits. But I was wondering if you could help us get a sense of -- as you look at your -- if the improve -- most of the improvement is behind you, and you look at where your loan book is today, what a normal charge-off rate would look like for Regions in 2 or 3 years, and how you look at a normal provisioning rate. Do we look at reserved loans? Do we look at reserved average loans?","Barbara Godin","Erika, it's Barb Godin. Relative to what we look at for a normalized loss rate, we would target somewhere around that 75 basis points of loss through a cycle, is what you can expect as we get down to that range. In terms of what our reserve would be, it's not going to be the same as what it was pre-crisis. I don't think that was horrible neither. And I think we're just going to have to hold our capital to somewhere between 150 and 200.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And David, I appreciate all the color on the margin, but can you give us a sense of what the loan yields would've been if you excluded the impact of the NPLs getting worked out of the balance sheet this quarter?","David J. Turner","Yes, it would've been about 3 basis points on the loan yields.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That was on the loan yield, not on the total margin?","David J. Turner","3% or 4%. I mean those numbers can be fairly close. It's about 3%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rose of Raymond James.","Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered but I wanted to get a sense for where you stand in your mitigation efforts related to Durbin.","O. B. Grayson Hall","I'll just make a couple of comments. One is that we continue to look at our consumer business model and see where we can enhance our products, but also expand products. As you are aware, we entered the credit card business a little over a year ago. And we introduced a number of new products in that line in the last few weeks. So we tried to address our interchange revenue in terms of adding credit customers that will use the credit card for purchases. But we continue to push the debit card. We continue to see success in increasing the penetration of the debit card product into our checking account base. We obviously have seen the revenue on a per transaction basis decline there, but we're obviously trying to make up some of our loss through growth. I would tell you, we've introduced a number of new products in terms of prepaid cards, that we hope enhanced the view of that customer segment. And as you are well aware, we've continued to migrate our checking accounts from, really, the free-checking environment to one where accounts are fee-eligible. We continue to believe that we can mitigate the impact of Durbin over time. We will not completely mitigate it in '12, but we believe that we can mitigate it over time. And we continue to be positive about the progress we've made, thus far.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about your thought process around the potential redemption of your $840 million in TruPS? I know you mentioned that you are evaluating it, but if you can just give us more color around what you're looking at there and what the thought process is.","David J. Turner","Sure. We have 2 issues in that 8.45, there's a 3.45, there's price of debit, 8 7\/8, and there's 500, that 6 5\/8. The 6 5\/8 clearly is business capital treatment as this other one. But we look at that as a reasonable long-term debt yield today. The other one, the 8 7\/8 is one where we think we have opportunity to -- as we think about liability and capital strategies via NPR, that we could look at and perhaps call, given the regulatory event that occurred. So we're trying to lead it to -- as we are investigating that, we'll be putting together our thoughts on that and get back to the investors and analysts regarding that.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then secondly, around the reserve level. Could you talk about the pace in the expected decline in the reserve over from your current 3% of loans to that 1.50% to 2% that Barb had indicated?","David J. Turner","Yes. I think that clearly, the pace is what's harder to predict, given that we think clearly the economy's where it is there's going to be unevenness relative to charge-offs as we've indicated earlier on charge-offs are higher than where we want them to be. Although we have reserve for. The biggest determinant of how that 3% comes down closer to that 1.5% to 2% that Barb mentioned is going to be the level of charge-offs. As we continue to get clarity around that number, the pace of that change to get to the 1.5%, 2%, will become clearer.","O. B. Grayson Hall","As we've said earlier, we've looked at the migration of loans to nonperforming status. We were 3 15 this quarter, that exceeded our internal projections. It's actually less than our internal projections. The pace of economic improvement in the country really drives that. That really is an indication of the health of our customers. And we continue to ask ourselves that same question, it's a great question. It's what's the pace of that improvement going to be? We continue to believe it will be an uneven recovery. But we would love to see it faster, but predicting that pace of recovery is a very difficult thing to do at this juncture.","Barbara Godin","The only comment that I would add to that is, as we think about the third quarter and what we think might be a potential problem loan at this point. We would think somewhere in that $300 million to $400 million range in terms of migration to NPL.","O. B. Grayson Hall","And you'll see that range when we follow our queue. But we do believe that it will fall in that range of $300 million to $400 million.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","All right. Then lastly, just real quick. Around the securities portfolio, do you have what the premium amortization expense was for the second quarter? And then what your unamortized premium balance was as of June 30?","David J. Turner","We don't have that readily available, but we can get back with you on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Ketron of UBS.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of questions around the loan portfolio. You've had really good growth in commercial. Some of the consumer loan categories, we continue to run off in areas you had noted previously. Do you have a sense, to the degree you can control the runoff, when we may see the loan portfolio bottom out and you actually may start to see net growth come to the bottom line?","O. B. Grayson Hall","What you're seeing, the loan portfolio, this time is good growth in commercial industrial lending. We saw good growth in mortgage. We saw good growth in indirect auto. We did not -- when you look at the balance sheet, we've elected not to place any fixed rate product on the resi mortgage portfolio or to out that production on our balance sheet. And we've done that predominantly because of our cautiousness around the duration of that asset. How long it might be on the balance sheet given the low rate environment that we're in today. So the consumer portfolio continues to decline, predominantly because of that decision. I would say the equity portfolio continues to decline about $100 million a month. That's consumer de-leveraging. And we continue to see that de-leveraging. The ability for people to refinance continues, I think, to add to that issue. The good news we saw in our mortgage production is about 60% of our production was refinance and 40% was purchase. And so the purchase part of that activity really encourages us from first to second quarter. We saw not only refinancings go up, but purchases go up. So we have some strength, I think the housing market's starting to show. It's slow and incremental, but improvement, nonetheless. On the commercial side, I just think what you're seeing is that most of our activities in the higher end of commercial middle market, and the small business owner, the small commercial customer. It is still behaving an awful lot like a consumer, it is still de-leveraging. And I think, as we get more confidence in the economic outlook, you'll start to see that segment improve. What we had said earlier as we felt that our loans outstanding would, by the end of the year, would be approximately what they were at the beginning of this year. I would say we have less conviction in that today. Although we've seen our rate of decline slow, we've seen more production on commercial real estate than we saw this time last year, and we're seeing that commercial real estate portfolio still declining but at a slower pace. So we think we'll be close by the end of the year, but I think it's a great question.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then one other question, your loan yields have held up very well, really going back over the last 5 quarters. And then it looks like some of it's a mix issue, you put more indirect into the portfolio. But is this something that you anticipate that you'll be able to maintain close to, despite the rate environment, as we look forward into later this year and maybe even into 2013?","David J. Turner","Okay, this is David. I think Erica's question was really trying to get there, too. So we had 3, call it maybe 4 points, related to loan yield that we had related to end of the performance of nonperforming loans this quarter, that hopefully, they'll repeat. But if they do, then that'll benefit our margin outside of what we're telling you. Persistently low rates from a loans standpoint, yes, we'll continue to have some pressure. But it's really the reinvestment risk on investment portfolio is probably the greatest impact to us from a NIM standpoint. We are trying to change our mix of our loan portfolio to more to the consumer side. I've mentioned in my prepared comments about the changes we were making to our credit card program that we purchased last year, about a year ago, that we'll be converting into our system in the third quarter, and we're rolling out new cards and Rewards program. The purpose of which is to control the customer experience and assist us in increasing our sales production with credit card. We think that also bolster -- to the extent that we can execute on that, bolster our loan yields.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of quick follow-ups. One is on the interest rate outlook, there's some debate  as to whether or not the Feds going to keep the paying rates on reserves. Obviously, the EU stopped doing that. What is your kind of game plan for if that were to happen here?","David J. Turner","Well, I think to the extent that we're not getting 25 basis points anymore, everybody will move to going back to what we used to do. It'll be more credit risk in the system as we go overnight, with other counter-parties probably be compensated some for it. Front-loaded compensation will offset the risk relative to having a 25 basis points with the Fed. But today, we've got net amount that we have on deposit with the Fed down to about $1.8 billion. It's about the level where we want to be, maybe in the $2 billion range, and we'll see if that movement is going to happen. I'm not sure what the odds are on that right now.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So it would be partial mix into more loans to the degree you could and then offset whatever you couldn't do there, you'd be doing with other financial institutions.","David J. Turner","That's right.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just second quickie is on HARP 2. You mentioned that $1 billion in mortgage fees you're expecting in 2012 due to HARP 2. How much of that have you seen already in 1Q, 2Q?","David J. Turner","That was mortgage production of $1 billion.","O. B. Grayson Hall","If you recall, we did about $1.6 billion in total mortgage production in the first quarter and $2.1 billion in the second quarter. The HARP 2 production is running about 24% of total production. And that's up significantly from first quarter. But we're pretty steady. Right now, about $700 million originations a month. We don't see that increasing a lot from this point. But we think, right now, looking at our application pipelines, that at least for the third quarter, that looks very sustainable.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So at least sustainable is what you're guiding to?","O. B. Grayson Hall","That's right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fitzsimmons of Sandler O'Neill.","Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just a quick question, I think this is still a ways out. But as far as the CCAR process for 2013, when you all start to put your plan together in the fourth quarter, I know there's a lot of uncertainty regarding risk weightings as far as Basel III. But what's your appetite and priority in terms of raising the dividends, about doing buybacks and is the trust preferred redemption you mentioned earlier -- is that part of the plan that was already put through the regulators or is that something that you have to include in your 2013 submission?","David J. Turner","Well, let me talk about kind of our capital plan and kind of stay away from the regulators. From a capital plan standpoint, we will continue to evaluate all capital actions. You asked specifically about returning capital to shareholders. The way we view that is we generated the capital and raised the capital, so we think our shareholders expect that we redeploy that in our business, to grow our business, to invest where we can get the best risk-adjusted return back to the shareholders. And so that's our first priority. To the extent that growth is not there, acquiring product lines, entities, those kinds of things would be what we would go to second. And then to the extent we have capital and expect to generate capital, returning it to the shareholders in the form of increased dividends and stock buybacks. That being said, we do acknowledge that our dividend payout ratio is below our peers to date. Now we just repaid TARP and so expectations were that we would put together a capital plan that would include an appropriate use of that capital, and we will submit that in January. The trust preferred, clearly the NPR, provides an opportunity for the regulatory call on the trust preferreds. And as we're trying to guide through our prepared comments on liquidity and capital strategies, that we would seek to do something, not only the trust preferred but other subordinated debt instruments as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gaston Serendah of MorningStar Equity.","Gaston  F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I just had a quick question on following up on economic conditions. I know you gentlemen spoke a little bit about this already, but I'm wondering if you can just give us some color on some of your key markets, especially Florida. There's been some reports of the housing situation kind of improving there, but things still seem a little mixed and unsettled. Just kind of wondering what you're seeing on the ground or in Florida in all the key markets.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes. I mean, I think, obviously when you look across the 16 states we operate in, there are some mixed metrics around housing. But generally, what we've seen is some pretty steady improvement, although incremental, in most of our markets. I would tell you that, generally speaking, inventory levels are down. And in some markets, inventory levels are down at levels we haven't seen in a number of years. In Florida, in particular, I would say most of the strength we've seen have been in metro markets. And in particular, we've seen the condominium segment improve faster than we had earlier forecasted. We're seeing some strength in our business in Florida, that have been exceeding our internal forecast. And we think that while Florida was probably one of the harder hit markets we've seen from a housing standpoint, and it's going to take some time for recovery, that we continue to be encouraged by some of the signs. When you look at our mortgage production, there's an awful lot more home purchase in Florida. And in the other markets, use of refinance is not an option for a lot of homeowners in Florida, but you are seeing home purchase there. And so, I would say the strength is, at this point in time, seems predominantly located in the metro markets. Barb, would you like to...","Barbara Godin","Miami, as an example, seems to have rebounded clearly in terms of pricing. We're seeing increases in the Panhandle area in Florida and we're even seen increases now starting to happen in places like Ft. Myers. So clearly, we're seeing that the bottom has been hit, generally, across most of the markets in Florida, and is on the way up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The 2 questions. First of all, David, following your earlier comments about other liabilities, and with deposits down at period end, you had some redemptions this quarter, of some debt. I'm just wondering, with the kind of flat loan growth, underneath that, are we still just going to see assets continue to shrink? And at what point do you think the earning asset base will stabilize?","David J. Turner","Well, we were trying to guide to, in particular within earning assets, the loan portfolio being stable from here on out. So we think we've had good growth, we've shown you, in C&I. The decline in the investor real estate portfolio slowed almost $500 million this quarter. And we see that continuing to attract some, but not as rapidly as we have had. But we'll be de-leveraging on the consumer side, and we aren't changing our resi mortgage strategy. So we think we can have stability there related to our earning assets, in particular, our construct of our loans.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was getting more at the total balance sheet size, right? Because the right side of the balance sheet continues to shrink. So if loans are flat, and you're happy with where your cash deposits are now with the Fed, it kind of implies that you'll be just shrinking the investment portfolio. I just wanted to make sure that I was not misunderstanding that.","David J. Turner","Yes. From a deposit side, we did have declines and our average deposits were flat, but they down due to the repricing. We think we can hold where we are with earning assets to be fairly, fairly stable from here on out.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And my second question just relates to salaries and you mentioned that you had a 500-person decline in headcount year-over-year, but the salaries line was still up 8% on relatively flat revenue. So I was just wondering if there's some moving parts inside the salaries line and what we could expect from that going forward.","David J. Turner","As we mentioned earlier, we continue to watch salaries and benefits expense. We did have our merit increases actually took effect at the beginning of the quarter. And that's probably the single biggest item. The other is pension expense continues to be higher as a result of this extraordinarily low interest rate environment. So we'll see those 2 things impact us. But we've continue to look at headcount and that's really, from a cost control standpoint, our primary lever.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The question I had was coming back to your comments about the new charge-off ratio through a full cycle of being about 75 basis points. Since your net charge-off ratio was north of 300 basis points in 2010, does that imply that we should see a net charge-off ratio, then, in the good years, that might be coming up in '14, '15 in the 30 to 40 basis point range?","Barbara Godin","Well, it's going to move around a bit. As you can imagine we're going to try to keep the volatility as down as we can, as well as we can. But clearly, if you're going to have 75 basis points through a cycle, you're going to have some years that are below 75 and other years that are above 75. But I wouldn't want to give you a kind of a range right now.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. On the total classified and special mention loans that you guys reported this quarter, at $5.4 billion, is that considered a normalized level or is there still improvement here as well? I know your nonperforming assets will likely continue to improve as we go forward. But how about the classified and special mention?","Barbara Godin","Yes. We should continue to see those come down. If you look at the 90-day past due levels, while they were up in Business Services by $34 million this quarter, that was 1 account got cleared in the last couple of weeks just didn't make quarter end. Consumer was down, we anticipate that those levels will continue to move in the right direction. Our 30- to 59-day delinquency levels as well, relative down to the quarter. And again, depending on what happens in the economy, we're at a track to the economy. But those are my very early indicators of what I would expect to see in special mention, in classified and criticized.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Should we think of a more normalized number instead of the 11.7% that you reported here? Is it something after that or 6% or 7%, is that considered to be more of a normal number that you've seen in a normal economy?","Barbara Godin","Yes. I'd hate to point to a specific number, because we don't track it the way you're talking of the 11%. As if we're looking at my criticized loans and my criticized loans are not at that level, they're at 8.49% for criticized, which includes the classified loans. And that includes my special mention. So my 8.49% includes my special mention.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And during a normal environment, is 8.49% normal or is it somewhere closer maybe to 5% or 6%?","Barbara Godin","Right now, it's clearly, it's elevated. And yes, it would be somewhat reduced. I'd give you a range, probably a 5% to 7%.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in all the nonperforming assets results that you reported this quarter. Do these results reflect the Shared National Credit exam where you may have participated as a H&O lead or a participant?","Barbara Godin","Yes, they do.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then, one final question. On the loan pricing for loans, the CNI loans in particular, the Federal Reserve data is indicating that it seems like pricing is holding up. Are you guys sensing that? That, yes, it is competitive but there isn't really any slash and burning pricing going on or is there really that type of pricing going on?","O. B. Grayson Hall","No. I think what we've seen is, clearly, there's pretty intense competition for loans, obviously, in this environment. We saw some pricing compression early on, that I think part of that was because pricing would hit -- the spread, it really expanded during the recessionary period. And we saw some compression. But still, pricing is holding up above pre-recession levels. But it seems to be steady at the moment. And I'm not saying there isn't the odd transaction here and there where one gets priced at a level we don't understand. But I would say that is infrequent. The norm seems to be fairly stable.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I know this may sound too optimistic, but with all the new challenges that the industry is confronting particularly with the higher regulatory costs and certainly efficiency ratios for most banks are elevated, do you think more rational pricing could enter the picture where it doesn't get so cutthroat and people realize that they can't cut prices because expenses are just going to be permanently higher as we go forward?","O. B. Grayson Hall","A couple of things. I think one, as this environment extends for long period of time there's going to be some rationalization on the part of competition. There has to be. There can be some irrational behavior on the short term. But on the long-term, it has to rationalize. I think the other issue too is the Basel III rules coming out. Obviously, there's going to be the entire industry stands to revisit our pricing models with those capital allocations and certainly will alter pricing in a number of different lending products.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Matt Purnell of Wells Fargo.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Quick question on your deposit, your expectations for deposit growth. I'm just curious, how you're thinking about the potential for the guarantee of non-interest-bearing deposits going away at the start of the year, relative to your debt ratings. I know you've had an upgrade from S&P in March, but just curious as to how you're thinking about what your trends in deposits might be at the start of the year?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes. I mean, we continue -- we continue to deliver a considerable improvement in our deposit cost without demonstrating much of a decline in our outstanding deposits. And in fact, other than the time deposit segment of our deposit portfolio, we continue to grow that segment. We've gone through quite extensive analysis of the deposit guarantee program. We believe that would have a fairly nominal impact on our deposit base. We know which customers we work with our customers closely that might be an issue with. But I think given the capital levels of the industry and where we're at today, but that's not as material an issue as it was a couple of years ago. And so, we don't anticipate that being an issue for us at this juncture. We do not know how to handicap that event and would not speculate on that.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Grayson, you mentioned that anecdotally in some of your conversations with clients that clients are getting a bit more risk-averse given the headlines that we're all reading every day. I'm curious as to, if you combine that with your comments about the potential for pricing on loans going up post-Basel III, do you get the sense that your clients understand that that industry-wide pricing is very likely to change in the relatively near term? For commitments and other types of commercial loans?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I do not think that the anecdotal information we're hearing as a result of perceived pricing issues going forward at all. I think the average customer is seeing such a healthy level of competition between financial institutions at this juncture I think most of our customers continue to believe that they're going to have a fairly robust level of competitors competing for their business and pricing would be fair. I think most of the risk aversion is really over economic uncertainty as opposed to any sort of implications from capital requirements.","Operator","Thank you. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Hall for any closing remarks.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Listen, we appreciate again, everyone's participation today and your interest. We had some great questions, and we thank you for that. But without any further conversation, we'll stand adjourned. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call, you may now disconnect."],"18258":["Regions Financial Corp (NYSE:RF) Q3 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call October 23, 2018 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Dana Nolan - Investor Relations","John Turner - President and Chief Executive Officer","David Turner - Senior Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer","Analysts","John Pancari - Evercore ISI ","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank ","Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies ","Saul Martinez - UBS ","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets ","Peter Winter - Wedbush Securities","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Jennifer, and I'll be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participants' phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. ","I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin.","Dana Nolan ","Thank you, Jennifer. Welcome to Regions third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. John Turner will provide highlights about our financial performance, and David Turner will take you through an overview of the quarter.","A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and earning supplement, are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Our forward-looking statements disclosure and non-GAAP reconciliations are included in the appendix of today's presentation and within our SEC filings. These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of today's call.","With that, I will turn the call over to John.","John Turner ","Thank you, Dana. Good morning, and thanks for joining our call today. Before we get started, I want to take a moment to speak about Hurricane Michael. As we've seen, this was an incredibly powerful storm and communities in the Florida Panhandle, South Alabama and South Georgia all faced different challenges as they began the recovery process. I'm extremely proud of the way our teams are responding to meet the needs of customers, fellow associates and the communities affected.","As of today, all of our associates are safe and accounted for. All but five of our branches in the impacted areas are open and conducting business. And all our ATMs are now operating. We are working with our customers to determine their needs for assistance and have activated disaster recovery financial services, including ATM fee waivers and loan payment deferrals.","I was in Panama City on Friday. And while the damage is significant, the markets are determined to come back strong. We're still evaluating the overall financial impact to Regions, but we do not expect it to be material.","With respect to the third quarter, we are very pleased with our financial performance. We reported earnings from continuing operations of $354 million, reflecting an increase of 20% compared to the third quarter of the prior year. Importantly, we grew loans, fees and households, and delivered positive operating leverage and significantly improved efficiency.","Of note, adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income increased again this quarter to its highest level in over a decade. It's important to point out that our results include the impact of a $60 million contribution to our Foundation during the quarter. Combined with the $40 million contribution we made in December of 2017, we've now invested $100 million, effectively positioning the Foundation to provide consistent and sustained investments in our communities for many years to come.","Our third quarter performance clearly demonstrates our focus on continuous improvement is gaining traction. We remain committed to the successful execution of our Simplify and Grow strategic priority and investments in technology, process improvements and talent are paying off. ","In terms of the economic backdrop, we remain encouraged by current conditions and customer sentiment. Increased lending activity coupled with substantial completion of portfolio recycling and reshaping efforts allowed us to deliver broad-based loan growth this quarter.","As we look to the fourth quarter, pipelines remain healthy and we're on track to achieve our low single-digit adjusted average loan growth for the year. ","Let me quickly remind you the four key strengths we believe provide considerable momentum for Regions. ","First is our asset sensitivity and funding advantage, driven by our low cost and loyal deposit base. This continues to provide significant franchise value and a competitive advantage, particularly in a rising rate environment.","Second relates to asset quality. We believe the derisking and portfolio reshaping activities we have completed, combined with our sound risk management practices, have positioned us well for the next credit cycle.","Third, our capital position supports credit growth and investments, as well as additional capital returns. ","And, finally, we expect additional improvements in core performance through our Simplify and Grow strategic priority, which is well underway. Again, our goal is to generate consistent and sustainable long-term performance and we believe our results this quarter provide tangible evidence that our focus on continuous improvement is working.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Dave.","David Turner ","Thank you, John, and good morning. Let's begin on Slide 4 with average loans. Adjusted average loans increased almost 2% over the prior quarter, driven by broad-based growth across consumer and business lending portfolios. New and renewed loan production remained solid, while previous headwinds associated with portfolio reshaping efforts subsided. ","In addition, recently implemented process redesign and improvement efforts focused on accelerating commercial credit decisioning, also led to loan growth. All three businesses within our corporate banking group, which includes corporate, middle market commercial and real estate experienced loan growth across our geographic markets.","Average loan growth was led by C&I across many sectors, particularly within our specialized lending and also within middle market commercial businesses. The investor real estate portfolio reversed trend and contributed modest average loan growth, driven primarily by growth in term real estate lending. Further, owner-occupied commercial real estate loans appeared to have reached an inflection point as average loan balances remained relatively stable in the quarter.","Consumer lending produced consistent loan growth across most categories, led again this quarter by our point-of-sale partnerships as well as solid increases in residential mortgage and direct vehicle and consumer credit card lending.","Let's move on to deposits. We continue to execute a deliberate strategy to optimize our deposit base by focusing on growing low cost consumer and relationship-based business services deposits, while reducing certain higher cost retail brokered and trust collateralized sweep deposits. Total average deposits declined 1% compared to the second quarter and 3% compared to the prior year. The linked-quarter decline was primarily attributable to seasonal decreases, whereas a year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to strategic reductions as well as corporate customers continuing to use liquidity to pay down debt or invest in their businesses.","Importantly, our teams continued to successfully grow net new consumer checking accounts, households, wealth relationships and corporate customers. For the full year, we continue to expect relatively stable average deposit balances, excluding retail brokered and wealth institutional services deposits.","During the third quarter, interest bearing deposit costs increased 6 basis points and total deposit costs increased only 3 basis points. Cumulative deposit betas through the current rising rate cycle remained low at 15%. Year-to-date deposit betas were 23% and we anticipate modest increases in the fourth quarter. While we expect deposit betas to increase, we continue to believe our large retail deposit franchise differentiates us in the marketplace and positions us to maintain a lower deposit beta relative to peers.","Now, let's look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income increased 2% over the prior quarter and net interest margin increased 1 basis point to 3.50%. Both net interest income and margin benefited from higher market interest rates, partially offset by increased wholesale funding, which included expense associated with debt issued during the quarter. Net interest income also benefited from higher average loan balances.","Looking to the fourth quarter, recent loan growth, the high likelihood of another rate increase in December, and an expectation for a modest increase in deposit costs, should result in a continuation of recent growth trends in net interest income and a 3 to 5 basis point expansion of net interest margin, putting us solidly within our 5% to 6% NII growth expectations for the year.","We also experienced a good quarter as it relates to fee revenue. Adjusted non-interest income increased 1% from the second quarter as increases in service charges, market value adjustments on employee benefit assets, and other non-interest income were partially offset by decreases in capital markets and mortgage income. The increase in other non-interest income was primarily attributable to a net $5 million increase in the value of certain equity investments, and a $2 million net gain on the sale of low income housing tax credit investments. Other non-interest income also benefited from a $4 million decrease in operating lease impairment charges. For of the full year, we continue to expect adjusted non-interest income growth between 4.5% to 5.5%.","Let's move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expense decreased 3% compared to the second quarter. Most expense categories reflected a modest reduction in the quarter, with the primary contributors being a reduction in salaries and benefits, and lower expense associated with Visa Class B shares sold in the prior year. The adjusted efficiency ratio improved approximately 230 basis points this quarter to 58.1% and through the first nine months of 2018 is 59.7%, below our full year target.","Also through the first nine months of 2018, we generated adjusted positive operating leverage of 3.4%. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted positive operating leverage of 3.5% to 4.5% and relatively stable adjusted expenses. The third quarter effective tax rate was 18.7%. It was favorably impacted by retrospective tax accounting method changes finalized in the quarter. Our full year effective tax rate expectation remains unchanged at approximately 21%.","Let's shift to asset quality. Overall asset quality remained stable during the third quarter. Total non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased to 0.66% of loans outstanding, the lowest level in over 10 years and business services' classified loans decreased 7%. Business services' criticized loans as well as total troubled debt restructured and past due loans increased modestly.","Net charge-offs increased 8 basis points to 0.40% of average loans. The provision for loan losses approximated net charge-offs and the resulting allowance totaled 1.03% of total loans and 156% of total non-accrual loans. While overall asset quality remains benign, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected. ","Through the first nine months of 2018, net charge-offs totaled 38 basis points. With respect to the full year, we continue to expect net charge-offs to be towards the lower end of our 35 to 50 basis point range.","So brief comments related to capital and liquidity. Through open market purchases and our previously disclosed accelerated share repurchase agreement, we've repurchased approximately 60 million shares of common stock during the third quarter. We also completed the sale of our Regions' insurance subsidiary. The resulting after-tax gain was $196 million and is reflected as a component of discontinued operations.","Regarding 2018 expectations, our full year expectations, which we updated in mid-September, remain unchanged. They are summarized on the slide for your reference.","So a quick summary. We are very pleased with our third quarter results. Believe we are on track to achieve our 2018 expectations and have good momentum as we head into 2019 and beyond.","With that, we're happy to take your questions, but do ask that you limit them to one primary and one follow-up question. We'll now open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari ","Just on the expense side, I wanted to talk little bit more about the efficiency ratio. I know you're currently in the 50 range and you're expecting below -- still below 60 for the full year of '18. When you look at '19, just given your expense efforts but also your -- some of the momentum you have in the top-line, where do you think that can go? And then longer term, do you think a mid-50s is still an appropriate goal beyond that? Thanks.","David Turner ","Hey, John. This is David. Yes, so we had a nice improvement on our efficiency ratio in the quarter. We continue to expect our efficiency ratio will improve throughout the year and into 2019. We had mentioned that we thought getting into the mid-50s was a reasonable goal for us over time, helped in part by our efficiency efforts, continuous improvement and lift in revenue from rates and the efforts we have to grow revenue through our investments. So, we still believe mid-50s at this point is a good target. Over time maybe we get below that. But we're going to update all of that for you in February typically.","John Pancari ","Okay. Alright. Thanks. And then, separately, on the loan growth side, I want to get a little bit more thoughts on -- a little bit more color on, where you're seeing the strongest demand? And we are hearing that a good number of the banks like pay downs are still relatively elevated and they are impacting their growth outlooks, while others are also flagging a competitive backdrop and lowering their guidance, given the competitive dynamics. It doesn't seem that you're seeing that in a profound way. And so, I wanted to get some of your -- some of the color you have around those factors? Thanks.","John Turner ","Yes. John, this is John. I would say, we continue to remain optimistic about our ability to deliver on our commitment to low single-digit loan growth on an adjusted basis. Loan growth was pretty broad-based, particularly within the wholesale business this quarter. So about -- if you adjust for the run-off and dealer indirect, about 1% growth in consumer and almost 2% in the wholesale book, we are not facing the headwinds that we had been facing that were the result primarily of our own derisking activities. So, we predicted that we would likely hit a bottom in investor real estate sometime in the second quarter. We did and we began to see a little pickup in activity there. And so, grew a little in the second quarter and that growth continued in the third quarter.","Similarly, within our commercial banking activities and corporate banking, the growth has been broad-based across our specialized industry groups, our diversified industries teams, manufacturing, distribution and across our geographies. I would tell you that it is very competitive despite the fact that we grew, we passed on about half as much business as we actually produced and the reason we passed was primarily because of pricing or some other structural element. We didn't experience the paydowns in the third quarter that others have talked about, but we very much did in the first and second quarter of this year, and you might remember in the third and fourth quarter of 2017. So it is very competitive, compensation comes from a variety of sources. But we have really solid pipelines and I feel good about our ability to deliver on low single-digit adjusted loan growth for the year.","John Pancari ","Okay. And one more thing, could that low single-digits move up to the mid-single, as you think about '19?","John Turner ","We are still committed to low single-digit loan growth, John. We think it's important to be very disciplined, to be very prudent about what we booked, focus on client selectivity and risk-adjusted returns. We don't need a lot of loan growth to achieve our stated objectives. And so -- and we are going to be careful and thoughtful about what we book and so our targets are still low single-digit at this point.","John Pancari ","Got it. Alright. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O'Connor ","You guys used a lot your 2018 CCAR approval buybacks this quarter, but your capital levels are still high and obviously the market is selling off overall here, including your stock. I'm just wondering about thoughts in terms of going back asking for more and how aggressive you could be on that front?","David Turner ","Yes, Matt. So we have our targeted capital range that we've spared before in common equity Tier 1 in that 9.5%. We've been working towards that. As you know, when you follow a CCAR plan that we did and receive an objection that had timing built into that as to when we would buy those shares back as well as have our dividend increased. So in order to change that, we would have to have a resubmission. We think we're on a good guide path right now, given where we are. We made a lot of progress this quarter, as you laid out. Our repurchase program will be completed in the fourth quarter and we can be in the market executing on our next quarter plan after earnings, so our share -- our accelerated share repurchase program I was referring to.","Matthew O'Connor ","Okay. When you say your repurchase program completed in 4Q you're talking about the ASR or you're \u2026.?","David Turner ","Yes. I want to clarify that, so the component part of the program, the piece of this accelerated share repurchase program will be completed in the fourth quarter. We have all our repurchases that are baked into our CCAR submission after that.","Matthew O'Connor ","Okay. And just to get thoughts on the 9.5% CET1 target, I suppose that was said maybe a couple of years ago and it seems like some of your peers have been guiding to, hopefully, getting into the call it 8% to 9% range.","John Turner ","Yes. Well, I think our peers are really all over the board. For us, it's incumbent upon us to keep the amount of capital we think we need to run our business and we will continue to update that each year, challenge ourselves, but we also have to be cognizant of where we are. We're nine years into an expansion. Next May it will be 10 years. And we think given our risk profile where we are and considering all other things at 9.5%, common equity Tier 1 is proper for us at this time. That being said, we'll be looking at that as we wrap up this year, then to the first quarter and we make any adjustments we deem appropriate at that time.","Matthew O'Connor ","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian ","Yes, good morning. Thank you. My first question is -- thank you for reminding us about your deposit base. And as we think about of further rate hikes from here, how should we think about the stickiness of your interest-free deposit balances? And I'm wondering if you could help us get a sense of the $35 billion in average interest-free deposit balance, how much of that would you call operational or part of checking accounts that are less vulnerable to mix shift?","John Turner ","Yes, Erika. I'll -- maybe I'll start. This is John. I would say to the question of how -- what percentage of our deposit balances we think are operational, 67% of all of our deposits are consumer deposits. We think approximately 93% of all of our consumer households maintain some sort of operating account balance with us. Obviously, on the wholesale side or corporate bank, all of those deposits, let's say in demand deposits, we think kind of as being operational. So I would believe that the vast majority of our demand deposits are in fact operational in nature.","When we look at our consumer book, one of the things that gives us a lot of confidence about our deposit gathering franchise and the strength of our customer base is that over the last year we've actually grown consumer demand by over 5%. We've grown consumer savings by about 7.3% and grown NOW deposits by over 1%. So despite the fact that we've been aggressively managing our interest cost, the core of our business, which is consumer operating deposits, has continued to grow as has checking accounts through the last 12 months.","David Turner ","Erika, I'll add. The non-interest bearing from a corporate standpoint, as mentioned in the prepared comments, we did see companies utilize their excess liquidity to pay down debt, to make fixed capital investments, and in some cases, seek higher yields that we were willing to pay. And so, we are not losing the customer, they're just choosing to seek the highest return as you would expect all treasurers to do. So, we think we have the ability to really gather deposits. We're looking at loan growth. We want to pair that off and our commitment is to grow our deposit base, our core deposit base commensurate with our loans over time, you may have a mismatch in the given quarter, but we feel good about where we are in terms of deposit growth looking out -- looking forward.","Erika Najarian ","Got it. And just as a follow-up to John's line of questioning. John, I was interested in -- when you answered the question about the amount of business that you passed on over during the quarter and I'm wondering if you could give us a sense as it's much talked about this quarter on the level of non-bank competition that you are experiencing. And perhaps, David, if you could give us a sense of any residual exposure on balance sheet, your leverage lending or sponsor backed term facilities?","David Turner ","Yes. So we are seeing competition from non-banks in the real estate mortgage space or commercial real estate mortgage space, the life insurance companies, and commercial banking activities largely around M&A, sponsor-based transactions from business development corporations, private equity backed funds, and that is having some impact on our business. But as said by John, the impact was more significant in the first part of the year, particularly in quarter one and in parts of quarter two, particularly with respect to the commercial mortgage business. And on an ongoing basis we continue to see private equity backed funds take more risk in the leverage space than we're willing to take. And as a consequence, we would think that or suggest that our exposure to leveraged lending and to sponsor backed transactions is very reasonable at about 20% of our leverage exposure down from over 35% about a year ago. So, we've continued to reduce our exposure to sponsor-based leveraged loans and in part that's a function of risk selection and I think a part of reflection of just their activity in the marketplace.","Erika Najarian ","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott ","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The other consumer indirect bucket continues to be a helpful driver of growth. Can you maybe start just remind us what is in that and what's been driving the growth there?","David Turner ","Sure. So, we have indirect coming from a couple of different places. We have indirect auto and then we have indirect other, which is our point-of-sale initiative that we have with several entities. We continue to experience good growth there and good economics on that portfolio. We continue to challenge ourselves on that -- on all of our portfolios. The profitability on indirect auto has been challenged. We are a prime -- super prime book, and all the losses are improved. The economics there are -- have been challenging and we're continuing to look at that, yields are growing a bit for us there. So those are really the two kind of point-of-sale in indirect auto as two good categories Geoff.","John Turner ","Yes. I would just add. We got into that business to -- because we began to see consumer preferences develop and evolve. We wanted to learn largely what was going on in that space. We've established some internal concentration limits to manage our exposure to effectively consumer indirect, unsecured lending, I think it's to-date good for us. David suggested the credit quality has been good, returns have been good, and we've learned some things through observation and on the balance sheet a little bit.","Geoffrey Elliott ","Thanks. It looks like it's been a pretty important driver of the NII growth. On those concentration limits, how much are you willing to see the portfolio grow?","John Turner ","I don't recall that we have necessarily been public about the limits we've established, but we don't expect the portfolio to grow whole lot more than its current size.","Geoffrey Elliott ","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin ","Thanks. Good morning, guys. First question, just a follow-up on the liability side. David, you said you issued the debt this quarter and you had some ins and outs about deposits that led to a little bit more on the FHLBs, which might happen quarter-to-quarter. But I'm just wondering in terms of the structure of the liability side and the capital stack, where are you in terms of the efficiency on the right side of the balance sheet in terms of that mix of long-term debt? How much more you would be issuing naturally over time and whether preferred has become a more likelihood as that capital ratio grows into itself? Thanks.","David Turner ","Yes, Ken. So, we did -- that we are opportunistic with regards to our $1.5 billion that we raised recently, some in the holding company and some in the bank to take advantage of FDIC costs. As we look out at our plan for the holding company, we'll have another debt issuance in the holding company probably in the first quarter and that number will be in the $500 million range.","But from a preferred standpoint, we have to -- there are a lot of moving targets in terms of preferred. We need to see what happens from a capital standpoint. We have a lot going on all the regulators and we need to see what happens with the buffer in terms of whether or not we need to issue and how much and when. So you need to stay tuned a little bit on the preferred offering in the -- which may or may not occur in the second half of the year if it occurs.","Ken Usdin ","Understood. Okay. And then my follow-up is just on, coming back to the left side of the balance sheet and the mix of earning assets, you've kept the investment portfolio pretty stable here for a bit now, now that the loans have started to turn up, can you just talk about what you're doing in the investment portfolio? What your kind of front-book, back-book looks like and are you comfortable with the size of it at this point?","David Turner ","Well, let me talk more about the total left side of the balance sheet. So, our securities book, we feel good about where that is. Obviously, we want to comply with LCR, to the extent some of that gets changed regulatorily, maybe we can put certain of those investment securities in a little healthier return than some of the securities we have today, Ginnie Mae securities as an example.","But in terms of front-book, back-book, we have about $14 billion of assets that are repricing over the next 12 months, that repricing of securities and loans, and that's a pickup of the 75 to 100 basis points even if rates don't move. If rates stay right where they are right now and that's a pretty good tailwind to us from an NII growth and resulting margin as well. We've been able to give you the confidence that we could hit our NII growth goals for this year and of course we'll update those for the next year later on, but that's important to note.","Ken Usdin ","Alright. Thanks a lot, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez ","Hi. Good morning, everybody. I could -- just on credit quality, it obviously 40 basis points, still very low. You did see a bit of an uptick, but still within sort of the guidance range. But any -- can you give us any color on the uptick and any areas of your portfolio you just feel may have more risk than others, just sort of a -- just a general view on where you think credit quality is heading?","Barb Godin ","Yes. Saul, it's Barb Godin. Relative to the uptick, it was related really to two credits, nothing systemic in the portfolio that we see, but two credits drove that uptick. And for the rest of the portfolio, it was well behaved, remained in good condition, moving on the right direction. And as we think about the future in terms of fourth quarter as well, we don't see anything major on the horizon, and again, feel good about our guidance of 35 to 50 basis points. And as you mentioned, 40 is still right there in the middle of our guidance.","John Turner ","I would just add. When you look at our overall credit metrics, we continue to see improvement in the level of classified assets, the level of non-performing loans, a little uptick in criticized loans this quarter. That to Barb's point does not reflect anything systemic at all and all the results reflect the outcome of the recent [stake exam].","Saul Martinez ","Got it. If I could just sort of stay on the theme of credit quality, I know you guys have been critical on certain aspects of CECL, but where are you -- can you just give a sense where you are in terms of your preparation? When do you think -- assuming there are no fundamental changes to how CECL works, when do you think you'll have a rough estimate of what the financial impact could be?","David Turner ","Yes. Saul, this is David. So we've been -- we spend an awful lot of time and effort on our modeling and leveraging some of the CCAR models and building some new ones. We are in pretty good shape. We are clerking third-parties to make sure we do this right and we'll be running parallel, we'll start that in 2019, we'll adjust and learn, so that we're prepared for January 2020.","As you know, there are discussions on CECL and whether or not there may or may not be modifications to the standard, whether or not there may be a delay or not, we'll just have to see, but it's incumbent upon us to be prepared either way. And as far as when we'll be prepared to give that guidance? We really -- before we do that, we want to make sure our models are reflective of our best numbers we can come out with. So it will be in the 2019, probably no earlier than the middle of the year and we'll just have to see how things develop before we can give you that kind of guidance.","Saul Martinez ","Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck ","Could we talk a little bit on the expense side, I know in the prepared remarks you've highlighted the operating leverage and the outlook. But maybe if you could give us a sense of the drivers and if this is going to be taking place in the near term due to Simplify and Grow or is this something that is a little bit longer-tailed with regard to acceleration in operating leverage?","David Turner ","Yes, Betsy. So there are several things working on operating leverage and efficiency, the revenue side and the expense side. Let me start with revenue. We continue to make investments to grow revenue, those investments are in people and in technology, making investments in higher growth markets for new branches, and we do pay for those investments and so we've been leveraging our continuous improvement process that we started out for Simplify and Grow. It's going to continue. This is something we want to culturally advantage. How do we get better each and every day through process improvement, leveraging technology? A big part of the expense side has been savings and the SMB line item that you saw this past quarter, which we told you about beginning of the year that you'd see the benefits of that in the third quarter, you'd see it again in the fourth quarter. We're substantially through with the larger numbers of headcount reductions. You'll see some, but not to the degree that you saw thus far through the nine months to September.","And then from there we have to continue to become more efficient. And getting back to John's earlier comment on the efficiency ratio, where you think you can go? I just think our industry will continue to become more efficient leveraging all the new technologies that are out there to get efficiency ratio, which we think we could target in the mid-50s. We'll see if we can get better than that over time. But that's with a healthy revenue growth in making investments to grow our business are really important to us.","Betsy Graseck ","And then just on the NIM outlook, I know we talked through some of the drivers including securities book. Can you give us a sense as to how stickier you think are uplifts that you're looking for in 4Q, can persist going forward?","David Turner ","Well, our margin of 3.50% is better than most of our peers. And so, it gets harder as you have a -- if you continue to outperform, it gets harder to keep outperforming. That being said, we are leveraging what we see as our competitive deposit base, continuing to make investments to grow earning assets, in particular the loan portfolio as you saw this quarter. So leveraging off of that in the future growth that we see should help us and obviously we think December has a pretty high probability of a rate increase in that. And so, if LIBOR starts moving 30 days prior to December rate increase and you will see that benefit even more. Our beta has outperformed and we do expect our beta to get higher, to continue to increase the pace of which we'll see what happens. For the year, we're only at -- cycled to-date about 15%. So, we think that continues to increase, that is baked into our guidance already that we've given you and we think that that continues to help propel us to continue to grow NII in the fourth quarter and into 2019.","Betsy Graseck ","Okay. And LIBOR has actually widened a little bit recently, so maybe that's a tailwind into 4Q or are you already have that baked into your 4Q outlook?","David Turner ","We have that baked in already.","Betsy Graseck ","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy ","Thank you. Good morning, David; and good morning, John. Can you guys share with us, when we go back and look at your numbers as well as your peers\u2019 for the last 20 years on non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits, the industry and yourself included has seen a significant increase in that percentage, in fact with you guys and post the merger of course, it looks like it's running around 19%, 20%, right around that time in '07, '08, now it's obviously in the mid-30s, so I think it was 38% this quarter. Is there something structurally different with the customers that they keep that -- that you're able to garner much more of your deposits and non-interest bearing?","David Turner ","So Gerard, we have really focused on continuing to grow customer accounts, demand deposit checking accounts, we've been very good at that. We've grown checking accounts this year, about 1.5%. And so, we think that that will continue. We expect that to continue. Our non-interest bearing demand deposits have also grown over time. We have seen that shrink as have all of our peers this past quarter. We performed a little better than most -- and again as because we see large companies putting that non-interest bearing to work either to pay down debt, make fixed capital investments or reinvest some higher earning securities. We do think that the non-interest bearing will be higher than history. We think as companies have gone through the liquidity scare that we had in a way that people are thinking differently about their liquidity. We think we'll see it for right, but we think people will hold on to more of that liquidity and leverage up versus using it all and then leverage it, at least that's our assumption, we'll see how that plays out. But I think it's going back to that liquidity scare in 2008. That's a little bit of a change in terms of how people think about it.","John Turner ","Yes. I'd agree with that Gerard. I'd also offer -- I mentioned 67% of our deposits are consumer deposits, 93% of our consumer households have a primary operating, what we would consider a quality primary operating account with us. The average balances in our deposit accounts are more granular we think than some of our peers. It reflects the markets that we're in, it reflects the type customers that we're banking and we think that that's a competitive advantage. It in fact does result in our maintaining more demand deposits, let's say, in the consumer space in some regard than we did before and it is a real strength of our franchise.","Gerard Cassidy ","Very good. And then on the other side of the balance sheet, you guys have been very frank and candid about what happens in the investor real estate portfolio post the financial crisis and the recession and you've been clear about winding down to a level that you're comfortable with, which seems as you pointed out the inflection point might be in this quarter. So as we move forward, what type of projects are you guys looking at on the investor real estate, whether it's the construction projects or the investor real estate mortgage area and I think John, you said you didn't really give any guidance on how big it allow different portfolios to grow to as a percentage of total portfolio. But in this one, I don't know if you'd be willing to disclose how big you would allow this one to grow to again as a percentage of the total portfolio?","David Turner ","Yeah. Today, it's in the 7 plus percent sort of range as a percentage of total and I think we'd expect it to stay there to grow potentially up modestly as a percentage of total. You might remember that, now going back almost three years, we committed to try and change the mix of business within investor real estate. In 2014, 85% of our production was construction primarily of multifamily and we began to work that level of production down. It had a significant impact on balances as you see and so our balances have significantly declined. We did reach a point in the second quarter when we began to -- I think it was in part because of seasoning, again to have the opportunity to win a few more commercial mortgage opportunities. And those are typically going to be financing season properties with stabilized cash flows largely on multi-family office projects. We have some retail exposure, but most of what we're doing is multi-family office and some industrial and with that comes full relationship. So we pickup deposit balances, we pickup opportunities to generate fee income through our capital market, secondary market offerings, placement products. And so, we think it's a business we want to grow sort of with the economy, maybe plus or little as it provides a lot of ancillary opportunities, but again it won't grow to be too much larger as a percentage of the total than it is today.","Gerard Cassidy ","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter ","Good morning. I just wanted to ask another question on expenses. You had a nice drop in expenses in the third quarter, do you think they could drop a little bit more in the fourth quarter given the full quarter benefit of the headcount reduction? And then looking at 2019, would you expect expenses to be kind of flat, maybe even down a little, just given a full year benefit of the lower headcount?","David Turner ","Yes, Peter. I think really focusing on improvements in the efficiency ratios and by the way to answer your question, we are making investments, as I mentioned earlier, to grow revenues, make investments in higher growth markets. We're trying to pay for that, keep our expenses relatively stable as we mentioned for the year, which means we have to have reductions in other places to pay for those investments. So, I -- we feel good about where we're going to end up for the year, fourth quarter already strong, and we'll now end up and update you on 2019, actually for the next three years, in February.","Peter Winter ","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. I will turn the call back over to John Turner for closing remarks.","John Turner ","Okay. Well, thank you very much.

My name is Shelby and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions\u2019 first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. John Turner will provide highlights of our financial performance and David Turner will take you through an overview of the quarter. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and earnings supplement, are available under the investor relations section of our regions.com. Our forward-looking statements disclosure and non-GAAP reconciliations are included in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and within our SEC filings. These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of today\u2019s call.","With that, I will now turn the call over to John.","John Turner","Thank you, Dana and thank you all for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying we are pleased with our first quarter results. The momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter has continued in the 2019. We reported earnings from continuing operations of $378 million delivering solid year-over-year revenue growth, broad-based loan growth and stable, but normalizing acid quality, all while reducing expenses and generating positive operating leverage.","Loans grew somewhat faster than we anticipated in the quarter, driven in part by increased line utilization by our business customers. We intentionally funded a portion of this incremental loan growth with commercial and corporate treasury deposits and while this was more economical than also borrowings, deposit costs were impacted during the quarter. We expect loan growth will moderate through the remainder of the year, providing opportunities to optimize our deposit mix.","With respect to the economy, we feel good about the health of the consumer and businesses. I\u2019ve traveled across our footprint in the last few weeks to markets including Tampa, West Palm Beach, Atlanta, Nashville, Houston, Greenville and Spartanburg, South Carolina and Mobile, Alabama. I\u2019ve met with clients of varying sizes and industries, and customer sentiment remains positive. Many customers experienced record revenues in 2018 and are expecting even better results in 2019. In general, our clients do not expect a recession in the near-term and neither do we.","That being said, we remain focused on building a balance sheet that will position us for consistent and sustainable performance through all phases of the economic cycle. The outlook for the interest rate environment continues to evolve. clearly, the lower rates and the shape of the yield curve makes near-term revenue growth more challenging for the industry. However, as we did over the last four, five years, we will make the necessary changes and adapt to the evolving market conditions.","In the meantime, we\u2019ll continue to focus on the things we can control, providing customers with the quality financial products and services they need, maintaining appropriate risk-adjusted returns, prudently managing our interest rate sensitivity profile, and effectively controlling expenses while continuing to make investments in technology and talent. Again, we are pleased with our financial results this quarter. Our focus on continuous improvement remains key to our ability to generate consistent and sustainable long-term performance.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to David.","David Turner","Thank you, John. Let\u2019s begin on Slide 3 with average loans and deposits. Adjusted average loans increased 2% over the prior quarter, driven by broad-based growth and the business lending portfolio, and relatively stable balances across a consumer lending portfolio. Once again, all three areas within our corporate banking group experienced broad-based loan growth across industries and geographic markets. adjusted average business loan growth was led by a 4% increase in adjusted commercial and industrial loans, where growth was driven by our diversified specialized lending and REIT lending portfolios.","Average investor real estate loans grew 8% in the first quarter, while average owner-occupied commercial real estate loans declined 4%. both were impacted by a reclassification of approximately $345 million of senior assisted living balances from owner-occupied commercial real estate to investor real estate at the end of last year.","Excluding the impact of this reclassification, average investor real estate loans increased approximately 3% driven by growth in term real estate lending, which is consistent with our strategic initiative to achieve better balance between term and construction lending. As John noted, a 160 basis point increase in line utilization also significantly contributed to this quarter\u2019s loan growth.","With respect to consumer, adjusted average loans remained relatively stable as growth in indirect-other consumer and credit card portfolios was offset by a decline in home equity lending. Average mortgage loans remained relatively stable. However, the sale of $167 million of affordable housing residential mortgage loans late in the first quarter, will impact second quarter average balances.","Despite solid growth this quarter, we continue to expect full year 2019 adjusted average loan growth in the low single digits. And with respect to deposits, we continue to execute a deliberate strategy focusing on growing low-cost consumer and relationship-based wealth and business services deposits.","Total average deposits increased 1% during the quarter, reflecting 1% growth in consumer and 2% growth in corporate, partially offset by declines in wealth and other. Importantly, our bankers continuing to grow new consumer checking accounts and consumer households as well as corporate deposit accounts and total wealth relationships.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at the composition of our deposit base. To protect our deposit advantage, we continue to execute strategies to ensure we are effectively serving our customers. These strategies facilitated growth in interest bearing checking, money market and time deposits at the end of last year, which contributed to total average deposit growth this quarter.","Increasing deposit rates combined with overall deposit growth and portfolio remixing drove an increase in total deposit costs this quarter to 46 basis points. Despite the increase, we remain well-positioned relative to peers, further illustrating the significant funding advantage provided by our deposit base. Our cumulative interest bearing deposit beta increased to 25% this quarter. assuming no additional rate increases from the Federal Reserve, we expect a through the cycle deposit beta in the low 30% range.","Retail deposits include consumer and private wealth deposits. Our cumulative retail interest bearing deposit beta increased to 10% this quarter, while our cumulative consumer deposit beta remained low at just 6%. As previously noted, a portion of this quarter\u2019s loan growth was funded with commercial deposits contributing to additional pressure on overall deposit costs. However, we remain committed to our long-term return targets and we will continue to optimize both sides of the balance sheet.","So, let\u2019s look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income decreased 1% over the prior quarter and net interest margin decreased two basis points to 3.53, both net interest income and margin benefited from higher market interest rates offset by higher funding cost, including the impact from our January parent company debt issuance. Net interest income also benefited from higher average loan balances, both negatively impacted by two fewer days in the quarter. Net interest margin, however benefited from fewer days, but was negatively impacted by average commercial loan growth.","In the current interest rate environment, growth and net interest income and margin will be driven by balance sheet growth and business mix. With respect to net interest margin, rates consistent with the current yield curve and moderate balance sheet growth is expected to generate a relatively stable to modestly lower full-year margin, implying moderate margin compression for the rest of 2019.","With that said, we continue to expect full-year adjusted revenue growth of 2% to 4%. With respect to fee revenue, adjusted non-interest income increased 4% this quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Significant asset valuation declines in the fourth quarter associated with market volatility improved in the first quarter. Variable market value adjustments on total employee benefit assets increased $19 million while also contributing to an $11 million increase in bank-owned life insurance income.","The increase in bank-owned life insurance also included the additional claims income compared to the prior quarter. As we look forward, we are taking actions to reduce future volatility associated with certain of these assets. Service charges and card and ATM fees declined 5% and 2% respectively reflecting seasonality and fewer days in the quarter.","Capital markets income decreased 16% attributable to lower loan syndication income and fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers, partially offset by an increase in merger and acquisition advisory services, and higher revenues associated with debt underwriting. As you know, capital markets income can be volatile for quarter to quarter. However, we do expect an increase in the second quarter.","mortgage production and sales revenue increased compared to the prior quarter. However, total mortgage income decreased 10% primarily due to lower hedging and valuation adjustments on residential mortgage servicing rights. Other non-interest come includes an $8 million gain associated with a sale of $167 million of affordable housing residential mortgage loans late in the first quarter. In addition, fourth quarter other non-interest income included a net $3 million decline in the value of certain equity investments and a $5 million loss associated with impairment or disposal of lease assets.","Let\u2019s move on to expenses, which we believe were well-controlled in the quarter. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expense increased 1% compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to a 2% increase in salaries and benefits reflecting higher payroll taxes as well as an increase in expense associated with Visa Class B shares sold in a prior year.","Partially offsetting these increases, occupancy expense decreased 5% primarily due to fourth quarter\u2019s storm-related charges associated with Hurricane Michael. Furniture and equipment expense decreased 7% primarily due to a benefit in property taxes recorded during the quarter and professional fees decreased 26% driven primarily by a reduction in consulting fees. The adjusted efficiency ratio was 58.3% and the effective tax rate was approximately 21%. For the full year, we continue to expect relatively stable adjusted expenses and an effective tax rate between 20% and 22%.","let\u2019s shift to asset quality. in line with our expectations, asset quality remained stable while continuing to normalize this quarter. Net charge-offs improved 8 basis points to 0.38% of our average loans. including the impact of loan growth, the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge-offs resulting in an allowance equal to 1.01% of total loans and 163% of total non-accrual loans.","Total delinquent loans decreased $102 million as loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased $106 million while loans 90 days or more past due increased modestly. total non-performing loans excluding loans held for sale increased 2 basis points to 0.62% of loans outstanding. business services criticized and troubled debt restructured loans increased $197 million and $27 million respectively. These results include the recently concluded Shared National Credit exam. While overall asset quality remains within our stated risk appetite, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected. We continue to expect full-year net charge-offs in the 40 to 50 basis point range.","So, let me give you some brief comments related to capital and liquidity. During the quarter, the company repurchased 12.2 million shares of common stock for a total of $190 million through open market purchases and declared $142 million in dividends to common shareholders.","We continue to execute our 2018 capital plan that as you know, we\u2019re not required to participate in the 2019 CCAR process. However, we were required to provide our updated planned capital actions to the federal Reserve in early April. These planned capital actions, which remained subject to approval by our Board of Directors, provide a path for us to achieve our targeted 9.5% common equity Tier 1 ratio this year. At quarter-end, the loan deposit ratio remained unchanged at 88% and the company continued to be fully compliant with liquidity coverage ratio rule. Our full-year 2019 expectations provided at Investor Day remained unchanged and are summarized on this slide for your reference.","So in summary, we are pleased with our first quarter financial results. Despite market uncertainties, we are focused on things we can control. We have a solid strategic plan and are committed to achieving our 2019 and long-term targets.","With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions, but do ask that you limit them to one primary and one follow-up question. We will now open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","John Turner","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks. David, just on your comments about the outlook for the changing rate environment and the potential pressures that brings forth, can you talk through where that manifests itself the most? Is it the investment portfolio? is it loan spreads? And if you could go back a little bit further into that ability to kind of remix those deposits as you move through the year? Thanks.","David Turner","Sure, Ken. So yes, we\u2019ve looked at the rate environment clearly changed, since going into the year, not anything different than we\u2019ve experienced before as we showed you at Investor Day. We had a three-year outlook, if rates were lower than we thought and we adapted and overcame that and we\u2019ll do it again this time. As we think about rates, from a reinvestment standpoint, we still have a front book, back book benefit, is not as much as it was originally. But we still benefit from that. In this particular quarter, we had a couple of things that impacted us. We had loan growth that was a little stronger than we had anticipated with 160 basis point increase in line utilization. We had to fund that and we chose to fund that with higher cost deposits versus going to the wholesale market.","So, if you look at deposit betas, that caused our deposit base to be up. our overall funding beta is kind of in line with peers. But we thought that was the right thing to do. The loans that we put on were a little center spread, which puts a little pressure on our margin. The margin actually was impacted by our parent company Danish once we had in the first quarter, as well as a reclassification of purchasing card assets that don\u2019t carry any interest carry. those two things were two basis points of margin in the quarter.","So, as we look forward, what we need to do is continue to remix the balance sheet both on the loan side and the deposit side as we seek to optimize both levels to get our net interest income, where we want being in the resulting margin. I will go ahead and answer the question, because it\u2019s probably coming up that our margin expectation for the year, we believe to be a commensurate with what we had last year in the 3.50 range, give or take a point or two. So, that\u2019s kind of how we see the rates and our expectations for the year.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Okay. And then one follow-up on the loans. You\u2019ve reiterated that with a good start to the loan growth, the adjusted loan growth. Can you give us an idea of just the summary of the non-core, the combination of the auto stuff and then the new ones you sold than what you expect that would be on the full year? Thanks, David.","David Turner","Yes. So we\u2019re still guiding on the adjusted loans with cards out the runoff portfolios to be in the low single digits. You\u2019ll see some of the remixing there. A little bit of that growth that you saw in the first quarter where companies that have access to the capital markets that chose to come to the bank market, because it\u2019s cheaper.","We expect that to change over time and so you should expect some runoff there. And we\u2019ll refill that still to get our low single digit \u2013 low single-digit growth. The auto book continues to run down. We\u2019ll be in the $700 million, $800 million range on those runoff portfolios.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore.","John Turner","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Yes. Good morning. John, on that point, on the deposit and margin commentary there, given the loan growth you saw on the quarter, you said it came in a little bit better, why did you make the decision to fund that growth with higher cost funding versus a deposit?","John Turner","What we \u2013 what I said was we chose to have \u2013 fund that with higher cost deposits versus wholesale funding, because the deposit growth was cheaper than what funding was. What I was trying to address is the deposit beta was negatively impacted, because of that decision. If you look at our total funding beta, our total funding beta was fairly consistent with the peers. So, it\u2019s just a mix of what we chose to fund that growth with versus what somebody else might have done.","John Pancari","Okay. Thank you. And I misunderstood that. I just wanted to get clarity on that, okay. And then separately, around the loan growth expectation for the year and that you expect it to slow from here; could you just talk about some of the give and takes, what you think will drive to the net moderation off of this level versus any incremental, strengthening on the commercial side for example.","David Turner","Yes. So, as John mentioned in his comments, we feel good about \u2013 our customers feel good about the economy and they\u2019re continuing to borrow. We had and that increase we saw part of that this first quarter. Again, we\u2019re \u2013 customers we believe have access, we know have access to the capital markets that chose to use their bank lines of credit to give them more flexibility in terms of timing on when they would go to the capital market system.","It\u2019s just a matter of time before that happens. So, we\u2019re going to see those loans run out of the bank as we continue to grow consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year. So, when you get net-net to the end of the year, we think net loan growth is still on that single, the low single digits.","John Pancari","Okay. thanks, David. And one last thing on credit, could you just give us a bit of color about around the drivers of the higher classified in special mentioned loans. And then I guess your thought around the longer-term loan loss reserve level of here. I know it stands around 1.01%, I wanted to get your thoughts on where that could trend to?","Barb Godin","Certainly, John. It\u2019s Barb Godin. relative to criticized and classified in terms of those numbers, that\u2019s attributable to really two or three credits that moved over, and given the lows that were on, it\u2019s simply starting to slowly normalize. Also recall that our results include the results of the recently completed Shared National Credits survey or credit exam. So that\u2019s all encompassing. We don\u2019t see any trends in there that we\u2019re looking at that concern us at all at this point. And in terms of our loan loss reserve, we\u2019re sitting at one-on-one; we think that area 1% one-on-one is probably the right number as we look forward as well until we get the seasonal next year.","John Pancari","Got it. Thank you, Barb.","David Turner","Yes. John, I would just reiterate that I think we still feel very good about our credit metrics. As Barb said, we\u2019re really a better than 10 year lows in terms of criticized, classified, non-performing loans. And so from time to time, we\u2019re going to see a little movement up or down I think in those metrics in this particular quarter, as Barb mentioned, we had one or two credits and impacted both criticized loans and non-performing loans. And so given the low base we\u2019re coming off, I think you\u2019re going to see some back and forth there, over the coming quarters as credit begins to normalize a bit, but we feel still feel very good about our credit quality.","John Pancari","Okay. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, good morning.","David Turner","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. I just had a question on your capital target. I know you mentioned that with the expectation that you have for buybacks this coming year, you should be able to get to 9.5% target seats you won. I\u2019m just wondering if given the proposal the Fed has for, its NPR that\u2019s outstanding out there for banks to your side, would you be at all rethinking the target seats you won at any point or is that something that you think you need to have it as high as 9.5% going forward?","David Turner","Yes, Betsy. We had mentioned at Investor Day that mathematically, our capital that we think we need based on the risk profile that we have, would lead one to a common equity Tier 1 of 9%. And we said to our \u2013 those attending and listen that we added another 50 basis points of cushion on that. We believe that that capital level one provides the proper capital we need to have plus a little bit. Wow, allowing us to get to our return expectations that we also laid out, so that those targets were not derived based on supervisory input or CCAR mechanism.","So, I don\u2019t see that changing at all. As you know, we have to get through the second quarter, which is based on last year submission. And then the third quarter, we\u2019ll start \u2013 we\u2019re not under CECL, but it\u2019ll start our capital planning and that\u2019s why we have confidence. We will get to our 9.5% by then. And we\u2019ll have \u2013 we\u2019ll be able to toggle between loan growth and share buybacks as we seek to manage the capital at that level.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Since the teams are very \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of cushion in there. So, I\u2019m wondering, maybe it reflects the view that you feel your portfolio might be a little more risky than peers or you\u2019re just superconservative.","David Turner","Well, as I mentioned our math, based on our risk profile would lead you to 9. We choose to have an extra 50 basis points in there, which we think gives us flexibility, especially as you think about, where we are in a 10 year run. And if the county were turned down, we have the ability to perhaps take advantage of some opportunities that might come our way to invest in the assets. they could give us growth. So, it\u2019s \u2013 we think inappropriate amount of cushion, because it didn\u2019t weigh us down from our return objectives and gives us that flexibility. So that\u2019s why we do it.","Betsy Graseck","Yes, I got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","David Turner","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the comments on capital actions. So, if we filled in the template that the Fed distributed or getting to about a max preapproved capital action of about 2.15 billion for 3Q 2019 to 2Q 2020. And I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s a ballpark with how your team calculated the template?","David Turner","Well, I think, again, the way we want you to get there is by looking at our target of common equity tier 1 of 9.5%. We think that the toggle we have to think through on buyback is what\u2019s loan growth going to look like. Now we\u2019ve said we wanted to pay out a dividend in the 35% to 45% of a range that uses a piece of it of earnings. and then the rest of it is either going to be used for loan growth or it\u2019s going for the most part or we\u2019re going to buy shares back. So, trying to now stipulate exactly what the buybacks going to be is when we don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary as much because we\u2019re giving you what the end result\u2019s going to be. So you have to \u2013 you have to come up with your expectation of what our loan growth is going to be and it\u2019ll help you get your buyback number.","Erika Najarian","I met all-in. Okay. And just taking a step back, you unveiled a mid-term efficiency ratio of 55% or below during your Investor Day. And of course, the curve dynamics have gotten less friendly since, I\u2019m wondering, as we think through the next few years, is there that much expense leverage left, to be able to get you to this target of less than 55% by 2021. Would this type of curve backdrop or are we underestimating some of the investments that you\u2019re making that could boost revenue beyond rates beyond 2019?","David Turner","Yes, Erika. I would say it\u2019s combination of both. First of all, we\u2019re committed to the 55% efficiency ratio by the end of 2021 and we believe we have appropriate levers both in terms of revenue growth from investments we\u2019re making and opportunities to reduce expenses to be reinvested in additional initiatives that will help generate revenue growth to get to the 55% efficiency ratio. We\u2019re absolutely committed to get there.","Erika Najarian","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","David Turner","Good morning, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","Hi. I\u2019m wondering where do market rates have to go to fly it out than them. obviously, you\u2019re guiding to flattish to them on a full-year basis, but trickling down from the 1Q level. And then just conceptually, and I realized that 10 year is not the only right that matters, but what\u2019s kind of the break-even point on the 10 year, where it does fly now that this kind of 3.53 that this is trickled down?","David Turner","Well, if you just think about the 10 year just on reinvestment that security\u2019s book. So, we\u2019re coming off a 2.70-ish range, reinvesting in the 2.90, the 3% range. So, we\u2019re getting some lift, just reinvesting those cash flows over the near-term. It\u2019s really not curved dynamics as much that drives versus the mix of what we put on both on the right and the left side of the balance sheet. So, I think you could have \u2013 you could be where rates are in the curve can look, where it is now and depending on what your choices are would depend on whether or not you can continue to grow an NII resulting margin or whether it stays flat. We\u2019re looking to optimize our balance sheet for not only NIM, but net interest income growth, return, credit risk management, all that has to work together. And again, we\u2019ve laid out our three-year expectations and our one-year expectation and we intend to kid all of that. So, there are a lot of moving parts that you have to deal with. And it\u2019s that\u2019s a hard one to explain.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. No, I understand. I think what\u2019s changed versus a few months ago is the rate environment versus I think your strategy, so \u2013 and obviously, rates, they move around and we\u2019re up to 20 bps off the bottom and maybe, two months from now, we\u2019ll be 20 bps higher and we\u2019re up about\u2026","David Turner","Yes, Matt. I\u2019d add, our expectation for that rates were going to go down at some point, which is why we began our hedging program over a year ago. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019re about 70 \u2013 we\u2019re about 75% through our hedging program right now. And we did that in large part with forward starting swaps to begin in 2020 as we expected GDP to decline to 2.5% in 2019, 2% in 2020 and 1% in 2021. And that the probability of rate cuts would increase in 2020 and 2021 and we wanted to be protected there. What you\u2019re seeing of late as a reversal from the Fed? And it put more pressure on not getting, not only not getting an increase this year, but having some probability of a cut this year, which we don\u2019t think will happen by the way. And so that that\u2019s really, where we\u2019re more exposed as if there were cut right now. Again, we\u2019ll take that risk, because we don\u2019t believe that\u2019ll happen.","John Turner","The other point, I guess I make just if I might on, a balance sheet optimization is we\u2019ve indicated we think that loan growth will begin to moderate a bit. At the same time, our core deposit base continues to grow very consistently. Consumer demand deposits grew over 4% last year. They\u2019re growing for the seventh year in a row point to point up about 7%. We see growth in consumer savings, consumer checking continues to grow. And so that\u2019s a more consistent to lever an increase in deposits that will occur over time and as that catches up with loan growth, which will be moderating. We have an opportunity to also optimize our deposit base and we think that will accrue to our benefit.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. I guess the optimization and the mix that you\u2019re talking about, I thought it would have been beneficial from them.","John Turner","Yes.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. But the combination of that and where we are in rates still causes it\u2019s trickled down a little bit.","David Turner","Well, I think you can ask some noise in the interim. Again, we\u2019re at 3.53, we said we\u2019d be at 3.50 for the year give or take a foreigner too. And it\u2019s going to be dependent on how well we optimize and the 10 year has moved quite rapidly, it\u2019s gone from 3.50 to almost 3.60. We\u2019re down a little bit this morning. So, if we continued \u2013 the 10 year continues to move up a little bit, then the reinvestment helps us to increase, net interest income and helps us from a margin standpoint.","Matt O'Connor","Got it. And then if you don\u2019t mind, I just want to squeeze in the line utilization increase of 160 basis point, was that concentrated in like a handful of credit and if not, I guess what makes you think it\u2019s going to decline so much to if you don\u2019t meaningfully slow the loan growth? It was so good this quarter. Thank you.","David Turner","Yes, Matt. I\u2019ll ask Ronnie Smith, who heads our Corporate Bank to answer the question. Ron?","Ronald Smith","Yes, Matt. It was very broad-based. It was not in a handful of clients and really focused in on most of our higher quality clients that I think David mentioned earlier that have access to other markets and we\u2019re anticipating that we\u2019ll see changes with those advance rates as we go forward, but very broad-based across the industries and within geographies as well.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust.","David Turner","Good morning, Jennifer.","Jennifer Demba","Thank you. And hi, good morning. Question on credit, Barb. Two questions. First of all, I assume you\u2019re running parallel right now. I\u2019m wondering if you have any preliminary estimates on what the day one impact will be for CECL. And my second question is on your criticized leverage loans that slide was very helpful in the deck. Is there any industry concentration within those criticized leverage credits? That\u2019s it.","Barb Godin","First question on CECL is, yes, we are in the midst of doing a lot of work, running parallel, making sure our models are operating the way they need to et cetera. We\u2019ll probably disclose something in the second quarter, but we\u2019re not quite ready to do that yet on the CECL front. Relative to the leverage loans et cetera, there\u2019s nothing that sticks out in terms of anything that\u2019s an anomaly. So, a pretty good book.","David Turner","Just for clarification, I think in our second quarter release, probably we\u2019ll provide some information on the third quarter \u2013 third quarter release, day one impact. So, we\u2019re still a ways off.","John Turner","It\u2019ll be in the third quarter release something. Yes. We want to run parallel for a couple of quarters to see what it looks like.","Jennifer Demba","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","David Turner","Good morning, Marty.","Marty Mosby","David, I wanted to \u2013 hey, good morning. I\u2019d talk to you a little bit about NII versus net interest margin. When you had a little bit of extra loan growth this quarter and then you went out and funded it, I mean you literally could have funded it through the securities portfolio, which would have increased your NIM, just by substituting higher rate assets, loans being investment securities.","So, I think the temporary nature of what you did or thought your loan growth is going to have and the sense of the run up, it\u2019s going to come back down. You just went out and funded it, which incrementally caused some pressure on your net interest margin. And if you look at NII is still growing relatively nice year-over-year, but you have the day count in the first quarter. So, it just seems like to me the margin this quarter was exacerbated just given all in the incremental funding of the balance sheet.","David Turner","Yes, Marty. So, the NIM to us is the result of all things that we do. And you\u2019re exactly right, but we put on, we want to be fixated at our NIM and then we could have done different things. I do want to make sure if I caught the fact that our NIM was impacted 1 basis point by our parent company issuance. And then we had the reclassification of our purchasing card into loans, which is a non-interest bearing asset. So that weighted us down another point. So, we could have kept the margin relatively stable at 3.55, but we were able to keep NII level, not withstanding two days, which caused us $10 million in the quarter. So, we thought it was pretty good. Again, we\u2019ll optimize the balance sheet and those loans that we did put certain of those loans we put on had thinner spreads to them. They\u2019ll run out to the capital markets, we\u2019ll get a capital market fee when that happens, we\u2019ll remix the balance sheet and we\u2019ll be off to the races. So, we\u2019re not overly fixated on the margin.","Marty Mosby","Well that\u2019s what I thought. And then when you thought, you talked about a deposit betas and you said that through the cycle or the key motivator right now is about 25% and you said by the time we\u2019re done, we\u2019re going to be at 30%. now that would, in general assume that you had further rate hikes that then we\u2019re going to push deposit rates up. But if we kind of stabilize here and rates don\u2019t go up anymore, let\u2019s just assume that they don\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t deposit pricing, maybe with a little bit, till increase in the second quarter began to kind of flatten out. So, I just want to make sure we\u2019re being consistent with that. How much of the excess you expected in deposit pricing going forward?","David Turner","Yes. So, what our history tells us is that it takes about 12 months and change after the last Fed hike for deposit rates to stop moving. So that\u2019s a piece of this that\u2019s usually just even if we don\u2019t get another increase, you\u2019ll see that continuing to come through. Mix has a big deal to do with it too. So as we continue to grow low-cost core checking accounts and interest freak accounts, that\u2019s helpful. but our commercial customers want to, they\u2019re trying to take their excess cash and get the best yield that they can. If rates stop moving, that will abate to.","So moving up into the 30s, we can argue, where in the 30s, we might end up. The point is we\u2019re going to continue to see some costs, some funding costs, increases continuing to come through that we need to deal with. And we have a little bit of the headwind on reinvestment on the left side of the balance sheet. And then the optimizations really will carry the day for us.","Marty Mosby","And then I guess the thing that I would suggest or highlight is that this deposit beta market has not been like any historical period we\u2019ve seen in the past. It\u2019s been a lot different and it\u2019s actually reacted much better than what we\u2019ve seen in the past. So, why shouldn\u2019t we expect that maybe we could see this thing slowed down or actually begin to flatten out a lot quicker given that the deposit beta has been better than what we\u2019ve seen in the past cycles?","David Turner","Well, you\u2019re certainly correct that is different. Betas last time were in the 60 range and now we\u2019re talking in the 30 range. And part of that is because of how slow the recovery has been and the pace of those increases. Also coming off historic lows and so I think all that matters and there is a chance that things flatten out quicker than we have anticipated. if that happens, then we\u2019re going to be better off than we think. And we\u2019d much rather give you a number that we \u2013 that we can hit versus trying to promise something that will struggle achieving.","Marty Mosby","And then just last question, the swaps next year, is there any net increase in earnings from the spread lock, enough freights were flat given the fixed rate that you locked in? Is there a \u2013 there should be a little bit of a positive spread. So, I was just curious if there\u2019s some upcoming income that you\u2019re going to get out of those swaps once they actually hit the four dates. And when does that actually happen? Thanks.","David Turner","Yes. So, the forward dates are in 20 and you\u2019re right, we would have some positive carry there, but we \u2013 we also entered into some interest rate floors, where you had to pay a premium and you amortize the premium. So, the amortization unfortunately offsets the swap benefit. So, again, if rates didn\u2019t move from here, we kind of pushed there. So, you won\u2019t see any real positive carry.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill.","Stephen Scouten","Hey, good morning everyone.","David Turner","Good morning.","Stephen Scouten","I\u2019m curious, just digging down in the name a little bit further, obviously Investor Day, you laid out this range of 3.40 to 3.70 and by the commentary from you, David, that \u2013 we might get to 3.50 for the year implies that the NIM will move into high 3.40s by year-end. So, can you talk to me a little bit about how that lower end, even on a zero policy range scenario would only get down to 3.40 and maybe what\u2019s \u2013 what dynamics have changed since 2016 when we were at 3.15, 3.16 that sort of range?","David Turner","Yes. So part of which \u2013 what we want to do is try to frame up the range at Investor Day like we did. And what changed since then was the near-term risk before our forward starting swaps began in 2020. So even if you saw a dip in 2019, we actually start recovering that in 2020 when our derivatives kick in. So that\u2019s the piece that gives us confidence that we\u2019re still within the range that we told you back then.","If we received a rank cut in 2019, that would \u2013 we\u2019d have a different ballgame. We\u2019d be telling you something different. We just don\u2019t think the probability is very high than that happens. So, anyway, that\u2019s\u2026","Stephen Scouten","Yes. That\u2019s a perfect answer. Thank you. And the swaps are really what prevents you from getting down into those levels we saw back in 2016, even if we were to revert back to a similar rate environment.","David Turner","That\u2019s exactly right.","Stephen Scouten","Okay. And then just lastly on the security\u2019s book, is there any chance that you guys look to reduce that as a percentage of average earning assets to fund some of the growth or is that kind of 22% range, where you\u2019d like to stay?","David Turner","I think there, we have a little bit in there that\u2019s helping part of our hedging program right now that works against us again on our margin. It\u2019s not a tremendously large number. We kind of like, where we are from that standpoint. I think what you should expect over time as a remixing of our security\u2019s book, kind of today, we still have treasuries and Ginnie Maes in there that we used for LCR purposes. And to the extent that that changes, then maybe we can put those, working a little more effectively force into mortgage backs. So, you\u2019ll see us do that from time to time. As a matter of fact, you saw us take security loss as of this quarter to pair off with a gain that we had on selling the affordable mortgage loans. So that we could get better carry going forward and we\u2019ll pay for that in less than a year. So, those are the kinds of things you should expect us to do over time.","Stephen Scouten","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hey guys. A quick \u2013 I just wanted to follow up on the line of questioning on the deposit betas and actually, just wanted to make sure I understand the math kind, what you guys are saying, So, the 25% \u2013 the 25% through the cycle Beta thus far basically implies that your deposit costs have moved up in the neighborhood of about 55 basis points given where the Fed funds is that right now. if I assume no further hikes and you get to the low 30s, that implies an additional 15 to 20 basis points of deposit cost pressure over the next 12 months. Is my math more or less, right? Is that what you\u2019re kind of baking into that at assumption?","David Turner","Yes. I think you\u2019re close \u2013 just probably closer to 10. But we\u2019re at 46 basis points of costs, one of the lowest. So, when you start looking at beta and percentages, you get, you can get some odd numbers, but we feel, we feel like, again, back to, I think as Marty asked a question if we miss it, we\u2019re going to outperform what we\u2019re telling you.","Saul Martinez","It\u2019s closer. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s closer to 10 basis points is what you\u2019re kind of baking in, in terms of incremental deposit cost pressure without any further hikes?","David Turner","That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.","Saul Martinez","Is that on total deposit or interest bearing?","David Turner","Those are really more interest bearing.","Saul Martinez","Interest bearing. Okay. Want to make sure I got that math. And then I guess on the \u2013 just a broader question, the 2% to 4% revenue, I say, you\u2019ve talked about NIMs and NIM was sort of stabilizing at 3% to 5% for the full year \u2013 of being at 3% to 5% for the full year, but in the 2% to 4% revenue growth, how do we think about that in terms of NII growth versus fee growth?","David Turner","We kind of put those together, Saul at this time, because there \u2013 obviously, there\u2019s challenges in terms of managing earning assets in the mix and all that. So, we put that together with NIR, we\u2019re still convicted that will be within 2% to 4%. Right now, there is more pressure on the NII component of that, but not enough that would cause us to not meet that, that goal that we had.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Right. Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Good afternoon. How are you, John and David?","David Turner","Hey, Gerard. Fine.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys give us a little further color on the portfolio of the breakout that you showed on leverage loans and then the Shared National Credits; are you comfortable with these levels or we\u2019re talking a year from now these numbers going to be much different than they are today?","John Turner","No, I don\u2019t think so, Gerard, and not let maybe far, speak as well, but I think we\u2019ve established some internal limits, just as we have concentration limits for lots of other aspects of do we manage risk in our portfolio and we\u2019re at a level with respect to leverage lending that we\u2019re comfortable with. We expect to continue to manage to about the level that we\u2019re at. I think the most risky exposure we\u2019ve talked about before in the portfolio has been loans to sponsor own companies. We brought that down from kind of the mid-30% to somewhere in the 26%, 27% range as I\u2019d recall. And we\u2019ll continue to work on that to ensure that the leverage exposure that we do have is to customers that we have full relationships with that it\u2019s in industries that we know well is distributed across a variety of different industries. So, we don\u2019t have any real concentrated exposure by industry sector either. And I think we do feel comfortable with it, but I\u2019ll let Barb respond to that question as well.","Barb Godin","I think you\u2019ve done a great job responding, John.","John Turner","Thank you.","Barb Godin","The only thing I have to add is just as you said; these are to our best quality CNI customers that we do leverage lending to in particular. So, we are very comfortable with them. We look at them on a regular basis. We look at the book on a monthly basis and we recycled. If we see something that either is not carrying its weight or that we feel that that\u2019s probably a good opportunity for us to move out of. We take immediate action on it. So again, I\u2019m feeling very good with that book.","Gerard Cassidy","I\u2019m just curious, Barb, do you recall during the last downturn what the non-NPL percentage was for leverage loans for regions, where we could dig it up, but if you don\u2019t?","Barb Godin","Yes. We\u2019ll have to dig it up; we don\u2019t have it at the top of my head.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. I\u2019m not expecting that. Okay. I\u2019m not expecting that to be the same this time. But I was just curious and maybe, coming back to you, John. At Investor Day, you talked about the expansion into some priority markets in St. Louis, I believe, Atlanta, Orlando, Houston, can you share with us how that is progressing and how do we, as outsiders, determine whether you\u2019re being successful in those markets?","John Turner","Well, we think it\u2019s progressing well. We have about 40 de novo branches that have \u2013 that are now open and operating I guess for less than a year, largely across those markets. We continue to reposition our retail franchise as an example in St. Louis as we shift that franchise and we shared this with you at Investor Day, I think we now have access to 10% more households, more wealth, more businesses. The same would be true as we think about the expansion in Atlanta. I think we now have access to more than a million, more or nearly million more customer households, businesses and wealth. And so those opportunities continue to be available to us. The year-over-year checking growth, about 15% of our growth is attributable to de novos. And so \u2013 and we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to provide you all with some information like a percentage of growth attributable to de novos as an example. that\u2019ll give you some sense of how we\u2019re doing. I think, again, core to our strategy is looking for ways to continue to grow our core customer base.","So, as we\u2019re growing consumer checking accounts, as we\u2019re growing debit cards usage, as we\u2019re growing credit cards on the consumer side, as we\u2019re growing small business accounts and small business deposit balances, those should be indicators to you that, that our expansion strategy is gaining some traction. We\u2019re recruiting talent in those markets and feel good about the teams we continue to build. all-in-all, I think, we\u2019ll \u2013 we\u2019re going to continue it to on the path to execute that strategy.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. Thank you.","John Turner","Thank you.","David Turner","Let me \u2013 this is David. I just want to clean up one thing. So, I think as Saul had asked a question about the impact of beta going into the 30, I said \u2013 and we said more like 10 points on and I said, interest bearing that\u2019s a total, it shouldn\u2019t be total. So, I want to clean that up.","John Turner","Okay. I think that\u2019s all the questions we had today. Really appreciate your time. appreciate your interest in regions and thank you very much. Have a good day.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

My name is Paula, and I will be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).","I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.","List Underwood","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation on our call today. Our presenters this morning are Chief Executive Officer, Grayson Hall and our Chief Financial Officer, David Turner. Other members of our management team are present as well and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also, as part of the call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","Finally, let me remind you that in this call and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking statement that is located in the appendix of the presentation.","I will now turn it over to Grayson.","Grayson Hall","Thank you, List, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Regions and participation in our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call.","Today we reported another solid and consistent quarter with earnings of $305 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Total revenue increased 2% and asset quality remained solid with a net charge-off ratio of 39 basis points. We continue to focus on meeting the financial needs of our customers and once again this quarter we grew our customer base and deepened relationships, as evidenced by growth and quality households and quality checking accounts, all of which are fundamental drivers of long-term sustainable growth.","Although the overall lending environment was challenging in the third quarter, we remain committed to maintaining disciplined credit underwriting standards. Competition remains intense within the business lending, creating pressure on both price and structure. Nonetheless, we remain prudent on how we choose to compete the loans. As a result, there are number of deals that we are walking away from that do not meet the company risk appetite or have unacceptable terms. While we experience slower demand in July, August, recent trends indicate a very favorable pickup in activity and have generally been more favorable both at the end of the quarter and as we enter the next quarter.","The consumer lending portfolio continues to expand, including growth in indirect loans, credit card and mortgages. Additionally, our deposit base continued to increase, with the pending deposit balances up $308 million from the prior quarter. We remain focused on growing and diversifying our non-interest revenue. Despite the challenging environment, we believe to align customers to bank the way to choose is a key to customer satisfaction and growth. We also recognize we must continue to innovate as it is critical to attracting and retaining customers.","We are committed to driving long-term growth while improving efficiency across the organization supported by process improvement initiatives. Despite the recent market volatility and global macroeconomic weakness, we are encouraged by improving economic fundamentals throughout our core markets. Although the recovery remains uneven, we expect increased capital spending activity will drive GDP growth in 2015.","Finally, we are encouraged and been pleased with the recent analysis of positive actions by couple of our credit rating agencies. We believe these actions reflect meaningful improvements in the number of credit quality metrics and our overall risk profile. We are committed to maintaining a strong risk management culture and these rating upgrade are further evidence of our continued progress.","I will now turn it over to David for a closer look at our third quarter results and then we will take your questions.","David Turner","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at the detail starting with balance sheet.","Loan balances totaled $77 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of $94 million from the end of the previous quarter. The consumer lending portfolio drove increase as growth in business lending moderated early in the quarter, as Grayson indicated. Total consumer lending increased $120 million linked quarter as production increased 2%.","The growth in the consumer portfolio was led by indirect auto lending as balances increased 4% from the prior quarter. We continue to benefit from the robust market for auto sales, as well as from the process improvements instituted earlier in the year. As a result, we expect further growth in this portfolio.","Credit card balances increased $19 million or 2% from the previous quarter. This increase stems from a 4% increase in active card users. Today our marketing efforts have primarily targeted our existing customer base. As a result, we continue to make progress as our penetration rate is up 200 basis points to 15% over the last year and we expect growth in balances to continue in the near term.","Mortgage balances were up modestly this quarter as production increased 1% linked quarter. Meanwhile, total home equity balances declined $96 million as loan payoffs continued to outpace new production. However, total home equity production increased 13% from the previous quarter as customers continue to take advantage of fixed rate home equity loans and variable rate home equity lines of credit.","Looking at business lending. This portfolio totaled $48 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 4% year-to-date. Commercial and industrial loans grew $503 million or 2% from the prior quarter. As Grayson mentioned, competition remains intense in this space. In addition, we experienced loan payoffs related to customer mergers and acquisitions as well as refinancing activities occurring in the fixed income markets. C&I growth was led by the general industries group [ph] within the geographies, as well as refinance. Line utilization declined 40 basis points. However, commitments for new loans increased $1 billion or 2% and our pipelines remain strong.","Regarding investor real estate. While ending balances were up 1% year-to-date at $6.8 billion, the portfolio experienced a decline of 2% from the previous quarter. Investor real estate remains an important part of our corporate bank strategy, given our market presence in the Southeast. However as previously noted, we remain committed to our risk tolerance levels as it relates to this portfolio. As such, near-term growth is expected to be modest. Based on what we know today and reflecting our current economic forecast, we expect ending 2014 loan growth to be at the lower end of the 3% to 5% range.","Let's take a look at deposits. Supported by our multichannel platform, deposits continued to grow increasing $308 million during the third quarter. Of note, low-cost deposits grew by $492 million and continued to account for 91% of total deposits. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels and totaled 11 basis points, while total funding costs declined to 30 basis points in the quarter. We continue to expect 2014 deposit growth to be in the 2% range for the year on a point-to-point basis.","Let's take a look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $837 million, essentially flat versus the prior quarter. However as anticipated, our net interest margin declined six basis points to 3.18%. Net interest income benefited from an additional day in the quarter, as well as from a modest increase in the securities portfolio. Net interest margin was negatively impacted by approximately three basis points due to higher levels of cash and the additional day. Both net interest margin and net interest income were negatively impacted by lower asset yields, as maturities and paydowns and loans and securities are replaced at lower levels.","Asset yields are likely to continue to come under pressure if the current low interest rate environment persists. Deposit and funding costs are expected to remain stable at historically low levels with limited opportunity to realize additional cost leverage. Assuming rates remain at roughly current levels through the fourth quarter, we expect to have net interest margin compression of one to three basis points, and net interest income growth will primarily be driven by growth in loans.","In terms of our interest rate sensitivity, we remain asset sensitive and expect net interest income to benefit from increases in short term or longer term rates. More specifically, a 100 basis point parallel shift in rates would increase net income by approximately $160 million in the first year. Total non-interest revenue increased 5% to $478 million in the third quarter. Service charges increased 4% from the second quarter and card and ATM fees increased 1%. Credit card income benefited from a 2% increase in spending volumes.","Now with respect to posting order, as we previously stated, we plan to begin following a chronological approach in select markets during the first quarter next year. The results from these tests will be used to inform our posting order process and customer communications. We do not expect to fully implement these changes until the second half of 2015. However, through our current modeling efforts, we estimate the impact from these changes to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million per quarter. It is important to understand that the modeling assumes a static environment, and there are numerous policies including funds availability that impact fee revenue.","Mortgage income was down 9% from the previous quarter, primarily related to lower mortgage servicing rights and related hedge income. Although servicing income has been relatively consistent, we continue to look for opportunities to grow this revenue source. We currently have approximately $40 billion of mortgages in our servicing portfolio and have the operational capacity to take on additional volume.","While mortgage production declined in 2014, the pace of our decline has less than the industry. Originations continue to be driven by new home purchases and represented on average 73% of total originations this year. And looking ahead, the Mortgage Bankers Association estimates that mortgage origination should increase 5% to 10% in 2015, and we expect to continue to outpace industry estimates.","Capital markets income increased $8 million from the previous quarter, primarily related to an increase in activity in real estate capital markets. This increase reflects the revenue increase from investments we have made to expand our capital markets capabilities.","Let's move on to expenses. Adjusted expenses were flat from the previous quarter. Salaries and benefits increased $13 million from the previous quarter as headcount increased 183 positions. The majority of these positions are in revenue-generating or revenue support roles and include hires in specialty lending, insurance, wealth management and platform personnel and will drive future growth in revenue. The remaining portion of the increase continues to be primarily from hires of support staff, particularly in risk management and compliance functions. With that said, we continue to closely monitor personnel resources which has resulted in a reduction in headcount of 656 positions year-to-date.","Credit expenses have been particularly low for several quarters, as we have benefited from loan sales out of our held-for-sale portfolio. The opportunity for gains will diminish as the balances in the portfolio decline. This quarter, we also incurred expenses related to Visa Class B shares sold in prior years which resulted in $7 million of additional expense in the third quarter.","Furniture and equipment related expenses increased primarily related to investments in technology, including systems enhancements and data management solutions. Additionally, we benefited from a recovery to expenses related to unfunded commitments of $24 million, which was primarily due to a large credit line that funded that was subsequently resolved during the quarter.","The adjusted efficiency ratio improved by 60 basis points to 63.6% in the third quarter, as we remain committed to driving efficiencies across the organization. While some quarter-to-quarter volatility is to be expected, we continue to expect full year 2014 adjusted expenses to be lower than those of 2013.","Moving on to asset quality. Our overall asset quality remained solid as many credit metrics improved in the quarter. Our nonperforming loans declined 7% linked quarter. In addition, at quarter-end, our loan-loss allowance to nonperforming loans or coverage ratio was 141%, up from 137% last quarter. Total delinquencies declined 4% and troubled debt restructurings or TDRs meaningfully declined 7%, driven by both refinancing activity and paydowns. In addition, both criticized and classified loans declined from the prior quarter.","Net charge-offs totaled $75 million, representing 39 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $24 million or $51 million less than net charge-offs, and based on what we know today, we expect favorable asset quality trends to continue. However, at this point in cycle, volatility in certain metrics can be expected.","Let's move on to capital and liquidity. We continue to maintain industry-leading capital levels. At the end of the quarter, our estimated Tier 1 ratio stood at 12.7% and our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.8%. Further, we estimate our fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio to be at 11.2%. As previously mentioned, we expect to begin executing our $350 million share repurchase program shortly as we previously planned.","And just a quick note regarding preferred stock expense for the third quarter. due to the timing of our April issuance, the first coupon period was longer than future coupon periods and resulted in additional expense of approximately $4 million. Going forward, with the current level of preferred stock outstanding, the run rate for preferred stock expense will be approximately $16 million per quarter.","Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company remains solid, with a loan to deposit ratio of 81%. And regarding the liquidity coverage ratio rule, Regions' funding base and investment portfolio are well-positioned to receive optimal treatment based on the high quality liquid asset definition. Importantly, our Regions 360 approach supports deepening customer relationships, which provides an LCR friendly platform for the ratio calculation.","Overall, we are pleased with certain adjustments made to the final rule, and expect to be fully compliant by the January 2016 deadline without meaningful changes to our balance sheet. In summary, our third quarter results continue to reflect our steady progress in growing revenue, while maintaining a disciplined risk culture. We believe that by focusing on our customers' needs while prudently managing risk, we will drive long-term sustainable growth and deliver long-term shareholder value.","Thank you for your time and attention this morning and I will now turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","List Underwood","Thank you, David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session. In order to accommodate as many of you as possible this morning, I would like to ask each caller to please limit yourself to one primary question and then one related follow-up question. Now let's open the line for questions, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR Capital Markets.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Paul.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets","Good morning. Hi, it's actually Jessica Ribner, in for Paul. How are you?","Grayson Hall","Hi, Jessica. Good morning.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets","Good morning. It sounds like, just from your comments, you sound more positive about 2015 than 2014 in terms of loan growth and earnings. Do you feel like you can improve on today's loan growth into next year? What are you guys seeing?","Grayson Hall","Well, as you look at third quarter, we said in our prepared remarks, we saw a moderation of loan demand in the July and August and then we saw loan demand strengthen to some degree in September. We continue to see that strengthening of loan demand into the fourth quarter. Certainly, we are encouraged by that. I would say the moderation in the early part of quarter was a mixture of both the number of merger and acquisition transactions where we either were not the bank of the acquirer or we were the bank of both and had to reduce our hold positions on those.","But we also saw an overall reduction in demand and the related production as a result of that demand. And so there were a number of one-off transactions that we would not have anticipated in terms of payoffs or paydowns, but I would say, generally, in July and August, we saw reduced demand. That obviously concerned us early in the quarter but it restrengthened in September. And if the trend continues, I think it is a very good sign for 2015 and obviously gives us the opportunity to perform at a higher level if that trend continues and at this juncture we have no reason to believe it will not.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning. Hello.","Grayson Hall","Yes, good morning.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. A couple of questions on the overdraft. You indicated that based on the testing that you have done, that starting third quarter of 2015, you would expect to see $10 million to $15 million drop in your OD fees. Could you give us some color behind the analysis you did to get to that estimate and maybe also indicate what the total OD fees are and let us know if you are going to be offsetting any of that revenue shrinkage with other actions?","Grayson Hall","Well, I will start and then I will let David add to that. We spent the last several months making a number of fairly significant modifications to our deposit systems in order to accommodate posting order changes as well as to accommodate the testing and forecasting of those changes. All of those modifications have gone well and we are in a much better position today to understand what the implications of these changes might be.","We will start piloting a number of these changes and in general, without getting too deep into the details, our approach is very much of a chronological-based approach to posting and our early numbers would indicate, as David said, that we could realize $10 million to $15 million a quarter reduction in service charges. That being said, you know, we realize that it's our job to figure out how to mitigate those service charge reductions.","A lot of it is going to depend on customer behavior, but also we are looking at all of our deposit related products on how we price those products and how we deliver those products and we continue to believe that as we have in the past, as we make changes like this to find ways to mitigate those leakages, if you will, of non-interest revenue. We had a good strong and honest revenue quarter this quarter and so we think we are making some of the rights changes.","David?","David Turner","Yes, Betsy, we really wanted to put something out there on posting order. It's a question we get frequently. It is based on running some models today but we really need to see what the customer behavior is going to be before we know and we will update you when we know. But we want to frame it up a little bit for you and just try to hit off the continued question there. I will tell you that, through a lot of changes that have happened in our industry, we have had almost $400 million worth of revenue taken out of our company that we have had to overcome and we created new products and services and we will do the same thing here as well.","So the team is working hard to grow our revenue, regardless of changes that we see whether it be posting order or other changes we have to deal with. And so we don't have specifics on this just yet but we will continue to update you and find ways to mitigate this revenue and we will give you, as we get closer and run the pilot, we will give you better information to hone in on this number.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Yes, I guess, just if you can share with us anything regarding some of the assumptions that are behind the $10 million to $15 million. Is it a reduction in fee waivers? This is obviously a less bad number than some folks had been wondering or estimating out there. So I am just wondering if you could help us with some of those details?","Grayson Hall","Well, I think that clearly, as we went through our most recent assumptions and testing that, we have assumed a pretty static environment and that we are not putting assumptions in the model today that would be indicative of customer behavioral changes. We are assuming behavior to continue the way they have. We are not putting assumptions in there that we have less account attrition which is a potential. If this policy for some customers will be perceived as more friendly then you could argue that there is some account retention benefit, but we haven't modeled that in. So I think we have taken a very conservative approach to how we have modeled this. That being said, the best numbers will come when we actually pilot this in the first quarter and that pilot is really going to give us a much clearer view of that. I think that the primary issue, in our part, is being very transparent with our customers, making sure that we understand how this impacts customers and making sure that we don't lose our momentum in growing accounts as we have been throughout 2014.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good morning. I was just wondering about the buyback. Is your intention to utilize the full $350 million in buybacks over the remaining two quarters of the CCAR period?","Grayson Hall","That's what's in the plan, yes.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, and then switching gears to the ready advance. Could you update us on how much the ready advance fees might have been in the third quarter? I believe it was $6 million [ph] PPNR in the second quarter. And how does that trend in the third? And what's the time line for that going away?","David Turner","Yes. So the change in the third quarter and the second quarter, a pretty similar numbers that we had previously spoken about. By the end of the year, we will have converted everybody or stopped the ready advance program. Really by the end of November, we will have discontinued that. And we put forth other options for those existing customers in the ready advance product that they have today.","Grayson Hall","If you have you recall, we stopped offering the product in January of this year. And we are going through a couple of conversions. We broke the customer base up into segments. We are going to do a couple of conversion, follow those conversions to be completed before the end of the year. And I would say that, the drop off you saw from first quarter to second quarter was predominantly because of reduced enrollments. We took enrollments to zero. The drop off you saw. Really, from second to third quarter had to do with some limited amount of conversions. We still have, of the customers that we had in that product, probably 60% of those customers are still active today, but all of those customers will be converted, as David said, nearly end of November. None of that will be in our run rate for the first quarter. There will still be a limited amount in our run rate for the fourth quarter.","David Turner","Yes, in that product.","Grayson Hall","In that product.","David Turner","But they will be taking other products and then we will have loose revenue from NIR up into NII and that will be based on adoption rates for those customers.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, and that should happen partially in the fourth and then again in the first?","David Turner","Yes. That's correct.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, and then just to clarify Betsy's, on the posting order changes, we assume that $10 million to $15 million. We should start that in the third quarter of next year?","Grayson Hall","We will have very limited amount in the first half of the year and the rest of that, the balance of that will be in the third and fourth quarter of next year.","David Turner","And that's the plan right now. We will learn through our --","Grayson Hall","We will learn through the pilot.","David Turner","Through the pilot. So we are giving you the best information we have today and when the rights come back, we will modify accordingly.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Thank you. And one more thing on the buyback, David. Just anything, you mentioned the $350 million buybacks are in the plan. Is there anything that would prevent you from doing that, that you can foresee?","David Turner","No. I don't.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Matt.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Hi, guys. I guess I will circle back on the expenses. Obviously good progress here and as we think about the full year guidance is down year-over-year. You have been down pretty materially year-to-date. So maybe boxing it in a little bit more for the fourth quarter, if you are comfortable doing so, and then thinking about the trajectory for next year?","David Turner","Yes, Matt. We are still working on next year. We will update you on that as we get closer towards the end of the year. We have a couple of conferences coming up. We will let everybody know. As it relates to our general philosophy, as you know, we are wanting to generate positive operating leverage. We have one of the lowest expense bases, but that being said, we focus on it quite a bit. That does not prevent us from making investments where we see the need to do that. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we increased positions about 183 million this quarter, and we put most of that in our revenue-producing, our revenue support roles, because we think that's the right thing to do. And at times, you will see the expense come before the revenue. We had the same issue about this time last year where we have tried to indicate we were going to make some investments. We feel very good about that. And so, long-term, we think we are doing the right thing.","Grayson Hall","Yes, Matt. We really are trying to take a very balanced approach, both from a revenue and expense standpoint. We realize that there clearly are investments that we have to make to grow and to manage our business better. But there is also opportunities for us to continue to increase the efficiency of our company. And so we take this very balanced approach to it to try to, if you will, fund our investments through savings efficiencies.","We have been very aggressive, as you know, over the last several years, in branch rationalization. We do that on an annual basis. We are going through that process now, as we speak. And we are being more rigorous, more disciplined about that this year. Over the past seven years, we have closed a little over 19% or consolidated a little over 19% of our branch offices. You will see us continue to leverage that process to drive even more efficiency through our company.","We still believe that branch is a very relevant channel. We are investing in all of our channels, including the branch channel. But we also believe that we have to manage those channels pretty dynamically. And so, as David said, as we get closer to the end of the year, through the appropriate opportunities we look to update you on some of our cost efficiency initiatives. And we realize, in this kind of a low rate environment that we have got to continue to drive that forward.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","As we think specifically about the third quarter expense base of the adjusted $826 million, is that a reasonable kind of run rate or base? Or should we gross that out for the provision for unfunded credit losses that was a credit?","David Turner","Matt, we are not giving you -- you have to build your run rate expectations. We only give specific guidance here. But I do think you need to factor in the unfunded commitment because that's a credit, one-time credit, that may or may not recur. And as you can tell, if you look at that other expense line item we have pretty lumpy, and its because of that expense and unfunded commitment. So that's $24 million going one way. We did have the Visa expense of $7 million that went the other way. And that shouldn't be recurring every quarter. But we have had that from time to time. So that's lumpy as well. That's a net $17 million that I think you ought to consider as you evaluate what you think our run rate would be.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Marty.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Hi, guys. I had a couple of different questions. One is, with the rating agency changes positively, David, do you think you can become a little more aggressive maybe and maybe using excess capital to start pulling down those debt cost and refinancing your debt given the improvement you are seeing there?","David Turner","Marty, that's a great question. We look at trying to get more efficient, if you will, from that funding cost standpoint. As you know, we pay a little over 5% after considering swaps, whatever page it is in our supplement. We look at that all the time and when the economics are right, notwithstanding rating agencies, if it makes economic sense for us to do that, we would love to take that out, use our capital, as you mentioned, and have a better run rate going forward. But it has to make economic sense. And as the rates have continued to come down, it's gotten a little less economical for us, but we look at it literally every day. So your comment is spot on.","From a rating agency standpoint, we have gotten some improvement now with the rating agencies. And you know, we are looking to leverage hopefully, over time, even better ratings as we deal with our customers and also as we deal with getting our debt structure, if you will, as efficient and low-cost as we can.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","And then Grayson, we talked earlier this year about the strategy of how you are looking at your customers differently, in the sense of what they like, what types of customers they were and you were talking about growing your customer base and deepening relationships. How are you seeing your new approach to the market and the customers as an advantage now to maybe serve a little bit more the underserved mass market in your markets?","Grayson Hall","Yes, Marty, as we have spoken before, we are servicing a little over four million households today. We have about a little over five million customers. And we are constantly trying to think through ways that we can be innovative from a product, for delivery standpoint to increase our satisfaction and our delivery of customer needs and we have offered a number of alternative products to try to bank more of the unbanked or underbanked.","Obviously, we have a lot of competition in that space. And as you may recall, we introduced a suite of banking products directed right at that segment called Now Banking. And our Now Banking accounts for some 460,000 customers that we have added to that product suite. And we continue to see progress. As you saw from our numbers this time, we are growing households, growing accounts. We have got a number of borrowing segments that are growing as well as our depository segments are growing.","We believe we are making good progress. I would tell you, it is early though, as we have rolled out this new strategy. And that I would say we are in the early innings of this. But the progress is good. And recently to try meet the liquidity needs of some of our customer segments, we rolled out a secured savings lending product and already have some 25,000 customers who registered for that product.","So we are still trying to innovate in an environment that will meet customer needs. And I think your question is a great question, because at the end of the day, the only way to have a sustainable business is to be able to grow our customer base.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Hi, good morning, guys.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Good morning. David, I was wondering, your comments about, I know this is wrapped up into your general NIM guidance, but can you talk to us about, if rates stay as low as they are, the impact from the 10-year, whether it's on what your go-to reinvestment yields are, where premium amortization was this quarter and where it goes, and any effect on the pension expense for next year?","David Turner","Yes, I will start with the last one first. So pension, clearly, is rate driven and we will have seen what that looks like. I would caution you we were, through the low last year about this time and rates kind of spiked towards the end of the year which helped everybody's pension calculation. So it's a little premature, but you are spot on. A lower rate environment does cause an increased net net of pension expense. So we are going to watch that. It's too early to give you guidance on it. It will be embedded in what we give you later on in the year when we start going to last couple of conferences.","I think from out from an overall NIM standpoint, rates are lower than what we had anticipated. Right now, we have done a lot of modeling to figure out what that might mean to us. And we have given you the guidance for the fourth quarter in that one to three, which may persist into to the first quarter. So we think we can do that one to three, making even through that first quarter.","And I will tell you, Ken, this has been so volatile. We just need to wait and give us a little bit of time and see what happens. If you look at really the domestic economy, everything points to a higher rate environment, but you have to start factoring in the geopolitical issues that are going on, the economies around the world. And so we are in a tough spot. And then of course, what is the Fed going to do over time.","So we think, we believe rates will increase at some point, timing of which is uncertain. We continue to be asset sensitive. We think that's the right thing to do. But if rates stay low longer, we will continue as everybody else will have pressure on NII and resulting margin. So that one of the three right now, I think, could carry us a couple of quarters.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","And within that, can you just tell us what the premium amortization number is for this quarter? And is any change to that built into your outlook?","Grayson Hall","It is. Our premium amortization did increase a bit over the quarter. We were at about $40 million of amortization this quarter and I think last quarter it was $36 million. So it did you pick up a bit. But that is built into our overall guidance.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay, and then my other question just is about, you have still a couple of sizable loan categories that continue to shrink well past, I think, anyone's original expectations, whether it's the owner-occupied bucket, the commercial real estate mortgage and then the second-lien home equity. Any line of sight in terms of finally getting to the bottom on those categories from an originations versus runoff perspective?","David Turner","Ken, let's take owner-occupied real estate. That generally is our small business customer. And small business formation has been down in 2014 quite a bit. And we really need to see and want to see the demand from that customer. It is our bread and butter. It is really a segment that we can demonstrate our Regions 360 that we talked about just a minute ago with Marty's question, and a lot of services that that customer base needs.","The problem is, we just don't see that demand. We see reluctance as we talk to those customers in terms of wanting to borrow for expansion, given all the uncertainty that exists, whether its political, whether its domestic, whether its what's going on in Europe, Ebola. All kinds of issues are factoring in into the concerns of the small business owner.","So we are going to work really hard. Have been. We are going to step it up even more so in terms of that owner-occupied base to deal with what the main issue is, and that is amortization. Those have a tendency to be term loans that amortize. And so you have to have production going just to stay even. So we think we can slow that decline.","In the home equity second-lien, a lot of that has been refinanced away. Some of it's deleveraging by the consumer. We have started to see that pace to decline slower than it has been over the early part of the year. Some of that has gone into our new product, our home equity loan product. And so we think those are the two, we hope over time in the balance of 2015, that we see those declines slow down and that married with the production, we think we can have a reasonable forecast of loan growth in 2015. That of which we will update you on again towards the end of the year.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","For all that color, David, appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sameer Gokhale of Janney Capital Markets.","Grayson Hall","Good morning.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. A couple of questions. The first one, just to go back to the buybacks, and I was curious about your thinking behind buybacks. Why you didn't buy back any stock, it looks like, in Q2 and Q3? Clearly, you had the authorization in place certainly for this quarter. But how are you thinking about buybacks? You are going to buy back more stock, but why didn't you buyback anything in Q2? If you would just help me think about that, given that loan growth, I don't think it was particularly strong. So were you anticipating faster growth? And how should we think about that? It just seems like you have a lot of excess capital here. A perspective would be helpful.","Grayson Hall","I will say a few words and ask to do it. We put our capital plan together roughly a year ago. It was in the fourth quarter last year and we put that capital plan together. We clearly had to make some assumptions around what we thought the forecast for economic activity was going to be.","And quite frankly, some of the things have turned out better than we forecasted, some worse. Clearly economy's recovery been slower than we anticipated. Our organic loan growth has not been as strong as we had thought that would potentially be at that point in time. And alternative investments have not turned out to be as strong as we might have liked.","That being said, we were very confident in our plan. We felt like it gave us an awful lot of flexibility. We thought it put us in a position to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, strengthen our capital position and we were confident in that plan and we have been executing that plan. And as David said, now we are at the point where we are ready to finish off the task that we had put into that plan.","I know there has been some questions about why we planed it that way and why we backend loaded this. But again, we used the best forecast we thought we had and we still are confident that was a good plan.","David?","David Turner","Yes. I think going into the year, loan growth, if you go back to the first quarter, loan growth was more robust for us. We really want to deploy our capital to grow our business. We think that's why the shareholders gave us the capital to begin with and giving it back to the shareholders is what we will do when we haven't been able to deploy it otherwise. So we put it intentionally in the back half or in the back half of the plan. And we had no objection to that plan and we are executing in accordance with that.","Once you build a plan and submit the plan, that's what the plan is. There is not really an opportunity to go back and change that plan easily. So we are going to execute of course with it. And you should see us wrap that up by the first quarter of 2015.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay, that's very helpful. And then I am going to ask you a question that's more of a high-level question and one that I could probably ask CEOs of other banks as well, Grayson. But what I would love to get your perspective on is that you and other banks have been focused on the efficiency ratio and lowering expenses. And of course I think in any cycle, any given point in time, banks would like to be more efficient rather than less efficient. I think that goes without saying.","But having said that, as you think about your business and you think about the environment we are in, it sounds like you might, with your reductions in headcount and this probably applies more generally across the board, it suggests that you and other CEOs really aren't very optimistic at all about growth going forward. And I know the hope is that interest rates at some point will increase and give a top-line benefit. But having said that, from a business planning standpoint, how do you think about continuing to reduce headcount going forward in terms of running the business? You seem to be planning for more of a continued slowdown going forward. Is that accurate? And I would just love to get your thoughts on that. Thank you.","Grayson Hall","I appreciate the question. I think it's a great question. I think its one that a lot of banks are trying to answer. I think my answer would be more optimistic than the picture you just painted. I think that, we are seeing the opportunity to grow our business. We are seeing in the markets we operate in, given the strengths of the market that we operate in, we believe we have got an opportunity to grow our business. And we do believe that while the economy is improving slowly, it still is improving. And we are seeing signs of that improvement across all of our markets.","I have said it internally and I will say it externally. We have made a lot of progress, but we still have a lot of work to do. I don't believe we have even started to really demonstrate what the power this franchise can be going forward. I think the progress we have made in 2014 really lays a solid foundation for what we could potentially do in 2015. But we are growing customers. We are growing households. We are growing our business.","I think the third quarter was slower, from a loan demand, than we had anticipated. But if the trend continues, we are more optimistic for the fourth quarter, knowing what we know today. So all that being said, as optimistic as we all are, we still have to be prudent and I think that we have to have this balanced approach to both investing to grow but looking for efficiencies around the company that allow us to, if you will be, to be able to hedge that forecast.","David Turner","Yes. I would add. I do think that the investments in people that we made mentioned, I mentioned that on the comments, roughly 183 during the quarter, but we have done some things to cut back on headcount. So we had consolidated 30 branches. We started that in the fourth quarter last year, finished up in the first quarter of 2014. And when we do that, we have a reduction in staffing levels as a result of that. So that's an example of where we use our excess capital. We would take a charge for that, but then we were able to consolidate, get a reasonably quick payback as we consolidate and take those customers from one branch into another. So just looking at headcount numbers can be a little misleading in terms of what our commitment is to grow our business because we believe our biggest opportunity is revenue growth and we will get that by making prudent investments in people and businesses going forward.","Grayson Hall","Well, there is not just people. Our physical footprint, we are down under 15 million square feet. We continue to find opportunities to reduce our physical footprint, by 10% to 15% a year. And we think that continues. We are operating in a smaller physical presence. A lot of our branches are smaller. We have fewer branches. We also are doing the same thing in office space in our back office as we continue to consolidate space and there is number of different examples of the way we are trying to make sure that we get efficiency across the company.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you again. I appreciate your responses. I know I could have asked that of pretty much any CEO, and your perspective is very helpful. And then just a last quick one, if I may. Your capital markets pipeline going into Q4, I know the revenues were up a little bit, but do you see that spend continuing into Q4? Thank you.","Grayson Hall","Yes. I think we have made a pretty sizeable investment in people and product in our capital management group and in our capital markets group, and obviously, one of the bigger products in that group is in this interest rate environments, not been there for us. But the I think a little movement in rates and we could see a lot more production out of that group, but nevertheless with investments we have made, we continue to think we are grow the revenue out of that business.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James.","Michael Rose - Raymond James","Hi, good morning. Just going back to the expenses, how should we think about the environmental cost? Are we back close to kind of pre-cycle normalized levels? Are there some more levers that you can pull to reduce some of those costs?","David Turner","Well, Michael, we always can reduce costs and build efficiencies. We do that. We have a whole team and that's what they are focused on. Helping each business, each support area, look at how we might improve workflow, it gets harder from where we are. We have worked over the past few years reducing our overall expenses to support our business, but that being said, we can continue to do that.","Over time, we mentioned our overall efficiency ratio being with a rate increase in the 55% to 60% area. We are at 63% and change today. We have a group that we invested in. It's a Six Sigma group that is looking for top process improvement to do two things, one to increase revenue and we mentioned that, I think, on our last call, where we have changed process and helped us increase revenue in things like indirect auto. And we have also use them to help from an efficiency standpoint on the cost side.","So I think we can always look at how to improved there. We have had changes in our OREO and held-for-sale kind of credit related expenses there. We had some benefits gains on sale that don't repeat. And those are harder to replace. We do focus on consulting expense. We focus on our legal expenses. In all those, we have opportunities to continue to wind down or reduce overtime.","Grayson Hall","And Michael, I would tell you, and I would agree with everything that David said, but there is one additional area. If you look at the investment we have made in risk management and compliance, this industry has faced a lot of new rules. And as we have gone through those new rules and regulations, we have used awful lot of human resource to ensure compliance with those rules and regulations and as we have opportunity to invest in technology and recognized a lot of these processes, there is going to be some efficiencies and that's a tremendous effort on part of our company today is to find out how we can improve compliance and risk efficiencies through automation.","Michael Rose - Raymond James","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Grayson, as a follow-up, you have historically talked about having a more balanced loan mix between business and consumer. Can you update us on any sort of thoughts there and what the puts or takes are in getting there over time? Thanks.","Grayson Hall","We have been stating that desire strategically for some time that we would love to achieve a greater balance between business and consumer on our balance sheet in terms of loans outstanding. We have made a tremendous number of investments in the consumer lending products to try to accelerate that remixing, if you will, of the balance sheet.","As you have seen, we have not been particularly successful at that. There has been more demand on the business loan side of our customer base. And as a consequence, our progress in that regard has been somewhat muted. Long-term, we still have that as a strategic desire on our part to achieve a better mix. That being said, we have to take advantage of what the market offers us in any given economy. And so, still a goal that we are working on but not there yet.","Michael Rose - Raymond James","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Good morning. My first question, just on the LCR, David. How much is the securities portfolio going to grow as you march towards compliance in 2015? Or are we really going to see a remix of your balance into HQLA? And I assume that the one to three basis points in terms of forward guidance for the NIM considers that?","David Turner","Yes, Erika. It did, in fact, consider that. We see very little change in mix. I was trying to address that earlier in my comments that we have pretty large securities book. We were happy with the rules that came out. And we don't see any problem becoming compliant 2016 without any meaningful changes to our balance sheet mix. So you shouldn't expect any type of significant change or increase in our securities book.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Got it, and just wanted to follow up to Ken's question. Another institution had helped us think about the potential incremental cost of funding your pension next year by giving us some guidance for every 25 basis point in increase in the discount rate that that would turn into an incremental cost of X. Could you similarly help us think about that impact next year?","David Turner","We will. I don't have that committed to memory. We do have some sensitivity in our 10-K that would be a little helpful in terms of what the change in the discount rate does. So that would be place that you could go look. But I will have List and Dana follow-up on that.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Matt.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning, Grayson. Thanks for taking my question. Just David, maybe a question for you. You noted that a 100 basis point increase in the curve would generate about $160 million of incremental NII. If I am reading the 10-Q correctly, that's up from about $111 million three months ago. Could you give us a little more color as to what the components were that drove that increase?","David Turner","Matt, I am not sure what you are looking at. You should have actually seen it come down. We had about 6% change in NII as a result of 100 basis parallel shift, which was about $190 million the quarter before, coming down to about $160 million. I think it is with that should -- we will go back and take a look at that.","But we essentially took a little bit of our asset sensitivity off with trying to protect ourselves a little bit on the down rate environment. It proved to be the right move given where we are today. But I think that we are still pretty asset sensitive at about 5% of NII. So we took one point off and round numbers from the second to third quarter.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, my apologies. I will follow up with List on that. And then just on fee revenue, a couple of the other banks that have already reported have suggested, even though it's very early days in the fourth quarter, the lower rate environment has actually generated some positive growth in refinancing volume. And I am curious if you can give us some color as to how you are thinking about the mortgage banking fee revenue line heading into the fourth quarter.","Grayson Hall","Absolutely, we have been looking at the mortgage rates and the opportunity as the rates have moved to a more favorable position for that business, that the refinance opportunity could accelerate. I would say that we haven't seen that shift yet, but we do anticipate that if the rates continue to stay at this level for over the next few weeks, we will see an increase in refinance.","As you may recall, refinance has been a lower percentage of our production than most of our peers. And so it will probably have a more muted impact on us than some of the peers that you are looking at, but we do anticipate an increase in refinance activity. But it is also makes home affordability for the repurchase better as well. So we think it's good for the mortgage business. I will ask David to give any specific comments on it.","David Turner","Yes. I think one, we need to let this settle a bit and see whether the mortgage rates actually following and for how long. It takes a while for all that to get into the market. Clearly, if you are resetting 15-year rates in the three range or below and 30-year rates in four range or slightly underneath that, you will see another way to refinance activity.","If you look at our supplement, on page nine you will see our refinance activity did pick up a bit in the third quarter. We are up about 7% from where we were in the second quarter. Hard to tell, though, whether that was just really rate driven or just normal activity coming through in the third quarter. So we are looking into that. We will give you better guidance as we see what the impact might be.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. That's helpful color. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning. The first question, just circling back to your comments about loan growth. Clearly, on a year-over-year basis, the loan growth has been very muted and it's below the industry loan growth, as evidenced by the H8 data we receive from the Federal Reserve on a weekly basis. Would you say that the slower loan growth is more due to your customers? You indicated some of your customers are still concerned about the operating environment. Or is it more your more conservative underwriting standards that you are using that maybe your competitors are not?","Grayson Hall","I think it's really a combination of factors. I think one is that most of the loan growth over the past several quarters has been in the upper end of commercial middle market and into the corporate space, which we were very active there, but candidly the bulk of our businesses has been in the middle market and into the small business owners. We mentioned a moment ago, I think David spoke about it, we have not seen the strength of the small business owner come back yet like we have other parts of the business.","So I think one just a mix of our customer base, has caused us to be a little bit more muted or more moderate than some of our competitors. I think also given what this organization has gone through over the past several years, we are just very disciplined, very prudent about credit underwriting at this juncture. And so we would attribute part of our differential between some of the peers to be the credit culture that we have tried to build at this company.","And I think the third issue and we alluded to it earlier, there were a number of one-off transactions in the third quarter that we had not anticipated and were not normal part of our portfolio and that was a factor.","And I think the last point was that we did just see, and I think many of our competitors acknowledge this as well, as third quarter was more moderate than anticipated. All that being said, again, we are pretty optimistic at this juncture given the way the last month of the quarter performed and the way the early days in the next quarter are starting to perform. So we feel better today about where the economy is headed.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Grayson, have you seen any evidence, obviously you guys monitor your customer base very carefully over the years, that you are actually losing customers to competitors because they are being much more aggressive in their underwriting standards?","Grayson Hall","No, I would say that we think that our numbers would indicate very clearly, we are still growing our customer base and still deepening the relationships we have with existing customers. We spend an awful lot of time not only analyzing transactions that we win but also transactions we lose. And quite frankly, we aren't winning as many prospect transactions as we would like to. And that's probably true of every competitor we got. We all are wanting to win new customer relationships. It makes sense for the customer. It makes sense for us.","I would say that we have seen more non-bank competitors enter into our space, than we have seen before. There is a tremendous amount of liquidity in the marketplace. And so you do see, not only competition from non-banks, but you see the competition from the debt markets. And that being said, we have to complete and we have to adjust and we are doing that. And our loan growth may be more moderate than we had anticipated, but we still have growth and we still anticipate growing our outstandings.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","And then my other question is on the capital. Obviously your capital ratios are very strong with your Basel III Tier 1 number again over 11%. Do you guys ever see a day when you can give back more of that so that it comes down to a number you are more comfortable with? You look at your return on equity today on a stated book basis and it's under 8%. Your stock obviously trades at a discount to book, suggesting you are not earning your cost of capital. I know on a return on tangible common equity, you are up over 9%. But how do you get rid of all this excess equity? When you look out over the next three years, let's say, because I know CCAR has a lot to do with how much you can give back and you are limited to maybe your earnings in a current year. But what do you guys envision on how to get rid of that excess equity to get that ROE up to a point where your stock and trade above book value?","David Turner","Yes. Gerard, this is David. It's a great question, and I will tell you, I would rather have that problem than be on the other side of the fence.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","I agree.","David Turner","Which is where we were at a time. So we do acknowledge that having excess capital is not doing any good and that we need to have an optimal capital stack. That means not only in total, but the components that make up that. And we will adjust that over time in both the components of the capital stack as well as the share number. It's obviously a little more difficult to work, given how we have to approach capital, at least how we perceive we need to approach capital relative to CCAR.","But how we manage our capital, that's our call. That's what our Board does. We have a whole process and I do think, over time, you will see those capital numbers rationalize. It will be through a combination of utilizing that capital to grow our business, which is really what we want to do when the opportunity is there.","We talked about having acquisitions of product lines like we did our credit card portfolio a few years ago. We looked at using that capital to buy non-banks and looking at bank acquisitions when those opportunities arise and then returning it to the shareholder so that we don't keep piling it up because we realize the return on tangible common over time with the denominator continuing to grow becomes pretty difficult. So we will and do envision the time where we can rationalize.","Grayson Hall","But you look at it and I think we are in a transition phase. Our capital planning process has gotten much formal, much more sophisticated and our confidence in that capital planning process is much hard today and it continues to improve. And at the same time, we derisk our loan portfolio tremendously. And so we have more confidence in how our loan portfolio will perform going forward.","All of those are things that give us confidence in how best to deploy capital and at what level to deploy. As we get a better economy, it would be our hope that we would have more organic opportunities to deploy that capital, but also think as the economy recovers that we are going to have opportunities, as David said, to acquire and how you define what we acquire will be a mix of opportunities.","But I think at the end of the day, if those things don't prove to fruition then we have the opportunity to return that to the shareholder in the form of dividends or buybacks. And I think that we are in a transition that's a little bit uncertain but it gets more certain each and everyday.","David Turner","Gerard, I will add one last thing, you mentioned cost of capital. One of our goal clearly is to reduce our cost of capital and that comes with a good sustainable performance, solid performance quarter in and quarter out, such that our cash flows are more predictable and we think we have done that. But the market is saying not quite yet. And we hope over time, the market realizes our sustainability of this cash flow to get our cost to capital down and again optimizing the capital stack would be another way to get that cost to capital down, and we will do that.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Guys, thank you very much.","Operator","Your question will come from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","My questions have already been answered. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore.","John Pancari - Evercore","Good morning. Just a quick question on margin. Can you give a little more color on the increase in the interest-bearing deposit costs in the quarter? It looks like a couple of items went up including your CD costs by about four bips or so. So I wanted to get a little bit detail on why we are starting to see a lift in some of these deposit items.","David Turner","Yes. There is really no story there. That could just be mix on a given customer. We have run some tests to try and see what might happen if we go a little longer on some CDs in particular to see what the markets acceptability to have some of those. So that could be a piece of it. But there is really not is big story there or a trend that you should expect going forward there.","Grayson Hall","But we have runs market test. And obviously one of the risk we have is when rates go up, what sort of pressure does that put on customer deposits and we have run a number of sensitivity tests in some markets to be able to prove our theories and so you will see some of the interest rate numbers, individually, go up a result of some of those. But they are temporary nature and overall our deposit cost continues to remain stable.","John Pancari - Evercore","Okay, all right, and then secondly, also on the margin. On the securities yields, I just want to confirm that the bulk of that 11 basis points decline linked quarter, what drove that and how much of that was premium amortization in terms of the bips impact on the yield? And then also curious about your new pricing? Or your pricing on your new auto loan originations or spreads, if you can't give us the upfront yields? Thanks.","David Turner","Yes. So the securities yields, they are down 11 basis points. Obviously reinvesting in just a lower rate environment but the premium amortization is also about half of that number. We did also shift out of corporate bonds as spreads changed and that we think that that was the right thing to do. You see your corporate bond portfolio will have declined.","You asked about audit spreads. There was really no change there. Obviously it's a very competitive environment to be in indirect auto but we had about seven basis points contraction during the quarter, but we still feel good about that overall yield and spread that we have. I think you can just see -- those can change, only dependent on what mix you are putting on the books. But our overall yield on that indirect as you see in our supplement, was $3.39 million versus $3.46 million last quarter.","Grayson Hall","Yes. And as that market segments become more competitive, we have adjusted our pricing strategies to ensure that we have got the right mix of tenure and rate and that it's appropriately risk-based priced. And so you will see a little bit of shift in yield as adjust our strategy because we want to make sure that we are staying in the right part of that market.","John Pancari - Evercore","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. I know the call is running long.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Dick.","Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital","Hi, good morning. I am sorry to ask you a question after such a long meeting. But I am looking at these peer-to-peer companies and considering the fact that apparently the GSEs are now going to buy mortgages that have 3% to 5% down payments, and given your large, if you will, customer base in the, we will say the under-banked, I am wondering if a bank can get into the peer-to-peer business, number one and number two, if this reduction in the down payments to nonqualified mortgage levels allows some opportunity there?","Grayson Hall","Dick, you are really familiar with the markets we operate in across the Southeast and we think it's a valuable franchise because of those markets. But we obviously operate in some real communities where the opportunities are a little different, maybe than some of our peers see and I do think that there are ample opportunities in our market to be able to bank some customers that typically would not have qualified for mortgages. And we have been we been very methodical about the way we have approached that market and prudent about it.","Obviously with the GSE, we are going to change the rules. We are watching that very closely with our peer. We are reading some of the same reports you are. It appears that they are pretty close to agreement on how do that and what the rules are on that. And I think we are very interested, if we can understand the rules and agree what risk we are taking, if we can make the economics work out on it, then we are encouraged. And so I do think you are absolutely correct. It's an opportunity for our franchise.","Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital","And the company, I was thinking, this lending club is about to go public. And I was looking at the prospectus and they are charging up to 20% rate on people who have FICO scores in the mid-600s and they are not making the loans, they are shifting the loan. They are a facilitator, so other people make these loans and they are taking, in some cases, as much as 6% overrides for finding the loans. And I am just wondering, would a bank ever be allowed to be a facilitator like that where it simply shifts the loans to other buyers and takes a fee for finding the customer, underwriting a loan and sending it along?","Grayson Hall","Well, that's a great question and we have every one of these, if you will, technology based lending solutions, whether its peer-to-peer or whether it's just that an origination position. We have taken a hard look at every one of them and I think it's a good question. Quite frankly, we have got a number of competitors, that their rules of engagement are different than ours. And so you know today in our environment some of that type of lending, I just think we have to stay away from.","But that being said, there are still a lot of opportunities in that space and we have got a team of really talented people that continue to look at it. We think innovation is a big part of how we bank the consumer going forward on both the deposit and the lending side. And some of these solutions that you are seeing are going to play out and some of them are. And it's our challenge trying to figure out who winners and losers are in that space.","David Turner","Dick, this is David. You had mentioned really banking kind of funding somebody else. What we would like to and are looking at is how those parties actually bring the customer to the table so that those are our customers where we can have a deeper relationship than whatever that one-off loan is. And so that really seems to be the better alternative versus being a funding agent, if you will, for somebody else's customers. But as Grayson mentioned, things are changing pretty rapidly and we have to be able to adapt and deal with this on a prudent basis and obviously within the confines of our regulatory regime that we have.","Grayson Hall","But a lot of financial products are moving out of the traditional banking space and we have got to learn to compete with them but compete under the rules that we operate under.","Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital","Okay. Thank you very much.","Grayson Hall","Thank you. That's our last question. And we appreciate everyone's participation, everyone's interest we will stand adjourned. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"17977":["Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) Q1 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call April 21, 2015 11:00 AM ET","Executives","List Underwood - Investor Relations","Grayson Hall - Chief Executive Officer","David Turner - Chief Financial Officer","John Turner - Corporate Banking Group","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President, CCO and Regions Bank","Analysts","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Michael Rose - Raymond James","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Stephen Scouten - Sandler O'Neill","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott","David Eads - UBS","Vivek Juneja - J.P.

I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.","List Underwood","Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation on our call today. Our presenters include, Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer; and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of our management team are present as well and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also, as part of our call -- earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","Let me remind you that in this call and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking statement that is located in the Appendix section of the presentation. Grayson?","Grayson Hall","Thank you, List, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased you could join us as we review our first quarter results. First quarter results reflect a solid start to 2015, as we reported our earnings of $218 million or $0.16 per diluted share, which included $0.02 per share of significant items that negatively impacted EPS.","These results illustrate that we are successfully executing our strategic priorities, which include diversifying revenue, generating positive operating leverage and effectively deploying capital. As notably, we achieved these results even with severe weather conditions in our markets during the first quarter.","During the quarter, we grew loans and deposits, we grew checking accounts in all of our markets, we generated positive operating leverage, while prudently managing expenses and receiving no objection to our CCAR submission.","Our loan growth in the first quarter was 1% with most loan categories experiencing growth. Deposit growth exceeded our expectations this quarter with balance still growing 3% from the end of last year.","As continued evidence of our Regions360 approach to relationship banking, we grew checking accounts in all of our market and accordingly also increased our number of households.","Total revenue remained relatively steady from the fourth quarter, despite seasonal declines in both net interest income and non-interest income. However, our efforts around diversifying our revenue streams helped to offset these declines.","Wealth Management delivered strong results, growing revenue 8% and increasing assets under administration by 5%. While all segments within Wealth Management grew revenue, insurance was particularly noteworthy, as revenue increased 13% linked quarter.","Going forward, along the organic growth, we will continue to target lift-out and acquisition opportunities in the support of business. This will also allow us to round down our product offerings and geographic coverage, and will drive incremental revenue growth.","Adjusted expenses declined 2% from the fourth quarter as many of our expense categories declined. We continue to prudently manage expenses, while focusing on expenses we can control, while appropriately investing for future growth. Total expense during the first quarter was impacted by few planned actions, where we incur additional charges, but our future run rate should benefit.","Let me spend a few moments and provide you with an update on energy lending portfolio. We continue to use our corporate governance process to monitor oil price declines for direct and indirect impact to our overall loan portfolio.","While we have seen some downward risk breeding migration in our oil field services portfolio, we are not seeing widespread financial stress within our customers in the portfolio. Obviously, if oil prices remained at low levels for the extended period of time additional migration is likely. However, we are staying engaged with our customers and we will take necessary actions as we deem appropriate.","Conversely, we believe consumers are beginning to experience benefits from lower oil prices, with consumer loan categories, net charge-offs, delinquencies and non-performing loans, all declined during the quarter. In fact, total net charge-offs to average loans is 28 basis points in the quarter, our lowest level in over seven years.","Also during the first quarter, we received no objections to our planned capital action from the Federal Reserve related to our CCAR submission. We believe our plan reaffirms our commitment to effectively managing our capital is for long-term growth objectives, while also increasing returns to shareholders. It also highlights our continued long-term approach to capital allocation and distribution.","As returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority. Our capital plan included increase in the quarterly $0.01 per share to $0.06. Additionally, we plan to repurchase $875 million of outstanding shares over the next five quarters subject to Board approval.","From an economic perspective, we anticipate a growth should pick up over the remainder of the year, and we expect continued improvement in housing prices across our markets. However, we do not expect an increase in short-term rates until the later part of 2015.","We will continue to leverage our Regions360 approach to relationship banking to grow and expand our customer base. In fact, during the first quarter, Regions was again recognized by leading customer experience research firms the Temkin Group and Greenwich Associates for providing industry-leading service to both consumers and businesses in 2014. We are pleased to once again be recognized for providing an exceptional customer experience.","With that, I will turn it over to David. He will cover details for the first quarter. David?","David Turner","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the first quarter details and then wrap up with our expectations for the remainder of 2015. Loan balances totaled $78 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $936 million or 1%.","Business lending achieved solid growth that was balanced across industry segments and geographic locations. Balances in this portfolio totaled $49 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of $867 million or 2%.","Investor real estate lending balances totaled $7 billion, an increase of $108 million or 2%. And commercial and industrial loans grew $949 million or 3%, and this growth was driven by our market-based corporate and commercial bankers serving small corporate and middle market clients.","In addition, Regions\u2019 business capital, our asset-based lending group and corporate real estate exhibited growth during the quarter. Line utilization increased 10 basis points, commitments for new loans increased 4% and our pipelines remained strong.","Moving to consumer lending, loans in this portfolio totaled $29 billion, as production increased 9% linked quarter. Mortgage loan balances increased $103 million and production increased 9% linked quarter. In addition, indirect auto lending balances increased $59 million or 2% as this portfolio continues to expand.","New and enhanced consumer lending product offerings led the growth in our other consumer loan category, loan balances increased $28 million and the portfolio totaled $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, while production also increased 58%.","As expected, credit card balance declined following a seasonally high fourth quarter, balances declined $43 million or 4% from the previous quarter. However, production increased 20%. And finally, total home equity balances declined $78 million or 1%, while production also decreased 1%.","Let\u2019s take a look at deposit. Supported by our multichannel platform, total deposits growth was strong, increasing $3 billion during the first quarter. Two-thirds of this growth was driven by consumer deposits, which were broad base across the majority of our markets. Deposits costs remained near historically low levels and totaled 12 basis points, while total funding costs were 29 basis points in the quarter.","Let's look how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $832 million, a decline of $5 million or 1% from the previous quarter. The low rate environment and fewer days in the quarter were the principal drivers of the decrease, but were partially offset by increases in average loans and reductions of higher costs borrowings.","Net interest margin increased slightly from the previous quarter to 3.18%, reflecting the benefits of reduced borrowing costs, offset by higher levels of cash due to deposit growth.","Total non-interest income declined $4 million or 1% in the first quarter. Mortgage income increased $13 million or 48% as loan production increased along with improvement in the market valuation of mortgage servicing rights.","As Grayson noted, our Wealth Management Group delivered strong results for the quarter, revenue increased 8% led by higher insurance commissions, higher investment services fees and increases in investment management and trust income.","Service charges declined $6 million from the previous quarter, which was due to a $3 million decline in fees resulting from a product discontinuation in the fourth quarter and seasonally lower non-sufficient fund fees.","Card and ATM fees decreased slightly as a result of lower spending and transaction volumes that are typically experienced in the first quarter. However, the number of active accounts continued to increase.","Let's move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the first quarter were $905 million, a decline of 7%, while adjusted expenses declined 2%. During the first quarter, we redeemed $250 million of higher cost debt, incurring $43 million extinguishment charges, but earnings will benefit from a lower run rate going forward.","As previously noted, in the fourth quarter 2014, we announced plans to consolidate 50 branches throughout 2015 as part of an ongoing evaluation of the branch network. We recorded $13 million of expense related to the consolidation in the first quarter of 2015. In addition, we have a space planning initiative underway which will reduce occupancy expense going forward. This initiative results in an incremental charge of $9 million.","Salaries and benefits remained relatively flat from the previous quarter despite a seasonal increase in payroll taxes of $11 million, which was offset by decline of $15 million in incentives that is not expected to repeat next quarter.","Pension expenses increased $2 billion lower than our original estimate for the quarter and should remain at this level for the remainder of 2015. In the second quarter, we expect an increase of salaries and benefits commensurate with annual merit increases.","Occupancy and furniture fixtures declined a total of $5 million and outside services declined $6 million. Professional, legal and regulatory expenses excluding the previous quarters of $100 million legal and regulatory accrual declined $15 million to $19 million for the quarter. Although there are opportunities for expense reductions, we expect expenses in this category to increase somewhat and some amount of volatility should be expected.","Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 64.9% in the quarter, an improvement of 120 basis points from the prior period. Prudent expense management remains a top priority as we remain committed for generating positive operating leverage over time. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28.7%. This rate reflects the impact of the adoption of new guidance related to the accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects, which increased income tax expense and non-interest income.","All prior periods have been restated to conform in this new presentation. In addition, the first quarter\u2019s tax expense includes a one-time benefit related to an improved methodology to determine state deferred taxes of approximately $10 million which reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 300 basis points.","Moving to asset quality, total commercial and investor real estate criticized and classified loans increased $125 million or 5% from the prior quarter as the company experienced some weakening in large dollar commercial and industrial loans within the energy, healthcare and other portfolios. However, we do not believe this weakening is systemic in nature.","As Grayson noted, we are closely monitoring the energy portfolio and have experienced some risk-rating downgrades this quarter. However, because the number of our energy clients are limited, we are in a position to maintain frequent contact and will continue to be diligent through our normal processes of credit servicing these loans.","Compared to the prior quarter, total delinquencies declined 12% and troubled debt restructurings or TDRs declined 5%. Our non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased 3% linked quarter and at quarter end, our loan loss allowance to non-performing loans or coverage ratio was 137%. Again as Grayson mentioned total net charge-offs declined $29 million and represented 28 basis points of average loans.","The provision for loan losses was $49 million or $5 million less than net charge-offs. Given where we are in the credit cycle in the large dollar commercial credits in our portfolio along with fluctuating oil prices, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected.","Let\u2019s talk about capital and liquidity. During the quarter, we repurchased $102 million of shares of common stock which completes the $350 million program that was part of our 2014 CCAR submission.","Additionally, during the first quarter, we began the transition period for the Basel III capital rules. As such, we will report Basel III capital ratios under the phase-in provisions for regulatory reporting purposes. But we will also continue to report ratios as if fully implemented.","Under these new provisions, we maintained industry-leading capital levels as a tier 1 ratio was estimated at 12% and the common equity tier 1 was estimated at 11.2%. In addition, the common equity tier 1 was estimated at 10.9% on a fully phase-in basis.","Liquidity at both the bank and holding company remains solid with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 80%. And regarding the liquidity coverage ratio rule, Regions remains well positioned to be fully compliant with the January 2016 implementation deadline. Throughout 2015, we will update customer agreements to include LCR friendly language. We will modify our existing deposit products and we also plan to create new products and services to complement our strong position of high-quality liquid assets. It is important to note that no major balance sheet initiatives are expected in order for us to be compliant. ","Let\u2019s take a few minutes and touch on our expectations for the remainder of 2015. With respect to loans, we continue to expect total loan growth in the 4% to 6% range on a point-to-point basis. Commercial and industrial loans are expected to drive loan growth within the business lending portfolio. And while owner-occupied commercial real estate is not expected to provide meaningful growth, the pace of runoff is expected to slow.","Looking at the consumer lending book, we expect continued growth from indirect auto lending. We will continue to focus on driving better pull-through rates, increasing margins and improving overall credit profiles. We also expect to augment growth through new partnerships later in the year.","Additionally, continued growth in other consumer loans is expected. We are focused on expanding lending through online and point-of-sale financing alternatives. And as a result, we expect growth in this category to accelerate in 2015.","Moving to credit card, as we remain focused on increasing our penetration rates, this should drive balance growth in the near term. And finally, we expect the pace of home equity runoff to moderate throughout the year.","Regarding deposits, while we had a better-than-anticipated first quarter, we expect full year average deposit growth in the 1% to 2% range. As a reminder, a significant portion of our deposits are made up of consumer deposits, which tend to be more granular and smaller in size, which based on our research should be more stable and less rate sensitive in a rising rate environment.","With respect to margin, our expectations for the year have not changed materially. We expect to drive net interest income and margin growth over the balance of the year under our baseline expectations for loan growth and an increase in interest rates late in the year.","Further, we expect to benefit from revenue initiatives within mortgage, capital markets and wealth management while at the same time diligently managing expenses. That being said, we are committed to generating positive operating leverage.","We believe that the first quarter was a solid start for 2015 and we will continue to execute on our strategic priorities of diversifying revenue, generating positive operating leverage and effectively deploying our capital.","With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I\u2019ll now turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","List Underwood","Thank you, David. We are now ready to begin the Q&A -- excuse me-- the Q&A session of our call.","In order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning and there are number of you in the queue, I would ask each caller to please limit yourself to one primary question and one related follow-up. Now let's open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Grayson Hall","Good morning Erika.","Erika Najarian","Good morning. My first question is on the $949 million in C&I loan growth in the quarter. How much of that $949 million was related to your oil and gas sector?","David Turner","Erika, during the quarter, we really had kind of moved sideways in terms of our oil and gas. That was really a far broader base expansion of the loan portfolio outside of the energy sector.","Erika Najarian","Great. And my follow-up question is, in terms of your guidance for positive operating leverage, it sounds like you're still accounting for some rate increases in the back half of the year, which many investors are sort of stripping out of their model. Could you still hit positive operating leverage if the Fed doesn't raise rates this year?","David Turner","Erika, it would be very difficult if rates stayed in the $1.75 to $2 range. To do that, we can get close but it would be difficult. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, we do expect -- we have baked in little bit of an increase in September and a little one in December. But really loan growth for us is important when we saw loan growth this quarter and deposit growth and earning asset growth. That\u2019s a pretty big positive for us going into this whole concept of generating positive operating leverage. So it\u2019s not out of the question. It does make it more difficult.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James.","Grayson Hall","Good morning Michael.","Michael Rose","Hey, good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the energy topic. Can you disclose how much of this quarter's provision related to the review of the energy book? And then, where do reserves stand? And if you can\u2019t give a specific number, maybe you can give us some context as where they stand now versus maybe where they stood in \u201809 when we had a similar price decline?","David Turner","Yeah. So Michael, we won\u2019t disclose the specific dollar amount attributable to this but clearly we have a process, I\u2019ve talked in the prepared comments about our servicing that we are going through. We have relatively small number of customers in this sector whether it\u2019d be our E&P customer base or oilfield services customer. So we\u2019re spending a lot of time with them and we understand where those credits are.","We had some migration down. The migration you saw that was not just in the energy sector, it was other sectors. Healthcare and even some other industries that really contributed to that. But we have a very disciplined process from a lending standpoint.","We do have amounts in our calculation attributable to energy. That allocation has increased as our credits continues to migrate down this past quarter. So, we feel like we have those credits appropriately reserved right now.","Grayson Hall","Yeah, Mike. We\u2019ve got a very rigorous disciplined process for credit servicing and risk ratings. And obviously we saw a number of risk rating downgrades in the energy portfolio and particular in the oilfield services part of that portfolio. That being said, we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in our customer selection and in our risk rating process and feel very good about where we are at today. That being said, I had asked John Turner, if he would. John runs our Corporate Banking Group here at Regions and all of our energy lending reports up to John, asking if he would make a few comments for oilfield services in particular.","John Turner","Happy to. Thanks, Grayson. Just commenting from a risk mitigation standpoint with respect to oilfield services, we have been through the process of reviewing about 80% of our outstanding. We did that about 45 days ago and we do that on a quarterly basis. As a result of that review, what we observed was that about 25% of the book had previously been downgraded. Virtually all those downgrades were well within the past categories. And as a result of that quarterly review because our bankers have previously downgraded credit really didn\u2019t downgrade any additional credit.","We do anticipate given what has clearly been some reduction in capital spending that in the latter part of the second quarter, the third quarter and fourth quarter, as we begin to get year end results for some of these companies, we should see some additional downward migration. But as David pointed out, we have a small group of customers that represent our exposure here. We are closer to those customers and we think they are doing the right things to manage their business in a difficult environment.","Separately, we think about our reserve based lending portfolio. We have now been through the borrowing base redeterminations for 25% of our book and what we have observed is about a 20% reduction in borrowing base availability, customers still have about 40% of availability on average under the lines of credit. Half of the credits we\u2019ve reviewed have remained at their current risk rating. The other half has seen again some downward migration in risk rating but virtually all of that has been within the past category. And so we remain cautiously, comfortable with the credit exposure we have in both the reserve based lending and the oilfield services books.","Michael Rose","Okay. That\u2019s great color. And then maybe as a follow-up to Eric\u2019s question who asked in a different way. If rates do stay lower for longer, what areas in the expense side would you look to maybe trim a little bit or take some more actions to maybe meet that positive operating leverage goal? Thanks.","Grayson Hall","Yeah. Mike, I would tell you, we are not waiting to see what happens with the rate environment. I think being disciplined around expense management is just part of who we are. We\u2019ve talked about that for a number of years. Cleary, the big drivers for us are our three largest categories of expense -- salaries and benefits, occupancy, furniture and fixtures are the areas that you have to move the needle on to get any meaningful change. We have deployed a lot of six sigma initiatives throughout our company to improve the processes.","Those process improvements are -- some of those were actually revenue enhancement opportunities but some of those are -- from a cost standpoint to control costs. We are down in headcount, a 122, from the end of the year to the end of the first quarter. And so you should see us look at those three categories and really every other one. You saw legal and professional down as we continue to watch really third-party spend. That\u2019s probably the fourth biggest one, making sure that we are -- we need a third-party that we hold them accountable.","And in the good old days when we were kind of going through all the changes in the industry, we had to go hire our consultant and throw a lot of labor hours and expense to solve whatever problem we have. Today, we are little more disciplined and in terms of meeting to go out for third-parties, so that\u2019s why that cost is down. And we will continue to look at that category and outside services being quite a fit. Those were five years that we target.","Michael Rose","Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, John.","John McDonald","Hi. Good morning, guys. David, I wanted to ask about the deposit service charge line. Just in terms of the first quarter number, if you look at the 161, is that really advanced or fully out of that and should we see some -- separately some pickup seasonally from the first quarter level?","David Turner","That\u2019s right. So it was embedded in that decline from the fourth quarter to the first. Half of that was already advanced, rolling out finally. We should not have anything going forward on that in the second quarter. And as you mentioned, the first quarter is a seasonal low for NSF. And so based on those, we will see what customer behavior does going forward. The good thing is we are growing accounts. So if we continue to grow accounts, service charges will be expected to grow commensurate with that.","John McDonald","And then in the second half of this year, do we still expect some incremental pressure from changes in posting order and do you have any update in terms of your plans on rolling that out and timing?","David Turner","We\u2019ve gone through a mile or so and our expectation is that update is still in the $10 million to $15 million per quarter range. When we implement, which we expect right now to be in the back half of the year. We have not been as definitive on that date yet, but we are continuing to go through pilots and learning. And as we get closer, we will give you more specific guidance.","John McDonald","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities.","Grayson Hall","Good morning.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning. On credit, this quarter we saw the smallest release since 2011 and given your comments on what\u2019s happening with energy, is it reasonable to expect that the provisions going to start to exceed charge-offs as we look ahead to the rest of the year?","Grayson Hall","Bill, I think that at this juncture what we saw this quarter is that the vast majority of our credit metrics all improved. And so we are still feeling very comfortable about the direction that our asset quality is moving. That being said, we did have pretty solid loan growth this quarter, as well as we\u2019ve discussed some risk rating downward migration of somewhat credits then I would tell you it is fairly broadened. Certainly, there were two or three credits in energy, two or three credits in healthcare and some general industries that drove that migration.","But that being said, sticking to our process, sticking to our methodology, making sure we are going through that with a lot of rigor, a lot of discipline. And so when you look at the quarters going forward, we still believe that the general direction holds true that we should continue to see improvements in asset quality. That being said, you can always have, given where we are at in the cycle and given the level that our loan -- problem loans were at today, you can always have just a handful of credits spend to create some level of volatility for quarter. But we are still confident in the direction of the portfolio.","David Turner","To the extent you see, we continue to see net charge-offs coming down and non-performing loans coming down. Our release was only $5 million, which dropped our coverage of loans from 143 to 140. But you could see if that continues charge-offs down and NPLs down, you could see that ratio continue to migrate down as credit continues to improve, notwithstanding Grayson\u2019s point that you can have volatility in some of this from time to time.","Grayson Hall","Well, we hope that loan growth continues on a prudent and modes rate and that\u2019s going to again have to be calculated into our division expense.","Bill Carcache","Understood. Thank you. The other question that I had is on the consumer side. We are seeing growth as you discussed but it looks like it\u2019s a pretty steady deceleration in credit card and indirect auto loans for the last few quarters. So it\u2019s certainly growth but decelerating year-over-year. I was hoping that you could maybe go a little deeper into both of those businesses. Should we expect that rate of growth to continue to decelerate there?","Grayson Hall","Well, I think -- and I will speak and David can add to this. I think when you look at the consumer, what we\u2019ve seen is that consumer appears to be paying down debt and servicing debt at a faster rate than they were and holding more liquidity in their depository accounts.","And so we are seeing a generally healthier consumer from a credit and deposit perspective. As long as the prices of the old pump stay where they are at, the gas pump stay where they are at, I think the customer has a lot more liquidity, disposable income than it previously has and they appear to be very conservative in the way they are using that. I do think when you look at the two sectors you mentioned, the credit card.","We are seeing -- we are still seeing very strong production. In our credit card portfolio, we think that production does translate into an increased and outstanding balances as we go forward. But there is a lot of seasonality to credit card and we think we are seeing some of that this quarter. But we still think that we\u2019ve got -- given the growth rate of new credit cards, which is growing at about 10,000 cards this quarter, we think we\u2019ve got -- we think we\u2019ve got an opportunity there to continue to grow that portfolio.","The auto sector is a little bit different question and that auto sales are still very strong, but there is more competition in that marketplace today. And we are more disciplined each and everyday in that space. And I think that our pace of growth of that portfolio has moderated, but we are still growing. And we still are active in that marketplace, which you should expect us to retain our discipline and how we lend into that space. And so we still feel good about it, but I do think the pace of growth will moderate.","David Turner","Yes. I would add credit card, it\u2019s a seasonal low. If you go back and look at the trend, we are down in the first quarter historically. But, I mean, the growth over last year at the same time is 5% of credit card. And you heard the growth that we\u2019re getting on production.","From an indirect standpoint, I would add a couple of things. One, we\u2019re up almost 14% if you look year-on-year. Linked quarter, it was only 1.6%. What we\u2019ve done over the past is we\u2019ve really weeded out some of the dealers we are doing business with as we believe we\u2019re getting adversely selected. Our loss rates were higher.","And so we actually are down several hundred dealers. And we are looking at getting with the larger dealer groups. We worked on some Six Sigma initiatives to help us from full through rates to expand production there in the industry. The automobile industry had been in the 16 million units going to -- we\u2019ve seen estimates as high as 17 million units for this year. So we think we will get our fair share of that and look to grow indirect in '15.","Bill Carcache","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Scouten","Good morning, guys. Question on kind of asset sensitivity and NIM. I mean, I know you said you\u2019re forecasting a rate increase, maybe in September and December, but would you guys foresee any changes in the way you look at your portfolio, whether it would be adding on swaps or other kind of [indiscernible] if that rate hike doesn\u2019t play out as you expect currently?","Grayson Hall","Well, we ask ourselves everyday what we ought to do to manage our interest risk. And given where rates are, we believe have been and continued to believe be an asset sensitive is the right thing to do. If perhaps we got a quick rise in rates, we might want to lock in a little bit of advice to downside protection from there. That might be a time to put some interest swaps.","But right now we are looking at the 10-year where it is and expecting a rate increase to come, because we do know but they are on the short rates, we are just at a kind of a false bottom. We know that has to increase and whether or not we get the long end to steep or where we have a flat yield, we don\u2019t yet know. But there will be a time when we consider that stronger than we are right this minute. We think there is more biased to up rate than there is to the down rates.","Stephen Scouten","Okay. That makes sense. And then just as it pertains to kind of the balance between the loan growth that you expect to see and deposit growth, I know you said for the year maybe deposit growth should be 1% to 2%. But if you had another quarter like the strong deposit growth you saw this quarter, what would your expectation be there increased security investments or kind of how would you manage that loan to deposit ratio, where would you want that to pan out? Thank you.","Grayson Hall","I mean, clearly, we look to -- we are encouraged to see deposit grow as strong as it was in this quarter. It exceeded our internal expectations but was very promising news. And with one quarter it doesn\u2019t necessarily make a trend and we are still projecting for the full year sort of a 1%, 2% deposit growth. We would love to be wrong on that and deposits exceed that, but I think we\u2019ve got to have another quarter or so before we\u2019re convinced that that is true.","I do think from a loan to deposit standpoint, we certainly would like to see loan growth more robust that it is to allow us to get a better balance and come closer to peers on our loan deposit ratio. But given the growth and deposits we saw this quarter, well we backed up a 1% or so in that regard. So we are seeing strong lending pipelines and hopefully we will have -- we will see continued strength in loan demand. But I don\u2019t -- at this don\u2019t see a strong amount to offset the growth in deposits that we are seeing.","David Turner","Yes. I think as a result of that, you\u2019re seeing us, our securities books still pretty high percentage of our earning asset base, little higher than we would like, but we are not going to manufacture loan growth. The loan growth is there and is prudently underwritten that we will deploy that cash there, but if not within the securities book. We have been relatively short on securities and we paid a price for that in terms of the lower NIM, but we think that\u2019s the right call. And to the extent we had deposit growth outside in that 1 to 2, that\u2019s what we would absent the loan growth.","Stephen Scouten","Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good morning, guys.","Grayson Hall","Good morning.","Ryan Nash","David, I was trying to get some clarity on the outlook for the net interest margin. Clearly, you are saying that there is increase for rates in your budget. But how do we think about the trajectory of the NIM before we actually get interest rates rising? And I just wanted to make sure that your guidance you gave us last quarter was still applicable. So after 10 years stays at around the current level the downside case could be 10 to 12 basis points.","David Turner","Yes. Ryan, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s got a little better. We think to the extent we stay in. Again last quarter we said the 1.75% to 2% 10-year. If we took that today, that probably would be in the 9 to 10 basis point range. So that tie better than what we disclosed to you last quarter.","Ryan Nash","And just the trajectory of it?","David Turner","Yes. I think we would continue to have pressure leading into '16 with this low rate environment.","Operator","Excuse me, this is, Operator, can you hear me?","David Turner","Maintaining this low rate environment.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And then just on expenses, you\u2019re obviously down year-over-year in the first quarter and you are talking about being -- remaining committed to prudent expense management. But I was just wondering given what you\u2019re doing on the branch side, you talked about reducing professional fees and you\u2019re referring something about pacing. Should we see the absolute level of expenses declined for the remainder of this year relative to 2014?","David Turner","We gave you a little bit into prepared comments. We had a couple of things, so we had some benefits from -- $15 million benefit in the first quarter that offset the payroll tax increases that won\u2019t repeat. We also will have the impact of our merit increases that we gave our folks. We will have a full quarter of that.","And then we had our legal and professional fees were down quite a bit from historical quarters. We think that there is some volatility there. I don\u2019t think it will be back where it was a quarter before. But I am not as confident that they could repeat at the level that we had this past quarter. So you might see a little bit of a tick up from that. But that being said, we are looking at every expense category everyday to control those going forward to '15 into '16.","Ryan Nash","And David just one quick follow-up on that. When I look back on past years there is not much seasonality heading into 2Q on the comp line. I am just wondering if you maybe size for us how big of an increase we should expect for things like merit increases?","David Turner","Well, if you -- we have increases been in that 2.5% range on salaries for merit and then I told you about the '15 that won\u2019t repeat. So you can do some and we had 11 million that was in there already for payroll taxes. So if you take those three things, you will get pretty close.","Ryan Nash","Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim Securities.","David Turner","Hi, Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. I just wanted to circle back on the credit quality issue. The information that you\u2019ve given about the energy portfolio is perhaps better than what we might have expected, but it sounds like maybe some of the other stuff is a little bit worse -- considering that there isn\u2019t necessarily evident pressure on other sectors of the economy. So I am wondering if you could just maybe us some insight about what\u2019s causing the negative reading of migration in areas outside of the energy portfolio.","Grayson Hall","Yes. I think one things we wanted to communicate to you is that migration was really was handful of large credits and there are some in energy, some in healthcare and other industries. And really if you look behind that, it\u2019s idiosyncratic issues with each of those. There is nothing systemic with them that caused that rating downgrade. There were downgrades within the past category. You saw downgrades into classified, but there is really nothing again systemic there that causes us concern with overall portfolio.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. So just in terms -- I mean you have been very clear about your overall expectations for NPL. But I guess my -- is that just a function then of the expectation that these idiosyncratic issues have not been sort of addressed and there is nothing similar on the horizon about basically the interpretation?","Grayson Hall","That\u2019s right. We feel live we\u2019ve recognized what the issues are. Clearly each of these has their own story and defending on where that story goes, you can have further downgrades through the deterioration. We are just trying to send the messages that there is nothing systemic that these are handful of credits that really caused us this issue.","So hopefully, we believe we recognized the issues that are there today and where they go from here, they can get better, they might get worse and we will take up that real time and there are provisioning. But we think we\u2019ve gotten our arms around it.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much.","Grayson Hall","Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer, if would like few comments.","Barb Godin","Yeah. I just going to jump in and say, I am looking at list, what did migrate? And firstly, the majority of them are paying as agreed. We are very close to our customers in terms of the credit servicing and making sure that if we see anything at all that we will move that into a non-pass rated category until things cure themselves.","But as I\u2019m looking at the reasons, they have to renew a largest contract, another was the systems issue, delay, another was billing and order processing issue, et cetera. So there is nothing that I saw in there as we -- and we do go through each and everyone of this credit prior to this call. That said, there is the warning signal or there\u2019s some emerging risk that we have to recognize. I also would anticipate that the majority of these credits will move back to a pass category in the next few quarters.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Hi. Good morning. Just a question on the securities portfolio, it\u2019s been about the same size and your yields actually went up a little bit sequentially. And I just wanted to understand, as you\u2019re trying to manage the rate environment, LCR, et cetera? Are your investment yields coming in higher or was there a delta in premium amortization that you could, perhaps, explain as well? Thanks.","Grayson Hall","Yeah. Ken, it\u2019s a couple of things. One the day count does impact that, so we moved, I think, it was what 244 to 251 and premium amortization for us was down a little bit about $3 million, so it didn\u2019t take a whole lot to move that around a little bit. We -- I think your basis -- your question is, are we doing anything structurally different, the answer is, no.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then second question is just given -- you\u2019ve talked about this in the past as your relatively strong positioning from a capital perspective and you did do a good job in terms of raising your CCAR asked relative to prior years? But you\u2019re still sitting on a tremendous bed of excess capital? So with regards to opportunities like you did this quarter to take down the long-term debt? Can you just give us any updated thoughts on whether it\u2019s the outstanding commercial portfolios that are out there potentially or acquisition appetite? Any updated thoughts on your incremental uses of excess capital? Thanks.","Grayson Hall","Yeah. So one of our three strategic pillars is really effectively deploying our capital, we did that through our 2015 CCAR as you mentioned. We do realized we have excess still and but the things we want to deploy it in, the way we think about it is, we want to deploy it in our loan growth and when we have excess after that we look to have acquisitions with this banks or non-banks. We\u2019re doing a lot of work around that.","To use the excess capital I want to be real clear that we think about acquisition is more about using the excess capital, paying cash versus using our shares where they are priced today and so we\u2019re looking at that to the extent.","We can do some transactions and still have some excess capital, perhaps, we will return that to the shareholders, because we don\u2019t want that denominator of the return on tangible common equity to continue to grow and accrete. We need to get that more optimize, so that we can get our return metrics where we wanted to be. It just takes time and we will get there.","Ken Usdin","Thank you, Grayson.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Good morning. I want to see if you can give a little more color on loan yields in the first quarter. We saw -- heard a few increases in select portfolios, including commercial real estate, owner occupied, investor mortgage, all up -- selectively. I just want to get the drivers of that and if we should expect that such yields can remain stable or even move higher from here?","Grayson Hall","John, you mentioned, so overall loan yields, you can see we\u2019re down 1 point. Some of that can be driven my mix. We\u2019re trying to stay pretty discipline with our pricing. If you look at our loan growth relative to peer all through 2014, we grew nicely at 3.6% for that year, so we\u2019re below our peers. Part of that\u2019s being disciplined in terms of what we want to put on our books and making sure we\u2019ll get paid to the risks that take.","As we think about expectations for increasing or improving, the easiest portfolio for that to happen is really in our home equity portfolio, because we have -- still have a portion of our home equity portfolio that was priced at prime minus -- a half of prime minus 1 and as refinance activity takes that out, we get a little bit of an increase in home equity.","You can see it was up just 1 point this past quarter. So we\u2019re really trying. I guess the main thing is we\u2019re trying to be discipline with regard to pricing, but I would not expect any major increase in loan yields over the near-term.","David Turner","And John, I just think you have to -- we\u2019re trying to remain very discipline around loan pricing and I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job there. That being said, it\u2019s a very competitive marketplace today and you are trying to book the prudent loans that you have the opportunity too. But with the level of competition in the market it\u2019s hard to move those rates up, absence some kind of interest rate increase.","John Pancari","Right. But, I guess, what I was getting and also is that, if you look at the linked quarter change in the portfolio yield for your commercial real estate, mortgage, owner occupied, as well as the non-owner occupied portfolios. They actually saw an increase linked quarter in the average yield and just wondering how you accomplish that?","David Turner","They also do it and predominantly there\u2019s some mix of loans in those categories as we got new and renewed production.","Grayson Hall","And if you look at the pure dollars they\u2019re in our supplement, you\u2019ll see that the interest income from those portfolios remained relatively the same. And in the case of investor real estate mortgage we had some properties that rolled out the portfolio that we\u2019re at lower rates than what we are going on. So it just looks a lot, we increased, not sure, a 10 basis points, but look at the income is really only a $1 million difference, so it get a little bit of an anomaly when you look at it just quarter-to-quarter.","John Pancari","Okay. And then my second topic was just around the credit deterioration again in the healthcare and other portfolios. And all -- were they share national credits at all? And then separately, what was the average size of those credits that moved on the classified status?","Barb Godin","Yes. So, handful of them were shared national credits. In fact, the majority of them were shared national credits that did move, wherein we don\u2019t leas any of those shared national credits. And in terms of the average size, it would be approximately $30 million each.","John Pancari","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning.","Grayson Hall","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","I just had a question around the debt refinancing. You have a stack of -- high cost debt behind what you just refi and I\u2019m wondering what your though are on continuing that process?","Grayson Hall","Betsy, so, we -- the remaining debt that we have is really tied to capital instrument. So anything that\u2019s a capital instrument has to be subject to the CCAR process. As we think about -- have thought about that, we want to be careful in terms of just getting high cost debt, it\u2019s uneconomical. In other words, the payback period advance so excessively long would make sense to us.","If you recalculate the payback period on what we did take out between two, three years, so that works for us, when you start going out, six and seven, eight, nine years, is just doesn\u2019t make it worth our while. Notwithstanding the fact, we know we have excess capital, but we just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right things for us to do. Go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","I was just going to say, if the rate environment continues to stay lower for longer or tougher for longer, doesn\u2019t the math start to work in your favor to take down some more of this debt?","Grayson Hall","If it\u2019s lower, it actually -- it still works against us because we maybe able to get an issue out there that\u2019s fairly cheap relative to what we have. The premium that you have to pay to take it out is just enormous and that\u2019s really where we get stripped up. If we get the holders to take it without a premium it would be good.","Betsy Graseck","Yeah. Unlikely to happen. Thank you.","Grayson Hall","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Matt.","Matt Burnell","Good morning, folks. Just I have a question on the deposit growth, which you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times. And perhaps this is specific to David\u2019s comments about retail deposits. But it look like the non-interest bearing deposits balances were up about $1.8 billion on an end of period basis, which has been up only about $300 million on an average basis. What\u2019s going on there and does that have any implication for your outlook for deposit growth in the next couple of quarters?","Grayson Hall","Yeah. I mean, we spend a lot of time. You are obviously analyzing the deposit growth. And I think the good news is what we\u2019ve found is that the growth has been broad across our markets. It was not isolated to a particular market or a group of markets but was fairly broad based and across markets that we serve.","To David\u2019s point a moment ago, we are growing accounts and growing households that are banking with us. And so we\u2019re obviously starting to see the benefit of that. But most of our growth, as you\u2019ve seen was in the low cost deposit or non-interest bearing deposit categories, which is some of the more favorable deposit mix that we could have hoped for. We do know that there is some seasonality to these deposits.","There is tax reforms that are occurring for consumers today. We also know that the consumer is having a fairly substantial benefit and reduction in gasoline prices that they are having to pay. When you aggregate all that, consumers, as we mentioned are really servicing and paying down consumer debt in a much more productive manner this quarter than we\u2019ve seen last quarter.","And we also are seeing much more liquidity on the part of those consumers. So it\u2019s a behavioral change at least for this quarter that we\u2019ve seen in our consumer base. I think we\u2019ve got to have a little more time before we absolutely agree that, that\u2019s a behavioral change with some link to it. But so far it\u2019s a very promising start in 2015. In that regard, we\u2019ve just got to see how well it holds up.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And David, a quick administrative questions for you. In terms of the branch consolidation charge this quarter, you mentioned that was related to your plans to reduce branches by about 50 this year. Should we expect future charges along those lines, or is that it for this year related to the 50 you\u2019ve mentioned?","David Turner","We don't have any current plans for further consolidation at this time. That being said, we constantly look at our network, including where we might want to consolidate, where we might want to build new branches. We still believe that is a very important channel for our customer base. And so while we don't have plans today, we will continue to look at refining and to the extent we see opportunities to consolidate, we\u2019ll do so.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR Capital Markets.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Miller","Yeah. Thank you very much. Most of the questions have been already asked. But I want to ask a little bit about the mortgage side of business. One of your competitors in your region was seeing very strong purchase production of growth over the last couple of months, especially out of State of Florida. Can you add any color around that, have you seen the same thing?","David Turner","We have. If we look at our production, you can see it in our supplement. But our production from a purchase standpoint was 60% of our volume and refi 40. So, we're seeing a strong purchase. It was down a little bit for us in the first quarter relative to the fourth. Refis really picked up, given the rate environment that we saw and we like that volume that we are seeing going into the quarters. So, we are looking for a continuation of improvement throughout the year in particular next quarter, but it\u2019s fairly consistent with what you're describing.","Grayson Hall","I mean all of the -- all the metrics that we are following in the mortgage business were positive at the moment. We like most people anticipate a very strong second and third quarter. The mix shift in the purchase versus refinance moved around a little bit on this quarter because of the rate flow but overall much better picture in the mortgage business.","Paul Miller","Okay. Hey guys. Thank you very much.","Grayson Hall","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello there. You\u2019ve talked a couple of times this year about the opportunity to acquire some servicing assets on the mortgage side. Could you just give an update on your appetite there and how that fits into your broader thoughts on deployment of capital?","David Turner","Yeah. So the three pillars to our strategy as we mentioned, one of them is diversifying revenue and the other one is deploying capital. Positive operating leverage is third one in the middle. So if you think about diversifying revenue for us, we believe we have a competitive advantage in servicing. We are very good at it. It\u2019s a low cost operation for us and we have room to put that on our books even though capital charge coming through in Basel III is a little more onerous.","We believe that\u2019s a good use of our capital and have been looking for portfolios to purchase. But we aren\u2019t going to buy descending portfolio. We want to buy portfolios in our market and we want a portfolio where there just can be our customers. We did do one deal of $406 million, but we are out there looking. There are a lot of -- there are people shopping some today that we\u2019ve taken a look at. But we are pretty strict in terms of what we are willing to take on.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then in terms of the size of portfolios that you are looking at, can you give us a sense on that?","David Turner","Yeah, the sense of the portfolios that we are looking at?","Geoffrey Elliott","Yeah.","David Turner","Well, we want them to be on our footprint.","Geoffrey Elliott","The size -- sorry, the size of the portfolios?","David Turner","Yeah. Somewhere in the $500 million to a $1 billion dollar range is what we\u2019ll be looking at.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Grayson Hall","Good morning Marty.","Marty Mosby","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. David, I had a very technical kind of accounting. When you talk about the affordable housing, you talked about the increase in the tax rate and then you talked about an increase in fee income I think. Was there just a compression of fee income from the affordable housing because I\u2019ve seen it in expenses and not income? So, I just wanted to make sure that was the right geography?","David Turner","Yeah. It\u2019s an income for us, Marty. It\u2019s an offset. It had been an offset to income historically for us when we adopted the accounting literature. We took that offset which was a debit and we moved that down to the tax line. So it actually improved our NIR and it -- our tax expense also went higher about that 300 basis I\u2019ve mentioned. So it\u2019s just geography.","Marty Mosby","Okay. And then the other thing that I was looking at was, we\u2019ve kind of head up what you might call a stall point here with a couple of issues creating some headwinds, one of them the catalysts that you are really looking for besides rates that could create the next earnings momentum for you over the next year or two. Thanks.","David Turner","Well, I think that deploying our capital is important too. There is no single one thing that we knock it out in the park. It\u2019s doing a lot of things well. It\u2019s executing our business plans. It\u2019s containing to grow loans and deposits. It\u2019s continuing to deploy our capital, looking at acquisitions from banks and non-banks, making the investments in people. You can look at wealth management as a prime example of.","We\u2019ve taken the medicine and making investments in people knowing that it\u2019s going to take to generate revenue. We believe further investment in those people in wealth management as a example. It is the right thing to do. There are other businesses we are looking at doing the same thing too. Capital markets is an area where we\u2019d like to expand and be larger in as we differentiate or diversify away from spread.","And so we are like you, we are not sitting here waiting for rates to bail us out. We are making -- we are making a difference by growing these revenue sources, watching our expenses as we go, but needing to make the investments of dollars to generate revenue growth.","Grayson Hall","Yes. But Marty I think it\u2019s a great question and a very relevant question where the industry is right now. And quite honestly, we don\u2019t see some one thing that we could do that would alter our power momentum. What we are committed to is very steady and consistent progress in strengthening our balance sheet, strengthening our business.","And we had over the last couple of years really trying to put in a whole new set of strategies for how we grow our core business and we are starting to see the fruits of that labor and that we are seeing growth more broadening across our markets and more broadly across our product lines. We obviously are augmenting our product lines and we are augmenting number of people we are partnering with to grow our business.","But I think to David\u2019s point the biggest thing that would help from earnings standpoint is the rate environment, but we can\u2019t wait on that, we can\u2019t depend on that. And plus our core business is really the long-term sustainable help for the company.","And so I think you are going to continue to see us very broadly in a diversified way continue to try to grow all aspects of our business. And if we can do that in a very steady and consistent manner, I think we\u2019ve got a very sustainable business model and one where shareholders benefit long-term.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, Grayson. Question David, you were talking about using the excess capital to potentially buy portfolios or even obviously give it back to shareholders. But you did also mention that your primary purpose is to grow the loan portfolio of course. If we put aside your excess capital that you have today and we just look at your ongoing earnings, how much loan growth do you need every year to optimize the excess capital you create every year so you don't need to go out and buy a portfolio or buy another bank?","David Turner","Yes. That's a great a question. I think if you looked at our generation, you could almost have a third of that be used, 30%, 40% of that be used up for loan growth, you are going to have 30% of 35%, maybe 40% in dividends over time. And then the other would be return to the shareholders. That\u2019s kind of what the math would lead you to. But we want to grow we have -- we do have the excess and we have to put that to work. But outside of excess, I think it\u2019s almost third to third to third.","Gerard Cassidy","And when you look at the third for a loan growth, what kind of loan growth would you need to use that third of the capital, is it 8% or 9% per annum or 3% or 4%?","David Turner","Yes. It\u2019s in that 4%, 5% range.","Gerard Cassidy","Good. And then circling back to your syndicated loans, of the oil presence or energy presence that you have with that portfolio of over $2 billion if I recall, how much of that is in syndicated loans? And second as part of that, is your approach -- when one moves into a classified category, is your approach to a syndicated loan where you are a participant different than your approach when it's not a syndicated loan and you are the lead and you are working with the customer?","Barb Godin","Firstly, the majority of our product in energy is syndicated loan, I believe that roughly 86% are syndicated. Secondly, we are the lead versus the participant irrespective. We are still required even at the participant to make sure we have all of the appropriate information about that customer.","We work with the agents and we make our own determination as to what that risk rating should be. And it can be different from the agent. Often, it is not different from the agent however and they are think that once a year typically during the Shared National Credit exam.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sameer Gokhale of Janney Montgomery Scott.","Grayson Hall","Good morning.","Sameer Gokhale","Hi. Thank you. Good morning or afternoon here. I had a question about the pull-through rates on any or indirect auto business again, just so we visit that. I think you had mentioned that you\u2019re doing some Six Sigma initiatives there and that\u2019s led to some improvement in pull-through rates.","But I was curious if those -- that improvement was related to maybe any sort of bottlenecks in terms of your ability to underwrite those loans, have you automated the underwriting? Or can you just tell us specifically what you may have changed there that\u2019s helped improve pull-through rates?","Grayson Hall","Yes. That\u2019s a great question. So I had mentioned earlier we deployed our Six Sigma teams throughout the banks. Some of them are revenue producers and some of them are expense management. This particularly one was revenue producing and what we have found is that they analyzed our process and noted that in some cases when an application would come through our sender that it would get kicked out for certain underwriting exceptions that would then force a human being to look at the underwriting and force that person to make a decision whether or not they are going to approve it.","And by the time that happens that deals already being done with the dealer, because the dealer requires speed of execution. So what we did is we found that those cases where an underwriter is approving the deal, we changed our algorithm to build into that, the acceptance so that it wouldn\u2019t kick out. And that improved -- that one change improved our pull-through rate quite substantially. And that was a big driver of our increase in revenue over the past couple of quarters.","Grayson Hall","We really try to focus our teams on the larger dealer groups. And if you look at this business, obviously quality of answer is important, quality of answer is important both to the customer, to the dealer, and to us. But the speed of answer is also very critical. And so we\u2019ve worked on both. We\u2019ve greatly improved our quality of answer and we\u2019ve greatly improved our speed of answer, all through automation and also in terms of bargaining, who we want to do business with. And from a dealer standpoint -- and so that rationalization of how we do business and who we do it with has made a tremendous difference in our pull-through rates.","Sameer Gokhale","That\u2019s very interesting. Thank you. And then just another question, in terms of the consolidation of your bank branches, I think, it sounded like more or less done based on your guidance 50 branches, but could look at ongoing opportunities. But are you using any sort of Six Sigma initiatives there also to rationalize these branches? And as you think about consolidating these branches or the process that you follow, to what extend do you look at just a kind of the marginal profitability, so marginal revenue minus marginal cost, because it seems like you probably have a lot of centralized technology and IT cost that is spread across the branches.","And to the extent, you shut down these branches, if they\u2019re marginally profitable then you don\u2019t get to leverage those technology costs. So are the efficiency items more important, do you look at marginal revenue, marginal costs and how do you think about that?","Grayson Hall","Yeah. I mean -- first of all our branch rationalization process is the continuous process. And we\u2019re constantly looking at transaction activities, marginal cost, marginal profitability, and trying to figure out what the -- our branches deliver in terms of direct contributions, making sure that all of our branches are profitable on direct basis.","And -- but when you look at the analytics of the branch system and where we consolidate and where we expand, that process is very comprehensive. And you have to factor in the relevance of branch, because still 80% of our new account sales come from the branch offices. And so we are very careful to determine if we consolidate the branch, how many of those customers do we lose that has a lot to do with where they\u2019re being consolidated into, how far away that receiving branch is from the consolidated branch.","We also have to factor in the community impact of that even though lot of our customers bank with us over digital channels. That bank branches is still a community asset and it\u2019s still an asset that that community values and we have to think through all of those issues before we consolidate.","We have tried to really still be engaged in all of our communities and deliver service in all our communities. We try to do that the most efficient way we can. So those analytics are comprehensive and they have done on ongoing basis. And we think that while we\u2019ll continue to see consolidation opportunities, we also see the need where some communities need more branches.","And so on a net-net basis when we think about it, we are not sure that our number of branches over time diminishes that much. In fact, we think over the next few years we\u2019ll be relatively stable. Well, we don\u2019t let the analytics drive that. And so we let the analytics tell us whether we ought to expand and whether we ought to contract.","Sameer Gokhale","Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate the explanation.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Eads of UBS.","David Eads","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. You have given some pretty good color on various kind of line items in loans. But I was wondering if you talk a little about what you are seeing in the real estate constructing portfolio, you\u2019ve guys have had some pretty strong growth there recently. Just curious, how big that can get and how kind of what trends you are seeing there?","John Turner","Yeah. This is John Turner. When you speak about construction, I guess, you mean overall just generally in the portfolio, I would say.","David Eads","In the -- in the investor real estate construction line?","John Turner","Yeah. So we very focused on managing that exposure fairly tightly as high resource across all the markets that we do business in. Majority of the exposure would break down between homebuilder finance, which is $700 million plus portfolio and there are multi-family business. And I think what you are saying is that portfolio grows, it\u2019s funding under previously approved construction facilities really have not been originating a lot of additional multi-family credit over the last six plus months.","And so primarily the growth is fundings under a portfolio that currently has duration of about 23 plus or minus months. So fairly short duration, a lot of turnover and again we\u2019re managing as a very finite resource given what we believe is some softness in a few of the markets that we operate in.","David Eads","All right. So we sort of expect that growth to taper off here pretty quickly?","John Turner","I would say, yes, expected to moderate.","David Eads","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of J.P. Morgan.","Grayson Hall","Good afternoon.","Vivek Juneja","Good afternoon, John and Grayson. So look at your efficient ratio. Perhaps back the $50 million your core efficiency ratio 66%, was it similar to last quarter and a year ago? And we factor in the deposit advance -- sorry, not the deposit but NSF fee decline that you\u2019re already seeing in the second half. It seems to me, is going to be tough to go much below this, even though you\u2019re working on cost cuts and just continued improvement. Can you walk through what else you need to do to try and get the efficiency ratio really down materially?","David Turner","Well, we have focused on our efficiency ratio, the big driver there is revenue generation. And we made the investments we talk about the growth that we seen in NIR. We\u2019ve seen the loan grows as our revenue grows and it takes a little bit of pressure of the expense side, but we\u2019re working on that, too. If we take all three -- two revenue improvements in NII and NIR, and work it on expense, we do expect the efficiency ratio to drift down but our goals is to get down into lower 60s. We really want to be in the 55 to 59 range but we\u2019ll have to have a rate increase to get there. So absent that we would be in the -- we expect to be in lower 60s. So it\u2019s a focus every day.","Vivek Juneja","Lower 60s even post the NSF reduction, David?","David Turner","With a rate increase, yes.","Vivek Juneja","With the rate increase. Okay. Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Grayson Hall","Thank you. I believe that is the last question. We appreciate everyone\u2019s time and attention today. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Paula, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. I would like to remind everyone that all participants online have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Dana Nolan to begin.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, Paula. Good morning. And welcome to Regions\u2019 Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer will review highlights of our year-over-year financial performance; and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the details compared to the prior quarter.

These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of today\u2019s call.","I will now turn the call over to Grayson.","Grayson Hall","Thank you, Dana. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. Before we get started, I want to take a few minutes to speak about the hurricanes that richly impact our footprint. I am immensely proud our team responded and met the needs of our customers, fellow associates and our surrounding communities.","Due to our market locations, we unfortunately have significant experience dealing with severe weather related events, immediately following the storms. Our first priority was ensuring the safety of our associates in the impacted areas. While several associates were personally affected, we are extremely grateful that none were injured.","In total, 482 banking offices across 100 counties and six states were impacted by the storms. But because of our strong processes and experience teams, we reopened 95% of them within three days following each storm. With the exception of one branch that sustained significant damage, all banking offices are open and conducting business.","Our focus remains on helping our customers, associates and communities begin to recover and to rebuild. And while we are still evaluating the financial impact of these storms, David will provide you with our related loss estimate shortly.","Keep in mind historically following similar weather events we typically experienced a pickup in economic activity associated with reconstruction efforts along with overall deposit growth. Despite the impact from the hurricanes, we reported solid earnings available to common shareholders from continuing operations of $296 million during the quarter. With earnings per share of $0.25, while generating positive operating leverage, expanding our net interest margin and producing solid growth in pretax pre-provision income.","Importantly, we remain focused on expanding our customer base, as we believe is fundamental to future income generation. This quarter we grew checking accounts, households, credit cards, Wealth Management relationships, total assets under management and Consumer loans.","We continue to benefit from our asset sensitive balance sheet, as strong deposit franchise, which drove an 8% year-over-year increase in net interest income and a 30 basis point increase in net interest margin. We continue to make strides in our efforts to control expenses, adjusted non-interest expenses decreased $32 million or 4% year-over-year as efficiency remains a top priority of our team.","As it relates to loan portfolio, several factors impacted balances this quarter. New and renewed loan production increased 9% year-over-year. However, consistent with the rest of the industry borrowers access to capital markets to a larger degree this quarter which led elevated loan payoffs and loan pay downs.","Furthermore, we continue to execute our deliberate diversification strategy focused on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns. While these decisions pressure loan growth in the near-term, we believe it is a right long-term strategy and a prudent approach to creating a balanced portfolio, positioning well for future loan growth, with respect to asset quality, our disciplined approach to credit continues to deliver positive results, although uncertainty regarding the impact of the hurricanes remains, we continue to characterize overall credit quality as stable.","Regarding efficiency, we recognize the slow growth environment could persist for some time, and therefore, we remain focused on what we can control. Our plan to eliminate $400 million in expenses is well underway. However, we now expect to achieve the majority of these eliminations by 2018 rather than 2019.","Through our work in this area we are implementing steps to simplify and grow the bank, which will allow us to significantly improve efficiencies and effectiveness throughout the organization. We believe there is an opportunity for expense eliminations beyond the $400 million. To that end, additional efforts are underway and we will provide more information later this year.","With that, I will turn it over to David to cover details of the third quarter.","David Turner","Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Now let\u2019s get started with the balance sheet and take a look at average loans. In the third quarter, average loan balances declined to $79.6 billion as growth in the consumer lending portfolio was offset by declines in the business lending portfolio. Total new and renewed loan production remained strong for the quarter and approximated $16.2 million.","Within Consumer, we continue to reshape our indirect lending portfolios with a focus on increasing overall risk-adjusted returns. This is evidenced by our decision to exit a third-party indirect auto contract, while expanding our indirect other Consumer portfolio through point-of-sale offerings.","As a result, average balances in the consumer lending portfolio increased $180 million or 1% quarter-over-quarter, despite the strategic runoff in the indirect vehicle portfolio. Excluding this runoff, average Consumer loans increased approximately $385 million.","Average indirect vehicle balances declined $180 million or 5% during the quarter. Runoff in the third-party portfolio of $205 million was partially offset by an increase of $25 million in our dealer financial services portfolio. The full year average impact of the runoff portfolio is expected to be approximately $510 million.","Our other indirect lending portfolio, which includes point-of-sale lending initiatives, continues to experience growth. Average balances increased $257 million or 26% linked quarter aided by the purchase of approximately $138 million of unsecured consumer loans late in the second quarter. Average mortgage balances increased $171 million or 1% during the quarter. However, growth continues to be constrained by lack of housing supply across our footprint.","With respect to home equity lending, average balances continue to decline during the quarter, decreasing $134 million or 1% as growth in average home equity loans of $44 million was offset by a decline of $178 million in average home equity lines of credit.","Further, average line utilization decreased 68 basis points, compared to the second quarter. Average balances in our consumer credit card portfolio increased $36 million or 3%, as a number of active cards increased approximately 2.5%.","Turning to the business lending portfolio, average balances totaled $48.3 billion in the third quarter, a 1% decline from the second quarter, despite a 1% increase in total new and renewed production.","As Grayson mentioned, we experienced elevated loan payoff and pay downs. In particular, many customers in the large Corporate space access the fixed income market taking advantage of favorable pricing spreads, using those proceeds to pay down or payoff bank debt.","The level of payoffs and pay downs was 1.5 times higher than the previous quarter and just over 50% higher than the third quarter of last year, a number of investor real estate loans paid off prior to maturity, reflecting the impact of low capitalization rates and a modest increase in mergers and acquisitions was observed in the middle market space, further contributing to elevated loan payoffs. In addition, the decline in average owner-occupied commercial real estate loans reflects continued softness in demand and competition for middle market and small business loans.","As part of our risk mitigation strategy, we continue to reduce exposure in certain industries and asset classes. For example, average direct energy loans decreased $52 million or 3% ending the quarter at $1.9 billion or approximately 2.4% of total loans outstanding.","Average multifamily loans decreased $58 million or 4% during the third quarter and average medical office building loans decreased $24 million or 8%. In addition, average investor real estate construction loans declined $195 million, due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve diversification between construction and term lending.","While these risk mitigation strategies have impacted average loan growth, we believe they are appropriate and will position us well for prudent and profitable loan growth in the future, while maintaining an appropriate credit risk profile.","Evidence these strategies are working include, continued declines and expected loss estimates across all business lending categories, improving our relevance and profitability within the shared national credit book or capital recycling efforts have also reduce both the probability of default and expected loss estimates by approximately 10%.","The company has reviewed approximately $33 billion of large shared national credit exposures since 2016, and as a result, we exited $4.2 billion of credit and added new or expanded existing relationships of $4.6 million. These expanded relationships provide average trailing annual revenues that are 51% higher than all other shared national credit relationships. Average trailing annual non-interest revenues that are 123% higher and average risk-adjusted returns on capital that are 252 basis points higher.","With respect to loan growth, while current pipelines are higher than they have been all year, line utilization reductions and payoffs experienced quarter have tempered expectations. As a result, full year average loan balances, excluding the impact of third-party indirect vehicle runoff are expected to be down slightly. However, based on what we know today and borrowing another quarter of elevated payoffs, we expect loans to grow in the fourth quarter on an end-to-end basis.","Let\u2019s move on to the deposits. Similar to loans we also continue to execute a deliberate strategy to optimize our deposit base, focusing on valuable low cost Consumer deposits, while reducing higher cost brokered and collateralized deposits.","Total average deposits decreased less than 1% during the quarter, primarily due to our strategic decision to reduce higher cost deposits. Average deposits in the Wealth Management segment declined $276 million or 3% as a result of ongoing strategic reductions of collateralized deposits.","Certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities continue to shift out of deposits and into other fee income producing customer investments.","Average deposits in the other segment decreased $220 million or 7% driven primarily by our strategy to reduce retail broker suite deposits. Average deposits in the Consumer segment experienced a seasonal decline of $153 million, while average Corporate segment deposits increased $23 million. We continue to expect full year average deposits to remain relatively stable with the prior year.","Let\u2019s take a look at the composition of our deposit base. Third quarter deposit costs remain low at 17 basis points and total funding cost were 37 basis points, illustrating our deposit advantage. As a reminder, our deposit base is more heavily weighted towards retail customers, approximately 75% of average interest bearing deposits and 51% of average interest free deposits are considered retail.","In addition, we have a loyal customer base, as more than 43% of our consumer low cost deposits have been deposit customers at Regions for more than 10 years. And finally, approximately 50% of our deposits come from MSAs with less than 1 million people and approximately 35% from MSAs with less than 500,000 people, both are in the top quartile versus our peer group. For these reasons, we believe that our deposit base is a key component of our franchise value. It is a competitive advantage in a rising rate environment.","Now let\u2019s take a look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $921 million, representing an increase of $17 million or 2% from the second quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.36%, an increase of 4 basis points. Interest recoveries continued to benefit net interest income, adding $4 million and 2 basis points of net interest margin relative to the second quarter.","After normalizing for recoveries, net interest margin and net interest income benefit primarily from higher market interest rates, driven by the June Fed funds rate hike, partially offset by a decrease in average loan balances and higher interest expense associated with our holding company debt issuance early in the third quarter. Further, one additional day in the quarter benefited net interest income by approximately $5 million, but negatively impacted net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points.","Looking forward to the fourth quarter and excluding the impact of interest recoveries, we expect net interest income and net interest margin to grow modestly, in line with market expectations for December Fed funds rate increase. For the full year, we continue to expect net interest income growth in the 3% to 5% range.","Before we move on, I want to make a couple of points about our asset sensitive, given the extended low rate environment, the majority of our balance sheet has essentially re-priced. As a result, our natural reinvestment of fixed-rate loans and securities even at current interest rate levels will be accretive from here. So even if interest rates remain low, our balance sheet is position to deliver continued growth in net interest income.","Let\u2019s move on to non-interest income, adjusted non-interest income decreased $13 million or 3% during the quarter, driven primarily by declines in mortgage and capital markets income, partially offset by an increase in service charges. In addition, the company incurred $10 million of operating lease impairments during the third quarter, compared to $7 million incurred in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have incurred $22 million in operating lease impairment charges, primarily attributable to oilfield services customers.","Mortgage income decreased $8 million or 20% during the quarter. Despite a 9% decline in mortgage production, sales revenue increased $1 million or 4%, primarily due to improved secondary marketing gains. However, this increase was offset by $9 million reduction in the valuation of residential mortgage servicing rights.","Capital markets income decreased $3 million or 8% driven by lower merger and acquisition advisory services, and loan syndication income, partially offset by higher revenues associated with debt underwriting.","Card and ATM fees were negatively impacted by the hurricanes, as the estimated impact of fee waiver was approximately $1 million in the quarter. However, service charges increased $6 million or 4% during the quarter, aided by continue checking account growth, new now banking accounts and higher mobile deposit revenue.","Wealth Management income remained relatively unchanged during the quarter. Of note, our wealth team recently launched the Regions\u2019 wealth platform through its partnership with SEI Global Services. This new and enhanced platform is expected to benefit all customers across the wealth space, including private wealth, institutional services and asset management, with best-in-class online experience, while also increasing operational efficiencies.","Similarly, in an effort to improve our customer experience through innovation, we were in the process of rolling out a new iTreasury platform. This should enhance the customers experience and further expand our product capabilities.","We also announced this week plans to expand person-to-person payments and account to account transfer solutions through our partnership with Fiserv. We will add Turnkey Service Brazil and Transfer Now capabilities in the first half of 2018, providing an enhanced and seamless customer experience across all payment types.","With respect to future non-interest income, we expect growth in capital markets revenue next quarter as several transactions originally expected to close in the third quarter are now expected to close in the fourth. In addition, we expect a modest increase in Mortgage, Wealth Management and card and ATM fees to collectively contribute to overall growth in adjusted non-interest income during the fourth quarter. We continue to expect full year adjusted non-interest income to remain relatively stable with the prior year.","Let\u2019s move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis expenses were well-controlled in the third quarter, decreasing $19 million or 2%, compared to the second quarter. Total salaries and benefits decreased $14 million or 3%, primarily due to reduced pension settlement charges and lower health insurance costs. Professional fees decreased $7 million during the quarter, associated with lower legal and consulting costs. Provision for unfunded credit losses also decreased $5 million during the quarter.","These declines were partially offset by $5 million increase in occupancy and a $7 million increase in other real estate expenses related to branch damage, hurricane preparedness and other storm-related charges.","Despite the impacts of operating lease impairments, pension settlements and hurricane-related charges, the adjusted efficiency ratio improved 150 basis points to 61.7% during the quarter. We continue to expect the full year adjusted efficiency ratio to be approximately 62%.","The company also produced solid growth in pretax pre-provision income, increasing 4% compared to the second quarter and 12% compared to the third quarter of the prior year on an adjusted basis.","For the first nine months of 2017 the company generated positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis of just over 1%, reflecting growth and adjusted total revenue of 1.5%, offset by 0.3% increase in adjusted non-interest expense. We expect full year adjusted operating leverage of approximately 2%. With respect to taxes, the effective tax rate increased 140 basis points in the quarter to 30.9% and our full year guidance for the effective tax rate remains unchanged in the 30% to 31% range.","Shifting to asset quality, excluding the impact of the hurricanes, we experienced another good quarter from the credit perspective. Non-performing, criticized and trouble debt restructured loans continue to improve. Non-performing loans decline $63 million, resulting in an NPL ratio of 0.96%. We also reported a 10% and 8% decline in business services criticized and total trouble debt restructured loans, respectively. These declines were primarily driven by improvement in commercial loans.","Net charge-offs totaled $76 million in the third quarter or 38 basis points of average loans. This represents an $8 million increase over the second quarter and includes the impact of two large energy credits. For the first nine months of 2017, net charge-offs represented 41 basis points of average loans. We continue to expect full year net charge-offs to be in the 35 basis point to 50 basis point range.","As Grayson mentioned, it\u2019s too early to assess the full impact of the hurricanes, generally it takes up to nine months to fully evaluate storm-related losses. We are still gathering available intelligence, including direct communications with customers where possible to determine potential losses resulting from the storms.","As you would expect, our loss estimate includes a significant amount of uncertainty. Based on our current evaluations, we have provided for an incremental reserve of $40 million for loan losses. Including the incremental reserve, the provision for loan losses match net charge-offs for the third quarter. The resulting allowance for loan losses at quarter end increased 1 basis point to 1.31% of total loans outstanding.","We continue to characterize overall credit quality is stable. However, volatility from quarter-to-quarter in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially as it relates to large dollar commercial credits, fluctuating commodity prices and further analysis and revisions to hurricane-related exposures.","Let\u2019s move on to capital and liquidity. During the quarter we repurchased $500 million or 34.6 million shares of common stock and declared $105 million in dividends to common shareholders, an aggressive start to our recently approved capital plan.","We see the compounding benefit of executing repurchases early, but also understand the need to retain some flexibility throughout the year. Our resulting capital ratios remain robust. Under Basel III the Tier 1 capital ratios was estimated at 12.1% and the fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.2%.","Finally, our liquidity position remains solid, with a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 81% and we were fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule as of quarter end.","Regarding expectations, while 2017 has been challenging in many respects, we still expect to meet our overall profitability targets for the year. We are able to accomplish this because our asset sensitive balance sheet continues to benefit from increasing interest rates, including the benefit of our core deposit base and at the same time we are continuing to exercise solid expense management.","I have provided an update on each of these targets on the previous pages of deck. Those updates are summarized again on this slide for your reference.","So in conclusion, despite the negative impacts from recent hurricanes, we reported solid third quarter results and remained focused on continuing to execute our strategic plan to drive growth and shareholder value.","And to end, as Grayson mentioned, we expect to achieve the majority of the $400 million expense eliminations by 2018, one year ahead of schedule and are committed to achieving additional expense reductions over and above the $400 million amount, and we look forward to providing additional details to you later this year.","With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, David. Before we begin the Q&A, as a courtesy to others, please limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. We will now open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Peter.","Peter Winter","Good morning. I was just curious how much is left in terms of the balance sheet repositioning on the commercial side and in indirect auto?","David Turner","And in -- so in indirect auto, that runoff usually takes about two and half years runoff. It cost us somewhere in the $500 million range as we mentioned, so we just now finished about a year, so we have about a year and half round number, Peter.","Peter Winter","Okay. And on the commercial side?","David Turner","So we think about repurposing, we got -- round numbers we had talked about another $1 billion that we were looking at. The truth is we continue to see opportunities to look at all of our relationships as they continue to come through and mature, and so it\u2019s hard to explain to you exactly how much in terms of runoff would occur, it\u2019s really the opportunity to look at a lot of large corporate relationships as they come up for renewal.","John Turner","Yeah. Peter, this is John Turner. I would say that, our expectation was that we would begin to see inflection point in the third quarter and fourth quarter. Obviously we were surprised by the amount of pay downs in the third quarter and just the amount of liquidity has float into the bank. The timing of the transition from building or from becoming less dependent on construction lending, particularly in real estate and matching that with an increase in term lending has been all slower than we thought.","We do see that pipeline now building and so believe that we will grow loans based upon what we know today, grow loans on an end-to-end basis in the fourth quarter. Our pipelines are stronger, our production has improved quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and so we believe we are beginning to see some momentum building in the loan portfolio based upon what we know today.","Peter Winter","Got it. And just a quick follow question, of the $400 million in planned expenses, how much of you realized so far?","Grayson Hall","We had talked about a $300 million we will -- that we found and the extra $100 million, which got us to the $400 million we will find by 2019. We\u2019ve now updated that guidance to tell you we will find the majority of that extra $100 million in 2018. But we want to reserve kind of including our 2018 looks like for later part of the year, because there are investments that we were making.","There\u2019s investments in technology in particular and so in the -- in December we will give you better guidance in terms of what that means for 2018. And we\u2019re also looking beyond the $400 million over the next three years, \u201818, \u201819 and \u201820, we will give you guidance on that in December as well.","Peter Winter","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Rose","Hey. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the expense question, can you just remind us what areas of the expense base the $400 million is going to come from. Then maybe just a follow-up on that the $400, how much you think will be on a net basis when you mentioned some investments? Thanks.","David Turner","Yeah. I will answer the last question. We really want to reserve that Michael for December, because we are continuing to finalize our budget, our strategic plan for the next three years. So we will have a better net response to you then.","As we think about, how we are going to simplify and grow our bank, really looking at all processes that we have, starting with how we serve the customer all the way to how back office enables the front office to deliver our product and service. Our goal is really to simplify how our customers bank with us and how our associates serve our customers.","So it is a broad base initiatives that we will be looking at how we can leverage technology to get more efficient and to have a more effective responses in many areas, and so we continue to look at branches as we\u2019ve done, we have consolidated more branches and any peer since the crisis and we look at a lot of square footage even outside of the branch in terms of opportunities for saving. So it\u2019s is pretty broad base.","Grayson Hall","Yeah. Michael, I think, that just to reiterate what David said, we continue to look at how we can do business more efficiently and still making sure we are doing business effectively. And as David mentioned, part of that strategy has been in our channels, in our culture channels and year-over-year our branches are down almost 7%.","We\u2019ve been pretty aggressive in trying to rationalize our physical points of presence. We\u2019ve also been very judicious in looking at all of our operational processes to try to streamline those to make a more efficient.","We just invested in some technologies, it have allowed us to continue to reduce our staffing levels to be more efficient. We work very diligently with all of our vendor partnerships to try to rationalize our expanded -- expenditure with third parties and you going to see us continue to keep expense management at a really high-level of focus and priority over the next several quarters. It\u2019s an imperative in the slow low rate, slow growth environment.","David Turner","Yeah. Michael, let me add one another thing, you know what our goal is with regards to efficiency in 2018. And as Grayson just mentioned, our expectations are to do what we have to achieve that -- those expectations that we laid out at our Investor Day, regardless of the environment that might be ahead of us in a slow growth whether rates are up or down or whether they are up or flat, and so that that\u2019s what our reason for focusing on the expense initiative.","Michael Rose","Thanks, David. That\u2019s actually I was trying to get at. And maybe just my follow-up, you guys have a decent provision for the hurricanes this quarter, if I go back to Katrina, since you guys took about $100 million and the loss came in a lot less than that. Should that same dynamic occur here, should we think about the future pace of provisioning to be more in line with loan growth and you basically growing to that excess provisioning, is that the right way to think about it?","Barb Godin","Yeah. This is Barb Godin. I wouldn\u2019t call an excess provisioning, what we do is then we look at the Hurricane Katrina of course being a very different hurricane than the three that we experienced, including a lot of the rules and regs, and help you got money back in Katrina and what happens.","But we take a very methodical approach to sizing up our exposure could be to the hurricanes, not just on the physical exposure but we reach out to customers, we reach out to other, we use the third-party service to help us do some reconnaissance work, et cetera. And so we come up with what our best estimate is recognizing the hurricane came in at the end of the quarter, the best estimate at this point as you know was about $40 million. We are going to continue to refine that.","As David said, it will take us roughly over the next nine months for us to fully get that number result, but we will have much more clarity even as we move into next quarter on that number. And so far as the rest of our allowance goes, we fill customer with the methodology that we use around our where we set allowance for the company. So again, we certainly don\u2019t count on any bleed over from something like hurricane.","David Turner","I do thank\u2026","Michael Rose","Okay. That\u2019s helpful.","David Turner","\u2026for Barb comments that, every day we are learning a little bit more from our customers and obviously the more information that we get from customers and communities, the more refined our estimates are for those losses. And historically, as Barb mentioned, within about a nine month period we got a great degree of certainty about what that potential is. We\u2019ve taken what we believe to be disciplined and prudent approach of what we\u2019ve done this quarter, but for certainty we have got a lot of play out.","Michael Rose","Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Matt.","Rob Hansen","Good morning. This is Rob from Matt\u2019s team. Just on expenses versus your adjusted expense number of [ph] $80 (39:15), I was just curious, how should we think about the 4Q level and then how much of the specific items that you called out this quarter should expect to be repeated this quarter and thereafter, specifically the hurricane related expenses, branch consolidation charges, et cetera?","Grayson Hall","Yeah. We had a very solid quarter from an expense management standpoint. I think you got a look at the hurricane and the expenses that we incurred both direct and through the expense categories and addressing the hurricanes, but also the provisioning we took as well. So, David, if you want to try to frame that.","David Turner","Yeah. So, I think, that, clearly, as we mentioned the hurricanes, three of them happened right here at the end of the quarter, so we did our best to estimate losses both on the credit side, as well as the non-credit side.","We will have some adjustments in the fourth quarter. I don\u2019t expect those to be many great magnitude thus far based on what we know today. And as we think about expenses, we still are within our guidance that we provided at the end of the year that we would be less than 1%, we have given you a guidance that we believe our operating leverage for the year will be approximating 2%.","So, I think, your questions also leading into what it\u2019s look like for \u201818 and I am just going to ask you to be little patience until we get to December and we will give you a better net number for both \u201818, \u201819 and \u201820.","Grayson Hall","Just to look at the third quarter and when we have hurricanes like this we dispatched off a lot of our team members with supplies and generators and so forth. We have a lot of payers. We have a lot of expenses occur when these events happen and our response to them and then we\u2019ve also taken a very supportive stance on waiving fees and so forth during the event period to try to accommodate our customers getting through these tough situations. And so, but in spite of that we still posted up a really solid quarter from an expense management perspective.","Rob Hansen","Okay. And then just separately with regards to the NIM and net interest income beyond 4Q, how you are thinking about your ability to grow net interest income dollars next year ex the benefit of any additional rate hikes?","David Turner","Yeah. So provided a little bit of guidance in terms of where our balance sheet is currently positioned right now with regards to even rates where they are as we have fixed rate loans maturing that and securities are rolling over that we can reinvest to have some accretion in net interest income and resulting margin.","We do believe if we mentioned that we will grow loans in the fourth quarter we will give you guidance in terms of loan growth relative to 2018 again in December. But we expect to continue to benefit without a rate increase and of course, the probability of December increase is in the plus 80% right now which is why we gave you the guidance on NIM in the fourth quarter to be up modestly.","Rob Hansen","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Geoffrey.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe back to the efficiency ratio, because I think it\u2019s important to clarify, the target from the Investor Day of adjusted efficiency ratio less than 60%. You said that that still stands the full year 2018, just wanted to make sure everyone\u2019s on the same page on that?","David Turner","Yeah. That\u2019s correct.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. And then in terms of the expense initiatives that you\u2019ve run so far, I guess, there is always a trade-off between saving expenses and avoiding a negative impact on revenues. Is there anything that you\u2019ve done so far that stands out as having been particularly effected in that trade-off, just some color around that might help us think about, how we look at expenses going forward and when most aids can come from?","Grayson Hall","Yeah. Probably the biggest impact is -- has been how we have sort of rationalize not only our physical footprint in terms of numbers of branches, but also how we format those branches from a staffing perspective and In will ask John Owen to speak to that just a moment.","John Owen","Sure. Our Investor Day few years ago we laid out plan to consolidate say 100 and 150 branches over a three-year period. We beat that. We are about 163 branches right now at the end of two years, so we are in advance to that. As Grayson said, at the same time, we have also rolled out a new online and mobile banking platform. Good thing I point out in the face of consolidations on the consumer side, we continued to grow revenue from customer accounts, grow deposits and grow loans. So even with the branch consolidation, I think, we are having a very balanced approach both on the digital side and with physical branch side.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Moss of FBR.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Moss","Good morning. I was wondering on your end of period loan growth commentary, if you could help give some color around what your expectations of the drivers are for the fourth quarter growth here?","John Turner","Yeah. So, this is John Turner, again. I would say, first of all, our markets were, probably, some of the slowest to recover in the country when we look at GDP and over the last two years we\u2019ve had some headwinds as we thought about trying to remix our business. We have also had to deal with energy recession, concerns about multifamily and our desire to change our mix of business.","All that came together to have a probably larger than might expected impact on loan growth. As we look forward what we are beginning see is market strengthening and so in our core businesses our portfolios are improving and some of ours specialized businesses like tech and defense, like financial services, we are seeing a good bit of activity in those markets and so pipelines are strengthening and then our Regions business capital asset based lending platform is active and we expected to have a good year in 2018.","And so as we look at our pipelines, we look across our markets, we are seeing strengthening in those economies and we are seeing, frankly, better execution amongst our teams, which we believe is going to lead to again some positive momentum, given what we know today.","Steve Moss","That\u2019s helpful. And then where does the -- what\u2019s the balance of your shared national credit as of September 30th?","David Turner","The actual balance is effectively unchanged. I think our commitments are in the range of $38 billion, outstandings roughly $19 billion, commitments are up modestly, outstandings are down a little year-over-year, couple $100 million, but we have generally tried to hold those balances about flat and are again remixing the business exiting some relationships, as David pointed out, entering others as we see opportunities to be more relevant and to gain more of our customers\u2019 share wallet.","Steve Moss","And one last one if I may, just wondering where you are looking to invest in the franchise in 2018 as we think about expenses here?","David Turner","Yeah. So we\u2019ve mentioned quite a few technology investments in our prepared comments in terms of helping our customers, helping guess our customers bank easier with us and helping our associates serve our customers. So you are going to continue to see investments in digital, will be a big investment that we need to have.","And I think the whole simplify and grow the bank, again a lot of initiatives there in terms of process. So we think technology will enable us to have more efficient and effective processes through that implementation, which is going to cost us a little bit of money, which is why we don\u2019t want to answer the question for \u201818 just yet.","Grayson Hall","But you will see\u2026","Steve Moss","All right.","Grayson Hall","You will see us as we go through our simplify and grow initiatives, we want to try to continue to enhance and strengthen the customer experience. We also want to try to find more ways to create more effectiveness and more efficiency in the back office, in particular in risk and compliance and we believe there\u2019s technology solutions that will allow us to do a better job in risk and compliance through robotics and artificial intelligence, we believe some of those investments we are making really find a way to make us not only do a better job, but do that job in more streamline manner.","Steve Moss","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning. I had a follow up on the discussion, I think, David, you were mentioning, how the front book is coming in better than a back book, were you speaking about the overall portfolio, so that would reflect some mix shift of where you\u2019re generating some of your incremental assets? What was that more specific around? What you\u2019re seeing in your securities book at current yields and what you\u2019re seeing in a C&I and CRE. Can you just give us some color there on would be helpful?","David Turner","Yeah. Betsy, it\u2019s actually both of those. We are looking at the total portfolio, the fixed rates that are -- that exist on both in consumer and in the business side, as well as the securities book that rolls over every month, and so it is a combination of those two or literally three things that we believe will help us be accretive in terms of net interest income even if rates stay kind of where they are.","Betsy Graseck","And how you are thinking about NIM in that situation, I mean, obviously, we\u2019ve got deposit betas that are beginning to rise here, so what\u2019s your thought on that?","David Turner","Well, we\u2019ve -- so we do believe that as rates continue to increase in the face of that, those rates increase deposit betas will also increase. We\u2019ve been fortunate thus far our deposit beta is around 10% thus far, quarter-over-quarter we were about 14%, but like beta about 10%. We believe this is a unique advantage for Regions and that our deposit base SKUs to our retail depositors where in smaller markets we\u2019re in those markets where deposit costs or deposit pricing is less sensitive and that we will have a better deposit beta relative to our peers consistent with what we experience last up cycle. So we think there\u2019s continued benefit for us to actually extract the value out of our deposit franchise as we finally getting rate increase.","Betsy Graseck","And then just on, again the front book, back book question, are you also suggesting that spread in C&I and CRE, and three other asset classes are stabilizing here or is there yields are up enough to offset any spread compression?","Grayson Hall","Yeah. It\u2019s a great question. So spreads clearly have tightened up since a year ago. That\u2019s why you saw not just with Regions but a lot of our peers with access to the capital markets, that\u2019s why you saw our $1 billion issuance in the third quarter, a little earlier than we had originally intended, because of that spread tightening.","I think there\u2019s still a lot of competition out there. Spreads are down, not down dramatically from a year ago, call it 9 basis points across the board, different asset classes and I think that we don\u2019t have an expectation that that will continue to grind down, but I don\u2019t see it evident of massive reversal either.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then just lastly, NIM, your commentary about 4Q going up, not making any commentary about NIM for 2018 yet, but NII moving higher that that\u2019s the takeaway?","Grayson Hall","That\u2019s correct. Consistent with the expectation\u2026","Betsy Graseck","Increment\u2026","Grayson Hall","\u2026 December rate increase, that\u2019s right.","Betsy Graseck","Yeah. Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Understanding your comments about potential volatility to come post hurricane on the credit front, just given that this quarter was the biggest energy charge-off quarter you had, you had 10% reductions in almost every metric of non-performers, classifieds, TDRs, et cetera. Could you just help us understand what your underlying trajectory looks to be for losses, any reason to expect any change in the loss rate and can we still continue to see ongoing reserve leases from here given all that?","Barb Godin","Good morning, Ken. It\u2019s Barb. Relative to the charge-offs. You are right. We did have a $28 million energy charge-off quarter. That was oilfields services primarily we are seeing an end coming to that book. I think you will start to see that over the coming quarters, but the energy itself in E&P and other sectors is really played itself out little bit of oilfield services left.","Relative to improvements in things like our non-performing loans out of our top 11 credits eight of them were actually payoff that came which was -- and it was very broad base. There was only one that was energy and the rest were just a mix of everything else. That was good to see 90-day delinquency behave, criticize classified. We talked about it, et cetera.","So all in as we think about where credit is, is stable for the time being and in terms of the allowance obviously as you hear me say, we follow a mythology -- methodology and as things get better in our book, the allowance will as well. But we again don\u2019t anticipate the allowance that were going down, for example, at 1%, et cetera, but there could be some room for improvement in the allowance ratio.","Ken Usdin","Yeah. And I was just going to say that, hopefully, you start to see some loan growth from here and have to provide a little bit, but it would just seem with these metrics that you\u2019d be at least offsetting that with ongoing improvement and related releases?","Barb Godin","You are right. But, again, both Mr. Turner and Mr. Owen are working very hard as is the rest of the company to make sure that the growth story is going to be a great story for us particularly as we look forward over the next few quarters and well enough to release as much in my allowance, because we will be offsetting those loan growth.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Understood. Thank you, Barb.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Jennifer.","Jennifer Demba","My question really revolve around the energy book. Barb, do you think that energy book is bottomed at this point or do you think we will continue to see some contraction?","Barb Godin","In terms of, let me go with outstandings first, I think, you are going to see some contraction in our oilfield services, loan balances will continue to decline somewhat. In our midstream we are happy with that part of the book. You are going to actually see us growing that part of the book. Same thing with E&P. There is opportunities in there.","Relative to the credit quality cases, again, the only key step, we really still think, time and attention on is the oilfield services piece. That too again, as I mentioned, this quarter we saw lot come through this quarter and I think that too is resulting itself pretty quickly.","Jennifer Demba","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Good morning. Just wanted to -- on the topic of capital, wanted to see how you would -- as you looking at the deployment, how would you prioritize M&A in the grand scheme of things? And then also on that front would you -- how do you view whole bank M&A versus non-bank deals? And then, lastly, what would you be your target as deals if you were to look at anything on the bank side? Thanks.","Grayson Hall","John, first of all, our focus right now is primarily call trying to execute on our fundamentals, grow the bank organically, manage expenses with an off a lot of focus and attention and deliver on the numbers that we have tried to project to you in our Investor Day and attract very closely with. As David mentioned, we will give you an idea sort of what we think in 2018, 2018 looks like in December.","I think that when you look at the options we got in deploying our capital we first and foremost would look to deploy in the loan growth, as Barb had mentioned earlier, and of course, John Turner and John Owen are both pushing hard inside the company to do that and do it prudently.","We have executed on number of non-bank acquisitions that that we think have been of a size and nature that has been accretive to our. We continue to look for those where they are at. We also monitor the bank M&A market very closely. We look at that. We look for when the economics of that makes sense for our company, but quite frankly and then quite candidly, right now, that\u2019s not the primary focus of ours. We just don\u2019t see that wonderful opportunity at this juncture. Those that could change. The map could change on that. The economics can change. But for right now we don\u2019t see that as a tremendous opportunity for our company.","John Pancari","Okay. Thanks, Grayson. And then on the margin front, the deposits that you\u2019ve been allowing to runoff the higher cost deposits, sorry if I missed this, but what is the average cost of what you have been running off? Thanks.","Grayson Hall","Hey. I don\u2019t have that John in front of me. We think about though is, we have collateralized deposits that don\u2019t provide us much liquidity value at all, because we\u2019ve had to post securities for that, give us a little bit of diversification if you will from things like the FHLB. But when we have and let just call it Wealth Management or trust deposit where our customers are really looking for a better deal and we are willing to give them. We don\u2019t want that deposit that that really is going to show more of 100% beta as rates move and so we are sitting here with a loan deposit ratio of 81%, 82% and it just doesn\u2019t make sense for us to continue to hold on to those type deposits and we will continue to let those roll off.","David Turner","And if you look at, I mean, over the last several quarters we really strengthen the composition of our deposit base and we think it\u2019s more of the core strength of the company and we have rationalized some of our higher cost deposit that whether it be collateralized deposits or public funds deposits. And under these liquidity rules, we want to make sure that we\u2019re building high quality deposit base that we can depend on quarter in and quarter out and so we feel very good about the deposit base we have built obviously in this environment. We have been able to really make that composition ship very gracefully and feel good about where we are at today on deposits.","John Pancari","Okay. Thank you. And just one more, on the back to Steve\u2019s question around the shared national credit. Thanks for giving us the number. What portion of that portfolio of $19 billion an outstandings, are you the leader ranger. I know you\u2019ve done a fair amount of repurposing with that exposure. So curious where you stand now in terms of which ones your lead on? Thanks.","Grayson Hall","So, John, we would say that we have a lead position right or left and a little over 10% of the opportunities that we\u2019re currently. Well, roughly, we have about 10% of the opportunities that were engaged and we don\u2019t have a number on right.","John Pancari","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja of J.P. Morgan.","Good morning, Vivek","Vivek Juneja","Good morning. Just want to follow up on that cost savings, just to take back a little bit further. You are expecting $400 million through the end of \u201818. How -- where are you thus far in that number. How much of that $400 have you achieved thus far?","David Turner","Yeah. So, Vivek, what we recently changed was, when we added the $100 million, so we had an original $300 million plan.","Vivek Juneja","Yeah.","David Turner","We added $100 million earlier and said we would find that through 2019. We have now adjusted that extra $100 million and say, we find the majority of that in 2018. So, not much of that component is actually in our current run rate.","Vivek Juneja","Okay.","David Turner","And we will give you better guide as to what that means in December.","Vivek Juneja","So meaning of the remaining $300 million, you are -- what you\u2019re saying is not all of that not most of that is already done, given that you are only one more quarter away from the end of \u201817. Does something less than just one quarter worth that\u2019s still you are expecting to still add, is that a fair interpretation?","David Turner","Yeah. That would be fair.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Second thing, insurance, fees have been coming down last three quarters, trying to understand just what your plans are for the business?","David Turner","Yeah. So we continue to evaluate the risk-adjusted returns on all of our businesses, we evaluate diversification of our businesses and geographies and as it relates to insurance you\u2019re quite right, industry has had a down on a premium market for some time, that starting to reverse actually recently. And so, but we continue, we are going through our strategic planning process, where we look at all of our businesses as we speak and we will give you again more guidance as to what that looks like for our next three years, we will lay that out in December.","Vivek Juneja","And what about acquisitions on that one, haven\u2019t seen you do anything much, is that just lack of opportunities or have you decided to step off that a little.","David Turner","Yeah. So we backed off that a little bit, you know that industry very well, the multiples of cash flow became very expensive and it was hard for us to justify the type of investment it was going to take us to get any type of sizable acquisition done. So what you have really seen it later are really smaller acquisitions of producers that we put into that business and but it\u2019s really right this minute cost prohibitive for us to spend the type of cash flow. It\u2019s going to be required to do the deal.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. And one last thing, your target for CET1 where -- what are you targeting and by when?","David Turner","Yeah. So we\u2026","Vivek Juneja","Just remind us.","David Turner","Yeah. So we have laid out a target common equity Tier 1 in the 9% range. We had originally targeted that for the end of 2018. We can\u2019t quite get there by the end of 2018. It will be in 2019 before we get there kind of given where our loan growth and our capital plan are laid out. We will update that as we do our CCAR next April, but we expect that to approach that sometime in 2019.","Vivek Juneja","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Saul.","Saul Martinez","Hi. Hi. How are you? Sorry to beat a dead horse here, just want to understand the mechanics around the cost save. So at the Investor Day you highlighted that $300 million over the next three years which about 35% to 45% of that would be in \u201816 and the remainder would be kind of split between \u201817 and \u201818. That -- so essentially what you\u2019re saying is that still holds with the incremental $100 million or so will be mostly achieved in 2018. Am I understanding that correctly?","David Turner","That\u2019s correct, Saul.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Okay. Great. Just -- and just the final question, if the 10 years kind of stays where we are at 2.4 even gravitate that, what is that mean for premium then going forward?","David Turner","Yeah. So we have kind of got to the point where our premium amortization is really not as important to us in terms of what our ultimate net interest income and margin are, we are sitting here in the mid-30s in terms of amortization, that might drift a bit lower, but not appreciably. So we are looking at maybe it bottoms out in the low 30s to high 40s.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Got it. So not really much of a change. All right.","David Turner","Yeah.","Saul Martinez","Terrific. Thanks so much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor back over for any closing remarks.","Grayson Hall","No. Thank you. We very much appreciate your time and your interest in Regions and look forward to speaking to you at the end of next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

At the end of the call there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Dana Nolan to begin.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, Paula. Good morning and welcome to Regions\u2019 second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Participating on the call are Grayson Hall, Chief Executive Officer and David Turner, Chief Financial Officer. Other members of senior management are also present and available to answer questions. A copy of the slide presentation we will reference throughout this call as well as our earnings release and earnings supplement are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward looking statements during today's call that are subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to defer materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release.","I will now turn the call over to Grayson.","Grayson Hall","Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Second quarter results reflect continued momentum in 2016 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing on our strategic priorities. We are pleased by our continued progress despite a challenging and somewhat volatile economic backdrop. For the second quarter, we reported earnings available to common shareholders of $259 million and earnings per share of $0.20. We continue to deliver results in areas we believe are fundamental to future income growth. We expanded our customer base as we grew checking accounts, households, credit cards and wealth relationships.","Our approach to relationship banking and customer service is excellence is instrumental to our success and we are always pleased to receive external recognition in these efforts. In that regard the Reputation Institute and The American Banker magazine recently ranked Regions as the most reputable U.S. bank overall and for the second consecutive year, the most reputable among customers. We are honored to again receive this top ranking as it recognized the efforts from all Regions associates in identifying and meeting the needs of our customers and communities we serve.","Another outstanding recognition came from Temkin Group which ranked Regions among the top 10% of companies they rated in 2016 as we ranked second in the nation for online experience. Looking further at our results we achieved total average loan growth of 4% compared to the prior year, despite market uncertainty the overall health of the consumer remains a bright spot. To that end consumer loans increased 5% year-over-year with loan balances up in every asset category and our consumer credit metrics continue to improve.","Consumer net charge offs decreased [ph] 5% from the second quarter last year, non-accrual consumer loans decreased 16%, delinquencies decreased 5% and troubled debt restructured loans decreased 4%, active credit cards increased 12% year-over-year, all active debit cards increased 4%. Total transactions owned cards increased 6% and total spend is up 5%. Further average consumer deposits were up 3% year-over-year including savings deposits were up 9%.","Turning to business lending, average loans increased 3% over the prior year. As we indicated last quarter we are experiencing some softness in our commercial lending pipelines, still strong but soft. In some areas customer sentiment continues to reflect less optimism and more uncertainty in the economy and we have yet to see small business owners really return to market with confidence to invest and expand. We are also exercising caution and discipline as we approach internal concentration risk lending limits with certain segments and certain geographies and as we highlighted recently at Investor Day we continue to strengthen our loan portfolio in our focus on migrating credit only relationships recycling that capital into more profitable and deeper relationship that resulted in better portfolio overall. As a result, and as previously disclosed we expect to attract towards the lower end on a 3% to 5% average loan growth for 2016.","Despite softer business loan demand total adjusted revenue increased 4% over the second quarter of 2015 reflecting the effective execution of our strategic plan to grow and diversify our revenue. Our investments are clearly paying off as capital markets increased 41% and wealth management increased 6% on a year-over-year basis. With respect to market conditions, the global and macroeconomic environment does remain challenging as such it's critical in this operating environment that we focus on what we can control. To that end we remain committed and focused on discipline, expense management and are on pace to achieve our 2016 efficiency and operating goals.","For the first six months of 2016 our adjusted efficiency ratio was 62.3% and we have generated 4% positive operating leverage on adjusted basis. With respect to energy lending, while our oil -- oil prices have improved, lower prices continue to create challenges for certain industry sectors while benefitting others. On a point-to-point basis our directly energy loans have declined $324 million, are 12% from the first quarter and currently stand at $2.4 billion or 2.9% of total loans.","Additionally, we continue to maintain appropriate energy reserves which now stand at 9.4% of our direct energy exposure, up from 8% last quarter. The percentage increase is primarily due to the decline in direct energy loan balances. Further, we are substantially complete with our spring redetermination which as to date resulted in a 22% decline in customer borrowing bases.","Turning to capital deployment, we successfully completed the annual comprehensive capital analysis interview process or CCAR and received no objection to our planned capital actions. As in last week, our Board of Directors approved a $0.065 on common shares and $640 million share repurchase plan. We remain committed as a team to deploying our capital effectively through organic growth and strategic initiatives that increase revenue or reduce ongoing expenses while returning an appropriate amount of capital generated to our shareholders.","In closing, our second quarter results reflect the successful execution of our strategic priorities and our continued commitment to our three primary initiatives which are rolling and diversifying our revenue streams, practice disciplined expense management and effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to our success and we remain on track to deliver our performance target.","With that I will turn it over to David who will cover the details for the second quarter.","David Turner","Thank you and good morning everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and a recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the second quarter, up 1% from the previous quarter. Consumer lending had another strong quarter as almost every category experienced growth and total production increased 20%. Average consumer loan balances were $31 billion, an increase of $303 million or 1% over the prior quarter. This growth was led by mortgage lending and balances increased $162 million linked quarter reflecting a 49% seasonal increase in production.","Indirect auto lending increased $93 million and production increased 4% during the quarter as we continue to focus on growing our preferred dealer network. Other indirect lending which includes point-of-sale initiatives increased $87 million linked quarter or 15%. Turning to the credit card portfolio, average balances increased $16 million from the previous quarter and our penetration into our existing deposit customer base increased to 17.7%, an improvement of 20 basis points. Total home equity balances decreased $87 million from the previous quarter as the pace of runoff exceeded production.","As Grayson mentioned, we continue to experience softer pipelines in the commercial space. As a result total business lending average balances were relatively stable with the previous quarter. Average commercial loans grew $178 million linked quarter inclusive of a $64 million decline in average direct energy loans. The net increase in average commercial loans was driven by corporate banking as our specialized industry segments added new relationships within technology and defense and financial services and commitments in line utilization were relatively flat with previous quarter.","Let's take look at deposits, total average deposit balances decreased $253 million from the previous quarter. Deposit costs remained near historically low levels at 12 basis points reflecting the strength of our deposit base and total funding cost continued to remain low, totaling 29 basis points in the second quarter. With respect to deposits, loan growth expectations provided the opportunity to accelerate our planned reduction of certain deposits within our wealth management and corporate segments which contributed to the overall decline in deposit balances.","Within wealth management certain trust customer deposits which require collateralization by securities were moved into other fee income producing customer investments. Average deposits in the consumer segment increased $1.2 billion or 2% from the previous quarter reflecting the strength of our retail franchise, the overall health of the consumer and our ability to grow low cost deposits. Our liquidity position remains solid with the historically low loan to deposit ratio of 84%.","Let's see how this all impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on our fully taxable basis was $869 million, decreasing 2% from the first quarter but up 4% compared to the prior year. The resulting net interest margin for the quarter was 3.15%. As you recall the first quarter benefited from items that were not expected to repeat which partially contributed to the linked quarter declines in net interest income and other financing income as well as the net interest margin.","Recent long term debt issuances, lower loan fees and less favorable credit related interest recoveries along with reduced dividends from training assets that benefited the first quarter were the primary drivers behind the linked quarter decrease. Now these were partially offset by higher loan balances. Noninterest income growth was strong in the second quarter reflecting our deliberate efforts to grow and diversify noninterest revenue. Total noninterest income increased 2% on an adjusted basis from the first quarter driven by growth in service charges, mortgage income and card and ATM fees. ","Service charges increased 4% in the second quarter reflecting the benefit of 2% growth year-to-date in checking accounts again, highlighting the strength of our retail franchise. Mortgage income increased 21% driven by a seasonal increase in production. Of note within total mortgage production 75% related to purchase activity and 25% related to refinancing. Additionally, during the quarter we entered into an agreement to purchase mortgage servicing rights on a flow basis. As a result we expect the purchase to rights [ph] to service approximately $40 million to $50 million of mortgage loans per month on a go forward basis. Card and ATM income increased 4% during the quarter driven by 1% increase in active debit cards and an 8% increase in transaction volume.","We had another good quarter in capital markets with increased fees from merger and acquisition advisory services. Linked quarter results declined 7% relative to the prior quarters strong results, the decline was primarily due to reductions in fees generated from the placement, the permanent financing for real estate customers and syndicated loan transactions which were especially strong in the first quarter.","Wealth management income decreased 3% primarily due to seasonal decreases in insurance income. This decrease was partially offset by increased investment management [indiscernible] fees. Importantly despite our reduction in the wealth managements deposits total assets under administration increased 2% quarter-over-quarter. Noninterest income was also impacted by market value adjustments related to assets held for certain employee benefits which increased $20 million compared to the first quarter, however this has offset salaries and benefits with no impact to pretax income. Bank owned life insurance decreased this quarter primarily due to $14 million in claims benefits and a gain from an exchange of policies recognized in the first quarter.","Let's move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis expenses totaled $889 million representing a 5.5% increase quarter over quarter. During the second quarter of 2016 we incurred $22 million of property related expenses in connection with the consolidation of approximately 60 branches as well as other occupancy optimization initiatives. These branches are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. Including these 60 branches Regions has announced the consolidation of approximately 90 branches as part of the company's previously disclosed plans to consolidate 100 to 150 branches through 2018 and we continue to expect to be at the higher end of the range. Total salaries and benefits increased $5 million from the first quarter and as previously noted includes $20 million in additional expense related to market value adjustments associated with asset held for certain employee benefits which are offset in other noninterest income as I mentioned.","In addition, severance related expenses declined by $11 million quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the impact of the market value adjustments and severance charges, total salaries and benefits would have declined compared to the first quarter. Year-to-date staffing levels have declined 4% serving to lower base salaries and fully offset the impact of the annual merit increase. Professional and legal expenses increased $8 million, primarily due to $3 million in lieu and regulatory charges incurred during the second quarter related to the pending settlement of previously disclosed matters, as well as the impact of the $7 million favorable legal settlement recognized in the first quarter.","FDIC insurance assessments decreased $8 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to a $6 million refund related to overpayments in prior periods. As previously disclosed we expect FDIC insurance assessments to increase by approximately $5 million on a quarterly basis associated with the FDIC surcharge, and we anticipate this will be implemented in the third quarter resulting in a quarterly FDIC run rate in the $27 million to $30 million range. Other expenses increased $25 million including an $11 million increase to the company's reserve for unfunded commitments as well as $9 million of credit related charges associated with other real estate and held for sale loans.","Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 64% in the second quarter and 62.3% year-to-date. As Grayson mentioned in this uncertain market environment we are focused on what we can control and to that end disciplined expense management is paramount. Our plan to eliminate $300 million in core expenses through 2018 is well underway. We're also evaluating opportunities to pull forward some of the identified savings as well as challenging our team to thoughtfully identify additional expense eliminations beyond the $300 million previously announced.","Let's move onto asset quality. Total net charge offs increased $4 million to $72 million and represented 35 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan loss essentially matched charge offs in the quarter and our allowance for loan loss as a percent of total loans remains unchanged at 1.41%. Total non-accrual loans excluding loans held for sale increased 3% from the first quarter and troubled debt restructured loans or TDRs increased 4%. Total business services criticized loans increased 1%. These increase reflect global market uncertainty and a strength of the U.S. Dollar along with continued volatility in commodity prices. At quarter end of our loan loss allowance to non-accrual loans or coverage ratio was 112%. We continue to see credit improvement within the consumer portfolio as net charge offs decreased 24% from the prior quarter. Additionally, consumer TERs improved link quarter while total delinquencies remained relatively stable.","Within business services, we experienced $17 million worth of net charge offs within the energy portfolio during the quarter. Approximately half were attributable to Oil & Gas and half were attributable to coal. While oil prices have recently traded around $50 per barrel and are showing signs of stabilization, uncertainty remains. Should prices fall and consistently trade in the $35 to $45 range we expect additional losses between $50 million and $75 million. However, the time frame for these losses now extend through 2017 as we expect resolution will take longer for certain customers in the portfolio. And should oil prices average below the $25 per barrel through the end of 2017 we would expect incremental losses of $100 million.","In addition, weakness in energy, mining and metals and agriculture continues to put some pressure on certain commercial durable goods companies. We also continue to monitor investor real estate in energy related markets. We continue to believe our total allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover inherent losses in these portfolios. Now given where we are in the credit cycle and fluctuating commodity prices, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected especially if related to larger dollar commercial credits.","Let\u2019s move on to Capital and Liquidity. During the second quarter, we returned $258 million to shareholders including the repurchase of $179 million of common stock and $79 million in dividends completing our 2015 CCAR capital plan. As Grayson mentioned, we successfully completed our 2016 CCAR process and received no objection to our planned capital actions. And last week our Board of Directors approved a $0.065 quarterly dividend on common shares and a $620 million share repurchase plan and under Basel III the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.6% and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7% well above current regulatory minimums.","So let me provide you an overview of our current expectations for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect total loan growth in the 3% to 5% on an average basis relative to the fourth quarter of 2015 and given current softer pipelines in the commercial space, we expect to track towards the lower end of that range. Regarding deposits, softer loan growth expectations coupled with a strategic reduction of certain deposits within our wealth management corporate banking segments will result in total average deposits remaining relatively stable with fourth quarter 2015 average balances. Our expectation for net interest income and other financing income remains unchanged, assuming no rate increases for the remainder of the 2016, we expect to be at the midpoint of our 2% to 4% range.","As result of our investments, we continue to expect to grow adjusted non-interest income in the 4% to 6% range on a full year basis and given our year-to-date performance we would expect to be at the higher end of that range. Our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses is on track and we continue to expect to achieve 35% to 45% in 2016. Therefore total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2016 are expected to be flat to up modestly from 2015. We also expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of less than 63% and adjusted positive operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range in 2016.","Full year net charge-offs should be in the 25 to 35 basis point range and given the volatility and uncertainty in the energy sector, we continue to expect to be at the top end of that range. So in closing, we are pleased with our second quarter performance and we believe our results demonstrate that we're effectively executing our strategic plan in the context of a difficult operating environment. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the remainder of the year as we continue to build sustainable franchised value.","With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning and I will turn the call back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, David. Before we begin the Q&A session of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up in order to accommodate as many participants as possible. We will now open the lines for question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","This floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","I want to ask a question about the other expenses, not that they were unusual but there was some credit related to the unfunded commitment as well as some other credit related expenses, I looked about $20 million higher than a run rate, just wondered if that was something that elevated that this particular quarter?","David Turner","Yes, Marty, this is David. So from the time-to-time, we'll have some credits that go sideways on us, this particular quarter we had really one large credit in the unfunded commitment that caused $11 million increase there and the charge for that we run through non-interest expense, and you'll see over quarters the volatility that can have, pluses and minuses, we expected that credit would fund in the third quarter, but believed it was important for us to continue to have an unfunded reserve for that today.","From an Oreo and Health for sales [ph] standpoint again just a couple of credits that happen to be large and we had some write-downs that we believed needed to take place, so we kept valuation adjustments in total of that $9 million. So you're spot on, between the two there was about $20 million of charge that we had to take during the quarter.","Marty Mosby","But thinking about that and then your tangible book value grows, been created by the 2% or better consistent growth. You know as you're looking premium shareholder value, one of the things that's probably -- what you've been able to de-risk because of just getting credit for the tangible book value growth would be an upward momentum for the overall valuation. So just wanted to see if as you think about where you're at today versus where you were at as it went in the last downturn, what makes Regions different from just a risk profile, so significant changes it\u2019s been able to address that should at least make investors comfortable with tangible book value.","David Turner","Sure, so I mean we\u2019ve -- over the past six years we've made a lot of changes and people and process, content of our whole balance sheet has changed dramatically. The most obvious one is the decline in investor real estate which represented almost 30% of our loan portfolio at one time. Today it's about at, call it 9% -- right at 9%. The credit discipline that we have with regards to how we approach business is very different and you know we feel good, we have our hands around our loan portfolio, energy has been a challenge for our industry and those of us that participate in it, but our concentration risk management program that we have in place has reduced the impact -- negative impact we've otherwise have had.","Being the largest bank headquarters in the Gulf State we have now about 3% of our loan portfolio in energy and we've talked about the reserves, the 9.4% reserves so we believe we have that covered. There's some volatility and uncertainty there, we feel like we're on top of that. As we think about our commitment to continue to grow our cash flow, our PP&R, look at the investments that we've made over time, those investments are paying off as we continue to grow and diversify our revenue stream and we've had a fairly consistent margin if you look at that.","And then I'll wrap up with expense management. We have a $300 million target out there, where we said we'd take 35% to 45% of that in the first year, we're on track with where we want to be and I gave you guidance as to where we thought we'd finish the year. So it's very different regions and a very different approach to business and the stability of growth in tangible book value. We've been leveraging our earnings well and returning mid 90% of our capital back to our shareholders in the form of a dividend around 30% of that earnings and you know 60 plus percent in terms of share buyback.","So we think we're deploying our capital effectively. So good business, good markets, good customers and executing against the strategic plan that we laid out in October for our board and at investor day.","Marty Mosby","Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust.","Jennifer Demba","Question on your capital markets revenue, what do you think the potential is for this feed line over the next two to three years it's been growing at a rapid pace for a few quarters now?","Grayson Hall","Yes, I mean as David mentioned earlier we continue to see some softness in our wholesale sales pipeline and if you look strategically what we try to do with that business is to build out a lot of the product offerings we have primarily in capital markets and also in treasury management.","So that we can generate a very reasonable return on invested capital in that business and the capital markets group is a place that we've made significant investments, we continue to believe that those have been thoughtful and smart investments, we have demonstrated a very strong growth this year, we continue to challenge the team and in terms of what the growth capabilities are of that activity. We're coming from a relatively low base so the percentage is remarkably high, but we have not publicly stated a percentage increase goal, but we do believe strongly and confidently that that\u2019s a business that we can continue to grow overtime at an above rate level to other parts of our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","When I look at the criticized loan balances you're giving overall on Page 8, I see an increase and then when I look at Page 12, just specifically the energy balances I see a decrease. So I wondered if you could elaborate on what's driving the increase outside of energy.","Barbara Godin","Yes, this is Barbara Godin. Energy as you said did go down, we saw some other movements as we look at some of the other areas that we have considered to be a little soft that would be agriculture, some transportation and primary metals. So, we're keeping an eye on that, we're being very cautious. In those categories we're watching them and as we see signs that there is any deterioration, we\u2019re immediately [ph] moving it into a special mention category and so that's -- that accounts for the increase there.","Geoffrey Elliott","And just a quick follow-up, I didn't catch earlier, but I think you said the non-interest income growth you thought should be at the higher end of the 4% to 6% range? I just wanted to check I heard that right.","David Turner","That's right, just taking kind of where we are today and looking at the investments we've made and what\u2019s in the pipeline, we feel that we will most likely be at the higher end of that, we'll give you a better guidance one more quarter out, but we feel confident to be able to lean towards the higher end of the range.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell","David maybe a question to you, just following up on your comments about $300 million cost reduction in the 35% to 40% specifically you're targeting for this year, is it reasonable to assume that the pace of that 35% to 40% reduction will be largely back end loaded or could it be perhaps a bit more evenly spaced over the course of this year?","David Turner","Well, you can have -- we haven\u2019t placed it in any given quarter, we really are trying to guide more to the full year than any given quarter. You can have at times spikes in expense from one quarter to the next, but we'd rather just stick with the guidance for the full year than -- more expensively [ph] -- flat modestly from 2015.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And then just on the, what sounds like a little bit of softness in the commercial pipelines particularly in CNI are there, outside of energy are there specific industries where you are seeing particular softness or is it more of a broad based greater level of caution on your borrowers part given economic uncertainty?","Grayson Hall","I think where we try to compete is in the lower end of the commercial market and you are seeing a lot of our competitor demonstrate growth, a lot of that growth has been in the higher end of commercial into the corporate space. But, when you look at that middle market CNI customer we are seeing a lower level of demand for lending to support capital spending. I would tell you that in energies, is an obvious place where that has occurred, but you do see it, you do see that spread across a number of different commercial industries as there has been obviously a strengthening of the U.S. dollar and some uncertainty created by a lot of events, both globally and domestically.","So I wouldn't say it's limited to one particular industry it seems to be more broad based than that. But yes, if you look at credit quality, commercial is still very good. We've had a really good experience now for several quarters in a row. We still expect it to be good, but it's modestly slow, modestly weaker than what we saw a quarter ago and at the same time we\u2019re just not seeing the new and renewed production that we were seeing this time last year.","Matt Burnell","Okay. That's helpful. And David may be just another quick one for you, in terms of the bank-owned life insurance numbers, you mentioned one of the -- couple of reasons why that had moved around over the last couple of quarters. Guess I\u2019m just trying to get level set on what a reasonable run rate would be for the second half of the year.","David Turner","Yes, so the first quarter did benefit from a couple of things. We exchanged the policy into the different product and we always had a plan. Where we are right now is about where you ought to expect that for the rest of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","On net interest income, wanted to just understand, you got the purpose full decline in the whole sale balances, so the balance sheet looks to have shrunk and with the offset being a little bit better NIM. Can you just walk us through how you kind of expect that trade off to go going forward? Do we see not as much growth in earning assets but a lesser decline in the NIM in terms of growing NII?","David Turner","Certainly, from a NIM standpoint we are really trying to growth NII, but NIM will be continued pressure at this rate environment stays where it is and I would expect you can have four to six more points of compressions for the remainder of the year. But as we think about growing NII, we do it from a couple of different spots, one growing earnings assets which is really on the funding side, deposit side and then putting those that growth into -- in good solid loan growth where we can get compensated for the risk that we are taking, where we can get compensated for having a full customer relationship versus just renting out the balance sheet from a credibility standpoint.","It\u2019s very hard to make money if you're just making loans only. So, we're challenging our teams where we have relationship that\u2019s a credit only relationship to figure out how we recycle that capital into a more fulsome relationship with a customer. So, just because we don't have the loan growth doesn't mean we can't continue to grow NII if we execute that program appropriately. So that's kind of how we think about NII going forward.","Ken Usdin","Yeah, and Dave. Go ahead Grayson I am sorry.","Grayson Hall","I would just reiterate, we continue to see solid loan growth opportunities on the consumer side of our balance sheet and we expect that to continue, we don\u2019t see a reason at this point in time to not believe that continues and the health of that consumer customers continue to be remarkably strong.","Now on the wholesale side, our focus continues to be in the lower end of that commercial middle markets space and we're trying to be much more regress, much more thoughtful and certainly more disciplined at this point in the credit cycle to make sure that what we're putting on our balance sheet make sense, that it has a reasonable return and a full relationship as David said.","Ken Usdin","And my just one follow-up on that David, so you're getting to 3% year-over-year NII growth, It\u2019s almost basked in the cake even if you don't grow it sequentially from here, but are you confident though that you still can envision an x-rates growth in NII from the second quarter point?","David Turner","Again we've landed on 3% for the full year and we're working hard to take where we're right now to continue to grow. It's obviously very challenging given the rate environment, what\u2019s rolling off versus what's going on flattening of the yield curve. So we have some reinvestment risks with regards to the securities portfolio, but we think if we will execute, we can continue to have some modest growth in NII and again we believe strongly in the 3% growth for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Eads of UBS.","David Eads","Maybe just following up on the last point about the reinvestment risks in AFS [ph] portfolio with the tenure where it is, is there any change to your -- how come you're basically just looking to replay maturities and pay downs at current prices or anything you would look to change on that perspective?","David Turner","We don't have any major change anticipated. We haven't extended integration [ph] in little over three year right now. It's been that way for a while. We don't look to make that change. We have a risk profile in the securities book like we want it to be, so we haven't look for a lot of wholesale changes from basically the mortgage backs that we have there today. So as you're pointing currently the risks versus that reinvestment yield going as tenure continues to have pressure on us, we will put pressure on our return on the securities book, but we don't believe the risk of trying to change that dramatically is worth it to us right now. So you've kind of answered I think your own question.","David Eads","Right, that makes perfect sense and maybe on a related point, it's a good quarter from mortgage revenues and you guys have made a point that it was mostly purchase related, do you have expectations for how that business is going to shape out over the next couple of quarters and whether it gets a little bit more refi heavy and whether I guess revenues can kind of stay in your -- stay high, nearly seasonally high levels for a couple of quarters?","Grayson Hall","I think that we were pleased with the performance of our mortgage claim this quarter, again the mix of business that we placed on the books this quarter about 75% repurchased in about 25% refinanced -- purchased and refinanced. We do expect to have a good third quarter based off what we're seeing today. We have seen a shift in the application volume. I would tell you that instead of being about 75-25 it appears to be shifting more 60-40 in terms of purchase versus refinance, so we should see that shift in this quarter, but think we'll have a good quarter. Traditionally if you look at our numbers, second and third quarter are always our strongest mortgage origination quarters. So absent any change that we don't see today we think we outta have good progress going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill.","Stephen Scouten","I had a question for you on the previously announced relationship with Avant and where that's at and if there is any changes given kind of their volume cuts and their business or what that's going to look like for you guys moving forward. ","David Turner","Yes, so you know Avant is still in the early stages, we'll launch that in August. So it's premature for us to comment, we think it can be accretive to us over time, but the way we're treating some of these investments that we're making is, we're not taking a lot of risk, we're trying some things, we're seeing what we can learn, we're seeing how we can better serve our existing customer base with these opportunities so we think it'll work for us, but you know again too early to tell, we'll update you as we go through the third quarter and into the fourth.","Grayson Hall","I mean we've been getting a good feedback from our customers on our own line experience and you know we mentioned earlier in the call we've gotten some recent recognition in that regard and ironically we're in the process even as we speak refreshing our own line and mobile experiences for our customers. We're launching that as we speak and then Avant will be in August as David said. We think it's just one more way of trying to provide a better experience for our customers in both the online and mobile channels, but it'll be incremental to what we're doing. Good consumer numbers, I think we were extremely pleased overall with consumer numbers this quarter across all channels, one of the better quarters we've had.","Stephen Scouten","Sounds good, and I guess maybe as a follow up do you have any trepidation on either you know from the standpoint of giving away customer data or losing customer contact in a relationship such as this and also just you mentioned the growth in consumer as a whole, any trepidation there in terms of increasing that exposure and what ultimate losses could be on the consumer side even as I know credit metrics on the consumer side have been good here as of late.","Grayson Hall","I mean well, first of all foundation of our business is built off customer trust, without customer trust our business model doesn't work and so we are very sensitive to anything we do that involves customer data and the privacy of that data, the confidentiality protection of that data. So we have very extensive risk management reviews, our due diligence process is very rigorous and will continue to be. That being said cyber security is an area that we're all challenged with today, but spending an awful lot of resource and time on it, but there's nothing more important to us than the trust of our customers, with their information and their assets.","Operator","Your next question will come from Michael Rose of Raymond James.","Michael Rose","David just one for you, just going back to energy right at this scenario if oil was $35 to $45, but what if we\u2019re tracking above that into the back half of the year, what would that imply for total losses and maybe any updated commentary into '17?","David Turner","So, we have as you now see reserves of about 9.4%, those reserves are established based in large part due to the risk ratings we assign, they come from our work and our credit team\u2019s work and also evaluated by our regulatory supervisors. In terms of what ultimate losses are? We'll have to see if we continue to get stabilization in higher oil price than that reduces are pressure and risk of ultimate charge offs, but I would say that given the volatility that we see in the prices it'd be premature to see how those reserves would come back into income in the short term. I think we need to let that play out over a little longer period of time.","Barbara Godin","This is Barbara, I will say Michael that with oil even at $50 or higher a barrel, that certainly helps the E&P companies first, but the oil field services company they can't delay, so again the reason for us putting out the 50 to 75 between now against next year.","Michael Rose","And maybe just a quick follow-up, the reason that's charged off this quarter, obviously I understand the volatility with oil and the lack of service companies, but is the way to think about that is the provision should match pretty closely to charge offs moving forward?","David Turner","We have a process that we go through, [indiscernible] anything unusual that's a pretty good yes, that being said as credit continues to improve across the board and risk ratings change then you don't have to provide for those losses and that would be the indicator of where the provision could be less in charge offs. We need to let our model run and trying to forecast that out is probably not the best thing for us to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","You had two of your peers give guidance on dollar expenses beyond '16, in fact going out all way out to 2018, in a bid to tell investors that they can support efficiency gains without rates and I'm wondering if we think about 2017, you're guiding that we should enter the year with a base -- a natural expense base of let's say 3.45 billion and I'm wondering if how you're thinking about some of the cost savings that you've already identified to go into that 2017 number and whether they can overwhelm some of the investments, in other words is there room to cut that 3.45 billion number to support efficiency if we don't get the help from the rate environment?","David Turner","So Erika it\u2019s a good question, I tried to address a little bit of that in the prepared comments. When we -- so we have the $300 million expense elimination program, we're on track with that, we're really are challenging ourselves, if you think of a couple of a things, one, how do we -- some of those savings actually through our model started 2018 and so the question is what can we do that\u2019s prudent, makes sense to move into 2017? That'll take some work, we'll come back as we get later in the year and start giving you a little better guidance of the '17, we'll give you an update on that.","The second would be, there's a -- we have a lot of rationale that went around the $300 million, it was roughly 9% of our expense base. But we're going to go back and challenge ourselves to think through how we might change that over time. Again we need to be very thoughtful, we need to make sure we don't benefit the short term at the expense of the long term. The franchise building that we are trying to do. We want sustainable franchise value, we don't want just short term.","So its get trickier as we start thinking in these terms, but we believe rates, you have to have the mindset that rates are going to be lower for longer and this is something we can't control. So, we have more work to do here and we\u2019re look forward to the challenge.","Grayson Hall","We have been in this environment for a good long while and we've learned how to manage through it. We've had to really defend our margin, defend the credit culture that we're trying to build in terms of how we grow and build our loan portfolio and managing expenses in this lower for longer environment has just got to be a skill set that we continue to exercise and deploy.","We've been very aggressive on branch consolidations, we think we know how to do that and do it well. But, I think that as David said is that in a lower than longer forecast and we have to go back and just continue to re-challenge ourselves and redefine how we manage through this for a longer period of time.","Erika Najarian","Thank you. And I just have a follow up question to Barb. You mentioned something about how energy prices impacts different parts of your energy portfolio from a different timing perspective. And the question really here is investors are starting to wonder, what type of oil price level do we need to see to see that 9.4 reserve ratio start getting released or going down, appreciating that this reserve is built on a loan by loan basis. But is there any external factor that we can look to say, okay, that's now done and we can now expect to release some of those reserves into the rest of the book?","Barbara Godin","Yes Erika, I think you hit the nail on the head relative to the reserve, it\u2019s made up of different groupings. Of course E&P as I said will benefit from higher oil prices where we see them in the $60 to $70 a barrel range that's great for the E&P Company, but again even at that level oil field services companies will continue to be challenged, it takes them longer to restructure and get back on their feet. So again, the extended tail on the oil field services and as we think of our provisions roughly two-thirds of our provision right now is established against the oil field services sub sector in our book.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Regarding the loan growth, on the commercial side I know you indicated some of the weakening of the pipeline but also some of the intentional pull back in the single relationship credit. How would you split that up in terms of the impact on second quarter and the period loan growth from the commercial side? How much of that weaker than expected or how much of that weakness should we say came from the intentional pull back versus the softening demand?","Grayson Hall","That\u2019s a great question, it\u2019s one we've spent some time ourselves internally sort of discussing and debating and clearly part of the weakness we're seeing is just general market demand for credit and if you look at top of company and domestic U.S. numbers the level of fixed capital spending by wholesale customers continues to be below historical proportions and we're seeing net end demand for credit, but at the same time you also hear us talking about making sure that we got full relationships and we are getting paid a reasonable return for providing banking services to our clients. So we need a full relationship to do that.","The return on the credit only relationship is just not sufficient, but we also have been very disciplined in making sure that we have diversity in our balance sheet and so there are certain asset categories that our risk appetite is full filled on and so we've been more judicious about not adding more of that product type to our balance sheet and we're absolutely committed to staying diversified.","I think if you look at it today, we would say it's about half and half, about half of it\u2019s the market and about half of it is disciplined that we're invoking. I'd also remind you that when you look at our loan growth for this quarter, keep in mind the reduction in energy loans that we've achieved over the past quarter then it's been a -- there is a story there that without that reduction in energy growth in our wholesale book would have been much stronger.","John Pancari","Okay that\u2019s helpful and then real quick Barb on credit, did you say that both the criticized balance increases as well as the NPA increase were attributable to the other areas that you sited agricultural metals and transportation?","Barbara Godin","No, NPA was primarily an energy story, [indiscernible] the other groups that I talked about.","John Pancari","Okay got it and then lastly in terms of the margin impact of putting on less of the more thinly price relationships that are single relationships type of credits that you're deemphasizing, just trying to put a number around it or in terms of yield, what yields are some of those loans running off that you're deemphasizing as a single relationship and then how's that compared to new production yield on what you are putting on your book?","David Turner","Well it really just depends John in terms different products. On the C&I space, we haven't seen spreads changed dramatically there, but if you are 225 over you're working against yourself that portfolio yielding yields today about 3.5%, and so as we think about how to combat some of this, wanted to get deeper relationship, we're not often having to look just at spread because the spread is only a component part of the income we get from the customer basis. The other is NII sources that helped rounded out. So it's in fact we had a lower spread asset we look for relationship, we can do with that, it's having a low spread without the relationship that\u2019s the problem.","So I think that also how to combat this would be the consumer growth, we grew consumer loans about $300 million, we've had nice production in consumer where we're getting paid for that risk and that's helping to combat the downward pressure on loan yields. So our loan yields from the first quarter we\u2019re only down 2 basis points, that\u2019s the mixed shift and remixing of business that we're trying to make in our total balance sheet to be more profitable to get better return to our shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR and Company.","Paul Miller","Thank you very much, most of my questions are answered, but I do have one on non-interest income. You gave a I think range of 5% growth there and over the last year most of your growth has come from either card and ATM fees, or capital markets. Is that what we should be modeling in, is that what most of the growth's going to come from or is there some categories that you've been investing and you should start seeing some growth there.","David Turner","If you look at that we've made lots of investments in capital markets you see in the growth there, but also in terms of service charges and credit card, ATM card kind of growth, all that's really coming from poor consumer household growth [ph]. We're seeing better consumer growth across the communities we serve, more broadly than we've seen in the past. We really are pleased with the progress we've made in the customer experience in our consumer business and the results really are starting to come through and we think that that continues to be a good story.","Additionally, we've made several investments in our wealth management offerings, you know wealth management had a good quarter this quarter, we think that continues and has the prospect of even improving. So you know overall very good story this quarter.","Paul Miller","And you're saying, where do you see most of the growth. I know you've invested in Florida pretty heavily over the years, is it coming across your geographic footprint or is it coming in certain states?","David Turner","It's more broad than it\u2019s been in the past and you know you're correct and historically we had a very strong growth out in the state of Florida, that -- Florida continues to be a very critical market for our franchise, but growth is much more broad than it's ever been historically in the company that's been purposeful on our part, we very much try to make sure that we're not only diversifying our business by product but we're diversifying it by geography and we've made very conscious investments to improve the production of our consumer and our wealth management business as well as wholesale across all the communities that we serve.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Conner at Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Conner","Any update on the CRA downgrade from earlier this year in terms of what you're doing to remediate that and if there's any impact that's having on kind of day-to-day operations [indiscernible]?","David Turner","Yes, Matt it's David, so you know we have to go back to kind of the exam that we had the results our core CRA program continues to be robust, we have a lot of assessment areas specially relative to anybody else in the country and we do a good job, our team is really committed to the customers and communities that we serve and we feel like we're doing a pretty good job there. We did have an issue that was outstanding from another regulatory fee was considered and so we're going through, we had to go through another exam cycle for that to get cleared up, the timing of which is completely dependent on our regulatory supervisors and we believe we've done everything we need to continue to work through this and we hope that the conclusion is favorable when that is concluded upon by our regulatory supervisors.","Matt O'Conner","And then just separately if you look at the indirect consumer bucket I think which includes the POS loans the $600 million to $700 million of loans, you've had good growth there, it seems like there's kind of the typical beginning of the seasoning of that portfolio from a credit quality perspective, obviously very small numbers, but do you have a sense of what losses in that book may get to? It's a good yielding book and you've been growing it a lot.","Grayson Hall","I mean that, we look at the indirect portfolio we\u2019ve been growing it quite steadily, starting off from a relatively small base, we've been very selective on where we participate in that market, we've been very selective in the auto space and we've been very selective in a number of point of sales spaces that we participate in and we continue as to test the production that's going on the book and we do believe that expected losses in this portfolio we're targeting them to be less than 2.5%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja of J.P. Morgan. ","Vivek Juneja","Couple of questions please, MBS premium amortization, can you just give us some nitpicky ones? What was the amount in the second quarter, when do you expect it to go in the third quarter?","David Turner","So, Vivek this is -- we've had in kind of the mid 30s in terms of premium amortization, we do expect that to increase modestly over the second half of the year, maybe up $5 million to $7 million each of the quarters, third and fourth quarter, just dependent on prepayments that come in, we see the refinance activities that\u2019s occurring through pipelines and at volume for us so we can project that out a little bit in terms of prepayment fees and expect it will tick up just a bit. Now that being said that is embedded in our forecast of our NII growth which we say would be somewhere in the right at the 3% range for the year.","Vivek Juneja","So, it didn't go up, David in the second quarter, you're waiting for prepayments to show the path before you increase in the third quarter?","David Turner","Yes, correct.","Vivek Juneja","And capital, a bigger picture question, how do you get it down, for both of you? You've got such a high level, you\u2019re close to 100% payout, what do you do to bring this down? Obviously long term it\u2019s not -- you're not growing that any faster based on all the other factors that you're taking into account.","David Turner","So, we've -- like over time we've mentioned to get to our capital targets and bring those down over time, if you look at the CCAR continuing to address a couple of things there, one, the stress is in each of the portfolios, we have some learning's that we can take from that as we reshape certain of our businesses to take out risk which then reduces the amount of capital you need to have in particular in a stressed environment.","We did not have -- go over a 100% of earnings, we did have a couple of regional players that did for the first time. For us, we want to make sure we optimize our capital structure in terms of the nature of the components, so preferred stock and common stock alike and make sure that that's optimized and overtime we will do that to reduce our cost of equity. But I think working on the stresses is apparent [ph] in the balance sheet which we've done and you've seen that come down in places like commercial real estate losses came down quite dramatically. But still high. And so how do we change our business model overtime to reduce the amount of capital we have to have so that we can either put it to work if there is opportunity to grow loans and when there is not returning that capital to our shareholders especially when you've traded it, when we traded at tangible book value.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Can I question your loan to deposit ratio upticked a little bit this quarter to 84%. What's the optimal level for that loan-to-deposit ratio for you folks and how do you plan to reach that level?","David Turner","Yeah, Gerard it's a good question. So, we've been one of the lower loan deposit ratios. I think getting up a few more points perhaps in the upper 80s, lower 90s is the right place for us to be. In the good old days it would be over a 100% when you could rely on wholesale funding and that you could take money out every night, that really -- that market doesn't operate that way.","So, I would say upper 80s lower 90s. I do think the construct and the deposits we have given the LCR framework deposits, certain deposits are as useful to us and in particular as we think about liquidity. Those process that are collateralized provide little liquidity value to us and that value really stems from the diversification of funding more so than actual liquidity because we\u2019re having a most [ph] of our best security for it.","So, I think you will see that drift up a bit overtime, the pace of which is hard to tell.","Grayson Hall","And Gerard if you look at our deposits this quarter, core deposits is really a very good story. We've created a much more favorable mix of deposits and we've reduced some of our deposits to David's point they are less attractive under LCR, but also less attractive at the end of the day from a liquidity perspective and so while our deposits were down modestly at the top of the company this quarter actually core deposits, core deposits that we find attractive were actually up and the liquidity in the company actually improved.","And so we continue to believe that the core value this franchise really is a deposit gatherer and we continue to have a very good story there and a good message back and so I think that to David's point there was a time when you could fund loans in a very different way, but today best way to fund loans is with core deposits and we think in that high 80s low 90s would optimize the earnings power of this company. But we're going to need good solid organic loan growth to make that occur.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. And regarding the consolidation of the branches, have you guys done any work to measure when you consolidate or shut down a branch? What percentage of the customers stay with you? Yeah, go ahead I was going to follow up, but go ahead David.","David Turner","Go ahead and finish.","Gerard Cassidy","Yeah, okay. And then with the advent of the mobile technology you all have today versus 15 years ago when if you shut down some branches the numbers may have different, have you've noticed, is there a differential meaning you're keeping more than today because of the mobile technology?","David Turner","I think, one, is since I guess since 2007-2008 we've closed the consolidated over 500 branch offices. We have a very good process for that. I think that from our perspective, we continue to see that how do the process for consolidating those offices really have to do a lot with customer communication and how you equip and train and staff the receding offices. And to the extent, if the receding offices is at relatively close proximity and we would say that close proximities within 10 miles of the other branch that you're seeing very-very good success with virtually no losses in customers in that regard.","We do think that alternative channels ATM, call center, mobile, online all of those other channels provide us an opportunity to provide strong connectivity to the customer and while we're seeing branches losing traffic in the sort of 3% to 5% a year range, we're seeing tremendous growth in the online and mobile channels. So we think continuing to add functionality there enhances the customer experience, it enhances the retention of those customers. But I would say all of it has to be done, you have to do all those things well in order to have a successful consolidation. But great question is one that we continue to adjust and fine-tune on a regular basis.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners.","Christopher Marinac","I wanted to ask about Slide 14 which has gone into the loans split in Texas and Louisiana, I guess I am curious with energy prices trying to stabilize, does that pertain that you would want to see those markets to be stabilized in terms of loan balances or could we actually see growth on those areas?","David Turner","I think if you look at Texas and Louisiana on those slides, very important markets for us and a much more diversified market than you would have seen a few years ago and even though we're seeing obvious stress from our customers that are directly or indirectly tied to the energy business. We're seeing an off a lot of strength in other industries, we're seeing an off a lot of opportunities that still provide banking services in those markets and so we're still very confident about our ability to grow there.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session at today's conference. I'll now turn the floor back over to Mr. Hall for closing remark.","Grayson Hall","Thank you very much for your attendance and participation today, really appreciate your questions and your interest and thank you, we strand adjourned [ph].","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Paula and I'll be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen only. At the end of the call there will be a question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.","M. List Underwood - Director of Investor Relations","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation in our call today. Our presenters are Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer; David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of management are present and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also, as part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","Finally, let me remind you that in this call, and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking disclaimer that is located in the appendix section of the presentation. With that I'll turn it over to Grayson.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, List, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased you could join us for our call today. For the third quarter we reported earnings from continuing operations of $246 million or $0.19 per diluted share. These results reflect total adjusted revenue growth, despite an operating environment that remains challenging. In the third quarter we continued to deliver growth in categories that we believe are fundamental to future income growth. Our fundamentals are strong with growth in households, accounts, loans and deposits. In fact, one of the most important categories is checking accounts, which we've grown by more than 2% year-to-date. We remain focused on expanding and deepening relationships through our need-based approach to relationship banking.","Total net interest income increased 2% from the second quarter, representing the highest quarterly increase in approximately two years. For the same period, total loans increased 1% on an ending basis and were up 2% on average basis, contributing to the increase in net interest income.","Business lending had a good quarter, driven by real estate and corporate banking groups. Within real estate, REIT business growth was strong. The growth within corporate banking reflects the strength of our business model as local bankers collaborate with industry and product specialists to grow loans. In the third quarter all specialized industries experienced growth led by power, utilities, technology and defense, restaurant and healthcare. Consumer lending had another strong quarter reaching $30 billion in total outstandings on an ending basis with growth in every loan category. Our new point of sale initiative led this growth as consumers took advantage of the convenience of this product offering. Additionally, indirect vehicle lending continues to be strong supported by robust auto sales during the summer.","Total noninterest revenue in the third quarter declined compared to a strong second quarter. The majority of the decline was attributable to a lower benefit from mortgage servicing rights and related hedges. Despite this decline, we have continued to experience good momentum in several areas, including capital markets and wealth management as our prior investments continue to produce results.","Wealth management income was strong this quarter, up 13% over prior year. We remain focused on our strategy to grow wealth management by continuing to recruit, retain and develop talent required to meet the diverse needs of our clients. We will continue to look for insurance acquisitions and lift-outs, similar to our recent addition in Georgia. Clearly this operating environment continues to be challenging as we have continued to face lower interest rates for an extended period of time. Furthermore, we expect the pace of increases in interest rates to be slow and measured.","Given this backdrop, it's essential that we take more aggressive action as it relates to expense management. We've instituted a number of initiatives and are carefully evaluating a number of other actions that we will provide more details at our Investor Day on November 19.","Credit quality was relatively stable during the quarter, with some weakening in the energy portfolio. As expected there's been some downward migration risk ratings inside this portfolio. These shifts could continue if oil prices remain at current levels. Overall, we believe our energy customers are taking appropriate actions by reducing costs and making other infrastructure adjustments to create liquidity, preserve our capital, and reduce debt to mitigate vulnerabilities to this environment. As a result, we expect any future losses related to this portfolio to be manageable. We have remained focused on our strategic initiatives for 2015 and have made progress diversifying, growing total revenue by continuing to effectively deploy capital. We remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time and in the near term will rigorously seek operating efficiencies.","With that, I'll now turn it over to David, who'll cover the details for the third quarter. David.","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the third quarter details and then wrap up with our expectations for the remainder of 2015. Loan balances totaled $81 billion at the end of the third quarter, up $914 million or 1% from the previous quarter. Year-to-date, loans have increased $3.8 billion or 5%. Business services achieved solid growth with balances totaling $51 billion at quarter end, an increase of 1%. Commercial and industrial loans grew $559 million or 2% and commitments also increased 2%. As previously mentioned, real estate corporate banking and all specialized lending areas experienced growth in the third quarter.","Consumer lending had another strong quarter. Loans in this portfolio totaled $30 billion, an increase of 2% over the prior quarter. Indirect vehicle lending increased 3% while production increased 8%. And other indirect lending, which focuses primarily on home improvement retailers, increased $107 million linked quarter or 28%. Year-to-date, loans in this new portfolio have increased $284 million and we plan to continue to grow this business into 2016.","Mortgage loan balances increased $141 million, while production declined compared to a seasonally strong second quarter, total production remained healthy at $1.4 billion, an increase of 11% over the prior year. Looking at the credit card portfolio, balances increased 2% from the previous quarter and our penetration rate into our existing customer base now stands at 17%, up almost 200 basis points from the third quarter of last year. And finally, total home equity balances increased $48 million from the previous quarter as new production outpaced portfolio runoff in the third quarter.","Let's take a look at deposits. Supported by our multi-channel platform, average deposit balances increased $66 million and totaled $97 billion at quarter end. Consumer and wealth deposits represented 75% of total deposits. Of note, our average account balance is smaller and is expected to be less volatile in a rising rate environment. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels at 11 basis points, while total funding costs remained at 25 basis points. Now let's see how this impacted our results.","Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $855 million, an increase of $16 million or 2% from the previous quarter. Higher loan balances and balance sheet hedging strategies were the primary drivers behind the linked quarter increase. In an effort to mitigate impacts from a continued low rate environment, we executed hedges involving interest rate derivatives. These strategies benefited net interest income while only modestly reducing asset sensitivity. The net interest margin was primarily affected by pressure on asset yields and higher cash balances, resulting in a 3 basis point margin decline to 3.13%.","Total noninterest income declined after a particularly strong second quarter, driven in part by lower mortgage revenue due to lower benefits from mortgage servicing rights and the related hedges. However, our investments in and commitment to diversifying and growing fee-based revenues yielded positive results in several areas.","Total wealth management income increased 5% linked quarter, driven by insurance income and investment services fee income. Insurance income increased 15%, driven in part by the acquisition that Grayson previously mentioned. And investment services fee income grew 15% as our financial consultants continue to expand and deepen relationships, primarily through our Regions360 approach to needs-based selling.","Capital markets income increased $2 million over the previous quarter, primarily related to a pickup in loan syndication income. This reflects our continued investment in people and products in order to grow and diversify revenue. Card and ATM fees increased 3% as a result of increased credit card usage as well as an increase in active credit cards.","Let's move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the third quarter were $895 million, an increase of $35 million on an adjusted basis. This included an increase of $31 million in deposit administrative fees. In the third quarter we incurred an expense of $23 million related to prior assessments. Also impacting the linked quarter variance were refunds that we received in the second quarter of $6 million from overpayments. We expect the future quarterly run rate for this expense item to be in the $22 million to $25 million range.","Salaries and benefits were down 1% linked quarter. Additional head count related primarily to strategic investments drove an increase in base salaries; however, this was offset by reductions in performance-based incentives.","Expenses related to occupancy increased linked quarter due to seasonal increases in utilities. And additionally, furniture and fixtures increased from the previous quarter due to investments in technology and back-office infrastructure which will improve efficiency over the long-term. This expense item is expected to increase modestly over the next few quarters, reflecting these investments. Outside services declined $2 million from the prior quarter, partially related to lower risk management and compliance cost.","Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 66.8% in the quarter; however, excluding the additional expenses related to deposit administrative fees, the resulting ratio was 65%. As Grayson previously noted, in this operating environment, we must do even more to improve our efficiencies and lower operating cost. To that end, we have recently instituted hiring restrictions and continue to rigorously review all discretionary expenditures. Additionally, we have allocated expense challenges and goals by business unit and we will provide more details on these additional steps when we meet with you for Investor Day next month.","Let's move on to asset quality. Total net charge-offs increased and represented 30 basis points of average loans. Importantly, this increase does not reflect the broad deterioration in credit quality. Total business services criticized and classified loans increased $304 million, or 10% from the prior quarter. And nonaccrual loans increased 5%. These increases were driven by some weakening in a small number of larger loans, primarily within the energy portfolio.","As it relates to the energy portfolio, we remain in close contact with our energy customers. Rigorous credit servicing activities are ongoing and we have instituted heightened requirements for loan renewals. As previously stated, we anticipate additional migration into non-pass categories but expect any losses in this portfolio to be manageable. Based on what we know today, over the next 12 months to 18 months losses could range in the $30 million to $50 million range; however, we have adequate reserves to cover these losses.","The provision for loan losses was $60 million, matching net charge-offs, and our allowance for loan losses was relatively stable at 1.38% at the end of the third quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, troubled debt restructured loans, or TDRs, declined 7%. And at quarter end, our loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans, or coverage ratio, was 141%. And given where we are in the credit cycle, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits in our portfolio and fluctuating commodity prices.","Let's move on to capital and liquidity. During the quarter, we repurchased $270 million, or 26.6 million shares of common stock, and declared dividends of $79 million. Under the Basel III provisions, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.7% and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11%. On a fully phased-in basis, common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums. Our loan and deposit ratio at the end of the quarter was 83% and regarding the liquidity coverage ratio Regions remains well-positioned to be fully compliant with the January 2016 implementation deadline.","Now, let me have a brief review of current expectations for the remainder of 2015. We expect total loan growth to be in the 4% to 6% range on a point-to-point basis and probably end up at the higher end of that range. Regarding deposits, we continue to expect full-year average deposit growth in the 1% to 2% range. With respect to the margin, we expect performance through year end to be marginally better than the full year guidance communicated in early 2015, which call for a decline of 10 basis points to 12 basis points, if rates remain persistently low. However, even if rates remain low, net interest income is expected to grow moderately.","Finally, we expect to continue to benefit from revenue initiatives and we will take steps to prudently manage our expenses. We remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time.","With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning and I'll turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","M. List Underwood - Director of Investor Relations","Thank you, David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session of our call. In order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning, I would like to ask each caller to please limit yourself to one primary question and one related follow-up question. I appreciate your cooperation. Now let's open up the line for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question, here. First, one of the things about the energy portfolio and the reserves. I know you guys don't tend to disclose, maybe specific reserves related to the energy portfolio, but did you take any incremental provision related to that $30 million to $50 million in potential losses that you could see? Or was that, as you said, just kind of matching the net charge-offs you had in the quarter?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Stephen, thank you, that's a good question. And I'll ask Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer to make a few comments in that regard. And then John Turner, Head of Corporate Banking, to follow that up. Barb?","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer","Thanks very much, Grayson. Yes, we actually did take some incremental reserves this quarter on the energy portfolio. And we currently stand at around 4.7% of that portfolio being reserved. So, we are well reserved given where we feel the losses will be in the next 12 months to 18 months.","John M. Turner, Jr. - Senior Executive Vice President, Head-Corporate Banking Group","And I would just add we provided some additional detail, particularly on the Oil Field Services sector, in our release. I think what you'll see is that we have, as we said before, a smaller number of customers that comprise our portfolio. We believe that we've been very prudent in the selection of those clients, stay very close to them. We think they're doing all the right things to react to the crisis that they have faced, the declining oil prices. And so we remain cautiously optimistic about the performance of our book.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay, thanks, I appreciate that. And, yeah, definitely I appreciate the additional color there in the slide deck. And then, just as a follow-up as it relates to capital deployment. Obviously the share buyback was a little bit; it seemed accelerated, in the quarter. I'm assuming just taking advantage of the lower share prices. Is that something that you guys can continue to do in this current quarter as the share remains maybe lower than it should be, in my view? And how much flexibility do you have there?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","This is David. So we have, obviously, a capital plan that was not objected to by regulatory supervisors for which we are executing against. We were able to move up a small portion of that into a different quarter, but in order to have any meaningful change in our total buyback we would have to go through a submission to our regulatory supervisors for future \u2013 any increases in the buyback over our CCAR request.","Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. So the $875 million will remain the same but you could pull that forward kind of like we saw here in the current quarter?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","That's what \u2013 we did pull a piece of that forward this past quarter, but we can't change the $875 million.","Stephen Kendall Scouten - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Perfect. Thank you guys so much. I appreciate the color.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Ken, good morning.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, Grayson. Hey, just a quick question just on the outlook for net interest income. David, your comments about less bad than the prior guidance earlier in the year was kind of lost in sequential so just wondering can you help us understand; do we still see kind of the core compression of the NIM from here on an ex-rates basis? And what other drivers do you have to help support that further?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think so we will still have a couple basis points of compression expected for the quarter. We really are speaking more to NII. We believe that can continue to grow, though. But obviously you're continuing to see the impact, partially higher cash balances for us, our driver, and then this low rate environment grinding down, but will put in a couple of basis point pressure from here to the end of the year.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC","And underneath that it looked like the loan yields have started to flatten out. Was that just finally getting past the natural rollover or was there any incremental help from swaps or hedging activity that helped as well?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","It's a little bit of both. So you're seeing low rates work through to some degree, but you have to have help from some of the derivatives that we put on as well.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Marty.","Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Morning. David, I had two questions for you. One is, looking at the investment process that you've been in, that kind of forced your expenses to grow faster than your revenues over the last year. Do you anticipate that you're kind of getting to the inflection point where the return on investments begin to flip that around and you can start to create that operating leverage that you're talking to in your outlook?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","That's a great question, Marty. So I would tell you we've made investments in a lot of areas to execute our strategy which is to diversify our revenue stream into some NIR sources. In some cases we have further investments to make and in others we're just about finished. So an example of that would be our financial consultants that we have and wealth management. We had a goal to hire about 225 of those through September 30.","We have about 219, so we've got a handful more to go in the fourth quarter and we'll be done. And so what you'll start seeing is the payoff of these investments will start becoming even stronger relative to the investments or the expense that we had earlier. And so it just depends on which investment we're talking about. Our goal is to grow our income, diversify our revenue stream and to have better returns on capital over time, which is why we've needed to make those investments early on. And they're starting to pay off for us. They are performing exactly like we expected. As a matter of fact, in some cases they're actually ahead of schedule. So you've seen expense go up and we've talked about making the investments. We still believe it's been the right thing for us to do and you'll see the benefit as we get into 2016 and beyond.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But Marty, to add to that, we obviously have made what we think are very prudent investments and the results we've seen from those investments have been very positive and we continue to see opportunities for that. That being said, given the current rate environment and our rate forecast for what we believe the next few quarters hold, we've had become much more rigorous on expense management. We are trying to self-fund a lot of our investments to make sure that as David said, over time we can generate positive operating leverage as a company.","So you will see us be more rigorous around expense management over the next few quarters. We just think given the rate environment that it's prudent to do that. That being said, we really are trying to create long-term franchise value while being sensitive to quarter-to-quarter earnings pressure. But we need to make sure that we're thoughtful about how we manage expenses and to make sure that we continue to build franchise value over time.","Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks. And then, David, this won't be a surprise, so my next question, but you started to step out with hedging and neutralizing some of your asset sensitivity position. You kind of said net it really didn't affect your pickup when rates go up. Is that enough? You're still letting cash balances build. Shouldn't you start thinking about neutralizing that balance sheet over, let's say, the next 12 months, at least, more aggressively? And I know you're smiling there listening me to ask that same question I've asked several times before, but just wanted to ask you that again.","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","So Marty, we continue to challenge ourselves on the positioning of the balance sheet. We have been asset-sensitive for an extended period of time. We believe staying asset-sensitive is the right thing for us as we seek to extract the value out of our competitive advantage, which is our deposit base, our granular, sticky, consumer-oriented deposit base. And to neutralize rate sensitivity in this environment, we think, is the wrong thing to do.","We did put on some hedges to protect ourselves, primarily, on a prolonged low rate or declining rate environment, but we didn't want to take too much sensitivity off. So we're still up instantaneous 100 basis points, we're still at about $155 million of NII impact, down from about $165 million. So, it was a slight change down. But we believe maintaining that sensitivity is the right thing for Regions, given the construct of our deposit franchise and that side of the balance sheet.","Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Betsy.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Couple of questions. One, Barb, I just wanted to make sure \u2013 you indicated that, regarding the energy, you feel like you've done the reserving you need to do here today. And could you just give us a sense of, that's at current oil price or the forwards on oil and the kind of timeframe that your price outlook persists?","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer","Yeah. When we go through our process, including sizing up what we think the losses might be, et cetera, we go through looking at a number of models, but we also do an account-by-account bottoms-up review. We do that on a monthly basis, staying close to our customers, close to their balance sheets, et cetera. And when we look at the price of oil, we look at the spot price; we also look at the futures price as well. So all of that is incorporated into our thought process as to how we determine what the appropriate level of allowance was.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And what kind of discount do you give to spot and futures?","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer","Well, again, we go through the standard. We start off with the number of barrels of oil that our engineers feel are in the basins, we apply our price deck to it \u2013 our current price deck base is $46, stressed $36.80, we discount that by the PD9. So discount it by 9%. Then we risk adjust all of that, again, one more time. We do that at approximately a 10% level, and then we do a borrowing base, the borrowing base is about 65% of all of that. So, long story short, is you'll end up with 53% of what's in the ground is what we'll lend against.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And do you think that there's going to be much in the way of a reduction in supply here, based on all of that and what you and others are doing with regard to these redeterminations or do you think supply kind of kicks along as is?","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer","Well, I know with the borrowing base redeterminations we believe that we'll probably reduce another 15% to 20%, which is roughly what we did in the prior quarter as well. And we do see a lot of supply that's still out there.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just separately on the outlook for operating leverage, what I'm hearing is with the hiring restrictions and we'll see the benefits of the hiring that you've done over the last 12 months to 18 months come through, that we should look for operating leverage to improve as we go through the next two, three, four quarters. Is that a fair assessment?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","That's right. We wanted to continue, as Grayson mentioned, to make investments to grow revenue and we're going to self-fund those. So we're going to look at all areas of our company to control our expenses with the goal of generating positive operating leverage. It just takes time to work through. I think the question came earlier in terms of the investments; it takes time to generate the revenue that pays for the investment we made. But we are on track and we think you'll see that improvement coming through in 2016.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then in the past you've talked a little bit about the insurance growth from lift-outs. I know it's a modest effort relative to the size of the overall company, but would that continue in this outlook for slowing down hiring or putting a freeze on hiring?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","No...","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead, David.","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","We've continued to expect to make investments, as we mentioned. So, those are not included into the hiring numbers we've talked about, the freeze, as you mentioned, the restrictions. So you should see us continuing to look for opportunities to grow that insurance business.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. I know it's threading the needle between the words, just wanted to make sure where it starts and stops with regard to insurance, so I appreciate that. Thanks.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As I said earlier, we recognize in this environment that the most prudent thing for us to do is to be much more rigorous, much more disciplined in managing expenses. That being said, we have to do that in a thoughtful way that doesn't degrade franchise value, that actually affords us the opportunity to continue to increase franchise value. And where there are opportunities, such as the insurance lift-outs, that provide us a situation that we believe that gives us economic benefit in a relatively short period of time, we're still going to seize those opportunities.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Eads of UBS.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, David.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Maybe following up on energy just quickly \u2013 great color you've given so far. Just curious, particularly on the Oil Field Services side, if you can give any color on how you guys think about loss frequency and severity in that book.","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer","Yeah, this is Barb Godin again. You know, Oil Field Services in total is about $1.2 billion. 24% of that book is close to the well head. But what you need to know about that book is 66 customers make up 98% of that book. So we're very close to them.","As I look at that overall book, what the largest piece of that book is is marine and we have just under $500 million, $494 million in marine, but 23 obligors. So, again, not very granular. But 70% of what we do in marine is deep water marine. So only 30% is on the Gulf of Mexico shelf. So, again, looking at that book we feel pretty good about the marine piece of that book. Quite frankly, all of the other pieces are quite manageable. The one that I would worry about the most would be the fluid piece and we have eight obligors in fluid and we have $99 million in outstandings for fluid. So, again, we're paying them a lot of love and attention these days.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for that. And then kind of on the loan growth side, obviously another quarter where almost everything is looking good, the main exception there being a continued runoff in the unoccupied commercial real estate portfolio. Are you any closer to kind of knowing when we might get an inflection point in that portfolio?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's a great question, and it's one we challenge ourselves with frequently. As David had said earlier, one of our primary goals is to try to not only grow revenue but to diversify our revenue streams. And if you look at what's different this quarter versus last quarter, certainly versus a quarter a year ago, we've really gotten greater diversity and gotten greater growth more broadly across the different lending segments. And as you pointed out, the one segment that we did not get growth in, have not hit an inflection point on, has been in owner-occupied real estate, which has predominantly been our small to medium size businesses that we provide banking product to.","And in that small business community we have seen this year an improvement in production. What we've not seen is enough production to offset the normal amortization of that portfolio. And it's predominantly an amortizing portfolio. There's some line usage in that group, but mostly it's amortizing. We continue to look for that inflection point. We don't think it's too far down the road. But it's \u2013 that one product segment has been the one that we've been most challenged to reach that inflection point on. But good production numbers and I think the confidence of that segment is improving. But that small business sector has been sort of the last to recover from a confidence perspective.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's been a great deposit sector, though. We really have been growing deposits in that group. So, we're encouraged, but still not at that inflection point yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Paul.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yes. Thank you very much. Guys, I do want to commend you on the energy side. I do like it. I just had a question about your \u2013 how do you define indirect exposure and in that sense I get a lot of people \u2013 feedback I get from clients is, I'm not really worried about the direct exposure, I'm worried about the indirect exposure, i.e., small businesses in these communities, that are mainly oil-driven. Are you seeing any real deterioration in any of these communities, I guess, in the Gulf or where you do business?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll start and then I'll let Barb Godin speak just a second on that. We've really tried to take a broad view of what the implications of the drop in the commodity prices and the energy sector have been. And I think that some segments of that energy portfolio are fairly easy to define.","When you get down to the indirect piece, there's some subjectivity and objectivity that's required to define those. And I would tell you that we've seen in certain cases some softness in some of those indirect segments. Overall, in some of our markets we operate in, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Houston, there's a lot of activities that's offsetting the softness in this activity from a community perspective, but some individual companies absolutely you see, do see some softness. Barb?","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer","Yes, thank you, Grayson. We would define indirect as those types of companies, as an example transportation, that majority of their business is done to support something going on in the energy sector. So we capture all of that, that's incremental almost $500 million that we talk about.","Relative to the other contagion effects that we would look at i.e., consumer, small business, commercial real estate, et cetera, we look at all that. Consumer side is a positive, it's a net positive, they're enjoying the low gas prices, it's helping them a lot, we're seeing that pickup, as an example, in our restaurant business that we have a specialty in. We're seeing better results there. Relative to some of the other areas as we think about Texas, the only area of any heightened attention is the Houston market, the office sector. We're looking at that. It's still doing well but we're keeping an eye on that. And New Orleans, of course has suffered a little bit from softening demand, as well. And that is pushing their vacancy rates up.","Overall retail and all of those sectors have done well, a lot of the Gulf of Mexico and Houston as well. But we don't want to be a Pollyanna. We absolutely want to keep our heads up and keep attuned to making sure that if we do see some softness that we react quickly.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And as a follow-up, have you seen \u2013 have you got any feedback from the Fed with rates staying low on any guidance on your capital management? Or is your capital management good to go for the year until the next CCAR?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think \u2013 so we can't discuss anything with our regulatory supervisors. But suffice it to say that all capital planning that we have built into this year's expectations have been via the non-objection we received in our CCAR. So, if we wanted to do something outside of that, it would require some form of off-cycle request to our regulatory supervisors.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay, guys, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, John.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Morning. Just a question regarding the loss range of $30 million to $50 million on energy that you put out there. Can you give us a little bit of color on how you arrived at that? Did you look at the past cycles and what basis do you have behind the numbers on the calc?","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer","John, this is Barb Godin again. Again, we use both quantitative as well as qualitative. The quantitative being, yes, we look at models that we run. It includes historical information as well as current information of what we think will happen in the future. But, again, we supplant a lot of that with an ongoing monthly looking at every file, every customer, looking at what their balance sheets look like, looking at what their cash flows look like. So that, as we talk about our estimate of losses, we talk about \u2013 I can't talk about through the cycle, I don't know when the cycle will end, we use the 12 month to 18 month horizon to say we have pretty good visibility for that period of time. So, again, pretty comfortable with the number we put out there.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Now, Barb, is that 12 months to 18 months from now or for the cycle?","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer","Yes.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. So now, do you have any way of identifying what that implies in terms of the accum loss assumption that you're now incorporating?","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer","No, I wouldn't go that far.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. All right. And then separately, David, just on the interest rate side, on the swaps. I'm not sure if you've disclosed, but did you indicate how much in swaps you added? And then also, can you give us just your thinking in terms of the willingness to add incremental swaps here or is this it?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah, so we will be disclosing our swaps in the Q. We put about $3 billion of received fixed swaps. They're a little longer dated. We had some short-term that we took off, so we were up about $1 billion net on notional. John, as we think about interest rate risk positioning, it kind of gets back to Marty's question. We challenge ourselves every day on where we need to have this. We think taking that sensitivity away and foregoing that nice lift and nice benefit we think we'll get when rates rise would be the wrong long-term answer for our shareholders. So we'll pay the freight today for the benefit that we'll get tomorrow and we'll manage our profitability the way we've done. So we've put some incremental swaps on. We don't have any current plans to execute further swaps, but if conditions change, then we could change our mind as well.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. And if I could just ask one more. You may punt me to your Investor Day for the answer for this one, but I know you've been investing in a lot of your fee-based businesses that tend to be higher efficiency ratio businesses like wealth management and cap markets, but less capital-intensive and accordingly higher ROE. So can you give us just a \u2013 how do you think about that, how it could all come out in the wash in terms of the ultimate benefit to your ROE from these investments?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah, that's a very good question. We challenge ourselves on that. You've nailed exactly the math there. We have to look at all of our businesses working together and the synergistic effect they can have on our total business and the diversification and how we might react in a stressed environment versus a normal environment. All those come into play as we think about the investments we want to make in businesses. We well understand that the investments in some of these businesses are less efficient. That's part of where our efficiency ratio is today, but they take a very little amount of capital, as well, so the return on capital is pretty strong. And they have a tendency to be annuity-based so that you can count on them year in and year out, so that's worth something.","You will see \u2013 so I'll half punt to Investor Day, you'll see how all this comes together in terms of our outlook over the next three-year period with the investments that we have made and plan to make. And how we're going to self-fund these investments, as Grayson mentioned, from an expense standpoint so that we can improve our bottom line over time, so that we can become more efficient over time as well. So that we can \u2013 our business model can address whatever interest rate environment might be out there, we're going to put together a plan that shows you how we win in all those scenarios.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","All right. Thank you, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Erika.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Just a follow-up question on the previous question on efficiency. If I take your adjusted efficiency ratio of 65% and I put together everything that you've said so far. So modest NII growth even if rates stay low because loan growth has been solid. You know, fee income starting to benefit from some of the investments that you've made, but naturally a more higher efficiency ratio business in terms of wealth management, capital markets and self-funding some of the investments, I guess over the next 12 months how much improvement can you generate on that 65% assuming no increase in rates from the expense side?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah. Well, let me talk about it in terms of all of our businesses coming together and this will be a discussion we'll have at Investor Day but, as you know, we've sought to be in the lower 60%s. We believe we can get there based on all the things we've talked to you about this morning. We'll get more granular on how if you'll come to Investor Day. But, our long-term goal with rates increasing was still in those higher 50%s that we've talked about previously. But we're building the business model and if we don't get the rate increase, how do we continue to improve bottom line, how do we continue to become more efficient, that is, get below 65 and trend towards the lower 60%s without rates increasing? So, we believe we can do that, we're going to show you more specifically how we'll do that on November the 19th.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And just maybe as we think about the next quarter, David, is the correct base for adjusted expenses as we think about a fourth quarter $872 million to $875 million?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","That is the basis on what you should extrapolate anything in the fourth quarter, yes.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Matt.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, Grayson. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, David, maybe a question for you. It looked like your long-term borrowings were up roughly two times quarter-over-quarter. I didn't \u2013 if I look at some industry sources, it didn't look like you had issued quite that much debt. Could you give us a little sense as to what's going on there? And also in terms of any preferred issuance that you might think about going forward to fill up that regulatory bucket?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Sure. So we did increase our long-term debt. We did have the debt issuance during the quarter. It was about $750 million, I think your \u2013 that you've seen. We did take out some short-term FHLB debt in place of long-term FHLB debt. Part of that was to fund loan growth. Part of that's sitting in cash as well as we think about LCR. But that was really the big \u2013 the biggest driver. And the second part of the question...?","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","In terms of any possible preferred issuance going forward?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","So, we do acknowledge we probably need a little more non-common Tier 1. And to issue it right now, without a good place to put the proceeds, though, is really cost-prohibitive. The carry on that is something we want to avoid. If we can kind of work that through our optimization of our capital stack over time, I think would be the better play for us as we trade out a more expensive common instrument for a less expensive preferred issuance and get our delta, delta between common equity Tier 1 and our Tier 1 to be a little better than we have today. So, you'll see that in time.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Sure. Makes sense. Barb, my follow-up's directed towards you, I mean, if I take, I guess, an admittedly conservative view of the $30 million to $50 million range that you've talked about over the next 12 months, that's roughly a 1.5% loss rate on your overall energy exposure. How does that compare, perhaps, with the 12 month to 18 month loss rate that you may have had on an energy portfolio back in the 2008-2009 timeframe when energy prices were down about 70%?","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer","Yeah, we look back on that timeframe and we had very few losses. If I recall, it was something give or take around $8 million, I think, and we've had none since then.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Right. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Gerard.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, Grayson. Good morning. David, maybe you can share with us, on the LCR I think you said you guys are well positioned to reach the, I guess 90% is where most of the regional banks need to be by January of 2016. Assuming that's correct, if rates don't change in 2016 and you then lift the LCR to 100% next year to reach the January of 2017 target, should we expect some margin pressure as you do that, if you're not already at 100%?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think you would see some downward pressure there. I would not call it significant. We continue to have \u2013 that's why we're positioned where we are today. And we have a little bit more in cash. It has already weighed down our margins. Over time, there could be a little bit of further compression, but not significant enough \u2013 not a significant amount.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. And on the follow-up question, you've given us good detail on the oil portfolio and how you guys have looked at it. One of the banks, JPMorgan, when they released numbers gave us some sensitivity analysis suggesting if oil got to $30 a barrel they would take another $500 million to $750 million in reserves. Have you guys stress-tested this portfolio? I know you're using the future prices and discounting it back for the next 12 months to 18 months, but have you gone beyond that, saying if oil got to $35, $30 or $25 a barrel, what would happen to the portfolio?","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer","This is Barb. We have not run those models specifically with a $30 number, but we have done an awful lot of dialogue on what happens if it goes to $30. And it's not just a matter of the price; it's the speed at which it would go down to $30. If it goes down to $30 slowly over time, everyone has an opportunity to adjust their CapEx, adjust their expense models, et cetera. If it goes quickly, of course you're going to feel more pain. But, so far, what we've found with our customers is they have taken all of the right measures at the right pace to make sure that they're adjusting their operating models as quickly as they can.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust Robinson.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jennifer.","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. I was wondering if you could give your perspective on the Houston market specifically right now and what you're seeing in terms of your overall Texas loan growth.","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Jennifer, we couldn't hear you very well.","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I'm sorry. Could you give us some commentary on what you're seeing in the Houston economy right now? And what you're seeing in terms of the company's Texas loan growth over the last three months to six months?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think when you look at the markets that we're seeing in Texas, clearly we're still seeing some good strength in most of the markets in Texas. Obviously, there's some softness in Houston. We have \u2013 we're spending a lot of time focused on that market because it's one of the markets most exposed to the energy industry and our customers that are there.","But, so far, the Texas markets have held up surprisingly well. As Barb had mentioned a moment ago, the consumer in particular has shown some good strength in terms of benefiting from the lower pump prices, but also there's a lot of diversification in a lot of the economy in Texas. I think everyone's worried about what the contagion that may occur in some of these markets. Quite frankly, we haven't seen it in Houston yet. We look for it, especially in the commercial real estate market, which we're monitoring very closely.","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer","I'd add a little bit to that. This is Barb. Demand continues across all the Texas markets vigorously, in fact, for newly constructed single-family housing, particularly in Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio. In Houston, it's decelerated somewhat for newly constructed units exceeding $600,000, so pretty high price point. But sales of the lower priced units, those under $600,000 continue at a healthy clip. And the home builder industry has responded pretty quickly. They've reduced construction activity. We look at that \u2013 looking at permits, et cetera. So, again, the market has been adjusting to the reduction in the oil prices.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Werner of Morningstar.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Werner - Morningstar Research","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. With respect to \u2013 just a little more color on the commercial portfolio. Is it primarily from drawdowns from existing lines or is there a more organic growth? And maybe kind of give some color on the energy in terms of the lines themselves. It looks like you still had some increase in midstream. I was wondering if that's from existing lines and kind of how you guys are addressing those.","John M. Turner, Jr. - Senior Executive Vice President, Head-Corporate Banking Group","So, this is John Turner. I would say that the commercial growth that we see is fairly broad-based and it is both a reflection of customers borrowing under lines of credit, though, we actually saw about a 30 basis point reduction in utilization of lines of credit during the quarter. And customers borrowing to finance transactions to acquire new businesses, to expand, to add to their working capital or support their working capital needs associated with expansion of their businesses. So we've seen a variety of activities that have resulted in growth in the book, and as we said, that growth has occurred across our businesses, particularly in real estate and in our corporate banking business across our specialized industries verticals. Good growth in power utilities, in our restaurant book, in technology and defense. So we think nicely diversified and reflecting good fundamentals in that sector of the economy.","With respect to the energy book, we have added a couple of midstream names over the course of the last 12 months. We've done that typically through our Regions Business Capital group where we feel like we've got a very good asset support. Those particular customers are operating under longer term contracts. We think there's a lot of stability in that business and industry and we've seen an opportunity to grow a couple of nice relationships as a result of bringing those customers on.","Dan Werner - Morningstar Research","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Vivek.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I just wanted to check a couple of things. Firstly, the check posting order change that you'll were going to go through, did that start in the third quarter or is that coming in 4Q?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yeah, Vivek, this will start in the fourth quarter. You'll see a piece of that.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, because I saw that your service charges were down 8% year-on-year, which is a little faster rate. Any color on that then? What's making that go down a little bit faster, David?","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","I just think it's more seasonality. There's really nothing that stood out for us. We continue to grow accounts and customers and feel good about service charges and I'll be a little more specific, that posting order will start about mid quarter for us, so we're still in that guidance we've given you on the posting order of $10 to $15 million per quarter.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But no real changes in the third quarter. I mean, still growing accounts, growing transactions, growing balances. But seasonally we did see service charges slowdown. But I think it's just normal seasonal adjustments.","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Vivek, were you comparing quarter-to-quarter or year...?","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, I was looking actually year-on-year for the minus 8%, quarter-over-quarter it was down \u2013 it was more flattish. Because the year-on-year was down 8% so I was trying to get a sense of is there a customer behavior further change or is anything else that's causing that.","David J. Turner, Jr. - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","No, the primary driver there was, if you remember, we exited the Ready Advance product about a year ago so that was in your number last year that's not in your number this year. That was the biggest component of that difference.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. A quick question for Barb. Barb, last quarter you'll talked about national credits where you had some issues. Can you give us some update on where that stands? One of your peers this morning took some additional provisions for weakness based on global manufacturing conditions. Could you weave any thoughts on what you're seeing in relation to that into your comments too?","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer","Yeah, the shared national credits, as you know, there's currently going to be two reviews a year. The second review is going to take place starting in November, but it's only for the large players. We will not be involved in that other than as a participant, so we'll get some of those results, likely January or so by the time they put the results out. Relative to the overall shared national credit book though. It's a very strong book, a very good book for us. We're happy with those credits. Again, we don't specifically look at the shared national credits and say because it's a shared national credit I reserve for it any differently. We look account by account, credit by credit; to see what the underlying issues are and what the appropriate level of reserve should be against it.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And any color on the manufacturing stuff that Fifth Third talked about this morning? They're seeing some weakness so they've taken some provisions. What are you seeing in your manufacturing clients?","Barb Godin - Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer","Yeah, what we're seeing is aluminum casting, steel companies, we're seeing a little bit of softness there, keeping an eye on that sector. But, again, as they move through our risk rating process, if any of those credits do deteriorate, of course they'll get a larger allowance as they move through our normal process.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","At this time there are no further questions. I will now turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.","M. List Underwood - Director of Investor Relations","Well, let me close and just say thank you for your time, your attention and your questions today. We would encourage you to attend our Investor Day on November 19 and we thank you, again, and we stand adjourned.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

And welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation\u2019s Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Shelby and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions\u2019 second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. John Turner will provide highlights of our financial performance and David Turner will take you through an overview of the quarter. The slide presentation as well as our earnings release and earnings supplement, are available under the investor relations section of our website. Our forward-looking statements disclosure and non-GAAP reconciliations are included in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation and within our SEC filings. These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of today\u2019s call.","With that, I will now turn the call over to John.","John Turner","Thank you, Dana and thank you all for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying in the face of significant market volatility, we are pleased with our second quarter results. We reported earnings from continuing operations of $374 million, a 3% increase over the second quarter of the prior year and earnings per share of $0.37, an increase of 16%. We also delivered solid pretax, pre provision income growth compared with the prior year, and generated 4% adjusted positive operating leverage.","This quarter's results demonstrate our core business remain strong. And our focus on meeting client need is producing sustainable growth. We grew revenue, average loans and deposits and new customer relationships across market while reducing expenses. We are also experiencing success in our priority market which included Atlanta, Houston, Orlando and St Louis. For example, in Atlanta, the pace of new account and deposit growth is approximately 2x that of net of the total company. Further, we are outperforming the general market in terms of household account growth in each respective location. ","Shifting to the corporate bank, in just six months we've added a significant number of new clients across these same markets. Commercial banking growth has been particularly strong in Houston where pipelines for credit and deposits are in all time high. Although it's early, we believe these facts provide evidence that our investments for growing are paying off. We remained focus on those things we can control. And we can continue to feel very good about our future. We are largely complete with our hedging strategy that we began about 18 months ago. These instruments will provide stability to our net interest income and net interest margin. Dave will spend some time discussing the details of that strategy in just a moment. ","We also remain well positioned to prudently manage through the next credit cycle because of our ongoing risk mitigation activities, including client selectivity, sound underwriting, rigorous credit servicing and appropriate concentration limits. We remain focused on appropriate capital allocation, balance sheet optimization and risk adjusted returns. This work led to our exit of indirect auto and insurance and the decision to exit a point-of-sale relationship earlier this year.","It also informed our strategic decision to achieve better balance between construction and term commercial lending within our real estate business. Another meaningful example of our commitment to build a business that's sustainable over the long term. This quarter, we reposition a portion of our investment securities portfolio, continue to focus on client selectivity and relationship profitability with our loan portfolios and improved our funding mix. These actions will help support net interest income and the net interest margin going forward. Despite recent market uncertainty, the economy still feels pretty good. And while our customers are more cautious than they were just a few months ago, they maintained a positive outlook and most continue to expect better performance this year than last.","Many of our customers have a backlog of orders. With the biggest challenge being an insufficient supply of skilled labor. Fundamentally, the domestic economy remains solid, and credit quality continues to reflect relatively stable performance with some continued normalization. And while lower interest rates support continuing economic expansion, they will certainly pressure future revenue growth. To respond, we will continue to build on the momentum we've established through our simplifying grow initiative. To make banking easier, accelerate revenue growth and importantly, become more efficient and effective. Should the market's current path for lower interest rates persist, with short rates declining in second half of 2019 and remaining at lower levels into 2020, and the economy softened faster than we expect, achieving some of our long-term financial targets will be challenging.","That being said, we remain committed doing all we can to appropriately adjust our plans and to respond. So to summarize, this was another solid quarter for Regions and despite the market volatility and uncertainty, I feel good about where we are today and believe we're well positioned to generate consistent and sustainable long-term performance throughout all phases of the economic cycle.","With that, I'll now turn it over to David.","David Turner","Thank you, John. During last quarter's call we spent time talking about certain balance sheet optimization efforts. And we're either underway or actively being developed. And today, I want to spend a few minutes highlighting the results of those efforts. When we say balance sheet optimization, we're referring to the strategies we execute every day to challenge the efficiency of our balance sheet in order to maximize net interest income and margin, as well as overall profitability and returns. This quarter, adjusted average loans grew approximately 1%. As you may recall, late last quarter we experienced loan growth from certain large corporate customers that while high in quality generated thinner spreads.","We anticipated some of these customers which used refinance in the capital markets. Although, we have experienced some movement, the moderation in loan growth this quarter was primarily due to our continued focus on client selectivity and overall relationship profitability. As John mentioned, loan demand in our markets remain reasonably healthy, but maintaining our disciplined approach impacted overall balance growth. We remain focused on risk adjusted returns and are not interested in trying to out grow the economy by pursuing nominal loan growth for short-term benefit.","With that said, we continue to expect full-year growth in average adjusted loans to be in the low to mid single digits. During the quarter, we also executed strategies to better optimize our securities portfolio. We reduce the overall size by approximately $1.5 billion through a combination of maturities and sales. We also sold another $2.8 billion of lower yielding securities and reinvested those proceeds into higher yielding securities, improving our yield run rate by 8 basis points, while recognizing approximately $19 million of net losses.","The new securities were selected to ensure appropriate prepayment protection with a focus on improving performance in a declining rate environment. Turning to the liability side of the balance sheet. Average corporate segments deposits decrease 3% during the quarter and included seasonal declines within public fund accounts, as well as an intentional exit of approximately $700 million of higher cost deposits that were added during the first quarter to support loan growth. Despite this reduction, total average deposits still increased approximately 1% driven primarily by growth in consumer. Exhibiting the strength of our core deposit franchise, average consumer deposits increased $1.3 billion and importantly average noninterest-bearing consumer deposits increased almost $600 million.","These optimization strategies also triggered a reduction in wholesale funding needs during the quarter. Average FHLB advances are down approximately $1 billion compared to the prior quarter. So let's look at how this impacted net interest income and margin. Net interest income was down slightly compared to the first quarter and net interest margin totaled 3.45%. As expected, continued deposit pricing pressure was the largest driver of this quarter's margin. What is important to know, however, is we did see deposit costs peak within the quarter in May and subsequently trend down in June.","Our total deposit costs remain one of the lowest in the industry. And our cumulative deposit beta for the recent tightening cycle is 29%. Assuming the Federal Reserve begins to ease in orderly increments of 25 basis points, we currently expect an initial deposit beta of approximately 35% at the beginning of a down rate cycle. In addition to deposit cost and after normalizing for days, another driver to this quarter's margin was declining market interest rates. This includes the decline we saw in LIBOR in anticipation of potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, as well as the decline in loan-in rates.","Currently the market is pricing in further interest rate declines over the second half of 2019. So let's spend a few minutes looking at how this could impact our results. While reducing deposit could provide some relief using the June 30 market forwards which includes roughly 325 basis point reductions, we would expect full-year net interest income to be modestly higher than the prior year. While fourth-quarter margin would approach 3.40%, the low end of our long-term range. However, we would expect the first quarter's margin to expand into the low-to-mid 340s as the benefit of our forward starting hedges begins.","Now I want to take some time and walk you through our hedging strategy, and its expected financial benefit. Slide 6 contains additional details regarding our use of forward starting swaps and floors along with their anticipated impact to our future asset sensitive profile. The chart provides a cumulative build of the notional value of our hedges broken out by the quarter in which they become effective. We are substantially complete with our hedging program. And importantly, the bulk of those forward starting hedges become active on January 1st, 2020.","In addition, these forward starting hedges have maturities of approximately five years from their respective starting. These longer tenures provide better support to future net interest income to the extent rates remains low for an extended period. Because the preponderance of our hedging program is forward starting, many of you may be modeling a negative impact to our future net interest income that will look markedly different six months from now. To illustrate the benefit of our future dated hedges, we have provided the estimated impact to annual net interest income associated with a standard 100 basis point gradual, parallel shock for each future period presented.","The table highlights this inverted relationship. As our forward starting hedges become effective, our asset sensitivity is reduced. The key takeaway from this slide is our forward starting hedges will stabilise our interest rate sensitivity profile in 2020 and beyond.","So let's move on to fee revenue. Adjustment noninterest income increased 2% compared to the first quarter. Service charges, card and ATM fees and mortgage reflected seasonally higher revenue, combined with continued customer account growth and an increase in transaction activity. Wealth management income increased primarily due to sales and market driven revenue from investment management and trusts, combined with higher sales volumes from investment services. Within mortgage income, our net MSR hedge impact remained relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter. However, as expected in a declining rate environment, we are beginning to experience an increase in prepayment decay. Partially offsetting these increases were declines in capital markets, like on the life insurance and other noninterest income.","The declining capital markets were primarily due to lower M&A advisory fees and customer swap income. The decline in customer swap income was almost entirely due to market related credit valuation adjustments tied to customer derivatives. Excluding these market-based adjustments, total capital markets income would have increased approximately 5%.","Let's move on to noninterest expense, which continues to be a really good story for Regions. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 1% compared to first quarter. Furniture and equipment expense, outside services and professional fees increase this quarter, but were partially offset by decline in salaries and benefits. A decline in staffing levels of just under 300 full-time equivalent positions combined with a favorable reduction in benefits expense contributed to the decline in salaries benefits. The adjusted efficiency ratio was 58.3% unchanged from the prior quarter.","Despite success in managing our cost, the challenging revenue environment necessitates even more focus on expense management. One area with expense save opportunity is within corporate real estate. This quarter we took advantage of market opportunities and sold a large office building in excess of 100,000 square feet. We also made a decision to market the sale of another large office building in excess of 300,000 square feet. These transactions will benefit future occupancy expense and are expected to help us exceed our goal to reduce over 200 million square feet of space by 2021.","Additionally, we continue to make significant progress in the digital space. Digital checking account openings are up 53% and digital card production is up 43% year- to-date. The effective tax rate was 19.4% and it was impacted by excess tax benefits associated with invested equity awards. So let's shift to asset quality. Asset quality continue to perform in line with our expectations this quarter, and reflected stable performance within a relatively benign credit environment, while some normalization of certain credit metrics continued, overall credit results remained well within the acceptable range of our establish risk appetite. Net charge-offs increased to 0.44% of average loans, in line with our expected range of 40 to 50 basis points for 2019. ","Provision match net charge-offs resulting in an allowance equal to 1.02% of total loans and 160% of total non-accrual loan. Non accrual loans increased modestly while Business Services criticized loans remained relatively unchanged. And total troubled debt restructurings decreased 7%. While overall asset quality remains stable and within our stated risk appetite, volatility and certain credit metrics can be expected.","So let me give you some brief comments related to capital and liquidity. During the quarter, the company repurchased 12.8 million shares of common stock for $190 million and declared $141 million in dividends. In June, we announced details related to our 2019 capital plan. We intend to reach our 9.5% common equity Tier 1 ratio target in the third quarter and managed at that approximate level going forward. Our capital plan includes the ability to repurchase up to $1.37 billion of common stock. However, the exact amount and timing of repurchases will be determined by actual loan growth and our overall financial performance.","We also expect to increase the quarterly dividend within our stated range of 35% to 45% of earnings. The Board will consider this increase at their meeting next week. Our full year 2019 expectations are presented on slide 11. Assuming the market forward curve at quarter end, we would expect to be at the lower end of our 2% to 4% full-year adjusted revenue growth target. Given the certain revenue environment, we are increasing our focus on expense management and expect full-year adjusted noninterest expense to be stable to down slightly. And we expect to generate positive operating leverage for the year. As John noted, we remain focused on the things we can control. And we are responding to the changing market dynamics as we have in the past.","So in summary, we are pleased with our second quarter financial results. We have a solid strategic plan, designed to deliver consistent and sustainable performance throughout any economic cycle. With that, we're happy to take your questions. But do ask that you limit them to one primary and one follow-up question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. ","RyanNash","Hey, good morning guys. So it looks like you've seen an inflection and deposit cost. So they're like a 29%, you had one of the lowest faded cycle to date. So you're talking about the NIM approaching 3.40% and then increasing. Can you just talk about how you feel about your ability to bring down deposit across -- a deposit cost across most of across retail wealth and commercial? And then as you think about the sensitivities you've outlined, given all the changing dynamics on the balance sheet, how do you think about the sensitivity to short versus long-term rates? Then I have a follow-up.","DavidTurner","Okay. This is David. So we're encouraged by the reaction of our team's on deposit cost. We clearly are competitive. But we are -- we are able and in the month of June through our actions we took the month before that to reduce deposit cost a couple of basis points. And we put that in the chart to show you that we expect that to have already peaked to the extent that we continue to get short-term rates down that will give us even more ability to reduce deposit cost. ","We have about 10% of our deposits are indexed; 10% of our interest bearing deposits are indexed, but we also have another 10% of our interest bearing deposits that are have been exception priced that really money market type deposits if get to address as rate change. So we can move pretty quickly as the market changes which give us some confidence that we continue to hold our margin at that 3.40% level for the remainder of the year. Even then if we get the two roughly three cuts that the forwards imply.","RyanNash","Got it and maybe as my follow-up, you talked about the environment being challenging and it might be hard to hit some of your targets. I guess if the rate environment does improve do you think you could still approach the low end of your efficiency and ROTC targets? And then second do you expect to continue to be able to generate positive operating leverage, even if you don't hit the target? Thanks.","DavidTurner","Yes. So we made a commitment at Investor Day that we would generate positive operating leverage each year of our three-year plan. Clearly, the rate outlook put some pressure on that, but we still are committed to generating positive operating leverage. If you recall the last three year plan that we had, the market didn't behave quite like we thought it was going to either and we pulled whatever it took to make sure we met the targets. And so we have confidence in that. Clearly, if we have a persistent low rate environment for this whole three-year period that does put pressure on certain of those metrics. But I would like to point out, we're six months into our three-year plans. ","There are a lot of things that can happen and so we're confident we have a good plan that we have the ability to toggle and do what we need to do to continue to improve our financial performance. And we will do that that was the commitment that was in our prepared comments both from John and from me.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari, Evercore ISI.","JohnPancari","Good morning, John. On the expense topic still just I guess longer-term you had an expectation for below 55% efficiency ratio in 2021 or by 2021. Can you just think, just let us know how you are thinking about the, that level and if it's still attainable despite the rate backdrop just giving you're hedging et cetera? Thanks.","DavidTurner","Yes. So as I tried to mention to Ryan then, three years is a long time. If you just did the math on this rate persisting for that entire three-year period of time, would be pretty hard to get to a 55% efficiency ratio because we don't want to do is cut our expenses so much we damage our franchise. We can get pretty close to that even in that rate environment because of all the hedging that's in place. But could we hit 55% it would be, again this rate environment persisting the entire time would be pretty tough. ","JohnTurner","But I would say, John, I mean we're going to remain focused on effective expense management while investing in our business. And so you can expect us to continue to deliver on our commitment to maintain expenses to flat just down slightly while investing in our business. And hopefully growing revenue despite what is a challenging interest rate environment.","DavidTurner","Let me add some to that John because we are talking about the interest rate environment. If we have low rate environment with slope to the yield curve that's very helpful. If we have, obviously a higher rate environment with slope that's ideal. A low and flat rate environment with as where we have would have pressure on that 55% margin.","JohnPancari","Got it, okay. That's helpful color. ","DavidTurner","I am sorry, efficiency. ","JohnPancari","Right, right, got it. Okay and then my follow up are around credit. Just wondered if we can get a little bit more color on the increasing charge-off on the commercial front? Where they come from? And then also your non performers still saw a moderate increase in the quarter despite the higher charge-off. So implying that we are seeing a pick up inflows here. Can you talk about what is driving that? Thanks. ","BarbGodin","Sure, it's Barb. Relative to charge-offs driven by one loan, it was in the -- it came out of healthcare sector something that we've been working on for quite a while. And finally came to a resolution. So we don't see anything systemic in there. Relative to the NPLs, it was three loans that really drove those numbers of which one has since been paid off. And the other two, we, at this point we don't expect any loss from them. So, again nothing systemic. We are still seeing credit is being stable in our outlook going for the balance of the year. And we are committed again to the 40 to 50 basis points range again for the balance of the year. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","MattO'Connor","Hi. There is puts and takes on the balance sheet kind of outside of loans. You talked about loans and securities, reinvesting them. Just as we think about earnings assets, ex loans, are those kind of relatively stable going forward with the restructuring? I just want to make sure I got all the puts and takes there. ","DavidTurner","Yes, Matt. I would tell you some of those investment transactions were toward the end of the quarter. So if you look at our average, our average is below with ending was, so you --we're going to feel a little bit of pressure on earning assets from that trade into the third quarter. So it's really not as much on growing net interest income and margin on earning assets as it is the mix. And being able to react to deposit pricing should we have rate reductions.","MattO'Connor","Okay. So those -- so the buckets of kind of non loan earning assets will be down a bit on average 3Q verse the 2Q level?","DavidTurner","In particular in the investment security portfolio because that trend happened at the end of the quarter.","MattO'Connor","Yes, okay. And then just following up on the line of credit discussion right before me. The early stage delinquency numbers also moved up and did that relate to healthcare loan or the commercial inflows, one of which paid off or was that driven something different?","BarbGodin","Yes. Part of that is seasonal in our 30-day buckets, 90 day buckets were down, and 30 day was up marginally. And there is nothing systemic in there at all. That is part, it's just a part and parcel of our seasonality. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust.","JenniferDemba","Thank you. Good morning. Question for you on M&A. Could you just give us an idea of what your interest level is at this point in bank and non-bank M&A?","JohnTurner","Yes. Thank you. Our interest in Bank M&A hasn't changed. We remain focused on the execution of our plans. We don't see any material change in the economic analysis of M&A and Bank M&A. And so we're going to continue to watch the market. We're going to continue to pay attention to what's occurring, but our position hasn't changed. With respect to non-bank M&A, we continue to look for opportunities to add capabilities to help grow and diversify revenue to meet customer needs. We recently announced the acquisition of Holland, which is a wealth management capability that complementary to our healthcare business. And one that we're excited about, it's a smaller transaction like the others that we've done. But it's meaningful and that again it helps us, we think grow and diversify revenue and meet a customer need by adding some capabilities.","We have been actively looking at mortgage servicing rights acquisitions, but with the rate environment those transactions have become more challenging to find. But we'll continue to do that and within our other businesses, we're again always looking for opportunities to add to our capabilities and will remain active there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter winter of Wedbush.","Peterwinter","Good morning. You guys are putting a little bit more emphasis on the expense side. I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the levers because it certainly doesn't seem like you're in slowdown, the investment.","DavidTurner","Yes. Peter, that last statement is really important because we are continuing to look for ways to make banking easier for our customers, looking to make investments in talent, technology. We have to pay for that. And way to do that is to continue to focus on our expenses and leverage our simplifying grow continuous improvement program that we started a little over a year and a half ago. If we're going to control our expenses, we have to really have an intense focus on our top three categories, salaries and benefits being number one. Down some 300 positions at this quarter, we continue to look to opportunities to streamline operations by leveraging technology. And most of that gets handled through attrition.","We've looked at occupancy, our next biggest category as we had in our prepared comments, we had some 400,000 square feet of space that we're exiting. Some of it we have exited; some what we just put in held for sale and we will be getting out of that space to save us on run rate occupancy. Also furniture, fixtures and equipment, our third category as we have here people, we have a smaller space we can save there as well. And our fourth category would be kind of purchasing or vendor spends, if you will. We have a, do had procurement that is really put in a lot of rigor in terms of helping us from a demand management standpoint on controlling what we need from a purchasing standpoint. Whether it is consulting hours or products or whatever the case may be.","And so we're, we, this type of challenging revenue environment and a commitment to positive operating leverage, you just have to pull every string that you can in terms of controlling expenses.","JohnTurner","And I'd add, Peter, we're, as we've said a few times, we're really pleased with our simplify grow initiative and we're really only beginning to see the benefits of the continuous improvement work that's occurring. And I asked John Owen who has led that initiative just too briefly talk about a couple of other things that opportunities that we see through the use of our digital capabilities to drive improvement. John?","JohnOwen","Yes. Good morning, everybody. We had about 17 new initiatives to our simplify and grow list. In the second quarter bringing that number up to about 62 initiatives. We've already completed 13 year-to-date. We will complete another 11 initiatives in the second half of 2019. When I think about some of the things we point to, go back to Investor Day, we talked about launching our digital lending platform and the consumer side of the house. That has really taken traction. We're seeing 38% of our applications today come in through that digital channel. On the e-side, e-close part of this, we're up to about 58% of our direct loans, closing of e-signs are really good traction of digital lending capabilities.","On the account opening, we're in a digital front. I think I'd point you to, we've had a team as part of simplify and grow working now for about a year, how do we streamline account opening, and how do we make the credit card process more smooth process and quicker process. I would revise the application, we've streamlined and we now are getting about 53% increases in our digital account opening and checking accounts. And about a 44% increase in credit card production to that digital channel. So really good traction there.","On the AI front, we continue to look for use cases on how we can roll out AI across the bank. You're all familiar with what we've done in the contact center. We've expanded a couple things in the contact center with AI. One of those is now where we launch password resets, which is one of our top calls into the center. We launched that in this month and we're seeing really good traction and having our AI virtual agent handle those password resets.","The last thing is we're having good success with AI and our quality assurance functions, where we're actually having the AI virtual agent Quality Assurance call types categories and really go through and make sure that our reps are following the right disclosures and right scripts. That's reducing our expenses in that QA area by about 70%. So good traction with AI as well.","Peterwinter","And then if I could ask with the hedging strategy really starting to kick in beginning in next year and you gave the outlook for the margin in the first quarter. Should we expect the margin going forward next year to be kind of flat to up?","DavidTurner","Yes. I think to the extent, so we're all assuming that the forwards actually work their way through for next year. As you can see on the chart, I think of slide 6 where we are trying to show you more and more hedging more and more the derivatives actually become effective, which helps us stabilize margin and what we're trying to do through the hedging program is just neutralized impact of insurance policy on lower rates, which prevents us from having to grow net interest income and margin from coming out of a hole. So now you can have organic growth and the balance sheet putting on good earning assets to give you the kind of growth that you want to have.","So we're not having to work against say, a headwind like we think many others might have. And so we do have the ability to grow depending on what we put on in terms of earning assets in 2020.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. ","KenUsdin","Good morning, guys. Thank you. Just a follow-up on that last question. So your scenario that you put out on page 5 which is really helpful, takes in three potential cuts that are in the forward curve. And this might be just more of a semantic one but I'm just wondering if the Fed only gives us one, how that saving changes potentially in terms of the decline before the hedge is come on. Like is it just like you end up in the same place but from a slightly different way of getting there or I just wanted to get --just trying to understand how the cadence might change if we don't fully get the three cuts of the curve?","DavidTurner","Yes. So, Ken, couple things to think about our sensitivity. We really have two things working. First is to your point the short end of the curve. So the short end of the curve is where our derivatives are tied to generally speaking one month LIBOR, we have received fixed so cuts in short term with the protection on the other receive fixed derivatives, and our ability to reduce deposit cost in that 35% deposit beta that we are talking about gives us the confidence that we have in 2020. So even if you have one, two, three cuts in the short end, we have protection under any of those scenarios.","It's then the second part is what happens to the long end of the curve. And so if we have slope to the curve even in us in a lower rate environment, if we have slope we are protected as well because the reinvestments coming off the investment portfolio on the like are really are tied to the long end. It's the, we don't want us to have a lower and flatter yield curve which is horrible for our industry as you know. So we're not as concerned about whether it's one, two or three because we'll react appropriately as long as we can get the, at the long end, at least stay where it is and maybe even increase a bit.","KenUsdin","Got it. So regardless of the pacing then you feel pretty good that 1Q, 2020 loaded mid 3, 20s can happen in most any circumstance except for a meaningfully flatter curve environment?","DavidTurner","That's exactly right. And we had our protection. We've -- we put the started putting this on over a year and a half ago with the expectation that we are going to be in this environment. We just thought it would be beginning in 2020 which is why we did forward starting. We did, we thought there are going to be rate increases through 2019 and we want to stay asset sensitive, so we've caught, been caught a little bit exposed in the latter part of 2019 as has have every peer of ours. But we're feeling pretty good about what can take place in 2020. And going forward, we have duration on those swaps in floors of five years beginning in 2020. So we have really good protection then. ","KenUsdin","Okay, got it. And then last just clean up on those forward charting swaps that you've got the fixed-rate strike on there. Are they at -- are they meaningfully different ones? The average is obviously 2.48% for the swaps and 2.08% for the floors on page six, but as you put them on, are they all around kind of a general average there or they are depends on which one they could be very much in or out of the money across the book?","DavidTurner","Yes. The averaging that we've given you, so we went to disclose a lot more this time to give you the ability to do your models. And we think the averaging is going to be representative enough. There will be 25 points here there but nothing that's really going to skew that from using the averages.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. ","ErikaNajarian","Good morning. I just wanted to clarify the response to Ryan's earlier question. As we think about the 35% deposit beta, given that deposit costs already peaked in May? Or is that for the initial 25 basis points? And as we think about 2020 what do you think, and if the forward curve is right and that will get three cuts and then maybe not anymore, what could the ultimate sort of reverse deposit data be on those 75 basis points of cut?","DavidTurner","Yes. I think we're going to start at 35. I think over time we're at 29 cumulative going up. So if you're starting at 35 you would expect that to drift down a bit as time goes through. I think that's what you're asking. ","ErikaNajarian","So the initiative to clarify the initial impact is immediate in terms of the 35% especially on the 20% of your interest bearing deposits that you are identifying as either quite expensive or indexed? And then it would taper that the repricing would taper off in terms of percentage of cuts rather than accelerate. I guess --","DavidTurner","Yes. You're exactly right. So it starts at 35 and then at the end of the day you're going to drift from that 35 down into the higher 20s as that -- and the driver of that is the 10% indexing at the exception pricing engine then just looking at the market of all of our deposits we compared to our peers. And we get the benefit of our floors. And we get the benefit of our receive pick swaps.","ErikaNajarian","Got it. And, John, just wanted to clarify, you loud and clear that 55 and below on efficiency isn't difficult in this rate environment. You did something earlier as an answer, a reply to a question that's flat to down slightly on expenses still a commitment. And is that what we should think about over this three-year period regardless of the rate environment?","DavidTurner","Yes. So this is David. So the flat to slightly down was an answer to 2019 changing our guidance there. I think your question is then what does it mean for the next three years, if we're in this challenging revenue environment. We clearly, we have to 2% and 2.5% inflation baked into our expense base every year. And so we have to continue to see cuts, if we want to keep expenses relatively stable. We have to find ways to cut that 2.5%. So and then if we want to make investments on top of that we got to find even more. Our commitment is that we would generate positive operating leverage under any of those environments, each of those three years.","Clearly, a lower rate environment, a flatter yield curve makes that very tough. But that's what we seek to do. And we're going to do whatever it takes to meet our expectations that we've laid out. The commitment was 55% three years from now, we're only six months there. So we're not giving up on 55% by any stretch.","Operator","Your next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS. ","SaulMartinez","Hey. Good morning, everybody. So I guess I'm still a little bit confused on the 35% deposit beta. And either glide path thereafter for future cuts. So are you saying that on the first 35 or the first 25 basis point cut, you'll see a decline in your interest bearing deposit cost of 35% beta on the decline on your interest bearing deposit cost? And over what time period does that occur? That's sort of an immediate decline or is that something that drags on over a couple quarters as new pricing filters in? Because it seems like, the commentary from some other banks has been that there is going to be a lag in terms of what deposit beta is and that they are going to accelerate not decelerators as rate cuts, further rate cuts happened.","DavidTurner","Yes. So we felt like ours are going to happen a little quicker because of the indexing that we have on 10% of our $60 billion of interest bearing deposits, another 10% exception price that we can move quickly to. So we think that can be pretty high early on. And we think that that could be maintained perhaps for a couple of quarters. At some point though that has to taper off. We're only up 29, so if you start at 35 some point it has to taper off as you get to an absolute floor in terms of deposit cost. So does that help?","SaulMartinez","Yes. I think so. But so the 35% then you're saying is pretty immediate?","DavidTurner","That's correct.","SaulMartinez","Okay. I guess just more of a conceptual question then on NII and how to think about net interest income growth in 2020 and 2021. I'm not certainly not asking for guidance. I know it's too early for that. But the extent you have stabilized your rate sensitivity, you've neutralized it to a large degree. When we think about NII growth beyond this year, should we be thinking net interest income grows more in line with loan growth average earning balance growth and mix shift and that occurs not necessarily independently of rates, but that being a much bigger driver of net interest income growth regardless of what the rate environment does.","DavidTurner","That's exactly what we were trying to communicate that our hedging program gave, is giving us the opportunity do not have to climb out of a hole to grow NII margin rather neutralizes that it was insurance protection of low rate environment not to give us a tailwind but to keep us from having this massive headwind. And therefore we could participate in growing NII and margin as we continue to grow earning assets watching our deposit cost. Our deposit franchises still our number one competitive advantage. And we think that's going to help us continue to grow NII with appropriate balance sheet growth.","SaulMartinez","Okay, no, that's helpful. If I can sneak one quick final one in. I don't know if I missed it but the outlook for indirect auto and indirect other consumer, now that you guys have GreenSky or exited not renewed the commitment there. How do we think about, can you remind us what your expectations are for balances there and how much fines and what the other consumer line balance should do?","DavidTurner","And so if you look at in hour supplement on page 21, you'll see our indirect vehicle decline this past quarter some $350 million. So we're kind of on that kind of run rate. We're not renewing that. It'll take some time. The whole average for the year will be about $800 million on the indirect auto decline. I'm sorry that's not auto, I mean GreenSky. ","SaulMartinez","Yes, GreenSky, okay. Thank you. ","JohnTurner","Yes. We need to clarify that. I think it's $800 million on average on the indirect auto portfolio full year, right, that's right. And then the runoff with respect to the indirect unsecured portfolio, it will top out over the next month or two as that contract expires and then we kind of expected 2 to 2.5 year sort of weighted average payout on that portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott.","ChristopherMarinac","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the environment [Indiscernible] late this year or next year about hiring teams of producers. Is this the environment where you invest in that or perhaps a few new markets come into the Regions' footprint because of external opportunities?","JohnTurner","Yes. I mean we're -- all of our business leaders' as well commercial corporate, real estate is actively recruiting all the time. Our consumer business similarly. One of our --one of their tasks is to always know who the best bankers are in their markets and in contiguous markets who the best bankers are in their specialized businesses. And so we're always actively recruiting. And we've had good success recruiting already this year across particularly our priority markets where we are investing St. Louis, Atlanta, and Houston and in Orlando and we'll continue to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. ","KevinBarker","Good morning. I was hoping you can give us a little more color on 9.5% CET 1 ratio target for the third quarter? It would seem that would imply a pretty aggressive buyback this quarter. And then maybe a tail off through the rest of the CCAR cycle? And maybe you just help us out with the cadence of the buyback in the near term and then through the cycle.","DavidTurner","Yes. Kevin, so you're exactly right. We put into our prepared comments that we were going to get to our 9.5% in the third quarter. Obviously we have loan growth that uses up some of that and dividends and then buying back to get us to that 9.5%, we will -- it will be exactly that every single quarter. But we're going to do what we can to keep it at that level because that's a level of capital, we think we need to run the company based on our risk profile. That does imply a quicker buyback or more of a buyback here in the short term.","It will moderate after that and we will use the repurchase ability. So we have authorization for our board up to $1.37 billion of stock buyback and how we think about capital allocation is first and foremost, we'll pay a dividend of 35% to 45% of our earnings. Then we're going to use some for organic loan growth and then we'll use the rest, we'll buy stock back to keep us at that 9.5%. Should loans grow faster, buybacks will be smaller and vice versa. If loans don't grow buybacks will increase, so that we can keep the capital optimized in the company.","KevinBarker","Okay. So given the authorization that you have for this cycle it would imply that or it would seem better imply that we keep the loan growth relatively low single digits or somewhere very close to that or maybe even closer to stable in the near term. Is there anything you're doing within the balance sheet in order to decrease risk weighted assets or some other way in order to keep the ratio at 9.5% given the buyback authorization you have in place?","DavidTurner","No. We're --we, our teams are out there growing loans when it makes sense from a risk adjusted return standpoint. We grew the first quarter a little quicker than we had expected. We slowed that down a bit this quarter. We still have the low to mid-single digit growth expectation for the year. Again any given quarter you can see a pace change. The third quarter for us over the last couple years haven't --has not been as stronger for growth even though our pipelines look pretty good. The fourth quarter on the other hand it's actually been pretty strong.","So we're sticking to our -- to that commitment on the loan growth. My point is that we use 9.5% and we toggle between loan growth and share buyback. We're not trying to manufacture one or the other. We want all the goods, we would much rather use our capital to grow organically than to buy our stock back. But we also want to have appropriate risk-adjusted client relationship type returns on the loan side. And if we don't get those and we can't use our capital to grow appropriately, that we will buy our stock back that makes sense.","Operator","Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. ","GerardCassidy","Question. Can you guys share with us -- we've seen a lot of commentary on by the strength of the consumer business and we all know how low the unemployment rate is in this country and the wage growth seems to be accelerating. But there seems to be some cross currents in the business side of our economy with what's going on with the trade negotiations, et cetera. So can you give us some insight of what your business customers are sharing with you about their business. And could you tie that into the forward curve of 325 basis points rate cuts in 2019. Just seems like the forward curve as being a little aggressive on those rate cuts. But I'm just curious to see what you guys think.","JohnTurner","Well, to answer the second half of your question, no, we cannot tie it into the forward curve. I would tell you that our business customers are still cautiously optimistic. It was clearly over the last 90 days or so, I sense more caution on the part of our business owners. But they're still optimistic, their 2018 results were very good. Most of them are having really good 2019 as we look at our credit quality across a variety of industry sectors really don't see any significant issues other than within the restaurant sub sector, we've called out before fast casual, don't appear to be any other stresses of any consequence that we see. Customers have good pipelines and so as I think I said in my prepared remarks, the primary constraint we see on the economy is the availability of skilled labor. ","And that's the thing that tends to constrain businesses from investing not the interest rate environment. And so I really can't tie our view of the economy through our customer's eyes to the forward rate curve.","GerardCassidy","Very good. And then can you guys share with us an update on CECL, where you stand and when we may get Day 1 estimate on the build up of reserves in January of 2020?","DavidTurner","Sure, Gerard. So we've been -- our teams have been working really hard to run parallel this year. We're feeling good about being prepared for the adoption also in January 2020. We're looking to put something in our 10-Q that would give some indication as to where we might be here shortly on Day 1. As we've mentioned before, consumer portfolios get hit really hard relative to commercial portfolios. And so we have about 40% of our loans, our consumer loans versus business services loans. So mortgages, HELOCS, credit cards, those unsecured credit, those get hit pretty hard in the seasonal adoption not as much on the commercial side. But stay tuned here shortly on our 10-Q filing.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. I'll turn the call back over to John Turner for closing remarks.","John Turner","Well, thank everybody for their interest. I hope you can tell we think we have a solid quarter despite the volatility in the market. We're focused on things that we can control. Client selectivity, sound underwriting, credit servicing, effective expense management, resource allocation and risk adjusted returns. We have a good plan. We think to neutralize our interest rate sensitivity. And we believe we're well positioned to continue to execute on our plans. And we stay focused on that. So thank you for your interest in Regions. And have a great day. ","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Paula and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. I would like to remind everyone that all participants online have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Dana Nolan to begin.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, Paula. Good morning and welcome to Regions\u2019 second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer will review highlights of our second quarter year-over-year financial performance; and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the details compared to the prior quarter. Other members of the management are also present and available to answer questions.","A copy of the slide presentation referenced throughout this call, as well as our earnings release and earnings supplement are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","I\u2019d also like to caution you that we will make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risk and uncertainties and we\u2019ll also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, as well as GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are detailed in our SEC filings.","I will now turn the call over to Grayson.","Grayson Hall","Thank you, Dana. Good morning and thank you for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying that, we\u2019re pleased with our second quarter results, which demonstrate that we are continuing to execute our strategic plan with a long-term sustainable growth, while delivering value to our customers, communities and shareholders.","For the quarter, earnings available to common shareholders from continuing operations increased 18% to $301 million, and earnings per share increased 25% to $0.25 compared to the second quarter of 2016. Importantly by expanding our customer base, we delivered results in areas we believe are fundamental to future income generation. This is evidenced by growth in checking accounts, households, credit cards, and wealth manager relationships, as well as total assets under management.","We continue to benefit from our asset sensitive balance sheet, as interest rate increases drove a 4% increase and net interest income year-over-year, and the resulting net interest margin increased 17 basis points. Expenses remain well controlled with adjusted non-interest expenses increasing 1% year-over-year, as our efficiency efforts continue to mitigate core expense inflation and the impact of investments in new initiatives.","As it relates to our loan portfolio, we remain focused on our deliberate and intentional diversification strategy, while we also seek to achieve appropriate risk adjusted returns. We are experiencing success with our remixing efforts. For example, we were early movers to reduce exposure in certain asset classes, including auto and multifamily lending.","While our customers remain optimistic, many still do not have the confidence necessary to make meaningful investments and take on additional debt. That said, we are seeing some positive signs. For example, we experienced solid loan production increases across most loan portfolios during the second quarter, and we fully expect this momentum to continue through the second-half of the year.","In the near-term, our interest rate sensitivity profile continues to position us well to grow net interest income even in the absence of meaningful loan growth aided in part by the strength of our deposit franchise.","With respect to asset quality, our discipline approach to credit continues to deliver positive results, as we reported improvements in almost every credit metric. We continue to characterize overall credit quality stable. However, volatility from quarter-to-quarter and certain credit metrics can be expected, especially as it relates to large dollar commercial credits.","Turning to capital deployment, we remain committed to achieving our long-term targets. We are focused on effectively deploying our capital through organic growth, strategic investments to increase revenue or reduce ongoing expenses, while also returning an appropriate amount of capital to our shareholders. We continue to benefit from the robust capital planning process that we\u2019ve developed over a number of years, as evidenced by our recent CCAR results, where our planned capital actions once again received no objection.","As part of the capital plan, our Board has authorized the share repurchase program of up to $1.47 million of common stock beginning in the third quarter. Subject to Board approval, plan includes 29% increase in Regions quarterly common stock dividend and $0.09 per share beginning in the third quarter.","During the quarter, Regions was recognized by Javelin Strategy & Research as a Trust in Banking Leader award winner, reflecting our reliability in meeting customers\u2019 needs and the confidence our customers have in Regions to look out for their best interests. In addition, Regions also received the Gallup Great Workplace Award for the third consecutive year. These examples illustrate how Regions\u2019 comprehensive approach to providing financial services creates greater value for all of our stakeholders.","In summary, our second quarter results reflect a continued execution of our strategic plan and our commitment to our three primary initiatives: growing and diversifying; practicing disciplined expense management; and effectively deploying our capital.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to David to cover details of the second quarter.","David Turner","Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s get started with the balance sheet and take a look at average loans. In the second quarter, average loan balances remained relatively stable at $80.1 billion. Average balances in the consumer lending portfolio totaled $31.1 billion, a decline of $87 million. Consumer production increased 22%, but this growth was offset by the company\u2019s decision to exit the third-party arrangement within the indirect vehicle portfolio.","Excluding this runoff, average consumer loans increased approximately $140 million over the first quarter. Average indirect vehicle balances declined $201 million, or 5% during the quarter. Run-off in the third-party portfolio up $224 million, was partially offset by an increase of $23 million in our dealer financial services portfolio.","The third-party portfolio is expected to decline between $500 million and $600 million on a full-year average basis during 2017. Average mortgage balances increased $168 million, or 1% consistent with seasonal increases typically experienced in the second quarter. We expect mortgage production in the second-half of the year to be comparable with the first-half of the year, despite additional declines in refinancing activity.","Historically, our mortgage production mix has been weighted more heavily to home purchase versus refinancing activity, and enhancements to our online home loan direct mortgage channel will continue to provide a modest increase in production. Average home equity balances decreased $131 million, or 1%. Growth in average home equity loans of $52 million was offset by a decline of $183 million in average home equity lines of credit.","Further, average line utilization decreased 66 basis points compared to the first quarter. Although, home equity balances are declining, the risk profile of the portfolio has improved significantly.","We eliminated the interest-only option last year and today approximately 64% of total balances are in a first lien position. We also continue to have success with our other indirect lending portfolio, which includes point-of-sale lending initiatives. This portfolio increased $64 million, or 7% linked-quarter on an average basis.","In addition, at the end of the second quarter, we purchased approximately $138 million of unsecured consumer loans, which are included in our other indirect lending portfolio. And we will continue to explore additional opportunities to further expand this portfolio. Average balances in our consumer credit card portfolio remained relatively stable with the prior quarter, as the number of active cards increased approximately 2%, helping to offset a seasonal decline in outstanding balances.","Turning to the business lending portfolio, average balances totaled $49 billion in the second quarter, an increase of $19 million, as growth in commercial and industrial was partially offset by declines in owner occupied commercial real estate and investor real estate construction loans.","As Grayson mentioned, we experienced solid production increases during the second quarter, with commercial and investor real estate loan production increasing 56% and 35%, respectively. In addition, commercial line utilization increased 20 basis points and commitments for new loans increased approximately $700 million from the previous quarter.","Growth in average commercial and industrial loans was led by new or expanded relationships in government and institutional banking, asset-based lending, financial services, and the real estate investment trust portfolios.","However, this growth continues to be offset as we produce exposure in certain instances. For example, average direct energy loans decreased $67 million, or 3% during the quarter and now represent less than 2.5% of total loans outstanding. Average medical office building loans decreased $40 million, or 12%.","In addition, investor real estate construction loans decreased $41 million, due in part to our ongoing efforts to better diversify production between construction and term lending. While production is improving, the declines in average owner occupied commercial real estate loans reflect the continued softness in demand and competition for middle market and small business loans.","We expect to maintain the momentum experienced this quarter through the second-half of the year, with future growth driven in part by the technology and defense, financial services, power and utilities and asset-based lending portfolios.","Let\u2019s take a look at deposits. Total average deposits decreased $478 million less than 1% from the previous quarter, while average low-cost deposits decreased $335 million. Total average deposits in the Consumer segment increased $890 million, or 2% in the quarter. And this growth reflects the unique strength of our retail franchise and the overall health of the consumer.","Average Corporate segment deposits decreased $581 million, or 2% during the quarter impacted by seasonal declines in public funds deposits. Average deposits in the Wealth Management segment declined $496 million, or 5%, as a result of ongoing strategic reductions of collateralized deposits. Certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits, which require collateralization by securities continued to shift out of deposits and into other fee income-producing customer investments.","Average deposits in the other segment decreased $291 million, or 8%, driven primarily by declines in average retail brokered sweep deposits. We will continue to manage and optimize our overall deposit base in the context of our balance sheet growth.","Let\u2019s take a look at the composition of our deposit base. Second quarter deposit costs remained low at 15 basis points and total funding costs were 34 basis points, illustrating our deposit advantage. As a reminder, our deposit base is more heavily weighted toward retail customers. Approximately, 74% of average interest bearing deposits and 53% of average interest free deposits are considered retail.","In addition, we have a loyal customer base, as more than 44% of our consumer low-cost deposits have been deposit customers at Regions for more than 10 years. And finally, approximately 50% of our deposits come from MSAs with less than 1 million people and approximately 35% from MSAs with less than 500,000 people, both are in the top quartile versus our peer group.","It\u2019s for these reasons, we believe that our deposit base is a key component of our franchise value and is a competitive advantage, in particular, in a rising rate environment. So let\u2019s look at how this impacted our results.","Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $904 million in the second quarter, an increase of $23 million, or 3% from the first quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.32%, an increase of 7 basis points. Both net interest margin and net interest income benefited from several factors during the quarter, including higher interest rates and favorable credit-related interest recoveries.","Further, one additional day in the quarter benefited net interest income by approximately $5 million, but negatively impacted net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points.","Looking forward to the third quarter, we expect continued growth in net interest income, net interest margin will be stable to up modestly, and this includes the negative impact of one additional day in the quarter and the potential need to issue debt in the near-term.","Non-interest income increased $15 million, or 3% in the quarter. This included the recognition of $5 million deferred gain associated with the sale of affordable housing mortgage loans that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 and an operating lease impairment charge of $7 million recorded during the second quarter, compared to $5 million impairment charge recorded in the first quarter.","When indications of possible impairment arise, we evaluate the current value of operating lease assets and record impairment charges when necessary. These impairment charges are recorded as reductions to other non-interest income. Adjusted non-interest income increased $9 million, or 2% in the quarter, driven primarily by increases in capital markets income and bank-owned life insurance.","Capital markets income increased $6 million, or 19%, as increases in fees generated from Fannie Mae DUS real estate placements and merger and acquisition advisory services were partially offset by declines in revenues associated with debt underwriting and loan syndications. Bank-owned life insurance increased $3 million, as a result of higher claim benefits.","Mortgage production increased 25% during the quarter, while mortgage income remained relatively stable within total mortgage production, 80% was related to purchase activity and 20% was related to refinancing. An increase in mortgage servicing income was offset by modest spread compression and lower hedging gain.","During the quarter, we completed the purchase of rights to service $2.7 billion of mortgage loans. And including this transaction, we have purchased the rights to service more than $15 billion of mortgage loans over the past four years. And looking ahead, increased servicing income is expected to help offset the impact of lower refinancing volumes.","Looking forward, we expect a pickup in capital markets revenue along with modest growth in wealth management, mortgage and card and ATM fees to contribute to overall growth in adjusted non-interest income during the second-half of the year.","Let\u2019s take a look at expenses. Total non-interest expenses increased 4% during the quarter. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $899 million, an increase of $27 million, or 3% compared to the first quarter. Total salaries and benefits increased $19 million and included $10 million associated with a pension settlement charge.","Excluding the pension settlement charge, salaries and benefits increased $9 million, or 2% and included a full quarter\u2019s impact of merit increases, as well as increases in production-based incentives. These increases were partially offset by lower payroll taxes and a modest decline in staffing levels.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect higher production-based incentives commensurate with revenue growth. However, we expect total salaries and benefits to decline as pension and settlement charges are not expected to repeat at this level. Professional and legal expenses increased $6 million during the quarter, primarily due to an increase in legal settlement expense.","Furniture and equipment expense increased $5 million, primarily associated with capital investment projects, including an enhanced online banking platform and other technology initiatives. As these are now included in our run rate, we expect furniture and equipment expense to remain approximately this level for the remainder of the year.","The second quarter adjusted efficiency ratio increased 50 basis points to 63.2% and includes the impact of the pension settlement and operating lease impairment charges. These charges negatively impacted the adjusted efficiency ratio by 100 basis points during the quarter. And despite the negative impact of these charges, we continue to expect the full-year adjusted efficiency ratio to be approximately 62%. With respect to taxes, the effective tax rate improved 90 basis points in the quarter to 29.5%.","Now shifting to asset quality, net charge-offs totaled $68 million in the second quarter, a 32% improvement over the first quarter and represented 34 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $20 million less than net charge-offs. A reduction in non-performing and criticized loans resulted in an allowance for loan and lease losses decline of 3 basis points to 1.3% of total loans outstanding.","The allowance for loan and lease losses associated with the direct energy loan portfolio increased to 6.9% in the quarter, compared to 6.1% in the first quarter, reflecting a specific reserve increase related to one oilfield service credit. Total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale decreased $181 million, or 18% to 1.03% of loans outstanding, driven by broad-based improvement in commercial loans.","Total business services criticized loans decreased 7% and total delinquencies decreased 5%. The improvement in criticized loans was primarily due to declines in energy and transportation and warehousing loans. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non-accrual loans, or coverage ratio was 127% at quarter-end.","Excluding energy, the coverage ratio increased from 135% to 163% in the second quarter. Total direct energy charge-offs were $18 million during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $31 million.","Let\u2019s move on to capital and liquidity. During the quarter, we repurchased $125 million, or 9.1 million shares of common stock and declared $84 million in dividends to common shareholders, resulting in 70% of earnings being returned to shareholders. At the same time, our capital ratios remained robust. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 capital ratio was estimated at 12.% and the fully phased in common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at a 11.3%.","And finally, our liquidity position remains solid, with a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 82%, and we were fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule as of quarter-end. As Grayson mentioned, we are pleased with our CCAR results and remain committed to prudently investing in our businesses for future growth, as well as returning an appropriate level of capital to our shareholders.","Turning to our outlook for the balance of 2017, our expectations remain essentially unchanged from last quarter. Excluding the impact of our third-party indirect vehicle portfolio, we expect full-year average loans to be flat to slightly down compared to the prior year. However, looking ahead, we expect to modestly grow average and ending loans on a sequential linked-quarter basis over the second-half of the year.","We expect full-year average deposit balances to be relatively stable with the prior year. We expect net interest income another financing income growth of 3% to 5% and full-year adjusted non-interest income growth of 1% to 3%.","Total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2017 are expected to increase between zero and 1%, and we remain committed to achieving a full-year adjusted efficiency ratio of approximately 62%, with positive adjusted operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range. We now expect the full-year effective tax rate in the 30% to 31% range, and we expect full-year net charge-offs to remain in the 35 to 50 basis points range.","So in summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter results and remain focused on continuing to execute our strategic plan to drive growth and shareholder value.","With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, David. Before we begin the Q&A, as a courtesy to others, please limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning. We will now open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Grayson Hall","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. One, I appreciate all the detail on deposits composition that you gave us. And I\u2019m just wondering in the context of your loan-to-deposit ratio, 82%, can you just give us a sense as to where you\u2019re anticipating? What levers you can pull to drive the deposit growth to continue to fund the loan growth? And are you thinking about that loan-to-deposit ratio staying flat, or are you comfortable having it migrate higher?","Grayson Hall","Yes, I mean, I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll ask David to add to it. One, we\u2019ve had a very thoughtful and prescriptive deposit strategy. And if you look at our deposit composition over the last two or three years, you\u2019ve seen us really drive to create greater diversity in that portfolio, more granularity and less cost And you\u2019ve seen us execute a strategy, where we\u2019ve reduced some of our highest cost deposits. We\u2019ve reduced a substantial amount of deposits that require securities for collateralization. And so we\u2019re very proud of the deposit base we put together. And as rates have started rising, you look at the deposit betas that we\u2019ve been able to learn and we feel good about that.","We think the big part of the value, this franchise is a strength of our deposit base. We would actually like to see our loan-to-deposit ratio improve, go up, if you will. We believe that we\u2019ve got the capability and the capacity to fund a great deal of our growth with deposits throughout the communities we operate in.","David Turner","Yes, Betsy, I want to add a couple of things. We don\u2019t focus on trying to get to any particular loan deposit ratio. We believe the core of any bank franchise is the ability to attract and retain low-cost core deposit and we are very good at that. Regardless of if our loan-to-deposit ratio was even lower, we send a message to the field every day, all day about attracting low-cost core deposit. That\u2019s just so fundamental to our profitability.","That being said, we would love to have those deposits deployed in the loan book versus somewhere else, securities or otherwise. And we\u2019re looking to grow loans as is prudent. And we did a little better this quarter, we\u2019ll talk about loans in a minute. But we have good core funding. We\u2019re ready to grow loans, but we\u2019re not going to force it. We\u2019re going to take what\u2019s out there. Our teams are working hard to grow appropriately, and again, we\u2019re not trying to solve for a given ratio.","Grayson Hall","Yes, I mean, we\u2019ve made a very conscious effort to do \u2013 take a different risk appetite on certain of our lending segments, energy and multifamily, medical office building. You\u2019ve seen us do that in auto lending as well. We\u2019ve made some risk changes into our equity lending products that take risk off of that.","So we\u2019ve been very thoughtful about what part of our lending portfolio we want to grow. And we feel like, we\u2019ve sort of remixed, both our deposit and our loan balance sheet. So we think, we\u2019re in a very good position to grow. As we said earlier in our prepared remarks, we had over a 20% increase in consumer lending production this quarter and over 50% increase in our commercial lending production. So we think that second-half of the year, we can see much improved numbers.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. That makes sense. I was just \u2013 I really like the detail on ID and how much of that is coming retail. And I just \u2013 when I heard your comment about the outlook for issuing some debt, I was a little confused there. Are you looking to hold the LDR flat and issue debt to fund growth? But maybe there\u2019s a different reason why you\u2019re issuing the debt, if you could just explain a little bit?","David Turner","Yes, that\u2019s a great question, because we\u2019re really talking about holding the company debt versus bank debt. We \u2013 the liquidity profile of the bank is in great shape, as we just mentioned. We do have some corporate needs too at the holding company that that we need to take care of. The exact timing of that not sure, which quarter that will hit in. It likely be towards the end of the year.","So I don\u2019t know that there will be a whole lot of impact from that this year could be some. But the general corporate purposes include things like our share buyback too that we had to think through how we fund that. So that\u2019s really what it\u2019s about.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And so it\u2019s more on optimization of capital structure as opposed to any kind of regulatory request?","David Turner","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And do you have a sense of the size of the debt issuance?","David Turner","We\u2019ve talked about anywhere from $750 to $1 billion range that we would be looking at.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, John.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes to the outlook for the margin next quarter stable to up modestly. And what are some of the underlying assumptions for your NII and NIM guidance for the year?","David Turner","Yes, sure. So before we get to NIM, which is at the result what we talked about NII. So we believe we can continue to grow NII. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that we had good production from a loan standpoint. We expect loan growth to be more robust in the second-half of the year than it was in the first-half of the year.","We\u2019ve done a good job of controlling our deposit cost. Our deposit costs were up 1%, call that at 10% beta. Thus far, we\u2019re not been able see, it\u2019s been among the lowest of our peer group. And it really gets back to all the discussion we had on our deposit franchise and our beta and our core accrual smaller markets that we get deposits from.","So we think that \u2013 the curves helped a little bit. I would tell you on the corporate side, LIBOR starts to move before increases happened. So we did get the June increase. The commercial side of that started to reflect it earlier, because LIBOR moved in advance. We do pickup a little bit more on the consumer side their prime base.","Kudos in terms of the probability of the December rate increase, it\u2019s not very high from a profitability standpoint right this minute. But as the market starts to anticipate that LIBOR to move too, I think our outlook really takes into account today\u2019s boards.","From a NIM standpoint, we did have 2 basis points that came through NIM this past quarter on recoveries \u2013 credit recoveries. We had guided a three to five. Last quarter, we ended up with seven and the two points really came from that. We don\u2019t forecast those recoveries if they happen, they happen. And so that\u2019s a little piece of the disconnect, where you\u2019re trying to figure out why it\u2019s stable to up modestly.","You also have to look at where we are. I mean, we have a \u2013 on a relative basis to our peers, a pretty strong NIM. And when we have the curve, it\u2019s pretty flat. So the profitability of what goes on relative to our existing NIM is even harder. So you don\u2019t see quite the expansion that we\u2019ve had. But if you take out the 2 points that I just mentioned, we should see growth similar to what we saw in the last quarter.","John McDonald","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just as a follow-up, David, wanted to ask about your updated thoughts on normalizing the equity base and getting that CET 1 to the 9.5% you talked about. I think earlier in the year, you were talking maybe end of 2018, early 2019 getting there. I was wondering if the successful CCAR and the big ask to help you get there faster, or just reinforce your confidence about getting to that target?","David Turner","Yes, we put in a plan to get down to that 9.5% by the end of 2018. We\u2019ve mentioned numerous times, we can\u2019t quite get there. We don\u2019t think, at least, it depends on what loan growth looks like over that period of time. We\u2019ll get close. We had anticipated, of course, we knew what our ask was at that time. We just are reluctant about sharing anything specific until our regulatory supervisors have an opportunity to object or not object.","And so we\u2019re confident at the submission even though we didn\u2019t know. And we\u2019re confident, we can get to that 9.5 in due time and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to get to our 12% to 14% return on tangible common by then as well. So everything is coming together, as we planned. As we stated in the Investor Day over a year-and-a-half ago, we feel very good about where we\u2019re marching towards that goal at this point in time.","John McDonald","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. Overall credit quality was quite good. I did notice an increase in the commercial TDRs. And apologies, if I missed, any opening comment on that, but what drove that rise?","Grayson Hall","No, I mean, I think, what you saw this quarter is that, we\u2019ve characterized our credit quality as stable. We continue to believe that. There\u2019s some volatility from quarter-to-quarter. And then the granularity of that portfolio isn\u2019t quite as small as we\u2019d like. So one or two credits can make a difference and TDRs, that\u2019s the case. There\u2019s one or two energy credits. But I\u2019ll ask Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer to expand on that.","Barb Godin","Thank you, Grayson. And that\u2019s exactly what it was. It\u2019s a small handful few energy credits and an ag credit on the energy side. Of course, we\u2019ve just finished or in the midst of finishing our spring borrowing base redetermination. So there\u2019s some of that and working with out oilfield services. So nothing systemic at all. And in fact, I think that number you will start to see it move down through the balance of the year as well based on what we know.","Grayson Hall","Thank you, Barb.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. The investor community seems to be losing a little bit of faith in terms of the revenue outlook for the industry generally, as the year has progressed. And I\u2019m wondering, as you think about your efficiency target first sub-60% for next year \u2013 for the full-year of next year. Is there enough sort of as you look out on the budget and the expense pipeline to continue to support that target even if sort of the rate outlook once again is maybe a little bit short of what we thought it was going to be to begin the year?","Grayson Hall","Well, Erika, we -- clearly, we can\u2019t bet on rates. We\u2019ve got to maintain a very disciplined, very rigorous expense management program. We\u2019re absolutely committed to that, we don\u2019t believe. We believe that\u2019s fundamentally the right thing for us to be doing in a low-rate, low-growth economy. We continue to press hard on a number of fronts to make sure that we\u2019re delivering on that.","As David said earlier, our personnel expenses quarter-over-quarter, our staffing relatively flat, but we had to absorb merit increases. And also I guess year-over-year, we\u2019re down a little over 300 positions. We have tried to structurally change our expense base and continue to do that. I\u2019m going to ask John Owen, if you\u2019ll speak for just a moment. We continue to rationalize our branch franchise and recently made some announcements that further complete some commitments we made at Investor Day year-and-a-half ago about what we\u2019re going to on branch closures. So, John?","John Owen","Good morning. This week we announced consolidation of 22 additional branches. At Investor Day, we made a commitment that we would consolidate between 100 and 150 branches and we\u2019ve got to about 160 right now. Over the last 10 years from our peak between 127 branches is where we peaked. We\u2019re down now about 1,500. So overall, we\u2019re down about 30%.","David Turner","And we\u2019re delivering on that 150, which is now at 260, a year early.","John Owen","Right.","David Turner","And so, I mean, I just used that as an example of where not only we\u2019re trying to reduce expenses, but we\u2019re trying to accelerate the pace of that expense management activity.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And as we look forward \u2013 this is a follow-up to John\u2019s line of questioning. Clearly, best-in-class in terms of total payout, as we look forward over the next couple of years, how are you balancing the preference between dividends and buybacks? And over the medium-term, what\u2019s a more normalized dividend payout ratio for your bank and given how \u2013 what you observed of your CCAR results?","David Turner","Yes. So it\u2019s a great question. Clearly, we \u2013 it\u2019s critical that we get our common equity Tier 1 and other ratios to follow along with that to an appropriate level of capital for our company and optimized best we can, both in common and preferred \u2013 common items like preferred And I think that we can do that over this fairly short period of time. As you optimize your capital based on the risk within your balance sheet, we do start leaning more towards a higher percentage of our income being paid out in a full dividend.","So we had as files our ratio in the 30% to 40% range, that\u2019s moving up in the 35% to 45% range. As time goes, we\u2019ll refine that as well. But I would think that right now based on where we are in the 35% to 45%, would seem to be a reasonable dividend payout ratio for us.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Grayson Hall","Good morning.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I want to ask a question on expenses. David, good control again if you take the $909 and then you add the two $10 million items. So if we\u2019re starting it somewhere in the 90-ish type of range, which is, I think around the zone that you had kind of spoken to as possible in the past. Can you just give us an understanding of just seasonality and just and growth from here? How well can you kind of control, given the points you made earlier about the branch plan and other initiatives? Can you keep them pretty tight from here?","David Turner","Yes, Ken, it\u2019s a great question, and you did the math exactly right. So you\u2019re \u2013 take that $899 and back out the settlement fees, you get closer to another items you mentioned, you get about where our run rate is. Clearly, we are intently focused on managing our expense base. Grayson mentioned revenue is challenged. Erika brought up revenue being challenged. We get that. We\u2019re not counting on rates to bail us out. And as a result, we are focused on everything expense-related from people, process, technology. And right now, we think that that run right that you mentioned is fairly accurate for us for the remainder of this year.","Ken Usdin","Got it. And to your point about adjusting to revenues, last year you had talked about the 300 program, you up that to 400, but you kind of rolled out the timeline of that two. Are there things within the program that you could bring forward if you needed to? So I know you\u2019re focused on it. But how much of that is \u2013 how much optionality is there around timing of those expected saves that you have for \u2013 over the time?","David Turner","Yes, as you know, about 60% \u2013 a little over 60% of our \u2013 or right at 60% of o our total expenses is compensation-related. So if you\u2019re going to move the meter on expenses, you\u2019re going to move it based on that. And so being able to \u2013 we have natural attrition as every company does, takes care of a piece of that, trying to change processes up quicker than we otherwise would have done to the piece of that not having to backfill people that attrit is important.","As John mentioned, the branch consolidation, so we\u2019ve put 22 on the Board and maybe we don\u2019t consolidate quite at the pace that we have done in the recent history. We continue to look at our retail footprint in terms of consolidations and additions. So for us managing expenses all about optimizing everything that we do and we have a pretty high sense of urgency to get that done.","So we\u2019re going to look to bring forward as much as we can. Again, our goal is focusing on getting our return by the end of 2018 in that range of 112% to 14% and expense management is a critical piece of that.","Ken Usdin","Es, understood Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Good morning. On the efficiency ratio and operating leverage, I know you gave the 2017 expectation of 62% and 2% to 4%. I\u2019m wondering, where do you think that could go for 2018 just given the progress you\u2019ve made on the expense front? I mean, do you think you can get to a 60% level or anything like that in 2018 without the help of rates? And we\u2019re \u2013 or conversely how about with the help of rate? Just curious where you think you you could go?","Grayson Hall","Yes, I think that\u2019s kind of where Erika was going with her question too, And clearly, rates matter to the extent that we don\u2019t get increases that we had anticipated that puts a lot more pressure on it \u2013 on us being able to get there. But as we\u2019re talking through all these questions, if the revenue is not there, then it\u2019s going to cause us to have to put even more pressure on our expense base, because we have certain goals that we want to meet and makes it more challenging, makes it more difficult.","I can\u2019t say an absolute right now for 2018. We\u2019re in the middle of our strategic planning process, and of course, roll out a new budget towards the end of the year, we\u2019ll give you better guidance into 2018. But we\u2019re committed to doing best we can to get \u2013 ultimately, we believe to be in the 60%, even over time, we think below that.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Thanks, David. And then on the credit side, quick one there. The \u2013 I know you bled the reserve about 7 basis points or so this quarter to about 1.26, I believe, in terms of ratio to loan. Curious where you think that to go? Could it go a little lower, I believe, the industry is maybe a little bit below that, but just want to get your thought?","Barb Godin","John, it\u2019s Barb Godin. Yes, we moved it from 1.3% last quarter to 1.30% this quarter. We are looking at the reserve, as you know, every quarter. And so there is always opportunity for downward movement. A lot of that is dependent on continued improvement as we\u2019ve seen so far in all of our credit metrics and in particular in our energy portfolio.","Grayson Hall","Well, and the composition of the portfolio. All that drives it as we derisk the composition of our portfolio and derisk individual credits within the \u2013 the allowance was done what it ought to do, it\u2019s rationalized to that inherent risk of the portfolio, and we think we continue to see opportunities to improve that.","John Pancari","Okay, thanks. One more, I know you said the beta right now on the deposit side is 10% ballpark. What are your assumptions assumed about where that could go over the next one or two like?","David Turner","Yes. So I\u2019ll give you some parameters. So we don\u2019t really factor in data for the next quarter. But kind of over the next 12 months, our beta assumptions really haven\u2019t changed. They started 40%, end up at 60% at the terminal pass-through. I think a good guide that you might want to have everybody could use is for every 5 data points, it\u2019s about $8 million for us.","So as we get a hike, that could be anywhere from $50 million to $60 million of NII just depending on what happens from a beta standpoint. We do think that the pace of change or pace of rate increases is helpful to keep beta down. But we also are realistic in knowing at some point, we\u2019re going to have to pass-through some of the increase at a faster pace than we have today, which is only 10%. So we think we\u2019re probably a little conservative in terms of our longer-term beta assumption, especially for the next increase or two.","Grayson Hall","Well, I mean, the other side of it is, we\u2019re coming from a relatively low position. And thus far, our industry, our competition has been pretty rational on deposit pricing. But with modest loan growth, there we\u2019re seeing modest economic growth. Then you should anticipate modest betas until a point in time that competition for deposits increases.","John Pancari","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Moss of FBR.","Steve Moss","Good morning. In terms of the loan growth here, it sounds like it\u2019s turning the corner a bit. I was wondering, is this result of pricing or has runoff is getting closer to the bottom here?","Grayson Hall","If you look at the economic recovery, fixed business investment has been really modest throughout the recovery. And we\u2019re \u2013 that\u2019s a combination of confidence and courage and uncertainty. And \u2013 but we saw really good production numbers, particularly in the commercial middle market space last \u2013 this past quarter. And while we still aren\u2019t certain that we\u2019re turning the corner there. We are seeing some encouraging signs and I\u2019ll ask John Turner who runs that business for us to make a few comments, to give you a little bit more detail around it.","John Turner","I think that we are in a better place to begin experiencing the loan growth. I think the derisking activities that we\u2019ve undertaken certainly are beginning to slow a bit. We saw good growth in a couple of different industry sectors. Our pipelines remain stable. When I look at our loss business reporting, we had still about $2.5 billion in opportunities over the last six months that we lost these because of our dissatisfaction with pricing or some sort of structural element, some other structural element, as I said with credit, another $700 million or so related to internal limits that we impose on ourselves to ensure that we have good balance and diversity within our loan portfolio.","So when you think about production being up over 50% quarter-over-quarter, and yet we still have some opportunity in our pipeline through continued \u2013 just good execution. I think, as portfolio mitigation strategies begin to play out and we don\u2019t have the kind of run-off that we have been experiencing, and assuming that we can turn the tide and run off an owner-occupied real estate.","I think we\u2019ll \u2013 we will begin to see some growth particularly as business investment activity, as Grayson suggests, picks up. Our pipelines are pretty stable, economies are still growing slowly in the markets, where we operate. But there are some signs of businesses gaining some confidence, or at least just running out of patience so to speak in deciding they\u2019re going to take some risk that they haven\u2019t been willing to take so far.","Steve Moss","Got you. And then on the derisking subjects here, wondering what\u2019s the prospect of moving your 9.5% target down towards 9% or lower, given your balance sheet profile ahead of next year\u2019s CCAR?","David Turner","Yes, that\u2019s a great question. And I\u2019m glad you brought it up, because that\u2019s not a static number. The 9.5%, we evaluate that all the time. We look at our risk profile. We think through the derisking that we\u2019ve done. That 9.5% could go both ways. I mean, if we put more risk on the balance sheet, because we decide do something else, we\u2019ll hold appropriate capital for it. But if we derisk continue to derisk the 9.5% goes lower than that, and I think it\u2019s incumbent upon us.","We\u2019ve espoused 9.5% and we\u2019ve kind of left it alone at that, because we\u2019re at 11.3. Now let us get the 9%, as we start approaching 9.5%, we\u2019ll give you a better indication as to what \u2013 tighten that up a little bit. But it\u2019ll be over time for us get to that number.","Steve Moss","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Geoffrey.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. It\u2019s another one on capital. If I look at the DFAST release that was about a 70 basis point GAAP between your common equity Tier 1 and your Tier 1 under stress. But if we look at CCAR that increases to about a 140 basis points with the capital actions. So that seems to suggest that there\u2019s about 70 basis points of preferred issuance baked into that. Just wanted to check that math was correct?","David Turner","You did really good math, that\u2019s about where we\u2019ll be we need right at $700 million of preferred over time to bolster our Tier 1, which we\u2019re solving through common equity. So, our capital regime is really about getting the capital down to the appropriate level, but optimizing this fact as well. So we want to solve the common equity Tier 1 with common equity obviously non-common needs to be a component of that, it\u2019s cheaper than our cost of common today and you\u2019ve nailed it.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then, I get clearly that preferred is cheaper than common. But why issue any preferred at all when those capital actions post stress you\u2019re still at 7.4% that\u2019s still a long way ahead of the, I think, it\u2019s a 6% minimum per preferred of the total Tier 1 under stress and CCAR why issue any preferred at all?","David Turner","Well, we won\u2019t. And we will \u2013 we\u2019re going to wait as long as we can, because we don\u2019t want to have the negative carry. And we\u2019ll do that in conjunction with the whole optimization and rightsizing. So timing is critically important to us and we\u2019ve got that timing down path.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then just lastly, are you committed to assuring that now, now that\u2019s gone into the CCAR ask? And barring any resubmission or anything like that, so you kind of balance to issue non-preferred?","David Turner","To the extent that we have \u2013 so our commitment is to have an appropriate amount of capital common equity Tier 1, as well as Tier 1. And if we\u2019re solving Tier 1 with common equity, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s regulatory supervisor that hears that you solve that with that type of capital instrument. So we don\u2019t have to issue of non-common instrument, preferred instrument unless we\u2019re taking our common out as well at the same time. So we\u2019re not forced to have negative periods, where I think we\u2019re going.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thank you very much.","David Turner","Okay.","Operator","I\u2019m sorry, go ahead with your concluding remarks.","Grayson Hall","Well, that\u2019s being our last question, we really appreciate everyone\u2019s time. We thank you for your attendance today. I appreciate your interest in Regions Financial, and look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Our presenters today are our President and Chief Executive Officer, Grayson Hall; our Chief Financial Officer, David Turner. And also here and available to answer questions are Matt Lusco, our Chief Risk Officer; and Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer.","As part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.

Grayson Hall","Thank you, List, and good morning, and welcome to Regions' Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. We certainly appreciate your participation and respect your time.","We view 2012 as a transformational year for Regions, with fourth quarter results reaffirming our positive momentum and providing a solid foundation for the future growth of our franchise. During 2012, we achieved a number of key milestones through the successful execution of our capital and business plans. We completed the Morgan Keegan divestiture. We issued approximately $900 million of common stock, redeemed the preferred stock issued to U.S. Treasury and repurchased the related warrant. We significantly improved asset quality, our risk profile and strength at enterprise risk management.","Our credit ratings improved. We further enhanced our technology platform. We issued $500 million of preferred stock and redeemed $345 million of trust preferred securities. And most importantly, we achieved sustainable profitability.","On a continuing operations basis, full year 2012 net income available to common shareholders was $1.1 billion or $0.76 per diluted share. Lower credit-related expenses, driven by significant improvement in asset quality, benefited 2012's results. Let me point out just a few notable asset quality metrics.","Nonperforming assets, including held for sale, dropped $1.1 billion or 36% year-over-year, the lowest level in 4 years. Net loan charge-offs declined 47% for the full year, the lowest annual level since 2008. In addition, results also reflected successful efforts to expand and deepen customer relationships and increase prudent loan production, strengthen expense management disciplines and improving funding mix and cost. Our emphasis on customer service and customer loyalty, along with enhanced product offerings and delivery channels, enable us to grow and deepen our customer relationship. As a result, noninterest income on an adjusted basis increased despite a number of business headwinds.","Mortgage banking revenue was especially strong in 2012 as mortgage production totaled $8 billion. This includes $1.6 billion in HARP 2-related production. Throughout 2012, approximately 50% of HARP 2 applications involve customers new to Regions mortgage, which allowed us to introduce new customers to Regions Financial and expand our business opportunities across all our lending segments in both wholesale and retail.","Total new and renewed loan production across all customer segments was a strong $57 billion for the full year. New production totaled $28 billion in 2012, up 14% from the prior year. Unfortunately, our strong production results have not yet translated into balance sheet growth as period-end loans outstanding were down, reflecting the continued deleveraging actions of our customers and further derisking of our Investor Real Estate portfolio. However, we did demonstrate favorable balance growth in our Commercial and Industrial portfolio and our indirect auto portfolio. In 2012, we also continued to improve our deposit and funding mix, lowering both average deposit and total funding costs 19 basis points. As a result, we were able to expand our net interest margin 4 basis points for the year despite another challenging year of low interest rates.","From an expense management perspective, full year 2012 expenses, excluding goodwill impairment in 2011, were down 2%, in line with expectations and included net reductions in staffing of about 1% or 280 positions. In the current challenging revenue environment, effective operating expense management is critical. As a result, we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage. At the same time, we must continue to invest appropriately in people, technology and products to ensure that we have the best team, the right technology and competitive products to improve productivity and efficiency.","Again, 2012 was a transformational year for Regions. We've clearly demonstrated that we have a viable business plan in place and that we are successfully executing on that plan to build a strong foundation for prudent, profitable and sustainable growth.","I'll turn it over to David for a discussion of fourth quarter 2012's financial trends. Afterwards, I'll return to spend a few moments discussing 2013 growth opportunities. David?","David J. Turner","Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 3 with a quick snapshot of our fourth quarter 2012 financial results. We reported net income available to common shareholders from continuing operations of $273 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders from continuing operations was $311 million or $0.22 per share. Pretax pre-provision income from continuing operations was $493 million on an adjusted basis. Net interest income was $818 million and the resulting net interest margin was 3.10%. Noninterest revenues were up 1% from the prior quarter, while noninterest expenses were down 2% on an adjusted basis from the prior quarter. And from a credit standpoint, net charge-offs decreased 31% linked quarter, while total loan loss provision was $37 million.","Let's look at some of the details, starting with the balance sheet. Regions experienced continued growth in our Commercial and Industrial and in indirect auto loan portfolios. However, this growth was offset by declines in real estate-related loan portfolios. As a result, average total loans for the fourth quarter were down $1.1 billion or 1.4% linked quarter. That being said, we expect to see growth in loan production and anticipate this production will outpace attrition by the second half of 2013. As a result, based on what we know now, we are projecting loan growth in the low single digits for 2013.","For the quarter, total lending loan balances were primarily impacted by a decline of $991 million or 11.4% in the Investor Real Estate portfolio. At quarter end, Investor Real Estate ending balances stood at $7.7 billion, down $3 billion from 1 year ago. This portfolio now comprises 10% of our total loan portfolio compared to 14% a year ago. We expect this portfolio to continue to decline at a moderate pace over the next couple of quarters and more specifically, we believe that we have approximately $1 billion of Investor Real Estate that we will derisk and then grow from there.","Our owner-occupied commercial real estate portfolio, which is comprised primarily of community banking and small business which tends to exhibit the same behavioral trends as consumers, declined this quarter due to customer deleveraging and lack of demand. Linked quarter, we experienced an average loan decline of $203 million or 1.9%. Although price competition has increased, a majority of the decline was related to prepayments and scheduled paydowns. However, as noted, Commercial and Industrial loan demand remains solid in the fourth quarter, driven in part by our integrated approach to specialized lending where our local bankers work with experienced lenders to meet customer needs.","Total production for this portfolio was a solid $10.4 billion. Pipelines remain solid and are slightly above the same level at this time last year as our clients fund expenditures -- capital expenditures, working capital needs and increasingly, M&A activity. Commitments have increased 4.2% linked quarter and 12.2% from the prior year.","Our consumer services portfolio, which makes up 39% of our total loan portfolio, decreased by $352 million or 1.2% as consumer deleveraging continued. As you may recall from prior quarters, our strategy has been to sell our fixed rate conforming mortgages. Late in the fourth quarter, we began the process of retaining our 15-year fixed rate conforming mortgages, and we believe this strategy supports our overall efforts to grow the balance sheet and effectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk.","Declines in our home equity portfolio continue as customers take advantage of opportunities to refinance. However, we recently launched a new home equity loan product to attract a new set of customers. Results have been encouraging thus far as loan production for lines and loans increased 23% over the prior quarter.","Average indirect auto loan balances increased 6.7% quarter-over-quarter. We expect the indirect portfolio to continue to grow at a steady pace throughout 2013, driven by expansion in the dealer network from approximately 1,900 dealers to 2,400 dealers, as well as by increases in auto sales volume. Total loan yields were up 3 basis points linked quarter to 4.21% primarily due to interest recoveries on nonaccrual loans.","Moving on to deposits. As shown on Slide 5, deposit mix and cost continued to improve in the fourth quarter, and total low cost deposits increased $2.1 billion from last quarter. Time deposits fell to 14% of total deposits, down from 16% linked quarter as a result of our continued success in repricing and growing low cost deposits. This positive repricing and mix shift resulted in deposit cost declining to 22 basis points for the quarter, down 6 basis points from the third quarter, and we expect to drive additional improvement in deposit cost.","Looking ahead to 2013, we currently have $8.3 billion of CDs that will mature. Of that, $5.4 billion matures in the first half with an average rate of 1.51% and $2.9 billion in the second half with an average rate of 53 basis points. This compares to our current average going-on rates for new CDs of approximately 20 basis points. Further, our overall total funding costs improved to 50 basis points, a decrease of 6 basis points linked quarter.","Now let's turn to net interest income on Slide 6. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $831 million or relatively flat linked quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.10%, up 2 basis points from third quarter's 3.08%. We were pleased with the performance of the margin. However, there were some temporary positive impacts from interest recoveries and acceleration of deferred fees related to loan payoffs. Together, these items added about 2 basis points to the margin. So really, you should level set our margin at 3.08%.","However, even without these impacts, margin remains stable and in line with our expectations. Even though the low-rate environment continue to push on portfolio yields, with paydowns and higher-yielding securities being reinvested at today's low levels, that effect was largely offset by the improvements in deposit costs and the lift from our trust preferred securities call.","In a continued low-rate environment, we continue to see opportunity to protect the margin through a number of factors, including continued reduction of deposit costs and our retention of 15-year mortgages. These factors support our outlook for a relatively stable margin in 2013. Of course, a rise in interest rates would further benefit the overall margin and net interest income.","Let's look at noninterest revenue on Slide 7. Fourth quarter noninterest revenue from continuing operations was $536 million, a 1% increase linked quarter, primarily related to an increase in service charge income. Mortgage banking revenue, while down $16 million from the third quarter, remains strong and continues to be driven by new home purchases and refinances aided by the government's HARP 2 program. Approximately 63% of mortgage loans were refinances and 37% were new home purchases. 20% of total loans were HARP 2-related. And importantly, as of the end of the fourth quarter, less than approximately 20% of our loans eligible under the HARP 2 guidelines have been refinanced. As a result, we expect mortgage revenue to remain strong for the next few quarters.","Moving on to expenses on Slide 8. Noninterest expenses totaled $902 million, an increase of 4% linked quarter. However, excluding the expense associated with the termination of a third-party investment in a REIT subsidiary, which I'll speak to shortly, and debt extinguishment cost related to our trust preferred call, noninterest expenses were $849 million, representing a $20 million or 2% decrease over the prior quarter. Additionally, during the quarter, professional and legal expenses benefited from a $20 million decrease in legal reserves.","As we have previously communicated, we remain focused and disciplined on expense management and constantly challenge all of our associates to be mindful of every dollar they spend. Additionally, we expect further improvement in credit-related expenses. As a result, we anticipate 2013 expenses from continuing operations to be below those of 2012.","Let's look at some of our credit metrics on Slide 9. We continue to make progress with respect to asset quality in the fourth quarter as several credit metrics improved, including criticized loans, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. The provision for loan losses was $37 million or $143 million less than net charge-offs. Total net charge-offs decreased linked quarter by 31%, or $82 million, to $180 million. Net charge-offs as a percent of total average loans dropped below 1% for the first time in over 4 years. Inflows of nonperforming loans decreased to $350 million from $463 million linked quarter. Nonperforming loans decreased 11% from prior quarter to $1.7 billion, the lowest level in almost 4 years. In total, nonperforming assets decreased $296 million or 13% linked quarter.","Notably, one of the best and earliest indicators of asset quality, that's Business Services criticized and classified loans, continued to decline, with criticized loans down 12% or $639 million from the third quarter. Our coverage ratios remained solid. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance for nonperforming loans stood at 114% or 1.14x. Meanwhile, our loan loss allowance for loans remained solid at 2.59% at the end of the fourth quarter. And based on what we know today, we expect continued improvement in asset quality going forward.","So let's take a look at capital and liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong as our estimated Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter stood at 12% and our estimated Tier 1 common ratio increased approximately 30 basis points to 10.8%. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, the company successfully issued preferred stock totaling $500 million, and part of the proceeds were used to redeem $345 million of trust preferred securities.","Also in the quarter, we extinguished a $203 million liability associated with an investment by a third party in one of our REITs, and we incurred $42 million pretax, $38 million after-tax and early termination costs. This redemption removed approximately $28 million of associated annual expenses. We will continue to prudently evaluate liability management opportunities as we look to efficiently manage our liquidity, debt and capital positions.","Tangible common book value reached $7.11 per share in the fourth quarter, up from $7.02 in the third quarter, an increase of 1.3%. Based on our interpretation of Basel III, we estimate our pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will be approximately 8.9%. Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company continues to remain solid, with the loan-to-deposit ratio of approximately 78%. Lastly, based on our understanding of the new amendments, Regions remains well positioned to be fully compliant with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio upon its implementation. Overall, this quarter's solid results provide positive momentum as we head into 2013 and provides a foundation for sustainable growth.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Grayson for his closing comments.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Thank you, David. And just let me make a few brief closing comments and then we can open up the lines for your question -- questions.","As I indicated earlier, 2012 was a year of progress for Regions. As we look ahead to 2013, we expect to face a business environment that in many ways resembles the year just completed. The pace of economic recovery continue to be positive but incrementally slower than desired. Our industry, our customers and our economy continue to deal with a substantial level of both global and domestic uncertainty. But overall, our confidence is building.","As a result, we do anticipate a stronger second half in 2013 as the economic and fiscal uncertainty abate and our markets continue to strengthen. The Regions team is focused on growing our customer base and generating positive operating leverage. Our efforts to derisk have begun to moderate. Our expectation is that business should stabilize and begin to grow this year. We have demonstrated growth in some customer segments, such as Commercial and Industrial and indirect auto. Additionally, we have experienced strong growth this year in our mortgage business. But the growth needs to be balanced across all of our lines of business.","We continue to be encouraged by our level of loan production, but we need to begin to realize net growth in our outstandings. Our confidence is growing, and our business continues to strengthen across the organization as we see improved pipelines, applications and originations. We remain disciplined in our efforts to control expenses and continue to see opportunities to improve efficiency. But we are committed to a balanced approach that invest in technology, people and products where the opportunity to grow revenues or improve efficiency exists. Our capital position and capital management process are much improved, and we are committed to returning an appropriate level of capital to our shareholders as our performance dictates, subject to supervisory review.","In closing, our business model is a relationship banking strategy. It works to build deeper and more productive banking relationships by addressing the specific financial needs of our customers. We believe this approach will build shared value for our customers, communities, shareholders and associates.","Now let's open up the line for your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Penala of Bank of America.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is one on your margin outlook. You've spoken in conferences in the past about being open to using some of your excess capital to call some of your long-term debt. I guess the first question is, a, are you still open to that in 2013? And b, does your margin guidance for stability include potentially calling some long-term debt?","David J. Turner","Yes, Erika, this is David. Yes, we have consistently wanted to put ourselves in the position to optimize our balance sheet structure in terms of its costs on the liability side. We've been doing that through our deposit side, as you've seen. And from the debt side, you've seen some of our utilization of our excess capital, if you will, to rightsize and adjust the funding. We do have other opportunities. Without going into specifics, I think if you evaluated what we have outstanding, you could probably glean what would be some potential targets. We do have elements of that, not all, but elements of rightsizing our liability structure baked into our margins. But we want to see how things play out during the year. There's still uncertainty with regards to the economy. So we haven't baked in all the potential opportunities that we do have, but some are.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I'm sure you'll be asked this question several ways, but let me be the first to attempt it. Your adjusted expenses were $3,471 million last -- this past year. And I guess as we're thinking about the magnitude of decline, will it be similar to the 2% decline that you talked about in 2012? Or is there an efficiency ratio that you could point us to as a target? I guess it's the one question I'm getting from investors in terms of magnitude of that outlook.","David J. Turner","Yes, we have not quantified that yet. We kind of gave broad guidance that we would be down in '13 from '12, just like the guidance we gave you last year at this time. Things that we can point to, there is not -- there's no one particular silver bullet in that expense number. If you look at our expense run rate, you'll see that -- actually, our largest expenses end up being salaries and benefits and occupancy, and we think those are 2 areas that we will continue to work on to bring those down even further. Yes, we moved our credit card servicing in-house from paying a third party that we think will have some savings. We talked -- I talked earlier about the savings related to one of our REITs. So again, there's no one place that we can point to, credit-related expenses and others that as we continue to improve nonperforming balances and levels, we have some opportunity there. So I think net-net, we can see that being down. As we get closer and go through the year, perhaps we could put a finer point on that.","O. B. Grayson Hall","And Erika, we've really tried to build a strong expense culture over the last few years and have, to David's point, when you look at our 2 predominant expenses which really have been personnel and also in facilities, we continue to rationalize both. Last year, we were down, on a net basis, some 280 positions. But we actually had added back over double that number that we had added back as we brought in our credit card processing. We had to have a number of people added there, as well as we've added people in risk management. And we -- quite frankly, we've added people, bankers that are in customer-facing positions, but we've been able to offset that through efficiencies in other parts of the company. We invested an awful lot in technology in our branches to improve the efficiency of that entire branch channel. We continue to think branches are an important part of our distribution strategy, but we're trying to rationalize the expense of that channel to try and improve the efficiency of that channel. But as David said, our expense strategy -- expense management strategy is really not a branded program, but it's just a way of making sure that we've got a strong culture that is focused on efficiency and improvement across all of our businesses and continues to look for ways to reduce our overall expenses. And we did that successfully in '12. We believe we'll be successful again in '13 and have guided to that point.","David J. Turner","Erika, I should have added, you asked about targets. We think we can have an overhead ratio still in that mid 50 to upper 50 range. So we still have some work to go...","O. B. Grayson Hall","Over time, over time.","David J. Turner","Over time. And of course, we need -- revenue is a component of that, too, and we need more revenue to get us to those levels.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin St. Pierre of Sanford Bernstein.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","As we think about potential capital return and the CCAR process, you're over 1 percentage point higher on Basel I Tier 1 common than you were the last go around in the CCAR in Basel III, but your estimate seems to be already where it would need to be, if not higher. Could you talk to us about your capital plan and what your capital return priorities would be?","David J. Turner","Sure, Kevin. We like to be in this position a lot more than going into where we were a year or so ago, which gives us an opportunity to do different things. Honestly, we would like to use, first and foremost, our capital base to grow organically. We think we -- as I mentioned, we think we can grow our loan book in '13, but that's really number one. Number two, we do believe that we have a capital base and profitability where we're accreting capital that allows us to return more to the shareholders than we have in the past. We, as you know, submitted our capital plan in the first part of January, and we'll be discussing that with our regulatory supervisors. So it's a little too early to be able to talk about what that looks like. But having an appropriate return to the shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks clearly is something that we think makes some sense. As you know, we've acquired our credit card portfolio about 1.5 years ago. We look for opportunities with asset classes like that to use our capital as well. So that's kind of the 4 things that we really think about in terms of positioning ourselves from a capital standpoint. We do know and acknowledge where we are with regards to Basel III and our Tier 1 common under Basel I, and we think that gives us optimal flexibility to work with our shareholders and to grow our company.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And similar question on the loan loss reserve side. You've got, no matter how we look at it, whether it's reserves to NPLs or reserves to annualize charge-offs, high levels. How -- do you think that there is a floor to the reserve to loan or reserve to NPL levels? Or how much of that can we expect to see flowing through earnings in 2013?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Kevin, this is Grayson, and I'll make a few comments and I'll ask Matt and Barb if they'd like to comment on this. But we try to stay very disciplined through our process. We've had a methodology that we've been following on calculating our allowance. It's a very analytical process, and we've been competent in that process. We continue to believe that as credit improves, that you'll see that allowance moderate closer to what peers have given the relative mix in our portfolio. If you saw this quarter, continued improvement. And absent any economic shocks that we don't anticipate today, we think that, that pace of recovery continues. That being said, we have to let our process work and we have to be very disciplined in that regard. Matt? Barb?","C. Matthew Lusco","Yes, the only other thing I'd add is, I think as we've stated before, we don't -- we certainly do not see levels of reserves sinking to the levels they once were, something that once upon a time, when there was a 1% of outstanding type range. We think that will settle out industry-wide at a floor that's something north of probably 1.5%. So I think times have changed in that regard. And of course, in a FASB statement out there, that we certainly don't anticipate coming into play for quite a while, but I think it does show prevailing changes of thought as it relates to where levels of reserve go. Certainly, I concur with everything Grayson said about our methodology and it's consistent application. And that methodology and our processes, together with the pace of our improvement, will dictate those reserves as we go forward.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Barb, anything you'd like to add?","Barbara Godin","Nothing to add.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James.","Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a clarification, if I could, on the expense guidance. Are you going off the adjusted number? I'm sorry if I missed it, the $3.471 million?","David J. Turner","That's right. That's an example.","Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then I noticed the headcount was actually up a little bit this quarter. Was that just more seasonal in nature? Or can you just give some color there?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, I mean, you saw headcount's up just a little bit this quarter sort of as we sort of transforming, if you will, a little bit to more of a growth strategy for '13. We added a few bankers in that regard, but you'll see that moderate some as we get into the year, as we drive some efficiency out of some other areas.","Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one final question, if I could, on the thoughts on share buyback. Now your stock is trading above tangible book value, does that kind of change at all your mindset around buybacks versus dividends?","David J. Turner","Well, Michael, I think that as -- we've gotten this question before. Clearly, when you're trading below or at tangible book value, that makes you think one way the higher you trade on that from a share buyback, you have a tendency to question that leaning in another direction. That being said, we're still trading closer to tangible book value. And if you look at our embedded cost of equity, it's still high. So you think about the return that you get from an investment kind of buyback compared to where you're going to put that marginal dollar, and that kind of informs us as well. Again, we've submitted our plan in January. I guess our industry is not quite as dynamic as we once were to take advantage of what market forces are, and that's just the way it is today. That being said, we think we'll have an appropriate return to our shareholders, and we'll be releasing that information at the end of March.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just some thoughts on the timing of when loans might bottom out or maybe how much they go down before... I mean, you mentioned some growth in the back half of the year. Just any sense of how much more runoff, and not to pinpoint 2Q or 3Q, but any more clarity around the trajectory of loans would be helpful.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, I mean, Matt, if you look at our loan growth last year, our loans period end to period end were down about $3.6 billion. 3 of that was in the Investor Commercial Real Estate portfolio. It has been -- in terms of trying to forecast that runoff, it's really been driven largely by the improvement in the economy and the availability of credit elsewhere for some of these distressed credits. And so the runoff for '13 was faster than -- I mean, for '12, for '12, was faster than we had early in the year forecast. And as you probably are aware, when we got into the fourth quarter of 2012, there were a number of decisions being made in anticipation of tax code changes that created a sense of urgency around resolving some of these more distressed credits, and so we saw some special activity there. So all that being said, the runoff in that portfolio was a little faster than we'd anticipated in '12. We see it today moderating in '13 and moderating from a couple regards. One is we think that we got the number of distressed credits in that portfolio down to a level that we believe most of our runoff in that portfolio will come in the first half of the year. The second issue is in 2011, in Investor Commercial Real Estate, we did about $1 billion of production. In '12, we did $2 billion. So we more than doubled the production in that portfolio, in that customer segment. We're encouraged by the early signs we see in '13, so we think we'll have a good '13. So we think we'd start to see stabilization in that portfolio by midyear '13. That being said is that our forecast -- the accuracy of being able to forecast that is challenging, but we believe that's where we think we are today.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the net interest margin, they're relatively stable, I guess, that'd be versus the 3.08% quarter [ph]...","David J. Turner","Yes, that's right. That's 1 or 2 points either side of that.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. And then is that just relatively steady throughout the year? I mean, you've got it -- with the CDs coming due and obviously there's some seasonality in 1Q, I mean, there's some pluses and minuses, but relatively stable throughout the year?","David J. Turner","That's right. There's obviously more challenges early given where the 10-year is, and we do forecast a low but slightly improving rate towards the back half. So it gets a little bit more expansive, potentially expansive in the back half. So the first half is more challenging on that comment, but we still think we can maintain stability even then.","O. B. Grayson Hall","We do have a number of time deposits maturing in the first and second quarter, and those maturities are more heavily weighted towards the end of first quarter than the first part of first quarter. So we do think that while we indicate a stable margin throughout the year, our forecast would say that, that stability is easier to come by later in the year than early. But we still believe we're going to be able to achieve a fairly stable margin. The part that we can't forecast is as we get resolutions on distressed credits, many times we get the benefit of interest recovery, which aids our margin like you saw what happened this quarter, gave us about 2 basis points of benefit and those come when they come, and so you can't predict them. But we would anticipate through the year, in all likelihood, we'll see some repeat of that activity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Grayson, I just wanted to follow on the last question there and just expand it a little bit to just the average earning asset side of things. So understanding you'll have some loan growth, but as you just mentioned, you do have quite a bit of the CD book running off. You've got some of the long-term debt as well. So can you just talk to us about how the earning asset progression goes as well? Does it continue to also decline? How do you mix shift different categories of the asset side as loans do start to grow from a period end perspective?","David J. Turner","Yes, Ken, this is David. You should expect to see some modest reduction in earning assets throughout the year, but that, from a margin standpoint, gets taken care of because of what you mentioned, change in mix of our balance sheet, whether it'd be from the liability side or the asset side. Things like on the asset side, we talked about our loan growth, we talked about our 15-year mortgages, we've talked at previous conferences about changing our investment portfolio and taking on more credit assets than we have because we have very solid liquidity. And so you'll see us take a little more risk there. And then we have elements of liability management that we continue to work down on the right side of the balance sheet. But -- so specifically, your earning asset question is a modest reduction.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So if we bring that all together, it presumes that net interest income dollars would likely be down this year, right, just on flat margin against the modestly smaller balance sheet?","David J. Turner","I think what you need to do is compare that and then also look at kind of the trends in terms of the 10-year for last year compared to where you think it might go this year. We started pretty high in the 10-year last year in the first quarter, I think, we topped out, I don't know, what, 230-ish and we're behind that right this minute. So there are a lot of factors that go into where you think revenue may come out, but those are the -- that's the main one you needed to look at, as well as earning assets and liability management.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then one just follow-up on the mortgage question. Can you just talk to us about the dynamic between how much mortgages actually you think about intending to keep as a proportion of that total loan growth you're expecting and then what the offsetting impact would be on the mortgage banking line by not getting the gain on sale?","David J. Turner","Let me kind of frame it up in terms of what last year might've looked like. So had we had this change, it would've meant about $1.2 billion in terms of volume and call it spread on the gain in the 3 25 to 3 50 range, so you can do some quick math to see what gains are relative to retaining that on the balance sheet. So today, 15-year mortgages are in, call it, 2 or 3 quarters percent offset with, if you didn't sell them, taking the proceeds and investing them in mortgage backs which going on today, with a like product, close to 1.5%. So those are the kind of things you think about and you can probably use what I just gave you and construct the difference between spread income versus gain on sale.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Levin of Citigroup.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","As you think about top line growth, where specifically do you see the greatest opportunities for top line growth in 2013?","David J. Turner","I think that, obviously, you have to look at continuing to maintain NII at a strong level because of the reduction in expense that goes into that line item. I think you have to look at continued solid mortgage performance and it was very strong this past year. It should be strong going in and through 2013. If you remember back to 2012 at this point, I don't think many people projected that mortgage would stay as strong as it did, and we are looking at -- we think mortgage will continue to be very strong for us. Growing our customer households is a priority for us. We picked up additional NIR there. Production and growth in our credit card book, which we saw in the fourth quarter, and as you recall, we brought that conversion in the latter part of the third quarter, so now we can control the customer experience. We grew accounts, which helps us from a credit interchange. There's no one magic bullet. It is getting back to basics and growing every one of our businesses that we think can generate both NII and NIR for us.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Josh, I think when you look at income statement, when you're trying to figure it out, where can we really grow, I would agree with David, I don't think there's one category that's going to dominate that. Clearly, last year, our loan production increased some 14% year-over-year on new production, new to Regions and we are encouraged by that. I think what we saw was sort of some slowdown sort of into late third, early fourth quarter sort of across our businesses, but then saw strong pickup in December. And I would tell you, December, from an activity standpoint, was probably one of the strongest months we've seen in a couple of years. December was a very good month for us and an encouraging month. And so I think when you look at where our opportunities are, clearly, for us to grow top line revenue, we've got to grow loans. We believe this can be a transition for our company in '13 to get back to more of a growth strategy and we've got a lot of momentum in the field across our franchise. And so I think if you look at where revenue streams have been, I think NII has got to improve for us to deliver on that. NIR has predominantly been driven by 2 things, really, our sort of transition to -- from sort of a free checking environment to a fee-eligible environment. We think we've gotten through that transition now or are back in a position to grow checking accounts in our company. We also think, from a mortgage standpoint, we did $8 billion in production last year. We saw sort of seasonally slowdown in the fourth quarter, between the holiday effect that you have in that fourth quarter. Top lines are back pretty strong. Is it going to be as strong as '12? I don't know, but it looks pretty strong to us at this point. So few more quarters, we'll know.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And as you said, 2012 was a transformational year for Regions. Given where you are now and you're past this inflection point, where do you see yourselves in the M&A landscape?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I think, at this juncture, we're still focused on growing organically in our franchise. I think the M&A activity is obviously opportunistic in nature. We're paying close attention to everything that's going on in the markets. But quite frankly, our focus right now in this company is trying to make sure that we're delivering on organic growth, sort of earns us the right to participate in whatever happens from an M&A standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I think I missed it, going back to the mortgage, follow-up with some of the mortgage questions, of the $2.1 billion of production, how much did you keep and how much was 15-year product?","David J. Turner","Yes, I think from -- most of that was actually sold into the market. I can't remember the specific percentage.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And what you were talking about was that going forward, keeping 15-year product would be about $1.5 billion?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes. Paul, we've been retaining -- of the $8 billion, we've been retaining roughly about little less than 20% of that. It's the only thing we've been retaining in large part was the non-agency eligible and also some of the adjustable-rate product that we had in there. We've been releasing the fixed rate mortgages. We transitioned in the fourth quarter the holding, the 15-year fixed rate product into our portfolio. But quite frankly, very little of that actually hit in the fourth quarter. That transition takes about 90 days, and so you'll see more of that occurring in the first quarter.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","In the first quarter. And then you said you launched a new HELOC product. Is this going to be for portfolio product? Can you add some more color to that?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, we had historically did an equity line offering. And in the third quarter this year, we've put together a fixed rate fully amortizing equity line -- equity loan product, that we rolled out to all of our consumer channels and production in the fourth quarter was up some 23% over third quarter. We were encouraged by the results of that. We like that product and that it is fully amortizing and it's fully funded on the date of origination. And if you look, it sort of how it stacks up from a Basel III standpoint, it's a very capital-friendly Basel III product.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Is this mainly second liens or can be first and second liens?","O. B. Grayson Hall","It's both, but it's predominantly first lien. Barbara, do you have the exact numbers?","Barbara Godin","I don't have the exact numbers to bring into production, but what we do have going on in HELOC right now, all-in is -- 52% of it is first lien of the entire portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just as a follow-up on some of the questions Paul was asking. In terms of HARP, it seems like you guys may have added capacity. You noted that take-up rates have been almost 20% so far. Can you give us your expectations of how high you think take-up rates for HARP could go as we look out through the rest of 2013?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, if you look at our portfolio, we're servicing about $40 billion in mortgages. That's large for us, but in terms of the overall market, we're a fairly small player, but $40 billion in servicing. And if you look at -- when we run the analysis, we've only refinanced, we believe, approximately 20% of the customers in that customer base into the HARP II program. If you look at our production, of the $8 billion in mortgage production we did last year, $1.6 billion was HARP II-related. Of that $1.6 billion, only 50% of that was mortgages that we serviced. So -- and it varied from month to month, quarter to quarter, but I would say irrespective of which time periods you looked at, it ranged from 23%, 24% production to as low as 18%, 19% production. But I think sort of keeping it in that 20% of production range is sort of where we still think that sort of falls out over the next few months, unless there's a shift in customer behavior that we have not yet seen. But there are an awful lot of people still eligible for that program. We're reaching out to those customers, making sure they understand the program and making sure they understand the benefits of that program and then trying to help them through that program and so I think it's a win-win for the customer and for our bank, so we're working hard on that.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just on expenses, when you think about the Regions 360 initiative, how much incremental dollar spend are you putting into this as we look out over 2013? And how do you anticipate us seeing the benefits of this coming through? And just when we think about the overall expense base, you alluded to credit-related costs continuing to come down, should we expect to see credit-related cost coming down but core operating expenses actually increasing from the current run rate?","David J. Turner","Well, let me tell you, your first part was Regions 360. Regions 360 is an approach to doing business the way we want it done with our customers, which is to help them through all their needs, through all their financial needs. Grayson had mentioned earlier about making investments in people that generate revenue for us. Don't take 360 as being a new initiative where we have to hire a bunch of people. It's getting our people to do what we want them to do, to execute on behalf of our customer. And we think you'll see that in terms of more pull-through in terms of getting a deeper relationship with our customer. And as an example, today, 50% of our deposit customers have one product type with us that we need to expand that and Regions 360 will certainly help us do that. So it's bringing the full bank to our customers that we expect. From an all-in expense point, again, we think our adjusted expenses for '13 will be down from '12. No one area really drives that. It's just got constant focus on every single line item. So if you wanted to look at the biggest movers, you have to look at our largest expense categories that we currently have, which are salaries and benefits and occupancy expense. We do have things like credit-related, it'll come down some as nonperformers continue to attrite. And I mentioned credit card servicing earlier and then the REIT-related savings that we had.","O. B. Grayson Hall","We talked about inside the company, we've got to generate positive operating leverage. And in order to do that, we have to look at both expenses and revenues and clearly have to be disciplined on expenses. But where there's opportunities to invest in people or technology or products that we believe has an opportunity to generate revenues and to generate positive operating leverage, we're going to take advantage of that. But your earlier question, you've really got to be pretty disciplined in that balanced approach to make sure that your investments are smart. But we recognize we still got to manage the expenses, but you still got to have a franchise as an ability to grow also.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio at Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just as a follow-up, I know we're kind of beating a dead horse on expenses, but David, could you determine what the overall environmental costs were in the expense line in fourth quarter and what a normalized run rate of them might be as we go forward?","David J. Turner","Well, let me kind of give it to you for a year. So if you kind of look at our run rate, we still think we have $200 million in terms of environmental expense, some of which we will always have. These aren't going away. We do think there's, over time, maybe up to 1\/2 of that number, perhaps a little less than that. I would not look to that as being a huge driver of any expense savings that we get '12 to '13. Yes, it will be a piece of it, but I think, as I mentioned earlier, that you really have to look at all the categories because we have an intense focus on every dollar that we spend and that will just be one of the areas where we have some savings in '13.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's good coloring. If I can follow-up with 2 quick questions, more logistical. The preferred dividend this quarter, if I did my math right on the most recent preferred offering, is that dividend going to be closer to $8 million per quarter than the $4 million that was before this quarter?","David J. Turner","That's correct.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then finally, you're going to save about $28 million annually on determination of the third-party investment and the sub. Is there any lost revenue to that termination?","David J. Turner","No.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, first, I have to, David and Grayson, applaud you on the 15-year mortgage decision. I did want to know a little bit of background of how you were thinking through that because we've talked about it so much in the past looking for some term assets, but kind of what's changed your thinking at this point?","David J. Turner","Well, Marty, as we mentioned all year, we couldn't make arguments on both sides of that trade. We thought at the time that the gains were more important to us as we continue to accrete capital and put ourselves in the position that we're in, capital wise. Honestly, with a low-rate environment you're taking -- you're having to analyze that marginal dollar. Where do I put it to get the best return -- risk-adjusted return I can get? And over the year, as we got -- as we became very comfortable with our capital position, and again, after looking at the markets' thoughts on how I treated gain on sale versus lack of loan growth, that also has to enter into the picture. And so when you kind of bring those 2 things together, we felt that it was time for us to switch the thought and put the -- give up the incremental liquidity, if you will, for mortgage-backed securities and put it in the 1 4s that go on the balance sheet. So it was a close call either way, but we think this shift for us will be net-net positive.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And is it a peer substitution for securities or when you dip into that $3.5 billion of short-term assets which are only earning 22 basis points. Will there any be real redesign or shifting of asset sensitivity or are we still waiting on that?","David J. Turner","Well, you'll continue to see us work down. So I guess at yearend, now that you see our balance sheet, we're at $3.5 billion, earning 0.25 point, that number shifts around quite a bit, you shouldn't see us on average throughout the year to have that much. Most of that is incremental to the proceeds if we did -- if we sold the loans and took the proceeds, we'd go into some of our mortgage-backed securities. So you're trading out 2 and 3 quarters for 1.5. We already have our repositioning of our investment portfolios, I previously mentioned, to take more credit-related assets, but I think you should think about it in the context of a mortgage-back versus the mortgage itself.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And looking at credit card balances, they've been dropping pretty consistently and now we're bringing this on board, we finished the transition. Do you think that those balances can start to turn around as you go forward now?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, we saw some stabilization towards the end of the year and actually saw a little net growth, but still, at the end of the day, you probably -- Marty, you'd probably still call that flat. But I think we have some pretty strong plans now that we have that portfolio in-house. We've seen improvement in sales out of our branches and we've got marketing programs for 2013 that we believe will deliver growth in that portfolio. And we'll have to demonstrate that to you, but we are encouraged by the early signs we're seeing.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then lastly, I just wanted to hit on what's happening with the HARP, what is causing only 20% penetration of those refinances as you've gone through this year? What's the critical thing that you -- you had a year to go and refi. What's really been holding the customers back from coming in and being able to get those loans and what will change that as we move forward? And that's it.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, I mean, Marty, I would tell you it's a great question. It's a question we ask ourselves often. And when you look at the programs, the rates, the rate and terms have been very attractive if you're one of these customers who are eligible for this program. Anecdotally, what we hear back from customers is some customers still are -- are still not as knowledgeable about the program as we'd like them to be. So we're trying to increase our level of customer communication and customer education about it. We also know that a number of customers who may be transitioning from the home they're in maybe to another home will not participate if they're going to refinance. So -- and if you look at all of the anecdotal comments you hear from customers, it causes us to believe that there's still a potential upside of more volume. I do think the underwriting process for mortgages is a very rigorous process right now. And so unless it provides a tremendous amount of benefit, people are probably somewhat reluctant. But we think once we explain the benefits of refinancing and what it can do for these families from a cash flow standpoint, we've been very successful in underwriting a number of these. We continue to build capacity to do this and as I think others around the country are as well.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So do you think just that this last year has been kind of a passive because of the capacity issue just taking what they came into the door, now what you're going to do is take on more of an active educational process proactively by going out to the customer and encouraging them to come in that way?","O. B. Grayson Hall","That would certainly be true for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you guys share with us, if you assume your SIFI buffer is going to be 25 basis points, maybe it's slightly higher, let's assume for a moment for the purpose of this question it is 25 basis points and you're required to carry Tier 1 common at 7.25%, what level above that are you going to be comfortable in carrying in terms of your capital?","David J. Turner","Well, Gerard, I'm not so sure of the -- that the SIFI buffer is the ultimate driver there. I think there are other things that we need to think through, and that is one of the biggest one is OCI and how that's going to be treated. You still have buffers related to operational risk and other elements if you want to consider the whole capital plan. And so we've kind of mentioned over time that we thought the capital kind of settles out in that 8, 8.5 Tier 1 common range. I will tell you, though, it's still up for debate. We have a lot of discussion that's going on even as we speak relative to things like OCI, the send bucket for deferred tax assets and mortgage servicing rights and the like, but as we kind of cut through all that, we still see, as of right now, somewhere in that 8, 8.5 range as being probably where it settles out. And we reserve the right to be wrong on that, but that's our best guess now.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. When you look at your securities and cash as a percentage of total assets today, it's about 27%. Where do you see that ratio needing to go to get to peak profitability for you guys and how long do you think it'll take to get there?","David J. Turner","You asked the question of the day. That is something we constantly look at. Honestly, we'd love to take a percentage of our securities book and deploy that in loans if we can get properly priced, properly structured loan growth. I think, historically, if you look at percentages of earning assets for securities book, you generally have been in that 15% to 18% range. We understand and acknowledge we're way above that. I think most people are carrying more securities than they would like to today. If we can get some uncertainties taken care of in the economy, whether it'd be the cliff, the debt, the uncertainties in Asia and Europe, and get some confidence in the marketplace, we could see some loan demand, which we have the liquidity to shift into that really quickly. So I think working that down to that range I just mentioned is what we want to do over time. It'll take us a while. It's hard to tell you how quickly we can get that deployed. But it is the reason that we have started to take more credit risks in the investment portfolio, which is historically and predominantly established to cover liquidity. But we believe, we had a 78% loan-to-deposit ratio, we have plenty of liquidity and we don't have a lot of long-term debt. But we think that we can take some extra credit risk in that investment portfolio to give us somewhat of a proxy for credit that we've put on the loan book. That being said, we're in the relationship business. We're in the business of making loans to people and businesses and that's what we want to continue to work on.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Recognizing that is the primary focus here is growing the loan book, of course. Would you consider paying down some of that high-cost long-term debt that you have on the books and then just reducing that securities portfolio? So you would almost shrink your balance sheet to increase the profitability of the company.","David J. Turner","Well, we talked earlier about liability management. You saw us do some of that this past year. We have about $750 million worth of debt maturing all-in this year. I think $250 million of that is at the holding company and $500 million is in the bank. We've already had that considered in our liquidity planning, which we start 2 years out. But we're looking for opportunities to reduce our all-in funding cost, in particular, our long-term debt costs which today is about right at 5% after considering swaps. And so you clearly are hitting on something that we look at all the time in terms of how we might take that out.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And my final question is on the securities portfolio. What's the duration, the average duration of the portfolio? And then what is the duration of the securities that you put on in the fourth quarter into that portfolio?","David J. Turner","Yes, if I look at the overall portfolio, what changes is obviously prepayment speeds keep moving around. But today, we're probably 2 and 3.25 years roughly. If you look at what we've put on in the fourth quarter, that's probably, I don't know, 3 years maybe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A question on your Corporate Banking effort. I'm just wondering if you could, Grayson, just discuss kind of the progress you've made in the last couple of quarters and the growth you're expecting from that effort over the next 1 or 2 years.","David J. Turner","On Corporate Banking business.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Jennifer, when you look at our commercial line of business, really, most of our growth over the last year has really come from the upper end of what we would call middle market and what is generally referred to as Corporate Banking. Our Corporate Banking efforts are not that large. And the way we sort of have our business dissected is, in our small business, our business and community banking approach, we go up to about $20 million in sales. In our commercial middle market C&I, we'll go anywhere from that $20 million up to as much as $2 billion in sales. So we're really focused on that core middle market space. That being said, most of the growth over the last year has come in the upper end of that, with smaller companies, smaller businesses really behaving more like the consumer, still no more deleveraging and carrying larger amounts of cash reserves. We are seeing a little bit broader demand than we've seen before. From a strategy standpoint, we've tried to take certain industries that we're specializing in, like asset-based lending, health care, transportation, energy and also franchised restaurant. And we've tried to focus on them. Those industries, we've recruited some really strong bankers in those industries, and we've used those bankers even though they may be located in one market or another. We've used them franchise-wide across all of our markets and have generated what I think is some pretty good strong growth in our commercial book of business. Where we've seen the decline really has been in owner-occupied real estate has continued to decline throughout the year. But that's not surprising because most of that product is in the lower half of the middle-market space and in the business and community banking space. The other side is investor commercial real estate, that portfolio had so many stressed loans in it and it allowed that -- those stressed loans have had to be resolved in the course of business one way or the other. And so you've seen that derisking activity. But as I mentioned earlier in the call, our production has increased on that segment. And when you look at the overall commercial business, I would again say we probably had the best December we've seen in a long time. And going into January, we feel pretty encouraged by it. We'll hold up through the year. Again, the economy being what it is, we're continuing to see incremental improvement in the economy and we hope that there's more certainty around a lot of fiscal issues and our customers could get back to investing in their businesses. And I think we'll benefit from that if that occurs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but just one quick question, I guess, to hit on the mortgage subject again. Just curious as to what the new recommendations for QRM mortgages coming out recently. How did that affect your outlook for mortgage production or did it affect at all your desire to keep -- to put the 15-year mortgages on your balance sheet? Just curious as to how you're thinking about that new item for the industry?","O. B. Grayson Hall","We've had our mortgage team going through all of those rules and guidelines and a lot of the rules will have little to no impact on us. We think that there will be some adjustments to our business model that we're doing today, but they're relatively small. And so our mortgage team at this juncture is not predicting a big impact of those rule changes on our business. But our mortgage business has been fairly simple for a long time. We're not doing a lot of the things that would have impacted that business very strongly. But the -- so I think that at the end of the day, the guidance was good, glad we got the guidance. We'll adhere to it and we think we'll adjust our business model and move forward without a lot of barriers.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. And then for my follow-up, I'd like to -- I'm not going to let Barb get away totally scot-free. I'm just, Barb, just curious in terms of you saw a very nice decline in nonperforming loan additions this quarter. How are you thinking about that trend into 2013 within your guidance of continued improvement in overall asset quality metrics?","Barbara Godin","Yes, even at the 350 level, I would say that we're in that normal range, the higher end of the normal band. I do see that continuing to trend down, though, and I would say the place for you to look at is our criticized and classified. Clearly, as those numbers come down, movements and [indiscernible] will follow.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions on loans. In terms of loan demand, can you -- I'm sorry if you already mentioned it, would you discuss what you saw in terms of line utilization during the quarter, where you see that trending?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Line utilization is relatively flat. It was down ever so slightly. We really haven't seen much movement in that line utilization in the last few months in that 43% utilization range approximately. We've obviously, in our commitments, increased substantially, but line utilization really hasn't moved much at all.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So in terms of borrower confidence, I know we've heard some of the other Southeast-based banks indicate that they're seeing a pretty good pickup in confidence post-election and the near-term resolution of the cliff for now. So are you seeing some improved activity amid your borrower base?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I think, overall, we see the confidence is incrementally better, but it's a little mixed. I would use the word mixed. I think, clearly, our larger customers are more confident than our smaller customers are today. I do think that I'm not sure how many cliffs we have, but getting past what we did recently really helped the overall confidence level. I think if we continue to make positive progress on the fiscal side, that corporations will become more confident. Because I would tell you, business, people in business, they want a more confident environment. I think they're poised ready for a better economy to start executing on their plans. But right now I would say it's better but not -- the movement has been incremental, not a big, huge swing.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, in terms of your loan book, can you discuss where you're seeing the new money yields come in on your new loan originations by type? I just wanted to get an idea of what the competitive pressure that you're seeing there in your pricing style?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, I mean, I'll make a few comments and then I'll ask Barb to speak on it as well. But clearly, competition for lending opportunities has increased and so I would characterize the kind of spreads we're seeing on transactions today, still historically better than what we've seen in the past but not as high as they were a few quarters ago. So I think pricing is starting to tighten a little bit but still at levels that we would say are better than what we've historically seen. Probably the most tightening has been on the commercial real estate portfolio where those spreads have really gotten wide right after we really got into the crisis and those, while they're still relatively high, they're tighter than they were. And Barb, if you want to add to that?","Barbara Godin","Yes. We look at middle market spreads in general, going back even as far back as 2004. And where we are today, they're generally pretty flat. They went up clearly during the crux of the recession back in 2010. They were up, as Grayson said, they've come back up, they've tightened. Again, all-in, if you look at some of our individual businesses, things like business and community banking, clearly, that's a much better yield than some of the others. In our business banking spreads, again, they were up significantly in '09 and '10 and they've come back in again back to '06 levels generally as we have with fourth quarter.","Operator","This concludes the allotted time for today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Hall for any closing remarks.","O. B.

Grayson Hall","Thank you, List, and welcome to everyone to Regions' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your interest in Regions and are pleased to have this opportunity to update you on the solid progress we made this past year in executing our business plans and building a stronger core franchise, as well as our expectations for continued progress in 2012. ","Although the environment has clearly remained challenged, our 2011 results demonstrated that our disciplined business plans and focus on the customer is working. Total loan production for the year was a solid $60 billion. Of that, Business Services accounted for $51 billion or 83%, including $15 billion of new loan production, a 14% increase over last year. Consumer banking loan production accounted for $9 billion in 2011, driven by strength in mortgage, indirect auto and credit card. Loan growth was fueled by commercial and industrial loan balances, which on average increased 11% for the full year. Offsetting this growth was the Investor Real Estate loan portfolio, which favorably declined over $5 billion in 2011 or 33% of outstandings, as we continued to consistently and aggressively de-risk our balance sheet. ","Average low cost deposits for the full year grew more than $4 billion in 2011 or nearly 6%, which led to a 29-basis-point decline in total deposit cost as a result of this favorable shift in deposit mix. Credit quality metrics meaningfully improved in 2011 as demonstrated by 29% decline in net charge-offs, a 24% decrease in nonperforming assets, a 40% decrease in inflows of nonperforming loans and a 35% reduction in Business Services criticized loans, which are our earliest indicator of problem loans for the future. ","We also sharply reduced our credit-related costs in 2011, with full year provision down $1.3 billion or 47% for 2010, while continuing to maintain a solid reserve level to net loans of 3.54%. ","Although 2011 revenues were down due to lower security gains, excluding these securities transactions, our revenues held relatively steady despite legislative, regulatory and interest rate challenges. Total expenses were higher due to fourth quarter's goodwill impairment charge associated with Morgan Keegan. However, excluding the goodwill impairment charge and last year's regulatory charge and related tax benefit as a result of our continued focus on cost, full year noninterest expenses from continuing operations were down 5%, aided by a 4% reduction in headcount and the elimination of 700,000 square feet of excess facility space. Additionally, we further strengthened our capital base, increasing our Tier 1 common equity ratio by approximately 65 basis points to an estimated 8.5%. ","As recently announced, we reached an agreement to sell our broker-dealer operation, Morgan Keegan, to Raymond James for $930 million. As part of the transaction, Morgan Keegan is also expected to pay Regions a dividend of $250 million before closing, providing total consideration of $1.18 billion. As disclosed, Morgan Asset Management and Regions  Morgan Keegan Trust are not included in the sale and remain part of Regions Wealth Management organization. To reiterate, the transaction reduces our overall risk profile, provides substantial liquidity at the holding company and modestly improves key capital ratios. It also establishes a strong long-term partnership with Raymond James, which we anticipate will provide incremental revenue opportunities and a source of low cost deposits while also enhancing our ability to serve our existing customers. Importantly, we also expect going forward that we will maintain important business relationships with Morgan Keegan associates that have developed over many years of working together to serve our customers' needs. The divestiture will strengthen Regions' overall focus and discipline on our core banking franchise. Although it's been less than 2 weeks since the announcement, we have been working productively and urgently to achieve a first quarter close of this transaction. ","Results for 2011 included fourth quarter net after-tax $731 million goodwill impairment charge related to the process of selling Morgan Keegan, which is reflected in both discontinued and continuing operations. As a result, Regions reported fourth quarter and full year losses per share of $0.48 and $0.34, respectively. And from continuing operations, Regions' fourth quarter and full year losses were $0.11 and $0.02, respectively. Excluding the impairment charge, Regions' fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations was $0.09 per fully diluted share, leading to full year earnings per share of $0.17 on the same basis. Importantly, adjusted pretax pre-provision income has now exceeded the loan loss provision for 3 quarters in a row, clearly demonstrating improved underlying fundamentals. ","Fourth quarter results from continuing operations also reflected lower credit-related costs, driven by broad-based credit quality improvement. This includes a 16% linked quarter decline in net loan charge-offs and a 26% decline in gross inflows of nonperforming loans. Fee-based revenues in the quarter were negatively impacted by the implementation of the Durbin Amendment on October 1. However, new revenue initiatives and changes to our checking account fee structure helped to offset some of the lost debit interchange fee income. Also, we continue to experience growth in debit card activity as total transactions have risen more than 2% from a year ago and total spending is up 3.6%.  And now we're also seeing healthy growth in credit card transaction volume, which was up 2.5% linked quarter. We were able to modestly increase our interest margin third to fourth quarter and continued improvement in both deposit mix and deposit cost, offset long term, low interest rates on yields in our securities portfolio. ","All in all, our underlying results and positive trends in certain key areas demonstrate that we are successfully executing our business plans by staying focused on our customer, and that we are making considerable progress positioning us well to take advantage of future opportunities. ","I'll now turn the call over to David, who will provide you with fourth quarter and full year 2011 financial details, after which, I'll return to make some additional comments prior to opening up the call for questions. David?","David J. Turner","Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our fourth quarter 2011 and full year results. As Grayson pointed out, due to the after-tax goodwill impairment charge in the amount of $731 million associated with the process of selling Morgan Keegan, we reported a fourth quarter loss of $602 million or $0.48 per diluted share. $478 million on the impairment charge was recorded within discontinued operations and $253 million in continuing operations. Therefore, we incurred a loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of $135 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Excluding the goodwill impairment, income from continuing operations was $118 million or $0.09 per share. Fourth quarter's results from continuing operations were solid and primarily reflecting lower credit costs. ","This morning's discussion, unless otherwise noted, will focus on fourth quarter results from continuing operations excluding goodwill impairment, as we believe this provides a clearer picture of fundamental trends. Starting with a quick overview, pretax pre-provision income, or PPI, was $485 million or 5% below the third quarter. As expected, service charges were negatively impacted by the implementation of debit interchange legislation, which drove the decline in PPI. Net interest income was steady linked quarter, while the net interest margin was up 4 basis points to 3.08%. Noninterest revenues were down 1% on a linked quarter basis, while noninterest expenses were up 2%. ","Now let's take a look at some of the quarter's highlights, starting on Slide 5, with the credit quality trends that continue to improve. Inflows of nonperforming loans declined to $561 million or 26% from the third quarter's $755 million. The mix of inflows continues to be more income-producing commercial real estate loans, which have cash flows and tend to have lower loss severities. It is important to note that Land\/Condo\/Single Family portfolio, which now totals $1.8 billion, makes up 10% or $58 million of the inflows. Of this portfolio, 20% or $373 million have already been moved to non-accruing status. ","It is important to note that 48% of all Business Services gross nonperforming loans were current and paying as agreed at the end of the quarter. This is up 11 percentage points from a year ago and compares to 45% in the third quarter. ","Let's move to nonperforming loans on Slide 6. Nonperforming loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased $338 million or 12% linked quarter and $788 million or 25% year-over-year. During the fourth quarter, we executed $306 million in strategic sales of problem assets primarily out of held for sale. We also moved $334 million of problem loans to held for sale. Throughout 2011, we were able to reduce nonperforming assets by almost $1 billion or 24%. Notably, Business Services criticized and classified loans continued to decline, down 13% or $935 million from the third quarter, and down $3.4 billion or 35% from one year ago. Importantly, criticized and classified loan trends are one of the best and earliest indicators of credit quality. As a result, we anticipate that 2011's marked improvement in overall credit quality trends will continue into 2012. More specifically, we expect our migration into nonperforming status in the first quarter to approximate the level of this past quarter. ","Moving onto the loan loss provision on Slide 7. Net charge-offs declined $81 million or 16% linked quarter, and for the full year declined 29%. This quarter's disposition activity added $141 million to fourth quarter's charge-off level. However, markdowns associated with these disposed assets had mostly been provided for in our loan loss allowance. Excluding net charge-offs related to disposition activity, net charge-offs were down 8% linked quarter. Net charge-offs exceeded the loan loss provision by $135 million, marking the third straight quarter we have provided less in net charge-offs. ","Our coverage ratios remain strong. At year end, our allowance for loan loss -- loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans coverage stood at 116%, up 15 basis points from last year. Meanwhile, our loan loss allowance to net loans declined from 3.84% at the end of 2010 to 3.54% at the end of 2011. From any metric observed, you will find much improved credit quality at Regions. ","Now let's move onto the balance sheet on Slide 8. Fourth quarter's average loan yield increased 4 basis points to 4.35%. This increase primarily reflects slightly higher LIBOR rates. Ending loans for the year were down approximately 6%, which reflects a favorable 33% decline in Investor Real Estate, partially offset by a 9% increase in the commercial and industrial portfolio. In addition, we added $1.2 billion of credit card loans and indirect auto loans to the balance sheet during 2011. Average commercial and industrial loans grew $357 million or 1.5% third to fourth quarter. However, other portfolio runoff, primarily Investor Real Estate, more than offset this growth, causing the total loan portfolio to decline 2.2% linked quarter. Line utilization on commercial and industrial loans was modestly lower at 42.6%, but up from 40.3% in the fourth quarter of 2010. ","We continue to see growth in our specialized industries, in particular, healthcare and franchise restaurant. In addition, we are expanding other industry practices, such as technology and defense. Noteworthy, total commercial and industrial commitments rose $3.7 billion in 2011, ending the year at just under $30 billion. This, along with other factors, lead us to expect continued growth in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio in 2012. ","Investor Real Estate loans declined another $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, resulting in year-end balances of $10.7 billion or $5.2 billion less than year-end 2010. This portfolio now comprises only 14% of our total loan portfolio, down from 19% a year ago. We do expect the Investor Real Estate portfolio will continue to decline in 2012, albeit at a slower pace. ","On the liability side of the balance sheet, as shown on Slide 9, deposit mix and cost continued to improve in the fourth quarter. Average deposits were down 1% in the fourth quarter, driven by a $1.6 billion decline in CDs, partially offset by an increase in low-cost deposits. Given our continued success in growing low-cost deposits, average time deposits fell to 21% of outstanding deposits, down from fourth quarter 2010's level of 25%. This positive mix shift resulted in deposit cost declining to 40 basis points for the quarter, down 6 basis points from third quarter and down 24 basis points from the end of 2010. Related, our total funding costs improved 7 basis points linked quarter to 68 basis points. Additional opportunities remained to reduce our deposit cost, as we have approximately $11.7 billion of CDs that carry an average of 1.46% interest rate that are scheduled to mature in 2012. This compares to a current average going-on rate for new CDs approximating 30 to 35 basis points. ","Now let's turn to net interest income on Slide 10. Actual equivalent net interest income for the fourth quarter was flat. However, the resulting net interest margin increased 4 basis points to 3.08%, benefiting from deposit pricing and an $843 million decline in average excess cash at the Federal Reserve. Late in the quarter, we repaid the final $2 billion of maturing TLGP debt, which resulted in a lower ending balance of cash held at the Federal Reserve. Consequently, excess cash reserves negatively impacted the margin, 14 basis points in this quarter, an improvement from third quarter's 16 basis points. ","As expected, long-term interest rates led to higher prepayments in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio, which negatively impacted our securities yield, resulting in a decline of 25 basis points linked quarter. The net interest margin was negatively impacted by 7 basis points related to these prepayments. Looking into 2012, we expect this portfolio to grow modestly as we deploy excess cash reserves. And as previously noted, with the opportunities that remain on the liability side of our balance sheet and based on our expectation of a  low-rate environment, we expect our net interest margin to continue to incrementally improve this year. ","Let's turn to noninterest revenue on Slide 11. Fourth quarter noninterest revenues declined 1% from the third quarter to $507 million. Fourth quarter's implementation of debit interchange legislation reduced service charges $47 million linked quarter, in line with our expectations. One thing in particular I'd like to highlight is that total 2011 service charges were relatively stable as compared with 2010 despite the negative impact of Regulation E and debit interchange legislation, illustrating our ability to quickly adapt our business model. We've been able to successfully mitigate these hurdles by generating new revenue streams and through the ongoing product restructuring of deposit accounts, and we expect to completely mitigate this over time. Mortgage revenue declined 16% linked quarter, reflecting reduced benefit from MSR and related hedging activities. Production in the fourth quarter totaled $1.8 billion, bringing our full year production to $6.3 billion. Further, the extended Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP 2, is expected to foster mortgage production into 2012. ","Moving on to Slide 12, noninterest expenses, excluding the goodwill impairment charge, were up 2% linked quarter. During the fourth quarter, we incurred a $16 million expense related to Visa litigation. Excluding this item and the goodwill impairment, expenses were relatively flat with the third quarter. For the full year, noninterest expenses, excluding goodwill impairment and the regulatory charge, were down $175 million or 5%. Regions has successfully been able to create and grow new revenue streams while also reducing expenses. Credit-related expenses declined $23 million or 23% linked quarter, primarily related to lower other real estate expenses. Fourth quarter 2011 credit-related expenses are 9% of total expenses, down from 14% in fourth quarter 2010. Additionally, and as previously announced, in the fourth quarter, we consolidated 41 branches. Furthermore, headcount declined over 1,000 positions or nearly 4% during 2011. It is down 6% over the last 2 years. We will continue to seek expense savings without sacrificing investment opportunities or compromising high service levels our customers have come to expect and deserve at Regions. As a result, we expect 2012 expenses to be slightly down from the 2011 level. ","Moving on to capital and liquidity on Slide 13, we've maintained solid capital and held a favorable liquidity position throughout the year. The Tier 1 common ratio increased to 8.5%, and the Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter stood at 13.2%. In addition, our pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios are above their respective 7% and 8.5% minimums. Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company remained solid with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 81% and cash held at the Federal Reserve totaled approximately $5 billion at year end.  Lastly, based on our interpretation, our liquidity coverage ratio is above the 100% Basel III requirement. ","Overall, this year's results show progress that we've made. Our core business performance improved as we achieved sustainable profitability on a continuing operations basis. We have substantially improved our credit risk profile and further strengthened our balance sheet from a liquidity and capital standpoint. ","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Grayson for his closing remarks.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Thank you, David. I want to spend just a few moments talking about 2012. Although we are encouraged by recent improvements in various economic indicators, in particular the unemployment rate and GDP growth, we do believe that the economy remains challenged by housing and unemployment and the pace of economic recovery does appear to be incremental. That being said, we are positioning our franchise to continue our recovery on asset quality and earnings performance. With this backdrop, we expect to be very disciplined in our focus on fundamentals, focusing on the basics of banking, focusing on our customers and continuing to take steps to position ourselves for growth when the economic recovery demonstrates sustainable momentum. By providing customers with superior service and a broad array of well-priced products, we are able to deepen existing relationships as well as profitably grow our business. In fact, we believe our competitive advantage is driven by customer loyalty, service quality and disciplined bankers, and that is what will ultimately differentiate us in the marketplace. ","Regarding noninterest revenue in 2012, over time, we expect to recover the estimated $180 million loss due to the interchange pricing changes. We are seeing early success in recent introduced suite of products and services that offer customers new choices on how to bank with Regions. We are encouraged by the positive results of our changes in checking account fee structures. As we transition from free to fee-eligible, we have to sell into legitimate customer needs and deliver value at a fair price. We are building a stronger and more consistent banking model that customers appreciate and respect. Given our assumption of a continued low-interest-rate, low-growth environment, we expect growing net interest income will remain challenging. Additional improvement in funding mix and pricing should offset pressure on earning asset yields, but our margin will remain relatively stable with incremental improvement. ","We believe that commercial and industrial loan growth was strong in 2011, and we are continuing to add resources into our specialized industries and will do so throughout 2012. As a result, we expect continued commercial and industrial loan growth in 2012. At the same time, we plan to continue de-risking some segments of our loan portfolio, although the pace of runoff is expected to moderate to some degree. ","Overall, we believe consumers and small businesses will remain cautious about spending and borrowing, but we do anticipate incremental improvement. Obviously, we continue to focus on legislative and regulatory changes in our industry and adjust our business model, products and services as necessary. We are working every day to restore financial confidence and to provide financial products to stimulate economic growth across our markets. ","In our business, we maintain a disciplined focus on streamlining and driving expenses down. However, innovation and new product development are critical and do require some level of investment. As such, we will be diligent about managing our resources to achieve the right balance of efficiency, effectiveness and growth. In fact, 2011 adjusted expenses are lower than those of the past 3 years despite increasing environmental costs. We have become much more efficient, reducing our operating expenses even as we added new products and services. And it is important, I think, to note that during the same time, customer service has actually improved at Regions, and this is supported externally by J.D. Power, by Gallup and by Greenwich. ","Improving credit quality metrics, combined with sharp reduction in Investor Real Estate portfolio, are driving our expectation for reduction in loan charge-offs and provision in 2012. We continue to de-risk our portfolio through the liquidation of problem assets and foreclosed properties. We expect our overall credit trends to improve, and nonperforming assets are anticipated to decrease as the year progresses. ","To wrap up, in 2011, we reached 3 important milestones. Our core franchise has strengthened and we do appear to have achieved sustainable profitability from continuing operations, excluding the recent goodwill impairment. All of our credit quality-related metrics experienced marked improvement throughout the year. And shortly after year end, we completed the strategic review of Morgan Keegan, culminating in the announced sale to Raymond James. While we are encouraged by all of these accomplishments, we recognize there's still much work to be done. As outlined earlier, we expect 2012 to be another year of slow, incremental economic recovery, but we remain committed to the ongoing successful execution of our business plans and we are taking decisive steps to deliver improved results. We are confident that we continue to make progress, and importantly, we believe this progress translates into improved returns to shareholders. ","Before we turn to questions, as you know, we're among the banks required to participate in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis Review, or CCAR, as it's being called, using stringent stress test scenarios outlined by the Federal Reserve. Our capital plan has been submitted. We expect to receive results by mid-March. We look forward to receiving that analysis, which will give us clarity on a number of issues we believe that are important to our organization. That being said, it is premature for us to comment beyond this point at this time. ","With that, I'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you remind us about the amount of total environmental-related credit costs in your operating expenses? And then more specifically, around the -- how we should think about the decline in those costs through 2012 and then beyond?","David J. Turner","Yes, John, this is David. We have approximately $300 million that are still in the environmental costs. And as we continue to go through 2012 and our credit metrics improve, nonperforming inflows come down, ultimate nonperformers come down, we expect those to trend down in 2012 as well.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then related to that, can you -- or at least on the credit funds, still, can you talk about your expectation for the balance of TDRs, whether we can still expect some increases there on a quarterly basis as you work through some of the CRE?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Barb, I'll ask -- I'll ask Barb Godin to comment on that.","Barbara Godin","Yes, we anticipate that our risks [ph] and TDRs to remain relatively flat. As you know, we've kept our tenure on those pretty short, and the reason for that is so that we can keep our customer talking to us instead of waiting for an extended period of time. So with that, and as the markets improve, we will then start to see the TDRs roll off. But until the economy improves, I would say you're going to see roughly the same level.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, with your expectation for the margin to see some upside here through the year, it's a little bit better than we had thought. And I guess if you could just talk about what changed with your expectation there because I believe you had thought it would be flattish at first? And then are you seeing some stabilization in loan pricing at all?","O. B. Grayson Hall","John, I'll just make a couple of comments, and I'll ask David to comment, as well. When you look at the margin, we do anticipate a continued incremental improvement in the margin. When you look at our margin relative to peers, our margin's lower than the peer median, and we've been working hard to bring that margin back in the line where it should be. Clearly, we've made a lot of progress on the deposit side; still more work to do there. We've brought it much more in line with where it ought to be. The loan pricing is really done one loan at a time, and it is a competitive marketplace where every basis point is a value that's debated. And we're making slow but steady progress on the loan side. Obviously, the reinvestment rate on our investment portfolio was challenged, and we will continue to see that in this rate environment. But we are seeing the opportunity to continue to incrementally improve our margin through 2012. David, do you want to add to that?","David J. Turner","Yes, I'll add to that. Grayson hit on a lot of them. We do believe the impact of the lower NPLs will be positive -- lower excess cash at the Federal Reserve. As we put that to work and are less defensive with our liquidity than we've been from a deposit cost standpoint, while we improved 6 basis points over the quarter, we still think -- we're at 40 basis points; we think we can clearly get in lower than that into the 30s. And I think if you look at our investment portfolio, we started to make some changes there going into different asset classes, and so you'll see some movement there. And then we've been pretty disciplined with our loan portfolio. We are ensuring we are paid for the risk that we take, and we feel like we're going to be able to book loans that are properly priced. And all that together, there's 5 or 6 points, John, when you add them together. It shows an incremental improvement in the margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I had 2 questions. One is, David, as you look at the Morgan Keegan divestiture, now that we can see that discontinued kind of operations, it looks like, on average, it produced about $20 million per quarter in earnings. But if you take that earnings away, it would be about a 5% dilution, probably, to your earnings power. In comparison, issuing $1 billion, which is basically the cash you got out of the divestiture, it could have created close to 15% dilution. So when you finally see the deal done, we only get about 10 basis points in capital ratio improvement. But really, this deal was about the cash and the substitution for having to issue that $1 billion in some common issuance down the road.","David J. Turner","Well, I think, as Grayson mentioned in his comments, really, we're doing 3 things. We're changing our risk profile so that we could focus on our core banking franchise. Liquidity, as you pointed out, is very important to us. That generated a substantial amount of liquidity. And the capital was important, as well. And so if you look at all 3 of those and our continuing involvement with Raymond James -- don't discount that totally, either -- I think your number is a little high in terms of its overall contribution -- core contribution. We had about $0.01 relative to that. So we think, going forward, that this was the right decision for our shareholders, and we'll see what this relationship brings to us on a go-forward basis.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","The other thing that I was looking at was, if you look at the release of loan loss reserve, about $135 million, and you talked about the disposition of your sales and said that the haircut that you took this quarter was basically already provided for, which matches up your $141 million hit on disposition, it was basically what you guided in the release in loan loss reduction this quarter. Are you seeing enough improvement in the overall portfolio that we begin to see some release not just related to the impact from disposition but mainly from the broad portfolio as a whole?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I'll make a couple of comments, Marty, and then ask Barb Godin to speak, as well. Clearly, what we saw this quarter was that generally across every credit metric improvement -- but one thing I would point out we saw was we saw the ability for resolution improve marketably this quarter. And as we look at the marks we're taking on loans, we take our marks and then we also reserve. As we moved it to held for sale, we felt very confident in the marks and the reserves we had taken. Dispositions continue to be a big part of our strategy, and we've been consistent in that and I don't see us deviating from that at this point. Barb, comments?","Barbara Godin","The only other comment I would make is, as you look at the makeup of what came in and also match that up against the makeup of what we had in resolutions, we're pretty well with that inflection point. We're organically -- we're at neutral, and any loan sales that we do clearly are impacting positively our NPL balances. I'd also say, as you look at our -- what we took in terms of a mark, we took 41% on our loan sales of $307 million. We had a 41% mark against that. And again, 10% of that was liquidity premium, just given the way that we've disclosed the fees, including a small group of loans that had a bulk sale associated with it, et cetera. So again, we're feeling pretty good about the way we have our reserve matched up against those portfolios.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And I guess what I'm really trying to get at is, can the release begin to broaden out so that you actually don't have offsetting increase in losses from disposition, you start to get just some release that starts to bring down the impact of the overall net charge-offs?","Matthew Lusco","Marty, it's Matt Lusco. Good question. I would say that our allowance model, really, we look at it more in terms of our portfolio. And it's balanced by, I guess, really the overall economic conditions we're seeing right now, which as Grayson stated, still remain relatively soft. That being said, today, we've only released about $430 million of allowance so that -- yes, we continue to believe we're appropriately reserved and we'll watch and see how the economic conditions moderate over the remainder of the year.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, I mean, Marty, the signs we've seen this quarter are encouraging, and it's just a question of sustainability. And we are encouraged, but we're still being very disciplined about how we run our models and the projections we are making. And as we continue to see early indicators, obviously, the drop in criticized and classified, there was a clear drop in early-stage delinquencies, late-stage delinquencies from fairly relatively flat. So we're seeing a lot of signs that would tell us that the asset quality is improving. But we keep running very disciplined models to make sure we're making the appropriate changes in that allowance as the numbers justify that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Nomura.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just as I was trying to write down all your different points of guidance, I just want to make sure I got it right. So NIM will improve. We've got C&I loan growth, but we have continued reductions in Investor Real Estate. If that's right, when you put it all together, is there any range you can give us of where the overall loan book is likely to bottom? Or I guess, at what level would the C&I growth start outpacing the CRE declines? And then secondly, would you expect the dollars of net interest income to grow from the fourth quarter base? Or is the NIM going up on a smaller balance sheet?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I'll tell you -- just taking a couple of points, Brian. If you look at the opportunities for loan growth over the 2012 time horizon, what we've seen is that we're seeing growth in C&I as the predominant place we're seeing growth. Our commitments have grown faster than our outstandings. Most of that growth has been in the larger end of C&I. When you look at the marketplace, it's been predominantly in the -- up into the larger syndicated markets. We've stayed pretty disciplined in what we're putting on our books. We've very much of a relationship-banking model. Our core competency is really in that middle market and lower end of the upper corporate market. We have had very good results through 2011. That moderated a little bit in the latter part of 2011, and then we saw it accelerate in the last 2 months of the year. Our pipelines are still very solid, so we feel good about the growth there. We feel good about the growth in our specialty industries, in particular asset-based lending, healthcare, energy, and we're still continuing to add resources into those segments. So from a commercial standpoint, we feel good about it. I think when you look at the consumer side, we still are seeing deleveraging on the part of the consumer, but growth in auto to a strong degree. Mortgage has been strong, but we've not held much of that on our balance sheet. We're holding very little of that. We're mostly passing that through. And so when you net it all together, I think consumer is up slightly through '12. And I think that when you look at the commercial, it's going to be a question of how fast -- what's the pace of decline in that investor and commercial real estate portfolio. And I think that is a question we ask ourselves all the time. That's going to have more to do with the economic strength in this country. As the economy recovers, hopefully, we see more demand in that segment. Right now, the strength that we're seeing in that segment is pretty much isolated to multifamily.","David J. Turner","Brian, this is David. I'll add from an NII standpoint, we do see a modest increase in the dollars as well, so it's not just a shrinkage of the earning assets that drives the NIM up. I think that rounds out your first question.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","That does. And I guess to follow up on TARP, I know you're limited in kind of how your things -- what you can say about thinking about the timing. But just as you think about the economics of TARP, I guess one school of thought is that the preferred dividends are pretty significant drag to near-term earnings. And even if you do a pretty sizable capital raise, the EPS in the near term improves because you don't have that dividend anymore. That pays like $0.14 a share per year. And then the other school of thought is, the longer you wait, the better because even though you've got this EPS drag in the near term, the preferred dividend is temporary, while whatever shares you wish you are essentially permanent or, I guess, you can always buy it back in the future, but you're issuing those shares forever. So I mean, as you think through just that economic trade-off between improvement in near-term earnings by canceling out the preferred dividend versus the long-term share count, how do you think about the balance in the trade-off between those 2?","David J. Turner","Well, you've brought up what we've been looking at for a long period of time. We've been very disciplined and patient with regards to TARP. We will continue to be that way. But those are the things we look at, in terms of immediate dilution versus what the dilution would be by paying the dividend. And so we think we needed to get some other things taken care of that would be reflected in the market for our company, which includes return to sustainable profitability, getting credit metrics turning. And we do those things, and as we've demonstrated, we think that all that actually gets taken care of in due course. We don't have specific timing that we can talk about today relative to TARP. As you know, we submitted our capital plan, and we expect to hear back in the middle of March on that. And, perhaps, that will provide clarity with regards to what we do from there.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, I do think it's premature and it's inappropriate for us to give much specific guidance on that. I do think the way you're thinking through the economics of the alternatives -- we had been laboring through those same analysis for several months now, and as David said, have been very patient and prudent in that regard. And we will continue to be so. But it is premature at this point in time for us to communicate anything in regard to that exercise.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","[Technical Difficulty]","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","One question on expenses. You mentioned that they might be down in 2012 over 2011. And I just wanted to check, given the restatement post the Morgan Keegan sale, can you give us a comparison basis of what you're thinking about as far as the expense starting point and then the kind of the go-to decline off of that?","David J. Turner","If you look at our core expenses that are adjusted expenses so it gets goodwill charged out of that, that didn't have Morgan Keegan in it. It's in our supplement. I don't have the page number, but it's off of that base for the year.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Was that about $3.6 billion x the $250 million, then?","David J. Turner","That's right.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But I was looking in the supplement, it's like $3.8 billion something minus its $2.62 million. And that you're saying minus the $250 million, and that's the core?","David J. Turner","That's right.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So a little down off of $3.6 billion. Okay. The second question I had is, you talked about this a little bit on the call a couple of weeks ago, but I wanted to just follow up and try to get a bit more detail. The litigation of reserve, you'd mentioned on the call that, that was a fair value, but that didn't seem to be the max value. So can you walk us through how it works with potential, what's the max exposure on top of the charge that you did that you're going to take upon sale of Morgan Keegan and how that could work in the future?","David J. Turner","I will attempt to get you closer. We do not have a maximum. That question came up last call that we had: was that the maximum? It is not. It is the fair value of our indemnification, which is indemnifying the buyer for all of the pre-closing legal contingencies that exist at Morgan Keegan, and there are several things that are embedded in that. And that fair value number comes -- we get to that number by thinking through possibly with a third party. Any related third party would ask for us to pay them to take that liability or that risk from us. Those cases that are underneath that aren't necessarily probable and estimable under the current accounting guidance, but they're fair value. So we may not have any payments that we have to make out of that. It also includes cost to defend us relative to all the litigation matters that are pre-closing issues. So we have not had a maximum. I can give you as kind of a reference point, if you look in our previous disclosures in the legal footnote, we talked about possible losses that we could have, and we had a range on those possible losses in the 0 to $300 million. These components of the litigation that you're reading about, indemnification is a part of that range of 0 to $300 million.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. Okay. And then one last thing, also related to the last call. In the last call, you mentioned that you want to keep 2 years of cash at the holding company even after a TARP repayment. So can you just walk us through how you think about what 2 years of cash flow is in dollar terms, so that we can try to understand how much cash you'll eventually need to get to the parent company on presuming an eventual TARP payment of $3.5 billion?","David J. Turner","Yes. Ken, I don't have those numbers. I can have List follow up with you specifically on that. But we've had a policy, a long-standing policy, that we would have 2 years' worth of debt service dividends and so forth in the parent company. And all we're trying to say is, we're going to continue to maintain that policy. We think that's the right thing to do.","O. B. Grayson Hall","We think it's been an appropriate policy we've had in place for a good long time. And the only thing we communicated in the last call is we plan to continue to adhere to that policy.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Can you just then tell us how much cash was at the parent company at March 31?","David J. Turner","At March or December?","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, at December. My bad.","O. B. Grayson Hall","We can get that number.","David J. Turner","About $2.6 billion.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two unrelated questions. First, on the NPA inflows, they've been coming down. But obviously, it's been a little bit of a bumpy leg down. But clearly, downward trends, stable in 1Q. I guess as we think from a timing point of view throughout 2012, are there any pluses and minuses that we should be focused on, whether it's a bunch of loans coming due or seasonality? It feels like kind of one quarter in each of the last couple of years has had a blip up, and any forecast of that, that would be helpful in advance, of course.","Barbara Godin","Matt, this is Barb. I would say the general projection is, we're looking at that continuing to show improvement for 2012. The last couple of years, we've shown that there's a slight increase in the third quarter. I would attribute that to seasonality. The rise last quarter was not -- in the third quarter was not as big as the rise in 2010. So we hope that it, too, would modify in 2012. But if there's going to be any kind of a small bump, it's likely to be in the third quarter. But again, even from where I sit right now, we just see continued improvement.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then separately, as we think about capital build from here, you still have, I think, about 50 basis points of disallowed DTA. And obviously, making money brings that back. But just give us a sense of the timing of which you think you might get some of that back? Are there any nuances beyond just positive EPS that might allow some of that to come back?","David J. Turner","No, Matt. You've really got it, it's based on projections. We look at that every quarter. We project out the next 12 months from the measurement date, and we expect that to start coming in, in 2012. Won't have all of it, but a decent portion of that comes into the capital calculation throughout 2012.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And I guess just putting it all together, it seems like there's some DTA's coming back in, some positive earnings and RWAs sound like they're still going to trickle down a little bit. Do you think the Tier 1 common gets to the 9% range by the end of the year?","David J. Turner","No. I think, honestly, we have a lot going on relative to our CCAR submission, which includes our forecast of where we think capital ratios will be at any point in time along the 2 years. And I think it'd be a little be premature to talk about specifics in terms of our capital plan right now. We'll probably wait until we hear back from our supervisors. That might be a more appropriate time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just had 2 follow-up questions. The first is on Matt's question with regard to the DTA. With this year, you have 3 years of GAAP loss. Should we -- will the accountants get more worried about 3 years of GAAP loss with regards to your GAAP DTA? Or it's not as relevant because it's not the timing difference between the loan losses and the provision that caused that GAAP loss, but it was the goodwill impairment?","David J. Turner","Yes, from a GAAP standpoint, different from what Matt just mentioned, that was a regulatory issue and the past losses really aren't applicable to that conversation. But from a GAAP standpoint, we have to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax asset every quarter. And at year end, obviously, our auditors sign off on that relative to the financial statements. When we have to support that, we do look at continuing losses, but we also look at the content of those continuing losses. And when you have an unusual event or item, like a goodwill impairment charge, you can take that into account in terms of providing support and basis for whether or not you need to have a valuation allowance. We did not add a valuation allowance. We don't believe one is required other than a small one that we have for some state net operating loss carryforwards. But we don't believe that there's any big valuation allowance required for deferred tax assets. Our core operations are profitable and have been for the year, and so I think -- and we expect that to continue. So we don't see the need for valuation allowance.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That was helpful. And my second follow-up question is on the guidance for NIM improvement. That does not include any potential financing plans or issuance of debt regarding potential TARP repayment, correct?","David J. Turner","Well, we get into specifics related to the capital plan. I would just say that, taking into account everything that we think we need to do, our NIM would increase.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you talk about the regulatory constraints on the Regions Bank subsidiaries' ability to upstream capital to the holding company? So really, kind of dividend capacity in 2012?","David J. Turner","Craig, as you know, the regulators have rules in terms of the earnings that you have to have, looking at the last 2 years' worth of earnings that you have to have without receiving any approval from them. So you'll see that disclosed in our 10-K in terms of, without prior approval, what that number is. I don't have that with me right at this moment, but that's really the constraint without prior regulatory approval.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And do you, by any chance, have the common equity Tier 1 level of the Regions Bank offhand?","David J. Turner","I can get that for you if you give me just a minute. I can tell you the leverage.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And what's the Tier 1 leverage?","David J. Turner","It is -- I said that too quick. 9.6. It was 9 points in the third quarter and 9.6 at the end of the fourth quarter.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And maybe just a follow-up while you're looking for that. In the 4-basis-point increase in loan yields, if we kind of oversimplify this trend when we looking at, what was driven by the change in rates, mainly LIBOR, and what was driven by the change in spreads repricing? How can you kind of -- how can you break up that 4 basis point in terms of the contribution?","David J. Turner","I don't know that I have the specifics in terms of whether it was -- what amount we have for repricing?","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Was it mostly repricing then?","David J. Turner","Most of it would be through repricing.","O. B. Grayson Hall","There's a slight improvement in LIBOR, but I think most of that came from repricing and new loans.","David J. Turner","Tier 1 at the bank -- Tier 1 risk base at the bank is 12.86. And the leverage was 9.7 instead of 9.6.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess the Tier 1 common ratio was in the mid-9s?","David J. Turner","No, 12.7.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I thought that was the Tier 1 risk-base, not the Tier 1 common?","David J. Turner","Yes, that's right. That wouldn't be really applicable, anyway, to the bank, the common.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jefferson Harralson of KBW.","Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. As you guys have talked about the, I guess, the ongoing relationship with Raymond James, can you just talk about the nature of what that venture is and what the revenue stream consists of there?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Jefferson, I think it's a little early to do that. I mean, we have started a very productive relationship and held conversations going on in a number of fronts. Since we've signed a definitive agreement with Raymond James 2 weeks ago, we've had a number of meetings, and we continue to be encouraged about where we think that relationship is going. It's a little early for us to start assigning revenue streams to that today, because clearly, we're still try to define some of that. But I would bring you back to the fact that Morgan Keegan and the associates there, and the leadership team there, has been part of this company since 2001. There's some very strong relationships built there. I'd also remind you that Raymond James has been a long-time customer of the bank, and so we know the leadership team there very well. And we continue to believe that there are future opportunities that are undefined at this point in time, but we fully intend to define those over the next several weeks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A quick question. On the write-downs that you guys took, could you share with us what the dollar amount was for Morgan Keegan? And then in the goodwill impairment charge for ongoing operations, what are the operations for those that was applied to?","David J. Turner","Yes.","O. B. Grayson Hall","David can explain that, but the goodwill calculation is really based off the segment reporting we're doing every quarter.","David J. Turner","Yes, Gerard, I know it seems odd, but the goodwill calculation -- the first half of the goodwill calculation is at the segment level. The segment included primarily Morgan Keegan, what we sold to Raymond James, but excluded trust. And so when we evaluate the whole segment's goodwill, we ended up impairing virtually all of it. Well we did impair all of it. But you have that impairment and allocate that impairment. The allocation of the impairment then has to be made on a relative fair value basis between the discontinued operation and the continuing operation. And that's why you end up having the impairment attributed to continuing. And it looks like it was related to trust; it is not. It's related to the segment.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Speaking of Morgan Keegan, are there any reps and warranties regarding the large producers at Morgan Keegan if they leave before the deal closes? Would that impact the price?","O. B. Grayson Hall","There is a -- if you look at the agreement that was signed, that we filed, you can see that there is a post-closing adjustment language in there that talks about production and retention of large producers. We continue to be very confident that we've got a retention plan in place and enthusiasm in place with the team to hold those producers in place. But that risk is there.","David J. Turner","That risk, Gerard, lasts for 90 days post-closing. And when you read the agreement, you'll see that there was a rep that the buyer put in an appropriate retention plan, on top of the existing retention that existed with the company, to reduce the risk of revenue producers leaving, because they don't want revenue producers leaving. Nor do we. And we think that, that's been taken care of.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And the final question is, when you guys get back to normalcy on earnings and profitability, what type of efficiency ratio do you think you're going to need to get to, to reach that normalcy and profitability?","David J. Turner","We've talked for a while now about wanting to get to into that high '50s, low '60s rate. We actually think that we can do -- be in the 50 range, in that mid to upper 50 range from an efficiency ratio, in time, as certain costs abate, as we continue to do and improve from a revenue standpoint as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Fitzsimmons of Sandler O'Neill.","Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","This is probably for Matt. I just wanted to get any kind of update in your thinking in terms of the timing or what you all have to do to get upgraded back to investment grade status, and the timing of that and then what that would mean for you from a financial standpoint in terms of lifting some drag.","David J. Turner","This is David. I'll take that, Kevin. We've spent a lot of time with rating agencies explaining kind of what our plan has been. We think our continued -- our return to sustainable profitability and our return to credit metrics were critical to getting our ratings stabilized in some cases and working on upgrades in the others. And we think that timing --  and to the extent we can continue to execute on our business plan, our credit continues to improve as we demonstrated through the fourth quarter, that we'd be in position to receive an appropriate adjustment to our ratings. So we clearly can't -- we don't know what the rating agencies will do, when they will do it, but we know the things that we need to do, which is that continued improvement in performance, including improvement in credit metrics.","Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And this is just more of a housekeeping thing, but your line item within fee income brokerage, investment banking, capital markets, that's a very small amount, obviously, now post-Morgan Keegan. What's left in there? And is that going to be something you continue to break out? Or is that going to be folded within something else going forward?","David J. Turner","Yes, we've looked at that. We'll probably change the title on a go-forward basis, but it's got our capital markets group in there. We do foreign exchange and derivative transactions and hedging things of that nature.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of, I guess, housekeeping questions. First of all, in terms of the Durbin mitigation, you said you certainly plan to mitigate most, if not all, of that. I'm just curious as to the timing of that and if you're getting somewhat faster mitigation than you previously anticipated, given some of the steps that you've already rolled out, that you've discussed earlier in the call.","O. B. Grayson Hall","No. I mean, what we've said is, we will mitigate that revenue loss over time. We do believe that time through 2012 that we will get the majority of that cost mitigated; not entirely, but the majority. We think that, so far, our numbers appear to be tracking where we thought they would. We've had some of the products that we've introduced. They've been slightly more successful than we had anticipated. The conversion from free checking to a fee-eligible checking, our numbers there have been almost spot on of what we had forecasted. So I would say no real surprises. We continue to be slightly ahead of where we had projected from a service charge revenue standpoint, but only slightly. So we still feel confident that our plans are working. And while it's been a challenge, I think that we've met that challenge very well.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just switching gears. In terms of the margin, you mentioned a little bit less than $12 billion of CDs are going to mature. What is your expectation in terms of the percentage of that amount that you will retain?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Matt, a lot of that depends on what our competitors are doing. But we've obviously had -- in total deposits, we've stayed fairly stable. We've been down slightly. But as we've shifted dollars from time deposits into low-cost deposits, we've had a fairly strong retention of the dollars in the bank. But we also -- when you look at maturing CDs, what we've experienced is a retention rate of about 60% to 70% of them stay in a CD or time deposit product, and we don't see that changing in 2012. But obviously, the competitive pressures could change and alter that, but we don't anticipate that at this juncture.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Sure. And then just one question in terms of the environmental costs. You mentioned that you expect that the $300 million that you're currently experiencing in environmental costs should be down a little bit in 2012. And I guess I'm just curious as to how those of us in the outside might get a sense as to the trend. And one way other banks have suggested we might look at that is just the trend in overall OREO amounts. Is that a reasonable proxy for thinking about the pace of the decline in environmental costs for Regions this year?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, I mean, I think the way I would look at it if I was trying to find a positive correlation, as I do think assets that are held in OREO are held for sale, as well, as overall asset quality trends would be where I think the correlation on those environmental costs would be at.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Ketron of UBS.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a question on the -- a follow-up question on the margin. When you look at the CD rates, if you go back to the first quarter of 2011, which, I think, is one of the higher maturity quarters, we saw the margin jump about 8 basis points and the yield on CDs drop about 20 basis points. Is that -- looking at your maturities and the going-out rate for the CDs in 2012, is it possible to see that kind of similar action? And where do you think the CD rates for the portfolio could ultimately reach?","O. B. Grayson Hall","When you look at roughly $11.6 billion, $11.7 billion in maturities we have for '12, you don't see that abnormally large group of maturities in the first quarter that you saw last year on high rates. It's spread out more evenly this year than what you saw last year, and probably a little more heavy in the second and third quarter than in first.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So is it fair to say, as you think about the margin improvement this year, it would be more of a gradual improvement instead of maybe a large jump?","O. B. Grayson Hall","That's what we were trying to communicate. We believe if they've continued to play out as we see them today, that if they play out that way, that we would see an incremental improvement in our margin over the course of the year. We don't see that being a rapid jump in the first quarter and then leveling out. We think it will be gradual throughout the year. But if you look at our time deposits, we're down to -- just slightly over 20% of our deposit mix is now in-time deposits. We can see that -- we see that percentage continuing to fall throughout 2012.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And what is the new CD rate that you're seeing on average?","O. B. Grayson Hall","It depends on term. Obviously, customer selects the term. But when you look at overall mix, we're probably coming on new CDs probably in a 30 to 35-basis-point range, all in.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And one final question on loan growth. As we play out 2012, you have runoff in areas like investor commercial real estate. Could we expect to see any type of change? We've seen some people commit more mortgage production to the balance sheet. Is that something that you all would consider?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes. We continue to revisit that question every month, and certainly could alter that decision if we thought circumstances warranted it. I think the question on how much earning asset growth we have this year is really is just going to depend on what is the pace of decline that we continue to see in investor commercial real estate. We do anticipate that pace of decline to moderate over the course of '12. In terms of balance sheet, we're seeing the assets on the consumer side that we have for the consumer, whether it's in equity line and first residential mortgages, continue to decline roughly $100 million each per month. But if we were to elect to keep more residential first mortgages on the balance sheet, we would actually alter that pace of decline on that particular asset type. But we also are encouraged by some of the growth we're seeing in some of our other products. And so if we can get to the point we're outpacing the decline in Investor Real Estate, we'll have net growth, and that's -- we're looking for that inflection point.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners.","Christopher W. Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to explore the disclosure you gave about the Business Services on the criticized information, particularly in Investor Real Estate, the improvements on special mention and substandard. What's driving that? And is there anything unusual happening in this quarter that may not be repeated in future quarters?","Barbara Godin","Things are getting better, quite frankly, in that space. But I think part of it is perhaps just the driver bias. Those that have lasted this long are able to last a little bit longer, and they're hanging on to better days. I think we saw the early fallout, and that's been a lot of what we've seen in the last couple of years. In terms of our charge-offs, there are things moving to criticized and classified. But we again -- we're seeing just an overall improvement in that sector right now.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, and Chris, I'd also say, when you look at, the most troubled part of our portfolio has been in land, single-family and condo. And if you look in our release, you'll see that's down to about $1.8 billion. And so in that -- to Barb's point, that exposure's now reduced, and those borrowers have made it this far. I would tell you also, in certain geographies, we're seeing geographies that have been pretty stressed throughout this cycle starting to turn in much better numbers. So it's just where we are in the cycle, quite frankly.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Hall for closing remarks.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, thank you for your time and interest in Regions Financial. We certainly appreciate it and respect it. So thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.","List Underwood","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation on our call this morning.","Our presenters today are Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer; and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of our Executive Management Team are present and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also, as part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","Finally, let me remind you that in this call and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking statement that is located in the Appendix section of the presentation.","Grayson?","Grayson Hall","Thank you, List, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased you could join us for this morning as we review our fourth quarter and our full year 2014 results.","This quarter we reported $195 million of net income available to common shareholders, bringing our full year results to $1.1 billion of net income available to common shareholders and earnings per diluted share of $0.80, an increase of 4% over 2013.","Included in the earnings were some unusual items which David will address in his remarks. Overall these results reflects steady progress in 2014 as we continue to focus on the fundamentals of banking and meeting customer needs through service and innovation, while maintaining a prudent and disciplined risk culture.","In 2014, we grew loans and deposits. We expanded our customer base. We prudently managed expenses. We improved asset quality and improved our capital ratios. Loans increased to a total of $3 billion or 4% during 2014. Importantly, this growth was broad based with both the business and consumer loan portfolios increasing.","In 2014, deposits increased $2 billion or 2%, while deposit cost reached historic lows. Through the successful execution of Regions360, which is our prescriptive approach to relationship banking, the number of quality households increased and we grew the number of checking, savings, credit card and wealth management accounts.","We believe this growth positions us well as we head into 2015. We remain focused on achieving operational efficiencies and reduced full year expenses on an adjusted basis by 2% from the previous year. An example of our efforts during the fourth quarter, we made a decision to consolidate 50 branch offices or approximately 3% of our network in locations across our markets.","Over time, we expect to add branches in higher opportunity markets such as St Louis, Atlanta, Houston and New Orleans. Through improved technology, these smaller branches will employ different staffing models and will be far more efficient.","In 2014, our asset quality continued to improve, reflecting our continued, prudent risk discipline practices. In fact, all our credit metrics experienced improvement in 2014. As a result of this progress and citing improvement in our overall risk profile, we received positive rating actions from four major credit rating agencies this past year.","Also during 2014, our capital returned to shareholders totaled approximately $500 million. This included and increased our quarterly dividend as well as share repurchases.","With respect to future capital deployment, as you are aware, we submitted our capital plan earlier this month and expect to receive the result sometime in March. Clearly we believe that our capital position is sufficient to support both the return of capital and strong organic growth.","With that said returning capital to shareholders is a top priority and given the strength of our current capital levels we believe is appropriate to increase our total payout ratio.","In 2015, in addition to effectively deploying capital, we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage and keenly focused on revenue diversification.","Shifting to the economic environment, I want to talk briefly about the recent declines in oil prices and its impact on our energy lending portfolio. We're closely monitoring the price declines for direct and indirect impacts to our overall loan portfolio quality.","Our bank has extensive energy lending expertise dating back multiple decades and through numerous energy cycles. Our core exploration and production loans at present are well secured and provide a collateral cushion to withstand price declines.","In terms of broader impact, we have been monitoring markets such as Texas and the Gulf Coast for signs of weakness in employment and housing. However, we're not seeing any material weakness past this point in time. We have provided additional detail regarding our energy portfolio in the appendix of the earnings presentation.","As we look ahead, we expect improved growth in the U.S. economy in 2015. Low energy prices should provide a tailwind to consumer spending and the manufacturing sector. However, an uncertain global growth environment does pose some risk. As a result, we continue to expect an increase in short-term rates in the latter part of 2015. ","With that, I'll turn it over to David, who will cover the details of the fourth quarter. David?","David Turner","Thank you. And good morning, everyone. I'll first take you through the fourth quarter details and then wrap up with expectations for 2015.","Loan balances totaled $77 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up $700 million or 1% from the end of the previous quarter. Business lending finished the year strong, totaling $48 billion at the end of the quarter. This was an increase of $524 million or 1% from the third quarter as production increased 18%.","Commercial and industrial loans grew $875 million or 3% from the prior quarter. This growth was driven by our specialized industries group, as well as Regions' business capital. Importantly, line utilization increased 40 basis points. Commitments for new loans increased 3% and our pipelines remain strong.","Regarding investor real estate, ending balances were relatively steady from the previous quarter at approximately $7 billion. As we have previously stated, investor real estate remains an important part of our corporate bank strategy, given our market presence in the South East.","Moving to consumer lending, loans in this portfolio increased 1% linked quarter. Growth in the consumer portfolio was led by indirect auto lending as balances increased 3% from the prior quarter.","While we benefitted from the robust market for auto sales, process improvements instituted earlier in the year also contributed to the growth.","Credit card balance has increased $45 million or 5% from the previous quarter. This improvement was driven by a 6% increase in spending as well as a 3% increase in active card holders.","Mortgage balances were up modestly. Meanwhile total home equity balances were down slightly as the pace of loan payoffs was slightly higher than new production.","Total home equity production increased 10% from the previous quarter as customers continued to take advantage of lower rates on variable home equity lines of credit.","This quarter other consumer loans were up just over 1% as a result of the introduction of several new products and improved customer delivery.","Let\u2019s take a look at deposit. Supported by our multichannel platform, total deposits continued to grow increasing $70 million during the fourth quarter. Of note, low-cost deposits grew by $242 million and continued to account for 91% of total deposits. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels and totalled 11 basis points, while total funding costs declined to 29 basis points in the quarter.","Let's take a look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $87 million. Net interest margin was 3.17%, a decline of one basis point from the third quarter.","Despite a continuation of low rate environment which exerted pressure on asset yields, both net interest income and net interest margin remained relatively stable with the previous quarter.","Stability in both measures was largely attributable to higher average loan balances and lower cash balances.","Total non-interest income declined $30 million or 6% in the fourth quarter. Services charges declined $40 million from the previous quarter and this was primarily due to a $4 million decline in fees resulting from a product discontinuation in the fourth quarter.","Additionally there was an $8 million reduction in revenue related to customer reimbursements.","Mortgage income was down $12 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to lower gains from loan sales and a decline in the market valuation of the mortgage servicing portfolio, net of hedging activity.","In the fourth quarter we purchased servicing rights on $833 million of loans, bringing our total servicing portfolio to $40 billion. We have the operational capacity to take on additional servicing volume and we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to add volume to our servicing portfolio.","While mortgage production declined in 2014, the pace of our decline was less than the industry. Originations continue to be driven by new home purchases and represented on average 70% of total originations in the fourth quarter. Based on what we know today, we expect mortgage production in 2015 to exceed that of 2014.","Capital markets income decreased $4 million quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by credit valuation adjustments on interest rate swaps. Absent these adjustments, capital markets income increased slightly from the prior quarter.","As we continue to build out our capital markets capabilities, we believe that\u2019s it indications in real estate capital markets represent opportunities for us.","Card and ATM fees increased as a result of higher spending and transaction volumes. And wealth management income also increased and as a company continues to expand and deepen relationship with new and existing customers.","While we had experienced headwinds as it relates to non interest income growth, we have several initiatives currently underway to offset these pressures. As Grayson mentioned throughout 2015 we will focus on diversifying our revenue.","Let's move on to expenses. Total expenses in the fourth quarter were $969 million, an increase of $143 million which included some unusual items. As a reminder, there in the third quarter we benefited from the recovery of expenses related to unfunded commitments of $24 million.","This was partially offset by expenses related to Visa Class B shares sold in prior years which resulted in $7 million of additional expense in the third quarter.","As Grayson mentioned, we intend to consolidate 50 branches in 2015 and incur related expense of $10 million during the fourth quarter. We expect to incur additional related expenses of approximately $15 million in the first quarter of 2015 related to this consolidation.","Also at the end of the quarter, we recorded an accrual of $100 million for contingent, legal and regulatory items related to previously disclosed matters. And although you may have additional questions, please recognize that we cannot comment beyond this disclosure at this time.","Salaries and benefits remain flat from the previous quarter, although headcount increased 124 positions. Importantly, the majority of these positions are revenue generating or revenue support roles and drive future growth in revenue.","Additionally, we had incremental hires and capital planning and risk management this quarter. However, at this juncture we believe that, hires of this nature are substantially complete.","Total credit expenses remained low. However, fourth quarter expenses increased slightly as a benefit related to gains from our held for sale portfolio diminished as balances declined along with the seasonal uptick in OREO property tax expense.","Outside services increased due to third party engagements to support risk management and capital planning functions. However, these third party expenses should begin to subside and I\u2019ll talk about that in just a minute.","We remain diligent with respect to expense control but we have opportunistically invested in talent and technology to further accelerate our momentum to grow revenue.","Let's move on to asset quality. Our overall asset quality remained solid as most credit metrics improved in the quarter. Our nonperforming loans, excluding loans held for sale, declined 1% linked quarter.","In addition, at quarter end, our loan-loss allowance to nonperforming loans or coverage ratio was 133%. Compared to the third quarter, total delinquencies declined 11% and troubled debt restructuring or TDRs declined 6%. In addition, both criticized and classified loans declined from the prior quarter.","Net charge-offs totalled $83 million representing 42 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $8 million or $75 million less than that charge-offs. And based on what we know today, we expect favorable asset quality trends to continue. However at this point of cycle, volatility and certain metrics can be expected.","Let's move on to capital liquidity. We continue to maintain industry leading capital levels. At the end of the quarter, our estimated Tier 1 ratio stood at 12.5% and our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.6%. Further, we estimate our fully phased in Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio to be 11.1%.","During the quarter, we repurchased $248 million of stock as far as the Board approved program that totalled $350 million dollars. We expect to complete this program during the first quarter of 2015.","The liquidity at the bank and the holding company remains solid with a low loan deposit ratio of 82%. In regarding the liquidity coverage ratio, Regions remains well positioned to be fully compliant with the January 2016 implementation.","Now, throughout 2015 we will update customer agreements to include LCR friendly language, to modify existing deposit products and we also plan to create new products and services to compliment our strong position of high quality liquid assets and it's important to note, that no major balance sheet initiatives are necessary in a order for us to be compliant.","And now I want to take a few minutes and touch on our expectations for 2015. We expect total loan growth in the 4% to 6% range. Commercial investor loans are expected to drive the loan growth with the business lending portfolio - within the business lending portfolio.","Also we believe that investor real estate portfolio has reached a point of stabilization. However, growth will be limited as we remain committed to our risk tolerance levels, as it relates to this portfolio.","Looking at the consumer lending book, we expect continued growth from indirect auto lending. We plan to continue to focus on driving better pull through rates, increasing margins and improving overall credit profiles.","Additionally we are focused on expanding lending through online and point of sale financing alternatives directly and through partnership with third parties. As a result, we expect to pace our growth in the other consumer category to accelerate in 2015.","And moving onto credit card, today our marketing efforts have primarily targeted our existing customer base. As a result, our penetration rate is up 190 basis points over the last year. This increase coupled with an increase in sales of new cards, should drive balanced growth in the near term.","We expect incremental growth and mortgage balances during 2015 as the pace of production should more than outpace refinancing activity.","From a production perspective, consumer lending closed the year on a strong note. In fact, December was a strongest single production month of the year.","With respect to deposits, balances should grow at similar rates as 2014. As a reminder, a significant portion of our deposits were made up of individual deposits, which turn to be more granular, smaller in size which based on our research should be more stable and less rate sensitive in a rising rate environment.","With deposit cost, deposit and funding costs expected to remain stable at historically low levels, there is limited ability to offset the continued effect of the low rate environment on margin. That being said, the net interest market would be expected to remain stable to trending higher in a moderately rising rate environment in 2015.","And if current market conditions prevail, then net interest margin is expected to relatively stable next quarter. However, with rates at current levels, the net interest margin would experience gradual pressure over the year.","For example, if the ten year treasury yield would remain in the 175% to 2% range throughout 2015, we would expect 10 to 12 basis points of margin pressure.","From an NIR standpoint, we expect this line item to grow in 2015 resulting from our investments that we have made in wealth management and in our corporate bank. Specifically, we made investment in insurance, investment services, institutional services and private wealth management.","Additionally, our investments in capital markets, Fannie Mae just is an example. And new hires related to our power and utilities in financial services team and treasury management corporate banks are expected to pay off in 2015. And finally, mortgage should have a stronger 2015 than 2014.","From an expense standpoint, we will continue to focus on our cost. Our largest categories, salaries and benefits, occupancy, and furniture and fixtures will be areas of focus in 2015. In addition, third party consulting cost is another area where we have opportunity to reduce those expenditures. All-in-all, we expect to generate positive operating leverage for 2015.","Now let me close by saying that 2014 was the year of solid progress and we are diligently focused on executing our strategies as we head into 2015.","With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning and now I'll turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","List Underwood","Thanks David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session of our call.","In order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning, I would please ask each caller to limit yourself to one primary question and one related follow-up question. Now let's open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Good morning. Just I heard you loud and clear in terms of your NIR guidance for the year. But I was wondering if we could get a little bit of clarity on the starting point. This is the first question.","Is the $4 million decline in fees resulting from product discontinuation the final impact from that discontinuation? And is it fair for us to add back the customer reimbursements of $4 million and the CVA adjustment - the customer reimbursement of $8 million and the CVA adjustment of $4 million, back to the 448.","Grayson Hall","Erika, the discontinuation $4 million just about $3.5 million left there and that will be done. And yes, the $8 million should be non-recurring, so that is - your conclusion is appropriate there.","Erika Najarian","In terms of your guidance of positive operating leverage, if the ten-year does stay between 1.75% to 2% range, and the Fed doesn\u2019t move, can you continue to chop away at the efficiency ratio, I think on a core basis I calculated 66.8% this quarter.","Grayson Hall","Erika, I think that if rates were to stay where they\u2019re at, and that the Fed does not raise rates this year, obviously we\u2019ve got to manage through that possibility and as David said earlier, we\u2019re focused on remaining very disciplined and very keenly focused on opportunities to continue to rationalize our expenses across the company. We\u2019ll have to continue to do that and we think we\u2019ve proven that if you look backwards in terms of how we\u2019ve managed expenses.","Moving forward, obviously in this rate environment it means that we\u2019ve really got to raise the bar if you will on that activity and I think you should continue to see us look at ways to rationalize expenses across the franchise as we had mentioned we had announced the closure and consolidation of 50 offices, I think since - if you look back over the past few years, we\u2019ve reduced our physical footprints some 20%, as well as attacked expenses across the franchise and across channels.","David, anything to add?","David Turner","I think we have to continue to look at our total business in terms of expense management under any scenario, any rate environment.","We do believe that there is a tendency to have short term rates go up towards the back end of the year still, we believe that's what the Fed wants to do. We have to be prepared in case that's not the case, and so we\u2019re committed to seeking positive operating leverage in any scenario. It gets harder if rates stay lower.","Erika Najarian","Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Wonder if you can give us a little more color on the 2015, margin outlook. Is that expectation for 10 to 12 basis points of compression, is that incremental off of the fourth quarter margin number? In other words, from this fourth quarter till the fourth quarter of 2015, or is that full year 2015 margin on an average basis versus the full year 2014 margin?","David Turner","That\u2019s really leveraging, John, of the fourth quarter where we are right now, and that would be - the impact of that really would be felt later in the year versus the earlier in the year. Again, to the extent that that\u2019s a sustainable 1.75% to 2%, throughout 2015.","John Pancari","And you just alluded to what my follow was going to be on the margin, so therefore, if that's the case, the Fed does nothing, next quarter you\u2019ve got a flattish margin, however from the second, third, and fourth quarter, for 2015, you expect 10 to 12 bps of compression during that period, so what is implying that drop-off? Because that does imply pretty good down tick from here.","David Turner","Well, I think we\u2019d continue to see the negative impacts of lower rates on reinvestment yields in particular where we\u2019re having to put to work $300 million, $400 million of cash every month. And you continue to see the rollover effect of lower rates in the loan book as well.","So, we think that if you look at where we think the Fed's going to be towards the middle of the year, we think you\u2019ll start seeing some pressure to increase short term rates, and so we haven\u2019t abandoned that, what we wanted to try to do is put some sensitivities and some extent that that does not happen.","And at the \u2013 ten-year [Inaudible] rates also stay lower. So, we\u2019re not saying that\u2019s what will happen or that we expect that to happen, we were just trying to give you a little bit sensitivity of possibly what could happen.","John Pancari","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Good morning. David, just to follow up on the expense side, understanding the clear focus on operating leverage. Last year you were able to also help us understand the directional dollars on the expense side - and you did a really good job of getting it down two and change percent.","So with all these pushes and pulls and wanting to leave the door open on investments, so can you help us frame an understanding of where you think expense dollars can go given that premise of uncertainty on the revenue side?","David Turner","We think, Ken, we\u2019ve made investments in a number of areas this year because we believe growing revenue is important for our franchise, we\u2019ve hired people to do that. We\u2019ve hired some late in the year that will have full run rate going forward. We have the negative impact of tension that will hit us for 2015, that\u2019s about $25 million in total for the year. So, call it $6 million per quarter.","So with that and the investments we\u2019ve made - we\u2019re talking about expense management and revenue together in terms of positive operating leverage versus a commitment on just expense levels because we\u2019ve needed to make these investments to grow revenue. We think they\u2019ll pay off and so I guess the best I can do to describe where you want to go is that positive operating leverage is something that we should be able to achieve in 2015.","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. And then, on the C side, just coming back to - also expecting growth there, I am assuming that\u2019s off of your adjusted 17.84 base.","But what I wanted to dig down into is that, I am assuming that's inclusive of the $3.5 million of that lingering deposit advance run off. And then also, can you just remind us, is it also inclusive of the expected overdraft charge changes as well?","David Turner","It does include both of those.","Ken Usdin","And then my last one just on that last point is, any update or changes with regards to the numbers you\u2019ve tried to put around your \u2013 that potential delta on deposit - on overdrafts? Thanks.","David Turner","No. We're doing some pilots right now on that posting order, and nothing's come to our attention that calls us to want to change that guidance we gave you 10 to 15 per quarter, when implemented.","Ken Usdin","Thanks David.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, one clarification question just on NIM outlook, I just want to make sure - in your second bullet point where you say, if the ten year yield were 1.75% to 2%, that would drive 10 to 12 basis points of NIM pressure throughout 2015. Does that scenario also include your base case scenario for the front end moving up in the middle of the year?","Grayson Hall","We have incorporated - we have our base case in terms of the front end moving up, and what we\u2019re trying to say is that we have - this risk would be on top of what we already project for that, so you could take our base case and then take 10 to 12 basis points on top of that.","But that really is - the 10 to 12 - we think we\u2019ll have relatively stable margin like I said in the first quarter even in low persistent rate environment.","The impact starts - it could be felt later in the year. Really in the third and fourth quarter it\u2019s more pervasive.","Betsy Graseck","Right, so then if there\u2019s no rate hike at the front end of the curve, does that - how does that impact your outlook, would that be incremental negative or not material?","Grayson Hall","It would be, but that impact would be felt later in the year as well. We didn\u2019t really have a full effect until the end of the year anyway.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay, and then just on the branch consolidation, the 50 branches in 2015, could you give us some color as to have extensive the review was of the branch network, and is this a beginning of consolidation or does this get you largely through what you intend to do on the network?","Grayson Hall","Thus we've been -- we've been very disciplined about doing an annual review of our multi-channel delivery system, branches being part of that. When we look at investments that we're making in branches, our ATMs, mobile homeland contact center, we look at across the channels, we may convert irrational decision on what we're investing in there.","If you look at what we've done on physical branch presence, as I mentioned over the past, five, seven years we've probably consolidated over 20% of our franchise. From a branch account standpoint, we're around 1,666 offices today.","We continue -- we will continue to look at that on an annual basis. It's an ongoing process for us. It's not a one-time and done, but it's rather part of how we think about our customer deliver points and so you should anticipate we will continue to do this each and every year.","Betsy Graseck","All right. And the cost of closing the branches is in line with what you've done previously. I am just wondering if\u2026","Grayson Hall","Yes, we've got pretty good experience based on this and not only from a estimating the cost -- the cost reductions that come out of those branches, but just as importantly is retention of customer relationships as we close with branches and so we think we -- from an modeling standpoint, we think we've got pretty good model and we understand how to execute on branch consolidations and closures.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then I guess just a last follow-up here is on the online product that you indicated in the prepared remarks that in the other consumer category should expect to accelerate in part from the online lending focus. Could you give us some color on what you mean by that, what you're investing in and how any pilots are going?","Grayson Hall","The conclusion -- we continue to look at both online and mobile, both of those channels have very strong growth rates year-over-year and most of those, most of that activity as you are well aware is around fairly routine bank transactions, balance inquiry, funds transfer, bill payment.","But all the things we've discovered through some of the product innovation we've had over the two last two or three years is that the desire for customers to also have the ability to borrow money online and also borrow money at point of sale and so we are introducing a number of new online capabilities as well as some partnership capabilities we have on a sale.","That's an activity that we'll be making announcements on as the year progresses and it's just a way to extend our brand further into market places that we are as dominant today.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks for the color there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Bill.","Bill Carcache","Good morning. Thank you. I had a question on asset quality remained strong, but I am trying to get a sense for how we should think about the trajectory of your net charge-off rate. It looks like it troughed at 35 basis points in the second quarter and it's been rising three to four basis points since per quarter.","And I guess as we look ahead, should we continue to expect that kind of similar level of quarterly increase over the next few quarters as credit normalizes? I guess at what point does it level out assuming credit conditions remain favorable? Any color around that would be helpful.","David Turner","One of the things we're going to leave in our prepared comments is when you get this down to this level of charge-offs in particular, you can see volatility in any given quarter. We're trying to leave you with you the conclusion that in particular if you look at criticizing Class 5 loans, that's one of the earliest indicators of where your credit quality is going.","That would imply that over time, we see the charge-off rate continuing to come down. Where it settles out we'll have to see, but we don't believe that the level it's at now is fixed. We believe that does come down.","Assuming that condition, economic conditions continue to perform where they are now. So you have to make your own assessment as to where that might -- that terminal value would be, but it should -- it should be lower than what it is over time.","Bill Carcache","Okay. I think -- separate question on auto, can you talk about the nature of your relationship with your dealer partners in the indirect auto lending side of your business and address specifically how dealer participation works.","In particular I wondering how much freedom your dealer partners have to charge auto loan customers rates that are above and beyond the rate at which you're willing to underwrite a loan?","David Turner","So we have almost 1,700 dealers today. We have -- I didn't see the -- to work with large dealer groups where understanding the dynamics and the changes that are going on in the industry are in terms of pricing and trying to be fair to customers and transparent to customers.","We like virtually everybody in the industry do give opportunities for dealers to mark-up the rate. Today it's up to 200 basis points. We know that that's being evaluated by regulatory supervisors in the industry and we're going to stay connected to what that looks like.","We think there is a chance the whole industry might move in a given direction, but we think we're spot on with what others are doing in the industry.","Grayson Hall","But Bill we have a -- we have very rigorous monitoring program of our dealerships and to monitor their activities and to make sure that we're confident in their capabilities for underwriting and pricing.","We also have a single price grid, franchise-wide, and are very, very disciplined about maintaining that pricing grid in exactly where our approval rates are if what FICO scores they were delivering on a monthly basis.","Now we continue to tighten up the rigor around our credit practices in that segment making improvements literally on a continuous basis.","Bill Carcache","Okay. Can you say finally on that point whether any of the changes to the practices that you've made have been prompted by your discussions with regulators or have kind of regulators been more kind of on a fact finding -- fact gathering kind of mode and haven\u2019t necessarily been asking for any changes to be made, just that\u2026","Grayson Hall","Bill really only I can say is we continue to have very detailed and productive conversations with our regulatory supervisors. We have decisions where changes where we believe they're necessary in order for the business to perform better and it's a longstanding relationship and so we feel we'll account for where we're at today.","As David said earlier, there are tremendous debates in the industry about how these products are delivered. As those rules changes occur, we will adjust to that.","Bill Carcache","Understood. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, John.","John McDonald","Hi. Good morning. On expenses, David any ballpark numbers for what kind of savings you could get from the new branch rationalizations that you took the charge for this quarter and next quarter?","David Turner","Well I'll tell you that generally speaking when we take charges, we like to target the payback period to be somewhere in the three to five year range. This is on the lower end of that and we continue to evaluate our whole footprint and to the extent that we can consolidate -- every time we consolidate braches, we lose revenue.","The idea though is to be able to adjust expenses -- run rate expenses faster than the revenue that we're losing. And so as we look at these last 50, we're closer to that three-year payback range and as Grayson mentioned earlier, we will continue to evaluate all of our branches and rationalize those and make investments in others.","John McDonald","Okay. And just take you to that item on the operating leverage goal for positive operating leverage, I assume that's on an adjusted basis year-over-year, that you should infer wouldn't include like the legal charge this quarter?","David Turner","That's correct.","John McDonald","Okay. And is there any efficiency goal aside to that just to issue?","David Turner","We've talked about our efficiency ratio over long term to be in that 55% to 59% range. We need a rate increase for that to happen. While we wait, believe we can drift down into the lower 60s of efficiency ratio. 2015 we're targeting to be better than we are in 2014 and all that's on an adjusted basis.","John McDonald","Okay. And then just for a follow-up on a payout, how you're thinking about what's the right kind of payout ratio for regions? You've got a lot of capital. Given how much this year's buyback was backend loaded on a quarterly basis, you're now actually returning on a high percentage of your earnings this quarter and hopefully next.","I guess just kind of as you went through CCAR, how did you approach thinking about where the payout ratio should go broadly over the next year or two?","David Turner","Yes so as a result of us being in the middle of a regulatory submission, we need to be careful exactly with what we're saying, although the answer and sometime in March we will let you know.","But the way we thought about capital was first off we wanted to get our dividend closer to where peers and market expectations were. We clearly wanted to use our capital to grow our business. Organically we think that's important.","When you look at our capital ratios that we have, we have more common equity Tier 1 than most of our peers and we believe we needed to be a little more forward leaning in terms of putting that capital to work.","So you should expect that ratio to be higher. We don't necessarily target a total payout ratio per se. We look at optimizing, excuse me optimizing our capital stack in terms of what's in the capital stack and the sheer dollar amount to become as efficient as we can be and we realize we had more capital our Tier 1 common or common equity Tier 1 on Basel III in most.","That's why we think we can do the things we need to do to get the dividend up, to get the investments made to grow our business and serve our customers and return appropriate amount to our shareholders and that's what we did.","John McDonald","And I guess one of the concerns some shareholders have is that you're aligned to a bank acquisition that's dilutive and you don't have a currency to your stock right now in terms of a multiple to do a bank deal.","And I guess could you just give us your thoughts about being disciplined on that in terms of using capital given where you trade today and your appetite to do a bank deal or opposed to doing some kind of cash deal to increase your fee income and how you're thinking along those lines?","David Turner","So you pointed out rightly. We also look at our currency. We think strategically about acquisitions, but I think you bring up a great point in terms of where we are from a currency standpoint.","We do have a capital that we can put to work in terms of the organic growth and returns to shareholders and use that excess capital on appropriate acquisition whether it be a bank or non-bank where you're using cash as a currency versus your stock.","And so that's a little more available to us today given our capital position, but we're well aware of expectations on dilution and being able to payback that dilution in a reasonable period of time and we're not in the mode of doing an acquisition just to do an acquisition.","We will be very thoughtful and we need to get our currency up and we will do that by executing our business plan and executing our strategy first and foremost and there will be plenty of time for acquisitions after we get that dealt with.","John McDonald","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR.","Paul Miller","Yes. Thank you very much. On the $10 million of increased expenses that you said really it's I guess for outside consultants and I guess it's really -- it's some of the regulations for Dodd-Frank, CCAR what not. Is that a one-time charge or should we model that going forward into the models?","David Turner","Are you speaking of the $10 million for the branch consolidations or\u2026","Paul Miller","Maybe I am misreading, but I thought there was a $10 million of increased consultants.","David Turner","Its $5 million Paul. If you look at outside services, it went up about $5 million.","Paul Miller","I am sorry.","David Turner","That was related to third party consultants and our capital planning process and certain risk management initiatives. Those are areas reasonably we point that out, those are areas where -- that we have a chance to cut those back and become more efficient on, but that is unrelated to the branch $10 million charge that we took.","Paul Miller","Okay. So that's an area that you think you can get down over time, but we should be modeling that in for the short term?","David Turner","Well we think we can get that down and third parties are one of the easiest -- third party expenditures are one of the easier ones to deal with because you don't have to sign a contract.","So we should -- we expect and you should expect over time that we work on third party cost and get those down to -- at level that is appropriate for our institution.","Paul Miller","And then you might not have these numbers. You don't -- you usually can have somebody give me a call back, but what exactly -- I couldn\u2019t really calculate, what is your capitalized cost of servicing because you did take it right down to the MSR, but what did you take it down to on a capitalized cost of servicing number?","David Turner","I don't have that. We'll get -- Paul, we'll get that -- get back\u2026","Paul Miller","If you can give me a call back that would be great. Hey guys, thank you very much.","David Turner","Thank you.","Grayson Hall","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of topics that have been addressed, but as I think about everything that you've said about your net interest margin and assuming that the forward curve is still correct in terms of implied midyear hike and given your fairly robust loan growth guidance, how should I think about sort of the geography of net interest income dollars over the next few quarters here?","David Turner","Well Eric to the extent that we can give a rising rate, what we will say is that we can have modest improvement to our overall net interest income and resulting NIM if that occurs. We do believe we will have an increase in the shorter rates. We don't believe it will start through mid year.","So we expect that to be an opportunities for us in terms of revenue growth if the loan growth will pan out like we've talked about and if the rate environment works like we've talked about, we think that's an area where we can grow revenue.","We've had a pretty resilient margin relative to our peers and so we're looking forward to that. We will try and give you the -- if that doesn\u2019t happen, here is what the risk is relative to that expectation and that's what the 10 to 12 basis point is all about.","Eric Wasserstrom","All right and in that scenario, does your loan growth result in flat net interest income dollars or is there some downward risk in the lack of -- in the 175 to 200 basis point tenure scenario?","David Turner","Well if you're adding interest earning assets, we should be able to grow with that incrementally our NII. The issue is that at what margin will that ultimately result in. So you could have a growing NII and a decline in the resulting margin that's been at where you put assets on the books.","Eric Wasserstrom","Got it. And just to follow-up on asset quality for a moment, how should we think about your reserve adequacy at this stage given that the reserve releases have moved, not necessarily entirely with the direction of net charge-offs on a sort of quarter-over-quarter basis.","David Turner","Yes, so the question is really where we think overall allowance levels would trend? We have a pretty sophisticated allowance methodology. We're getting the question where do you think that will ultimately be?","As charge-offs continue to come down, as criticized and classified levels come down, as non-performers come down, then you have a tendency to expect and lower allowance to loan ratio.","I can't tell you where that terminal value is. I think what's going on the books today is some of the most pristine, incredibly we've had in a long time and I think that each quarter as charge-offs come down, we do believe we have some leverage in our allowance, which helps us keep the provision down lower for a longer period of time, but at some point, that runs out and you have to start providing for whatever your charge-offs are.","So the question that was asked earlier in terms of where that charge-off maybe is something we needed to look at and think through, but the allowance is going to be what it's going to be and I think there is an ability for that to come down to some degree.","Grayson Hall","But Eric, when you look at the net charge-offs, you just have to keep reminding yourself, there is some residual effect of credits that we've had on our books for a long time that are getting resolved.","In addition, the granularity of our loan portfolio does require some level of volatility from quarter to quarter on charge-offs, but when you look at the charge-off in relationship to the provision, the provision really is driving our allowance as a reflection of the overall quality of the portfolio.","And as you see from the numbers, the overall quality of our loan portfolio continues to improve. We've got modest loan growth build in through our projections, but a lot of where that provision and resulting allowance winds us trending in large parts tend to pin down loan growth and in what segments that loan growth occurs.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great and then just last one for me, your go-forward tax rate, what you're expecting there?","David Turner","If you right-size for the impact of the legal and regulatory charge, you saw us in that roughly 29% range and you would expect that fairly similar to 2015.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","Hi guys. Just a follow-up on the energy theme, I guess first in terms of your exposure that you laid out on Page 12, which is very helpful, how do you think about how long oil prices need to stay where they are before we see some cracks just kind of generally speaking in your portfolio?","Grayson Hall","Matt, let me if you would, we've prepared that in the appendix to give you a little more data analytically on sort of our exposure in the -- I've got John Turner in the room with me today who manages our energy segment. So John, if you would speak to this for a second.","John Turner","Happy to, in terms of how long the prices can stay down, I would say, if you look at the material we've provided, the majority of our exposure is centered either in our exploration production or our oil field services portfolios and if we have a concentration in oil field services that's in marine transportation companies that are serving the deep water, we think that those companies are operating in an environment that has a much longer to play out.","Our portfolio is comprised of relatively small number of companies that are located in Louisiana and Texas. They're led by seasoned management teams, have really good liquidity both in the form of cash and credit available to them. They've operated through volatile cycles before.","Have good access to capital and so we feel good about our portfolio. We've got a seasoned team of bankers and risk managers. In terms of how long the price can stay down, I don't think we have a sophisticated approach to data to know how long that is because we don't know where the price will end up.","A lot of it has to do with where the price ultimately bottoms out and then the length of time that it will stay there, but based upon again good liquidity, good experience amongst our management teams, access to different forms of capital and just the credit profile and small number of customers that we have, we say, we feel pretty good about our exposure today.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. That's helpful and then just on the flip side as I think about your consumer, from a geographic point of view, you operate in some lower income areas and I would think some of those customers are going to benefit much more from lower gas prices, potentially lower home energy cost.","So just talk about some of the dynamics on the consumer side both in terms of maybe some relief on the credit and whether there might be some boost on the lending and spending volumes as well.","Grayson Hall","Yes, I think it's a little early to call, but clearly the reduction in price of a gallon of gasoline at the pump has had a material impact on disposable income of a number of our customers and we do operate a number of -- in a number of markets that, that will really play to as an advantage.","We continue to see from a consumer lending standpoint, consumer's credit metrics continue to improve and we would anticipate that if oil prices and conversely prices at pump stayed as low for an extended period of time, it will see a strengthening not only in the credit, the credit of those consumers, but also the spending behaviors of those consumers.","And we -- you see a number of different scenarios about a penny drop at the pump and how many dollars that actually puts back into the consumer's pocket and those numbers are just startling in size, but I would say that you it's early to see the results of that, but clearly it's occurring and clearly we will see strengthening.","I would say that in the fourth quarter we did see really strong results in the activity of both debit and credit card transactions, both in a number of transactions and in the dollar value of those transactions. And as you saw a modest increase in outstanding balances in the credit card portfolio.","So maybe those are early signs, but I do think it's still all early for us to decide what the marked improvement will be.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Marty.","Marty Mosby","Hey thanks for taking the questions. One is to ask you David a little bit about the prepayment speeds, if you had any impact in the security yields this quarter may be from the premium bonds being written down a little bit more?","And then also you did have a big impact on the write down in the mortgage servicing rights. Does that encompass a big pick up in prepayments already? So just wanted to see the two impacts in those areas of prepayment speed.","David Turner","Yes, I think Marty, I think there is really unrelated at this point. We did see a very small amount of pick up in pre amortization. It was about $2 million impact to this negatively in the quarter. So I think our total premium amortization was $42 million up from $40 million in the quarter before.","Mortgage was just a little different. Obviously we had a lot of volatility in rates and we obviously have hedges on the hedge as much as the change in fair value as we can. We're a little less effective in those hedges and that was part of the decline in the MSR and then total mortgage we had just lower deliveries into the secondary market that we believe real more of a timing issue for us.","So we think those were a little more anomalies that occurred in the fourth quarter than we should hopefully see going forward?","Marty Mosby","And would it be fair to reflect that if you look at the amortization, it didn't really accelerate any other future prepayments it may happen, yet if you look at the bag on the servicing rights, maybe you have accelerated some of the impact there?","David Turner","Yes, I think so and also we need to look at what's happening right now with rates -- mortgage rates continuing to come down. We could see -- we could see an opportunity for refinance activity helping our mortgage business, but also that negatively impacts us on the mortgage services rights.","So we have a little bit of a built in economic hedge to some degree there. We need to still see how that plays out over the course of the year.","Marty Mosby","And just lastly, when you talked about the modest rise in interest rate, holding margins flat to pushing it up, you would still expect if you had a short term rise in interest rates, does that eventually kind of pull through positively on your net interest margin.","So I just want to make sure of when a structural change that was somewhat pulling that benefit down a little bit.","David Turner","No, we continue to be asset sensitive along the curve and short-term rates, medium term, long-term, all those benefit us. I think our last disclosure on F100 was about $160 million, $170 million, which is almost split a third, a third, a third in that scenario.","So we benefit from that increase at any level.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Matt.","Matt Burnell","Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just a couple of very quick follow-ups, it sounds from your answers to Matt's -- Matt O'Connor's prior questions that you have not really incorporated much in the way of increased provisions against the oil exposure that you have or the energy exposure you have in the fourth quarter provision. Is that a reasonable assumption?","Grayson Hall","When you look at our fourth quarter provision, we're not saying any adverse impacts yet in that part of the portfolio that would be included in the quantitative part of our allowance methodologies.","In the qualitative part, obviously any market uncertainties in oil and gas being one of those, is included in that quantitative analysis and there would be some consideration given to the fact that oil prices have dropped, but an explicit special reserve we did not do that.","We let our methodologies process the way they are built to be modeled and we believe we have taken the right stance on that.","Matt Burnell","And just following up on that exposure, have you said publicly what the losses have been back in other periods of declining oil prices or perhaps what the non-performing asset levels rose to just to get a sense of sort of what the potential risk might be?","Grayson Hall","We have not, but Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer will have this. Now I'll ask Barb to make a few comments.","Barb Godin","We can't go back and actually reproduce those numbers at this point in time, but again going from experience those numbers were very small. Again being very active in that space, as we mentioned, we've been doing this for 40 years and so we have run through some ups and downs and know it has not impacted our books significantly.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And then just finally David, a question on cards, you sound quite optimistic about your ability to continue to drive card acceptance and card usage from your customers and the branches, did I get the sense from your comments that you're thinking about potentially broadening the offering of those cards outside the branches and possibly outside your footprint?","David Turner","Our focus really has been our customer base. If you -- and the reason for that is our penetration on our customer base has been right at 16%. We expect that to be in the lower 20s intact and so that's really where our focus has been.","We have from a strategy standpoint thought about expanding outside of our customer base and we think right now spending the time to again serve our existing customers is probably the best route to go at this time, but it is on the drawing board for us.","Grayson Hall","Well we think that's progress. We've looked at different strategies, but again cross-selling our current customer base continues to be our number one priority and we've got better at executing on that strategy. We've had -- our results continue to build momentum.","We've got more active cards, more card transaction and had more success in penetrating our book and in the past and so we're encouraged by our early results and that remains our strategy.","Matt Burnell","Makes sense. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Mutascio of KBW.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Mutascio","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. David, just a quick question, your positive operating leverage commentary clearly implies pretax, pre-provisioning earnings growth in '15, over '14.","But I guess can you achieve pretax earnings growth if in indeed the provision expense inevitably reflects off the low level in fourth quarter?","David Turner","Well, our goal is to constantly grow our earnings for our pretax and after tax basis. So we're working hard to grow all areas revenue, control our expense base and we think net, net we can do that from an operating leverage standpoint, but we haven\u2019t given explicit guidance as to what that pretax move will be.","As we go through the year, we will give you a little more clarity on that, but we're going to stick to positive operating leverage right now is the guidance.","Chris Mutascio","Okay. And then just one follow-up on the positive operating leverage guidance, that includes the branch closing cost in both fourth quarter of '14 and the potential for another $15 million first quarter '15? Is that correct?","David Turner","It includes the benefit of having that out in the expense run rate, but the actual charge, the $10 million and the $15 million are adjusted out.","Chris Mutascio","Okay.","David Turner","So it does not include those.","Chris Mutascio","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivek Januja of JPMorgan.","Vivek Januja","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Couple of them. Oil and Gas. Can you just talk about your originations during the course of 2014 and also how much do you have in commitments over and above 3.35 or 3.35 billion of academics?","Grayson Hall","The answer to your first or second question is commitments. We currently have 6.9 billion in commitments to the sector and 3.4 billion outstanding which represents about 4.4% of the portfolio.","Further originations we grew both around $200 million year-over-year. It was fairly diverse group of originations both in the E&P sector and in auto services driven through the cross both states in terms of geography and through our Regions Business Capital Group which has strong relationships with private equity sponsors in that space and have pretty good year in originations as well.","Vivek Januja","So would you say then - chunk of the growth came from the private equity related loans?","Grayson Hall","I don't have the mix exactly. So we\u2019ll say that those relationships were certainly important to some of the growth that we generated through our Regions Business Capital Group.","Vivek Januja","Okay, thanks. And one more question qualitative reserves you mentioned earlier, what is the amount of - what percentage of your loans are - what percentage we had loan last reserves qualitative reserves?","Grayson Hall","We have not disclosed that.","Vivek Januja","But is that something that's changed in the fourth quarter? Did it go up, down, flat any context around that?","Grayson Hall","Relatively stable.","Vivek Januja","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James.","Michael Rose","Good afternoon. Just two quick ones from me. What is the reserve on the loan book - on the energy book today and maybe what was it if you know going back to 2009 when we had a similar decline in oil prices?","And then just secondarily, what's the expected impact in dollars if you have it around the seasonal FICO costs that you expect in the first quarter? Thanks.","Barb Godin","This is Barb Godin. If we look at the energy book we don't have it specifically that way. We do have - we look at very detail and acquire particularly if it\u2019s a non performing loans for good specific reserve.","Other than that, we look at it improved loans, so we don't have competitive status, but we can is we feel very comfortable with what our book looks like, again remembering that we do a few things.","We do sensitivity analysis on that book. We have a price deck. We do that pretty well in the quarterly basis but the price deck we press it down and then we pick an additional haircut on that.","We also do reserve calculations with those 65% advanced rate on our reserved calculations. And last but not least we also have hedging on that book. So all in we feel pretty good about that book but again getting back to your comments both specific reserves or reserving we don\u2019t have them so we can provide you.","Grayson Hall","Michael I'll take the second question. So, if you look at prior year it should be relatively consistent for file the taxes and 401-K match and those kinds of things that happened in the first quarter. They are almost up around $12 million and then remember that our pension cost increased about $6 million for quarter that you'll, that\u2019s new.","Michael Rose","Okay. That's helpful. And just one more back to the energy book. What percentage of your book is hedged through 2015 and through 2016 if you have that? Thanks.","David Turner","About 41% through 2015 and an additional 17% I think through 2016.","Michael Rose","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard Cassidy","I apologize if you\u2019ve addressed this question, I need to jump off. If you look at your total energy portfolio, what percentage of that would be designated as leverage loans?","Grayson Hall","We currently have seven leverage loans in our energy portfolio. Five of those are managed through our Regions business capital group and so it would be a modest percentage of our total exposure.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And is there any talk, I haven't heard this, but has there been any talk amongst the OCC or the regulators to do for the industry and not just for you folks of course, targeted energy credit exams this year.","Barb Godin","We haven't heard of any that -- I would believe that they probably would just given the where things are in the energy sector, we would not be surprised.","The other comment I would also make on the leverage loans we just ask that question is recognizing that definition of leverage within the overall space and how we define leverage is different. So typically as you know, leverage is defined as non-investment grade and again that is -- that's what banks our side do as we land in the non-investment grade space.","Gerard Cassidy","And then finally and again I apologize if you've addressed this, as you of course is very, very strong. Do you guys get a sense that there will be at some point in the future where the regulators will allow you to reduce that to a more manageable level, so that your return on equity can obviously go higher?","David Turner","Yes, Gerard, this is David. There hasn\u2019t been any explicit guidance coming from regulatory supervisors on that. I think it's incumbent upon us to ensure we have an appropriate amount of capital for the risk in our business.","We clearly think we do. We think we have capital that can be more effectively deployed and I weren\u2019t on the call, we talked about easing that capital really for first off getting our dividend up to kind of our more consistent with expectations.","Using that capital to grow organically using excess capital to the extent that there was an acquisition to pay cash for whether it be a bank, non-bank and they are returning in appropriate amount of capital to our shareholders.","We think we have the kind of capital position and we think we have a really good understanding of the risk attended to our company and therefore, we think over time you will see those drift down.","Where the terminal amount is, is everybody's guess. And so I think we need not get ahead of ourselves on that, but I do think capital levels do rationalize over time. The amount of time -- when that is, is anybody's guess.","Gerard Cassidy","I appreciate that. Thank you. And one follow-up to your comments David, on acquisitions, not to say that you're looking at anything right now, but some of the bigger banks have commented that the BSA\/AML internal reporting has been a obstacle to getting deals announced.","How do you guys feel about your BSA\/AML condition in terms of your systems? Obviously M&T is still struggling to close its deal that was announced over two years ago because of BSA\/AML issues. Can you give us some color on where you guys think you stand in that arena?","David Turner","Well I think ensuring that you have all of your key processes in order to participate in acquisitions is important. BSA\/AML has been imported to our country for a long time. It will continue to get the time and attention and it's incumbent upon us to have all the controls in place.","We invest an awful lot of time and attention in ensuring that and we feel like we have a very robust program relative to BSA\/AML and -- but that mean we can't stop here. We have to continue to invest and continue to be diligent in terms of those processes, but we think we have a solid program today.","Gerard Cassidy","Again, thank you.","David Turner","You bet.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's conference. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Hall for closing remarks.","Grayson Hall","Thank you very much. We appreciate everyone's participation today and thank you for your questions and we'll stand adjourned.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"18112":["Regions Financial Corp (NYSE:RF) Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call January 15, 2016 11:00 AM ET","Executives","List Underwood - Director, IR","Grayson Hall - CEO","David Turner - CFO","Barb Godin - Chief Credit Officer","Analysts","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","David Eads - UBS","Steve Moss - Evercore ISI","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Stephen Scouten - Sandler O'Neill","John Hearn - RBC Capital Markets","Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners","Peter Winter - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Jack Micenko - SIG","Kevin Barker - Piper Jaffray","Operator","Welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Paula and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.","List Underwood","Thank you, Operator and good morning everyone. We appreciate your participation in our call today. Our presenters are Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of management are present as well and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also as part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of www.Regions.com.","Also let me remind you that in the call and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking disclaimer that is located in the appendix section of the presentation.","With that said, I will turn it over now to Grayson.","Grayson Hall","Good morning and thank you, List. I want to say just a few words about List Underwood before we get started with our financial results. As we announced earlier this week, List will be retiring at the end of the month.","He's been with Regions for 23 years and has been a trusted advisor and valued member of our management team. His impressive career spans 43 years and today marks his 90th earnings call with our company. List, congratulations, we will certainly miss you as you start your new phase in life and wish you the very best in retirement.","List Underwood","Thank you, Grayson.","Grayson Hall","Moving on to results, overall we're pleased and encouraged by our achievements and results in 2015. During the year, we focused on the fundamentals, growing and deepening our customer relationships, while also strengthening our financial performance by investing in initiatives that will drive revenue growth and create a more efficient and effective organization in the future. As a result, we're a much stronger organization today and are committed to continuing to build sustainable franchise value.","For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $272 million, bringing our full-year 2015 total to $1 billion. Earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.21 per diluted share and $0.76 per diluted share for the full year. These results reflect growth in total adjusted revenue despite a challenging operating environment.","Importantly, we continue to deliver results in categories that we believe are fundamental to future income growth, including checking accounts, households, Regions360 relationships and credit card accounts. For example, checking accounts grew by more than 2% during the year and active credit cards increased 11%.","We remain focused on expanding and deepening relationships through our needs-based approach to relationship banking and our 2015 results demonstrate that this approach is working. During the year, we delivered strong average deposit growth of $3 billion or 4%. The mix of our deposits continues to strengthen as 92% are now low cost deposits and as we have noted before, our markets provide us with unique and competitive advantages from a deposit composition perspective.","In 2015, we achieved solid adjusted loan growth of $5 billion or 6% from the prior year. Adjusted loans and leases include a lease reclassification adjustments which David will speak to shortly. Both business and consumer grew loans with total production for the year of $66 billion, an increase of 12% from 2014. Business lending had an excellent year, growing adjusted loans 7%. Commercial banking, corporate banking and real estate banking all grew loans and 95% of our markets achieved loan growth, reflecting the strength of our business model as local bankers collaborate with industry and product specialists to grow loans.","In particular, within corporate banking, our specialized industries group experienced solid growth led by technology and defense, as well as franchise restaurant. And the Real Estate Investment Trust lending business was strong throughout the year. Consumer lending was also strong in 2015. Total loans exceeded $30 billion at year end, an increase of 5% over 2014. Mortgage led this growth with loans increasing $496 million or 4%.","Additionally, our new point of sale initiative bolstered growth in indirect lending with increased loans of $339 million. Additionally, credit card balances increased 7% from the previous year which drove growth in card and ATM income of $30 million or 9%.","Total adjusted revenue for the year increased 2% over 2014, reflecting growth in the balance sheet and investments we made to grow and diversify our revenue. Capital markets income was exceptionally strong, increasing $31 million. Our recent acquisition of BlackArch Partners as well as our planned initiatives are expected to further augment capital markets' income in the future. Wealth management had a strong year with income increasing 10% over the prior year. Our focus to grow wealth management by continuing to retain, recruit and develop talent was evident in the success of our financial consultants and insurance initiatives.","During 2015, we executed on our capital plan, returning 93% of earnings to shareholders which is expected to be one of the highest percentages among our peers. We also made several small yet important investments and acquisitions in 2015 that will help drive future income. These transactions were a prudent and optimal use of our capital, enabling us to expand our capabilities and product offerings to supplement future revenue growth.","With respect to the economic environment, while the U.S. economy is still slow and steadily improving, there is a clear significant pressure from the global economy. Low oil prices continue to create challenges for certain industries while benefiting others. Consequently, we continue to closely monitor our energy portfolio.","As expected, there continues to be downward migration in risk ratings in this portfolio. These shifts will continue if oil prices remain at current levels. However, we remain in close contact with our energy customers and believe that we're taking appropriate actions to mitigate vulnerabilities. We continue to prudently build reserves which now stand at 6% of our direct energy exposure. As a result, we're cautious, but we expect the future losses related to this portfolio to be managed.","As we begin 2016, we remain committed to our three primary strategic initiatives. First, grow and diversify our revenue streams. Secondarily, to practice disciplined expense management and lastly, to effectively deploy our capital.","These are all integral to the successful execution of our strategic plan. We continue to operate in a challenging environment that requires us to focus on what we can control. To that end, as we discussed in our Investor Day in November of last year, it's essential that we take more aggressive steps as relates to expense management. Our goal is to eliminate $300 million of core expenses over the next three years, approximately 9% of the 2015 adjusted expense base. This plan which is underway will help us fund our growth initiatives and build sustainable franchise value.","In summary, 2015 was a solid year for Regions. We accomplished a great deal while laying the foundation for future earnings growth.","With that, I will now turn it over to David, who will cover the details for the fourth quarter. David?","David Turner","Thank you and good morning everyone. I will take you through the fourth quarter details and then provide our expectations for 2016. As Grayson noted, 2015 was a solid year for Regions and the year ended particularly strong which sets us up well for 2016.","Before I get started, during the fourth quarter, Regions corrected the accounting for certain leases which had previously been included in loans. These leases had been classified as capital leases but were subsequently determined to be operating leases. The cumulative effect on pretax income lowered net interest income and other financing income $15 million and reduced the net interest margin by 5 basis points in the quarter.","The adjustment resulted in a reclassification of these leases out of loans into other earning assets totaling approximately $834 million at the end of the quarter. The company does not expect this adjustment to have a material impact to net interest income or other financing income or net interest margin in any future reporting period.","With respect to the balance sheet, adjusted loan and lease balances totaled $82 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and were up $1 billion or 1% from the previous quarter. Business lending achieved solid growth withed adjusted balances totaling $52 billion at quarter end, an increase of 1%. Adjusted commercial loans grew $563 million or 1%. Commitments increased 2% and line utilization increased 30 basis points to 46.3%. Consumer lending had another strong quarter with every loan category increasing. Loans in this portfolio totaled $30 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter.","Indirect auto lending increased 2% and other indirect lending which includes point of sale initiatives, increased $55 million linked quarter or 11%. We're pleased with the results of this new initiative. Year-to-date, loans in this portfolio have increased $339 million and we expect continued growth in 2016.","Looking at the credit card portfolio, balances increased 6% from the previous quarter and our penetration rate into our deposit base now stands at 17.3%, up 160 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year. Mortgage loan balances increased $81 million and total home equity balances increased $31 million from the previous quarter as new production continued to outpace portfolio runoff.","Let's take a look at deposits. Average deposit balances increased $322 million and ending balances increased over $1.2 billion during this quarter. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels at 11 basis points and total funding costs remained low at 26 basis points. With respect to deposits, we're primarily core deposit funded with 74% of our deposits coming from consumer and wealth deposits. Low cost deposits were 92% of total deposits.","Approximately half of our deposits come from cities with less than 1 million people and 50% of our deposits are from customers with $250,000 or less in their account. This is why we believe our deposit betas will be a competitive advantage for us as rates rise.","Let's look at how this impacted our results. Interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $866 million, essentially flat with last quarter. However, excluding the impact of the lease adjustment, net interest income and other financing income increased $15 million or 2%.","Higher loan balances and balance sheet hedging and optimization strategies were the primary drivers behind the linked quarter increase along with interest recoveries. The benefit from interest recoveries is not expected to be at this level in the first quarter, approximately $4 million less going toward.","The overall increase in net interest income and other financing income was partially offset by fixed asset repricing. The net interest margin was 3.08%. However, excluding the lease adjustment, net interest margin was 3.13% or flat with the previous quarter.","Total non-interest income increased 4% on an adjusted basis from the third quarter, driven primarily by gains on sales of affordable housing investments and by higher card and ATM income. Card and ATM fees increased 3%, primarily related to an increase in commercial bank card usage, an increase in the number of active cards at 3.7% and an increase in seasonal consumer spending. Service charges were impacted by posting order changes that went into effect in early November and reduced non-interest income by approximately $7 million.","We expect the ongoing impact of this change to be at the lower end of our previously stated $10 million to $15 million quarterly range. Wealth management income was down slightly quarter over quarter due to lower insurance income, partially offset by higher investment management and trust fee income. Capital markets income was relatively flat linked quarter as revenue from new product and service offerings was offset primarily by lower loan syndication fees.","Let's move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the fourth quarter were $873 million. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $861 million, representing a decline of $33 million or 4% from the prior quarter. This included a decrease of $24 million in FDIC fees, primarily due to additional expenses of $23 million in the third quarter related to prior assessments.","The expected quarterly run rate for this expense is in the $22 million to $24 million range, excluding the impact of the proposed FDIC surcharge. Additionally, the fourth quarter benefited from lower expenses related to unfunded commitment cost of $12 million. Salaries and benefits increased $8 million or 2% linked quarter, primarily attributable to $6 million in severance related expenses. We also incurred $6 million of expenses related to 29 branch consolidations. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.4% in the fourth quarter, but excluding the $15 million lease adjustment, the adjusted efficiency ratio was 62.7%.","As discussed at Investor Day, we will continue to make investments to grow our business. However, we must be more efficient in everything we do. As Grayson noted, our plan to become a more efficient organization, including the elimination of $300 million in core expenses, is underway.","Let's move on to asset quality. Total net charge-offs increased $18 million to $78 million and represented 38 basis points of average loans. This increase was primarily related to one large charge-off in the energy loan portfolio.","Total business services criticized and classified loans increased $117 million, driven by some weakening in a small number of larger loans primarily within the energy portfolio. However, total non-accrual loans excluding loans held for sale declined from the third quarter. Troubled debt restructured loans or TDRs also declined, down 1% from the prior quarter.","The provision for loan losses was $69 million and our allowance for loan losses was down 2 basis points to 1.36% at the end of the fourth quarter. And at quarter end, our loan loss allowance to non-accrual loans or coverage ratio was 141%. Regarding our energy portfolio, while oil prices have declined, exposure remains manageable. Should oil prices remain at current levels, charge-offs will be in the $50 million to $75 million range in 2016.","The energy charge-off taken this quarter reduces the previous range of $50 million to $100 million. Additionally, we currently have just over $150 million reserved or 6% of our direct energy exposure. Given where we're in the credit cycle, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits in our portfolio and fluctuating commodity prices.","Let's move on to capital and liquidity. During 2015, we returned $925 million to shareholders which included the repurchase of $621 million of common stock and $304 million in dividends. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.7% and the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%.","On a fully phased-in basis, Common Equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums. Our loan to deposit ratio at the end of the quarter was 83% and at the end of the quarter, we were fully compliant as it relates to the liquidity coverage ratio.","Now let me give you an overview of our current expectations for 2016. We expect total loan growth to be in the 3% to 5% range on an average basis, excluding the impact of the operating lease reclassification. And regarding deposits, we expect full-year average deposit growth in the 2% to 4% range. And commensurate with our loan growth projections, we expect net interest income and other financing income to increase in the 2% to 4% range.","Now, should we experience no additional rate increases, we expect to be at the lower end of that range. As a result of our investments, we expect to grow adjusted non-interest income somewhere in the 4% to 6% range. We will continue to make investments in 2016. However, we have also begun to execute our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses, of which 35% to 45% will occur in 2016. Therefore, we expect total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2016 to be flat to up modestly from 2015.","We expect to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 63% in 2016 and positive operating leverage somewhere in the 2% to 4% range. We still expect our net charge-offs to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range. However, given the current price of oil, we would expect to be at the top end of that range.","In closing, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year. The investments we made in 2015 position us well for 2016 and beyond and we look forward to updating you on the progress throughout the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value.","With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I will now turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","List Underwood","Thank you, David. We're ready to begin the Q&A session of our call. In order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning, I would like to ask each caller to please limit yourself to one primary question and one related follow-up question. Now let's open the line, operator, for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Maybe we will just start off on credit. First, can you maybe give us a little more color on the loss you took, what type of loan was it? Is there any credit of left? I guess when you think about the reserve that you've taken, the roughly 6%, what does your reserve contemplate for oil prices? We've heard others say that if oil prices stayed at this level, you could see another incremental amount of provision. Just wondering what that number would be for you.","Barb Godin","I will address the second part. The first part was an energy credit that's been around for a few years with M&A activity which originally led to the credit. It is a shared national credit. There's five banks involved in it. We saw some distress in this credit in the early part of the year. We have been working this credit really hard during the course of this year and it simply came to conclusion near tend the end of the year.","What we've done is we have appropriately marked that credit. We've taken the loss on that credit as you've heard. And we've moved the residual balance into our held for sale and we anticipate that we will have that out of our held for sale numbers by the end of -- we're hoping January, but certainly this quarter it will be out of our numbers.","Back to individual credit, the charge-off on that was approximately $25 million just for rounding. In terms of how we think about our reserve and look at prices as we work our way through our process, in the backs of our minds, we look at our price deck, our price deck is roughly $36 right now, sensitivity, $28.90.","So we're looking in that range as we determine and establish what those numbers should be, but we're also looking very heavily at each and every individual customer, what their cash flow looks like, what our collateral looks like, what our asset coverage is. We currently have asset coverage of 1.71 times on the E&P book as an example. So again, in conversations and we have some ongoing conversations with our customers because we really do have a small number of customers, we still believe that repayment ability is adequate with them and again establish our reserves accordingly.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And then David had commented in his prepared remarks that you're expecting charge-offs to be towards the high end of the 25 to 35. I guess from both a portfolio, whether it's metals and mining or some other related areas or even if it's across different geographies, whether it's Texas or Louisiana or anywhere else that's exposed to oil and gas, are you seeing any other changing in credit patterns? Whether it's ticks up in delinquencies or anything that's having an impact on either growth or the overall credit performance.","Barb Godin","No, we're keeping a really close eye on all of that. There is some pressure certainly on commodities in general across the industry, as you know and that's just given the strong U.S. dollar, what's going on in Europe and in China in terms of the dislocation of the market. There is some pressure there. But we've seen nothing yet that is significantly concerning.","Ryan Nash","All right. Maybe just one last quick one, David, just can you help us understand the trajectory of the net interest margin, I guess maybe both based on the forward curve and if we don't get any additional rate hikes in 2016, where do you think the NIM would trend over the course of the year?","David Turner","A little bit of guidance in terms of -- if we don't get another change, we will be at the lower end of our 2% to 4% guidance that we've given you. Also gave you a little bit of guidance in my prepared comments in terms of margin. We did have unusual recovery, interest recoveries. We think about $4 million of that won't repeat going forward. But we're looking for a relatively stable NIM.","This is adjusting by the way for the lease accounting. We were at 3.08% on net interest margin, 5 points related to lease adjustments, so 3.13% would have made us flat. And we're looking for a relatively stable, just to remind everybody, that's been 1 or 2 points either side of where we're, for 2016.","So we're looking for that guidance in terms of growth in NII that we've really been focusing on to be that 2% to 4% through the year. So you may see some unusual changes in a given quarter, but you've got to keep the year in mind when thinking about NIIs or trajectory.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Eads of UBS.","David Eads","Maybe following up on energy, when I look at the -- you guys had some disclosure on the criticized loans which I thought was pretty interesting. When you look at it, the criticized loans are actually higher on a percentage basis in the E&P portfolio compared to oilfield services. So I was wondering if you could talk a little about what you're seeing that has you more comfortable with the exposures on the E&P side and I guess maybe a little bit less so on the oilfield services.","Barb Godin","It's Barb Godin. I will be happy to answer that. As we do our redeterminations and we just finished up our fall redeterminations, just about done, what happens is as you readjust the borrowing base and again, for fall redeterminations this year, borrowing base adjustments downwards were a little under 8%.","Notwithstanding if that causes an over-advance, what we will immediately do is call that loan a criticized loan and move it into a non-pass category. Again, that would account for the reason that we have roughly 48% of our E&P book that is shown right now as criticized.","Having said that, we have a rigorous process as well around our oilfield services portfolio, as you can see on the chart that we did provide, 32 customers make up 75% of that portfolio. So we're able to stay in constant and close contact with them. Again, as we see any weakness there, again, we're very quick to move it into a criticized category.","David Eads","Just maybe to follow up on that, on the E&P portfolio, if you have 400 -- close to half of the loans were in -- a lot of those were in an over-advanced position, I would think they'd only be further over-advanced position now where oil prices have gone since the redetermination was complete. So would that suggest that criticized loans, the real criticized exposure might even be higher than that?","Barb Godin","No. If I take the spring redetermination that we did, that was somewhere between -- let's just use roughly 15% reduction in borrowing basis. Now we're saying there's an incremental 8%, I will round it up, on top of that, so roughly 23% reduction in borrowing base.","Remember as well in the industry, customers get a six-month cure period in which they're able to cure and we have seen a number of customers. Again, those earlier in the year that had access to capital markets and even now those that are still very strong have access to capital markets and they're able to take themselves out of an over-advanced position.","David Eads","Okay. Maybe just as we think about the dislocations we're seeing in the markets right now, I know it's fairly early, but do you guys have any sense of how that -- if this continues, how that would impact the strategy you guys have for growing the capital markets and wealth management businesses? Is there anything that's particularly sensitive to market activity levels that you'd be more concerned about the growth trajectory?","David Turner","This is David. I will tell you that we're creating these new products and services. The driver of that is because our customers need that and we're looking to have a more fulsome offering to our customers. And we're out there talking to them and feel very good about where they stand right now which is why I reiterated our guidance for 2016 on things like loan growth being in the 3% to 5%.","In our discussions with our customers, we still see the domestic economy being okay. We're looking at 2%, 2.5% GDP and so there is this dislocation that's happening here of late, but as we see our customers, we believe they need the products and services, the capital markets investments we're making we think are going to be very strong and looking for that to continue and help us get to that 4% to 6% growth rate that we're expecting in non-interest revenue.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore IS.","Steve Moss","It's actually Steve Moss for John. I guess first off for List, congratulations and good luck on your retirement here.","List Underwood","Thank you. Thank you.","Steve Moss","And wanted to ask about energy again. Just wondering here with regard to oil -- if it declines further to $20 to $25, let's say, what are your potential losses there?","Grayson Hall","I will ask Barb to reiterate and complete this statement, but when we look at our energy portfolio, we have got a very disciplined process of calculating probability defaults and loss given defaults. We've got the redeterminations we're doing on the E&P portfolio twice a year. So we feel good about the level of rigor and discipline around our process that drives that evaluation of how much we reserve based on what we think the incurred losses may be. And so I think our confidence in that process is very solid.","We're staying disciplined around that process and if oil prices continue to decline, that process is going to drive risk ratings down on some of our credits and will drive a higher level of criticized classified loans and will drive how we reserve against those loans. But it will be on an incurred loss basis. Until that incurred loss occurs from an accounting perspective, our process is going to determine that. So Barb, you want to add too?","Barb Godin","I think what I would add to that is, the operative word here being how long will oil prices stay depressed and you mentioned somewhere in the $20 a barrel range. And again, if it's in the $20 a barrel range and it stays there for an entire year, it could be in terms of charge-offs -- this is not provision -- could be up to an incremental $50 million and that is based on some back of the envelope versus anything precise, I would have to tell you. But again, that's not our view and I don't think it's the view of the industry at this point that oil is going to stay sub-$30 for any length of time.","Steve Moss","Okay. And then with regard to the criticized level, you indicated on the E&P is 48%, was just wondering what is the total amount of criticized loans in the energy portfolio?","Barb Godin","Total amount of criticized loans in terms of everything including the operating leases we had, $900 million.","Steve Moss","Yes. Okay.","Barb Godin","$900 million on 3.2 or 28%.","Steve Moss","And then I guess one more thing. With regard to the margin, just a little more color here in terms of short-term expectations for the margin given the first Fed hike, how we should think about the margin in first quarter.","David Turner","So I try to give you a little bit more global view of where we thought NII margin was going. So we start breaking it down. We get pretty granular. There's puts and takes either way. If you just want to focus on that component of the December increase, we're probably benefiting in the $5 million to $10 million range in the first quarter, but remember there's some other things going the other way. You've got day counts, about a $5 million working against you.","You've got the interest reversal of $4 million that I talked about in my prepared comments. So I think it's better to look overall at the guidance in terms of relatively stable margin and growth in NII in that 2% to 4% range commensurate with the loan growth that we talked about of 3% to 5%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","So on energy again, looking at the build from 4.7% reserves that you talked about at the Investor Day for 3Q up to the 6% and then taking into account the charge-offs as well, to me it looks like almost all of the provisioning in the quarter related to the energy portfolio. Is that the right way to be thinking about it or am I missing something there?","Barb Godin","No, you're actually thinking about it right. If you look at the balance of our book, the balance of our book actually improved and we were able to reallocate that provision over to the energy customer.","David Turner","If you looked at the credit quality of our book and you ex energy, then the balance of our book performed very well this past quarter and we continue to see improvements in almost all of our credit metrics. But if you look at -- you add the energy back in and to Mark's point, there's stress in that sector, but because the way our portfolio's performing, it allowed us to build reserves around the energy portfolio.","Geoffrey Elliott","Just a follow-up, you've mentioned commodities a couple of times in the discussion. Can you just remind us where the other commodities exposures are and how stress in commodities beyond oil and gas could have some impact on credit?","Barb Godin","As I think about commodities, firstly our book in commodities we have roughly $400 million in fabricated metal and primary metals and another $430 million, so just to give you a rough sense for the size of the book. Again, a lot of those commodities in terms of metals, that's also an indirect hit, so to speak, from what's happening in the oil sector because they rely on a lot of those metals to provide piping, et cetera. You're seeing a secondary knock-on effect and one that we're keeping a close eye on.","Grayson Hall","We have a fairly minor exposure to agriculture.","Barb Godin","Yes, $800 million in ag.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill.","Stephen Scouten","Question for you maybe on the expenses, you had some nice progress here in the quarter. I'm wondering is any of that going to reverse out in the coming quarter, especially maybe that $12 million on unfunded commitments that was saved? And maybe beyond that, are you still expecting about 35% to 45% of the $300 million in saves to come out here in 2016?","Grayson Hall","So we do expect 35% to 45% of the $300 million to come out in 2016. And you're right, the reason we broke that out separately is that is not something that's expected to benefit at least to the degree we had in the second quarter. So we wanted to call it out separately so you could take that into account in your model.","Stephen Scouten","Okay. And just on a net basis, do you still believe that the $300 million really just allows you to keep overall expenses relatively flat and maybe even still up on a total dollar amount for 2016?","Grayson Hall","That's right, Stephen. We're calling for continuing to make investments to grow NIR, utilizing our savings of the $300 million, at least the 35%, 45% of that to help us keep expenses relatively flat to up modestly from the level that we're reporting for 2015.","Stephen Scouten","And then maybe if I could on capital and the buyback, it seems like you got about $350 million remaining maybe relative to the CCAR ask. Could that be accelerated in the quarter based on where the stock is trading now with it under tangible book? Is that something where you guys can take advantage of where the stock's trading currently?","Grayson Hall","Any change to -- $350 million is right, $175 million generally in each quarter. In order to change the amount and\/or timing requires an approval from our regulatory supervisors and there is a mechanism for doing that. But we have to assess that and can't guarantee there would be any change from what's already been approved.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","John Hearn","This is actually John Hearn on for Gerard. Just two questions for you. The first back to the criticized balance for the energy portfolio, can you tell us what it was in the third quarter?","Barb Godin","Criticized balance? It was roughly $300 million less.","John Hearn","$300 million less.","Barb Godin","I can get you an exact number after the call.","John Hearn","And then more broadly, the regulators in December I believe they expressed some concern about underwriting standards for CRE and construction lending. Can you comment a bit about what you're seeing in those segments and are you beginning to see any changes since the comments came out?","Barb Godin","No, in fact, we're feeling very good about our book CRE and construction lending, we used to have a book that was very heavy previously going back several years. And we've taken a lot of lessons from that to ensure that we understand what we're putting on our books and that we need to feel comfortable both in a stress situation as well as a normal situation.","So we have been very deliberate about what we're putting on the books. We have not had very much growth, came off a very low base in terms of growing that book and again, very deliberate on the types of credits that we're willing to underwrite. So again from a credit perspective, I feel very comfortable.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners.","Christopher Marinac","Just wanted to ask about where acquisitions may fit in, in select markets if at all this next year.","Grayson Hall","Chris, we certainly are very analytical and disciplined about how we focus on acquisitions. Quite frankly, our primary focus has been on bolt-on acquisitions in the non-bank space. 2015, we did two relatively small transactions that you're familiar with. We continue to look at the marketplace and we still think there's opportunities in both our wealth segment as well as our capital markets segment and insurance segments for bolt-on acquisitions. We continue to look. I think the expectation is these are going to be relatively small in size and still at this juncture we're -- valuations are that predominantly our interest is in the non-bank space.","Christopher Marinac","Grayson, if pricing did change, would you reconsider the bank side or would that have to shift a lot to affect that?","Grayson Hall","As markets change, we always reconsider. So markets change, we try to analyze what the changes are and see where the opportunities are.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Winter of Sterne Agee.","Peter Winter","Just want to go back to the 2016 expectations. The operating leverage of 2% to 4%, if the revenues come in a little bit weaker than expected, would you guys let more of the expense saves fall to the bottom line to ensure that operating leverage that you're forecasting?","David Turner","We looked at a lot of different scenarios, Peter, in terms of committing to the 2% to 4% or at least indicating if we could get to 2% to 4% operating leverage, there are a lot of different scenarios. We believe through our expectations of revenue growth and our expectations of expense management that we will get there. The combination of how we get there may change and we will adjust, adapt and overcome. But our goal is to generate that positive operating leverage regardless of the environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jack Micenko of SIG.","Jack Micenko","One of the industry conferences in the fourth quarter, I think you had disclosed that you were moving towards the upper end on the branch closure range that you gave at Investor Day. Does that still hold you true? And then the second question would be, the cadence of those closures, should we think about -- is there any guidance we can think about in dealing with modeling some of those onetime charges that we saw like in this quarter?","David Turner","Jack, so we did say we were looking at 100 to 150 branches. We said we would probably be towards the upper end of that through our strategic planning period. We've announced 29. We continue to look each and every day at how to best optimize our branch footprint which has included even opening some new ones at times. But it's hard to get the cadence down to give you that commitment up front because it's all facts and circumstances based.","We have to look at our footprint, what's going on in the footprint. We have a lot of coordination that has to happen. What I can tell you is so we had a $6 million charge on the 29 branches that we closed or made a decision on consolidating this quarter. There will be another roughly $6 million associated with those branches, so it's -- call it $12 million. And we expect a payback on that of about two years which is what we've had historically.","So all branches aren't created equal, they're all a little different. If you go back and look at all of our branch consolidations, it will give you a feel for what that charge might be over time, but it's hard for me to give you precise timing.","Jack Micenko","And then obviously you have a large, large portion of your deposits are consumer. Have you been feeling any pressure on the commercial side to pass on any of the rate increase some of the other banks have talked about today?","Grayson Hall","No, at this juncture we just have not seen deposit rate pressures. Given such a fairly modest increase in rates, the pressure from any part of our depository base has been very muted. We continue to watch very closely what our competitors are and watch very closely what our customers are saying to us. But quite to the contrary, we continue to grow deposits and in fact grow low cost deposits at a pretty healthy pace. And so we're not seeing that particular issue arise at this juncture.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Barker","You made the comments that you're looking at acquisitions in the non-bank space. Could you describe that a little bit further and what targets you're looking at potentially in order to expand your fee income?","David Turner","Sure. This is David. As Grayson mentioned, one of our strategic initiatives is to diversify our revenue and in this context diversification, is away from NII and into NIR. As we think about the desire to diversify and we think about how we can have a more full-some offering to our customers, things in capital markets come to mind. You saw our acquisition of BlackArch Partners, our M&A advisory firm. We looked at insurance entities. We will continue to do that, agencies, continue to expand there.","We would like to have a more solid offering in fixed income sales and trading, so we're looking there. And I think that these acquisitions have a tendency to be smaller acquisitions, but they fit into our need and our desire to continue to diversify and we think fit very well with our strategy.","Grayson Hall","And really serve -- they fit a customer need. Trying to identify the needs that our customers have and how we can serve those better, but at the same time, to David's point, diversify our revenue. But we make sure that these are incremental in nature, bolt-on acquisitions that don't -- that have a risk profile that we feel like is prudent.","And so I think you should expect us to continue to look at those opportunities over 2016, but our primary focus as you've seen is on organic growth in the markets we're in today with the services we have today. But this is in addition to that. But primary focus is organic growth.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And apologies if somebody might have mentioned this earlier. With regard to your CCAR in 2016, we had a pretty big impact from the stress test last year. Given the decline in oil prices and where you are now, do you anticipate a similar decline this time around and how are you preparing for CCAR going into 2016?","David Turner","Well, so we got a lot of work going on with CCAR to be prepared for our submission in April. We look at a lot of different portfolios. I think from a credit standpoint, we mentioned earlier that ex energy, our credit portfolios are actually improving. That works one way in terms of the CCAR submission. Energy clearly needs to be taken into account. Barb laid out some of the stresses that we're seeing and how we will account for those.","From our standpoint, we have one of the strongest levels of Common Equity Tier 1 of our peer group. We did return 93% of our earnings to our shareholders which we think was appropriate. And as a result, we didn't want to continue to accrete capital because we felt like we had enough capital to run our business in a prudent manner.","We look at our stresses all the time, not just from a CCAR standpoint. We do that for ourselves to make sure we're managing and optimizing our capital in our company so that we have enough in times of stress and -- but not too much in terms of ensuring we can have an appropriate return to our shareholders.","So exactly how all this will manifest itself in CCAR we will have to see and let the -- we run a lot of programs. We will just need to see what the results are. We don't see anything drastically different than what we have submitted before, ex-energy.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill.","Stephen Scouten","Thanks for letting me hop on for one follow-up. I just wanted to confirm, that $50 million to $75 million in potential incremental off the oil space around here, that's assumed just for 2016 as I heard it. And so would we assume that there could be further tail risk if oil prices remain depressed for a longer period of time?","List Underwood","That's right. That's a 2016 number. Obviously if oil stays low longer, then there is tail risk to that.","Grayson Hall","Thank you. Well, with that, we stand adjourned. Thank you for your participation and we look forward to next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"17970":["Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) Q2 2013 Earnings Call July 23, 2013 11:00 AM ET","Executives","M. List Underwood - Director of Investor Relations","O. B.

My name is Paula, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.","M. List Underwood","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Regions Financial's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Our presenters today are Chief Executive Officer, Grayson Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Turner. Other members of management are present as well and available to answer questions as appropriate.","Also as part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Finally, let me remind you that in this call, and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking statement that is located in the Appendix of the presentation.","With that, I'll turn it over to Grayson.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Regions and participation in our second quarter 2013 earnings call. Regions' positive momentum continued in the second quarter, with results meeting or exceeding our expectations as we remain focused on executing our strategic priorities and our business plans.","Let me highlight a few of our accomplishments in this quarter. Loan production increased, and more importantly, we grew loan balances outstanding. We expanded our customer base and grew core checking accounts. We invested in improved technology and experienced bankers to enhance our revenue-producing capabilities. We continued our disciplined focus on expense management, and we completed several actions that improved our debt and capital structure, as well as reduced our future funding costs. We raised our common stock cash dividend. And finally, we began executing common stock share repurchase program.","I am encouraged by our accomplishments in the first half of 2013 and believe that we are better positioned for continued progress in the second half of the year. Overall, our balance sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in both short- and long-term rates. Moreover, rising rates indicate an improving economy, which should ultimately lead to greater demand among our customers for products and services that translate into additional business opportunities.","In addition, we are encouraged by the outlook for the Southeastern U.S. where the majority of our franchises are located. According to a recent research report for Moody's, the Southeast continues to lead the nation in job creation and hiring rates. Furthermore, the Southeast is at the forefront of the national recovery in residential construction. As housing starts had risen by 84% since May 2011 versus the national average of 62%, we have experienced similar trends as the mix of mortgage applications is shifting more towards new home purchases and away from refinances. This quarter, 53% of mortgage originations were for new home purchases compared to 35% in the previous quarter.","Our success this quarter was driven by loan growth, which is broad based across our markets. Importantly, 70% of the markets we serve experienced loan growth in the second quarter. Commercial and industrial loan growth was a primary contributor to the improvement, but we also experienced strong growth in indirect auto lending and a modest pickup in credit card balances.","In addition, we observed a slowdown in the pace of decline in the investor real estate portfolio and moderating declines in residential mortgage loans. Further, the new loan production remains strong at $8 billion, up 23% over prior quarter, as all loan categories experienced an increase in production.","Additionally, we made progress during the second quarter in growing our customer base, which includes business customers, as well as consumer and Wealth Management customers. Growth of this essential measurement should, over time, provide additional revenue opportunities. Over the past several months, we hired close to 100 financial consultants and placed them in our branch offices. These financial consultants have generated approximately twice the amount of business that we had initially forecasted, and we plan to further expand and enhance this activity.","Our continued focus on prudent expense management is also paying off. Excluding debt extinguishment cost, second quarter's decline in operating expenses drove a linked quarter improvement in our adjusted efficiency ratio of approximately 180 basis points. We've done this while continuing to make appropriate investments in people, in products and in technology. To illustrate, this year we've hired over 500 net new associates, many in revenue-generating roles.","Finally, regarding Basel III final rule, recently approved by the regulators, we are pleased that our capital position will be less impacted than our previous estimate, and we have greater clarity in our capital planning process going forward.","I'll now turn the call over to David, who will provide you greater detail about second quarter financial trends. David?","David J. Turner","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with the balance sheet on Slide 3. So we were very pleased with our loan growth this quarter. At quarter end, balances stood at $75 billion, which is an increase of $1.1 billion or 1.4% from the first quarter.","Starting with business lending, which includes our commercial and investor real estate portfolios, these loans increased 2% from the end of the prior quarter. This growth was broad-based geographically and continues to be led by our commercial and industrial category as ending loans in this portfolio grew 5% versus the prior quarter.","Areas that experienced growth included Regions business capital, real estate corporate banking, as well as health care, transportation and technology lending.","Meanwhile, total new C&I production increased 36% over the prior quarter. And pipelines remain strong, and we are beginning to see a pickup in loan production extending beyond middle market into the small business segment, which is encouraging. Notably, line utilization increased 30 basis points from last year to 44.7%. The second quarter is usually a seasonally strong quarter for commercial growth. And while we expect growth in commercial and industrial loans to continue, we do not expect the pace of growth to remain at this level during the seasonally slower third quarter.","We were encouraged that we experienced a more modest pace of decline in the investor real estate portfolio. This portfolio declined 4% linked quarter compared to the previous quarter's decline of 5%. At quarter end, investor real estate ending balances stood at $7 billion, down 26% or $2.4 billion from 1 year ago. Notably, new and renewed production in the investor real estate portfolio has continued to improve as we see more opportunities to make loans to qualified borrowers consistent with our risk appetite. In fact, we've seen a variety of new lending opportunities within homebuilder finance, which was 28% of total investor real estate production in the second quarter compared to 17% this time last year. Overall balances in the investor real estate portfolio may fluctuate, depending on productivity levels, derisking in payoff activity.","Turning to consumer lending, this portfolio totaled $28.9 billion and was steady linked quarter, as consumer deleveraging began to subside. Importantly, our mortgage portfolio was relatively stable linked quarter, due to the retention of $222 million of 15-year fixed rate conforming residential mortgages in the second quarter.","Declines in our home equity portfolio, which includes lines and loans, continued as customers take advantage of opportunities to refinance. However, we are encouraged by recent results as loan production increased 47% linked quarter due to an improvement in residential home valuations and customers taking advantage of our home equity loan product. This production is expected to continue to reduce the pace of decline in our overall home equity portfolio.","Indirect auto loans increased 8% quarter-over-quarter and total loans -- total production was up 21% as we continued to expand our dealer network. At quarter end, we had almost 2,100 dealers and plan to increase the number of dealers by another 10% by the end of the year. There are currently approximately 8,000 dealers located in our footprint, further illustrating the opportunity we have to increase our dealer network.","Credit card balances were also up this quarter as our number of cardholders increased 2%. And we remain focused on increasing our penetration rate of our credit cards into our current base of 4 million households. We believe that, over time, this will result in a substantial increase in the number of customers that carry our Regions credit card.","Overall, we're pleased with the determined efforts of our bankers, which have translated into improved loan production and growth in balances this quarter. Historically, the summer months have been typically slower production months for the industry, but we will continue to stay focused on growing our business.","Let's move to the liability side of the balance sheet. Deposit mix and cost continued to improve in the second quarter. Total average low-cost deposits increased $230 million linked quarter, and time deposits fell to just 12% of total deposits. This positive repricing and mix shift resulted in deposit cost declining 3 basis points down to 15 basis points. While the opportunities for continued reduction in deposit cost is now more limited, we have an additional $3.6 billion of CDs maturing in the second half of 2013 at an average rate of 43 basis points. Now this compares to our current average going on rates for new CDs of approximately 21 basis points.","Let's take a look at how all this has impacted our net interest income and the resulting margin. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $821 million, up $10 million or 1% linked quarter. The increase was driven in part by an additional day in the quarter, incremental loan growth, continued declines in deposit cost and liability management activity. The resulting net interest margin was 3.16%, up 3 basis points linked quarter. Again, the reductions of deposit and borrowing cost were principal drivers, although our net interest margin was also impacted by a decline in excess average cash balances.","As we have previously stated, rising interest rates are beneficial to our net interest margin as our asset-sensitive balance sheet reacts favorably to increases in both short-term and long-term interest rates. Despite the outlook for short-term rates being stable for the foreseeable future, the recent rise in long-term interest rates has increased our expectations for future net interest margin. If rates remain at current levels or increase further, we expect modest margin expansion over time.","As long-term rates rise, we experienced higher reinvestment yields in our investment portfolio. And as mortgage prepayment slowed, we experienced less premium amortization, which amounted to $73 million in the second quarter, down from $77 million in the first quarter. At the end of the second quarter, mortgage-backed securities represented 84% of our investment portfolio. So as long-term interest rates rise, we continue to see a benefit to our portfolio yield.","Let's move on to the next slide, where we illustrate this point. We estimate that if short-term rates increase an additional 100 basis points, our net interest income would increase approximately $81 million over the next year. And separately, if longer-term interest rates were to increase an additional 100 basis points, our net interest income would increase an additional $132 million. Each of these scenarios would be additive to our base scenario, which assumes increases in longer-term interest rates over the next 12 months.","Considering that the recent changes in interest rates occurred during the latter part of the quarter, it was not a significant factor affecting the second quarter's net interest income. It takes time for rate increases to impact net interest income by way of reinvestment yields, prepayments and other customer behaviors. However, these recent increases negatively impacted the change in the unrealized gain in the securities portfolio. So I want to provide you a little more color on some adjustments we've made to the investment portfolio during the quarter.","The overall size of the portfolio declined $2.7 billion linked quarter, and we also moved $2.4 billion in securities to held to maturity. These actions will allow us to reduce wholesale borrowings, reduce the overall balance sheet size, reduce tangible common equity volatility and increase flexibility and asset liability management. In connection with these actions, we offset portfolio sales with derivatives in order to maintain our sensitivity profile. We will consider additional strategies as loan growth continues, and we get more clarity on fiscal and monetary policies. Including the assets moved to held to majority, at quarter end, the securities portfolio was $24.4 billion or 24% of earning assets compared to 26% in the previous quarter.","Let's take a look at noninterest revenue on the next slide. Second quarter noninterest revenue declined 1% linked quarter, primarily related to a decline in mortgage and service charge income. As expected, mortgage banking revenue was down in the second quarter. Mortgage loan production was $1.9 billion, an increase of 6% over the prior quarter. This production was offset by changes in market rates that affected mortgage servicing rights hedges and gains on sale, which ultimately lowered mortgage revenue. And as mentioned earlier, the retention of 15-year production on our balance sheet also impacted mortgage income. However, in order to generate additional mortgage revenue, we are also focused on cross-sell opportunities as only 13% of Regions banking households have a Regions mortgage.","Service charges during the quarter were impacted by a couple of factors. In viewing service charges during the quarter, we determined that we needed to make $12 million in additional reimbursements to customers related to our non-sufficient funds policy change that we made last year. Excluding this charge, service charges would have been up over the prior quarter due primarily to household growth that we experienced. Additionally, we continue to focus on other revenue-generating products and services like our Now Banking suite of products. During the quarter, the number of households using these products increased 4% and the number of active Now Banking debit cards increased 6%. Of note, almost 60% of these customers are new to Regions, providing us with additional opportunities for revenue growth.","Moving on to expenses. Noninterest expenses totaled $884 million. However, excluding debt extinguishment cost related to the early termination of certain debt and preferred securities, noninterest expenses declined 2% linked quarter. Credit-related cost continued to decline, as well as professional and legal fees. Salaries and benefits increased slightly this quarter due to additional staffing in income-producing areas, as well as increases for merit and incentive compensation. However, we continue to expect that 2013 expenses will be lower than 2012 expenses, illustrating our commitment to prudent expense management.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 31% and was impacted by the debt extinguishment cost associated with the early termination of certain debt preferred securities. Approximately $24 million of the $56 million was not deductible for tax purposes. That added about 2 percentage points to the effective rate. So if you exclude that impact, the tax rate would have been closer to 29%.","Let's move to asset quality. We continue to make progress with respect to asset quality. The provision for loan losses was $31 million or $113 million less than net charge-offs. Total net charge-offs were down $36 million linked quarter, and net charge-offs as a percent of total average loans was 77 basis points, which is the lowest level since the first quarter of 2008. Both nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets declined 5% linked quarter. In addition, total delinquencies declined 7% from first to second quarter.","Inflows of nonperforming loans amounted to $328 million, which was within our range of $250 million to $350 million that we've previously discussed. And while this represents an increase from the prior quarter, it's important to note that the increase represents a small number of large credits, which create volatility in migration from time to time.","Notably, criticized and classified loans, which is one of the best and earliest indicators of asset quality, continued to decline with commercial and investor real estate criticized loans down 4% from the first quarter. Our coverage ratios remained solid. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance for nonperforming loans stood at 109%. Meanwhile, our loan-loss allowance to loans was 2.18% at the end of the second quarter. And based on what we know today, we expect continued improvement in asset quality going forward.","So let's take a look at capital and liquidity. We successfully completed several actions in the second quarter that served to improve the efficiency of our capital structure while reducing funding cost. Specifically, we called virtually all of our remaining trust-preferred securities, tendered for higher cost senior debt and issued lower-cost debt. As a result of these actions, along with scheduled debt maturities, our overall funding cost improved 5 basis points to 40 basis points, and our run rate will improve going forward. These actions have been included in our margin guidance that we have provided.","We also increased capital returns to shareholders by raising the corporate dividend and repurchasing shares. For additional information related to the early termination of debt-preferred securities, refer to the Index, which is at the end of the earnings presentation.","Our capital position remains strong as our Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter stood at 11.7%, and our estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 11.2%.","We continue to analyze the final Basel III capital rule issued on July 2, and we're pleased that many aspects of the proposal were modified or removed from the final rule. Based on our interpretation, we estimate our pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will be approximately 10.4%, a significant improvement from our original estimate under the proposed rule.","Liquidity at both the bank and holding company remains solid with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 81%. Lastly, based on our understanding of the new amendments, Regions remains well positioned to be fully compliant with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio.","So in summary, we continue to be confident in our ability to maintain positive momentum as we strive to prudently capitalize on Regions' opportunities and deliver consistently positive returns for shareholders.","I'll now turn it back to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call. List?","M. List Underwood","Thank you, David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session of our call. [Operator Instructions]","Operator, now let's open up the lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the progression for earning asset growth. It's great to see the loan progression moving the right way, and you talked about shrinking the portfolio a little bit on the security side. So with period end earning assets lower than the averages, I'm just wondering, are we at the point where we get to that bottom of average earning assets? And what do you expect to see as far as that trajectory?","David J. Turner","Yes, Ken, this is David. We had, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, taken some actions with regards to our securities portfolio and deleveraged. You don't see all of that coming through. There's a little piece and other assets that will settle. And you'll see reductions there. But our earning asset number, in general, if you kind of look at it over longer term, we think we're pretty close to where we can get net growth from here. We may have some minor adjustments depending on what we do from a deleveraging standpoint. But I think it really comes down to us, is the loan growth, which we see as continuing to be positive.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","All right. And then my follow-up is just, any update with regards to ordering around NSFs and any potential changes you might have to make affecting revenue in that regard?","O. B. Grayson Hall","No. I mean we continue to -- we continue to review and challenge ourselves on policies, continue to try to make our policies very customer friendly, very transparent, continue to make adjustments here as guidance comes out. But no news to disclose is forthcoming at this juncture.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about your NIM guidance. You indicated that you could see some positive forward movement. Can you just give us a sense as to how much you're expecting from the funding cost and the asset repricing versus the mix shift? And part of the reason for asking is you do give the chart on the 100 basis points rise in rates at the long end of the curve, which 132 bps is 12 basis points to NIM. We did get that in the last quarter. I know it comes over the last 12 months, but I'm wondering if we're triangulating to 12 basis points, and that's what you mean by modest.","David J. Turner","12 basis points is above what modest is. We've been kind of in a stable discussion with, relative to our NIM. And that's really dependent on what happens with the interest rate environment. We've seen some pretty incredible volatility over this past quarter, so it gets a little harder to pin it down exactly. And we understand that's why you're asking the question. We tried to put a little guidance both in the short-term and long-term rates to give you our thoughts. So modest, to us, there would be some increases, perhaps a tad higher than what stable has been. Stable has been within 1 or 2 points, so modest could be slightly more than that. But I think your number's a little high.","O. B. Grayson Hall","I do think, Betsy, when you look at it, we've had a fairly disciplined approach to deposit pricing. We're down 3 basis points again this quarter. But we look at where deposit pricing is today, the opportunities to drive that number lower are diminishing. But we did make, with the debt and capital restructuring we did this quarter, we did reduce our funding cost. Loan yields continued to be under pressure. But -- and you saw a slight compression this quarter on loan yields. But our portfolio yield should improve incrementally over time. So we do believe we've got a modest opportunity for expansion. But a lot of that's going to depend on how rates move and what the slope of the curve eventually turns out to be.","David J. Turner","I would add to that, you need to really think through -- and I mentioned the impact of prepayments on our investment portfolio. The premium that we have that we're amortizing was down. It was $77 million in the first quarter, $73 million in the second. So that change in the 10-year really does impact that amortization quite a bit. So that's really one of the things to look at.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. The follow-up is just on that Page 6 slide where you do indicate the interest rate sensitivity summary. That assessment of the 100 bps, long end of the curve, $132 million NII impact, could you just give us some color as to what the assumptions are in there? Is that just static portfolio, static moves? And your modest increase in NII takes into consideration, competitive actions that you would take? Is that how I triangulate the 2 statements?","David J. Turner","I think you got to take all that into account. It's not just the static portfolio. That has baked in what we think our balance sheet changes are going to be, our productions -- loan production's going to be, prepayments assumptions on the investment portfolio. So all that's really baked in, deposit cost, funding -- long-term debt cost. So it's really, everything's in that guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Going back to your C&I loan growth, was that new stuff that was coming in, or is it your people tapping the utilization rate? And what is your utilization rate at this point on those portfolios?","David J. Turner","The utilization rate was up to about 44.7%. That was not the big driver. The big driver really was new production from customers. And as I mentioned in the prepared comments, it was really broad-based geographically, over 70% of our geographies grew loans. We had not only that, but products, broad-base in products. Health care and transportation were a couple, REIT lending was embedded in that, too. So we're seeing a little broader push towards production. We also have seen that drift a little bit into small business. That's too early to call. We're starting to see that, which is very encouraging for us.","O. B. Grayson Hall","I would just add to that as this quarter versus last quarter, the diversification of our loan production was much better. Obviously, we'd love to see even more diversification and granularity in that production, but it was more broad based across markets, more broad based across products. And in particular, more broad based across the size of the corporate borrower. Most of our business in the last several quarters in C&I has come from a larger end of C&I middle market. We're seeing demand further down into that customer segment today. And as David said, still too early to call, but the small business owner, the small middle-market customer, it's coming back some. But too early to call it a trend.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And how is the multifamily markets -- are you participating in any of that -- this type of lending or is that something you guys don't get involved with?","David J. Turner","Yes, we do. If you look at commercial real estate for us, one of our big drivers has been multifamily. It represents about 27% of our production year-to-date, and it's right behind our home builder product, which I touched on, is starting to come back as well. So we're looking at multifamily. In particular, where that multifamily is, make sure we don't let that get out in front of us. But we feel good with those projects that we're putting on today.","O. B. Grayson Hall","When you look at it, the commercial real estate production has been historically, compared to historical volumes, had been very low. We saw production pickup in 2011. We saw it pick up even further in '12. And the pace we're at in '13, it will be a little bit above that. But as David mentioned in his earlier remarks, that portfolio continues to reduce an outstandings. We're down to about $7 billion. While we're encouraged by the new production, we still have not reached inflection point on that portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Penala of Bank of America.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","May first question is a follow-up to Betsy's. Even with some of the redemptions that occurred this quarter, it seems like you still have a higher cost long-term debt footprint. And I guess, this is a 2-part question. One is what is the propensity to redeem some of that long-term debt, especially given your capital ratios are quite high under Basel III? And if so, is that included in the NII guidance that you gave on Slide 6?","David J. Turner","Yes, we do continue to look at our long-term debt cost and ways to get that down. So we haven't stopped looking at it. Any of those instruments, though, that have any type of capital attached to it requires approval from our regulatory supervisors. So it goes through a little longer process to get approval to do that. But we are continuing to look at opportunities to get our total funding cost down, the 40 basis points. We'd like to get that lower. And our long-term debt cost is somewhere in the 4.5 range, so it's a good point.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And is that, is redeeming that included in the NII upside guidance on Slide 6 or not?","David J. Turner","It is not.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And my second question is on losses. I hear you loud and clear in terms of the trajectory of asset quality improvement from here. But as you think about how the improvement in the Southeast is going, where do you think normalized losses will be for Regions as we think about earnings power, a year from now, 2 years from now?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I'll ask Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer to answer that.","Barbara Godin","We talked a lot about 75 basis points through the cycle is what our risk appetite is. What that actually means as we come out of a cycle, that we should see something better than 75 basis points, somewhere down in that 50 basis point area would be appropriate. And then as we move through the coming years that, that will move somewhere around that 75 basis points depending on the mix of our portfolio between consumer and commercial books.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler at Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So first just on compensation here, it's up modestly year-over-year. And I understand that you're adding bodies in income-producing roles, and of course, variable comp's going to move with loan production here. But what is really the outlook here now that loan growth is positive and your guidance is positive? Should we expect to see continued kind of modest growth in comp here, or could we see it kind of revert back to the downward thrust we saw the last 2 years?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, I think that, clearly, we're still focused on rigorous expense management. And we are looking for opportunities to make our organization more efficient. That being said, we also are continuing to add resources that are customer-facing, revenue producing. And where we see opportunity to do that, we're going to take advantage of them, to grow and diversify our revenue streams. If we're successful in growing our revenue streams, then I think you should anticipate that our salaries and compensation would follow that success. That being said, in our non-revenue producing, noncustomer-facing parts of the company, we continue to try to become more efficient each and every quarter.","David J. Turner","Craig, I'll add to that. Our guidance that we had over the past several quarters for our efficiency ratio to be in that low- to high-50 range, which is dependent on an increase in rate, it's really the efficiency ratio, which came down, is more dependent on the revenue growth. And we see opportunities to hire talented bankers to help us grow that revenue line. And there are -- there is some time where you make investments that get the new folks up and running to generate the revenue. But to Grayson's point, we are very -- we're wanting to make sure we look at our expenses. We still believe '13 will be lower than '12, as we've mentioned. But we are rigorously reviewing the expense management. But we don't want to stop making investments in people and technology as we've done because that's really what the future of the franchise is all about.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I understand. One follow-up on deposit growth versus earning asset growth. Your deposit growth actually has been quite negative, we understand why. CD runoff, you've been shrinking the bank in certain areas. But also you think earning asset growth now actually will trend up, given kind of your response to a prior question. So do you think earning asset growth will materially exceed deposit growth the next year or 2? And if so, how do you expect to fund that?","David J. Turner","Well, first off, I would say our loan deposit ratio is 81%, which is about 9, 10 points below our peers. So we have some room there. We're always looking at growing earning assets, loans in particular, as well as households and deposits. So we would -- we've mentioned before that a loan deposit ratio in the low 90s would be fine with us as steady state. We want to make sure we don't have too much reliance on deposits from a funding standpoint and get the overnight market like most banks did in '08. But 81% we would argue, is a little lower than we want. And that's why we've been stressing really wanting to have appropriate loan growth to match off with the great funding that we have. And when you own deposit market share, and have the density we do in the Southeast, that's our competitive advantage coming through. But we still want to grow deposits and grow households.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Levin of Citi.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I want to follow up on the check-posting question from before. Are you still doing high to low? And if so, if you switch to low to high, how should we think about that impacting earnings?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I think, Josh, that we continue to look -- we are still high to low from a posting standpoint on most of our transactions. But you have to look at your availability policy, as well as your other policies surrounding insufficient funds, all in aggregate, to decide where that'll turn out from an earnings standpoint, we've not finalized on exactly -- on all of those decisions and have not put forth what we believe would be an earnings impact to that. But that continues to be an internal conversation that is being nailed. And as we get further guidance, we will share that with you.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Secondly, I guess this is one of the more upbeat and optimistic regional bank earnings call that I've heard this earning season. You seem to be more optimistic on loan growth than a lot of your peers. Why do you think that is? Is it your footprint? Is it something else?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, I think it's a number of reasons. I think, one is that we've been showing good loan production numbers for several quarters now. But the runoff in the commercial real estate portfolio and the runoff in our residential mortgage portfolio has, if you will, has muted the benefits of that loan production. As both of those asset segments, as the attrition slows in those segments, we've been able to show positive growth. We do believe that we've got a lot of bankers that are calling on customers and trying to put forth a very determined effort to grow our business in a prudent manner. We think the Southeast is recovering a little faster than some other parts of the country. But the most encouraging part of this is how it's broadened. Out of the markets we're serving, we had over 70% of our markets show net growth this quarter for the first time, and it's a real improvement over where we were. I think that if you read the other reports, we probably are a little more optimistic than many of the peers in this report. But from a place we've come from over the last few quarters and showing net decline, this has been sort of a very important quarter for us in demonstrating that turn.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James.","Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to get a sense on the loan pipeline. You talked a lot about it by product, but can you talk about it on a geographic basis? I mean, are you seeing more of the pipeline come from some of the more distressed areas that are now rebounding?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes. I mean, the -- clearly, the more distressed areas in our franchise footprint have been Georgia and Florida. We're seeing good response out of both of those markets at this juncture. As I just mentioned, the demand is more broad than it was a quarter ago, certainly 2 quarters ago. We are seeing, if you will, on the business side of our lending, we demonstrated pretty strong production quarter in the fourth quarter. Things slowed down a little bit in the first quarter, and then strong production here in the second quarter. Third quarter is typically a slow quarter for our business lending production. Our pipelines are good, but we aren't forecasting third quarter to be as strong as second. But that is really more of a seasonal bias on our part. We are seeing -- but we are seeing strong pipelines, so third quarter could surprise us to the upside. We'll wait and see. On the consumer side, we are seeing -- with, I guess, over 100 basis points increase in mortgage rates, we are seeing some mix shifts in our application volumes. We did $1.9 billion in mortgage production in the second quarter. It's up about 6% from the first quarter, so good production there. And our pipelines look good. But we are forecasting that we think that mortgage applications will decline. It's a little early to predict the decline, but it would look like it's somewhere in the 15% to 20% range for the second half of the year. I would tell you the mix has really shifted. We saw that mix shift start in the first quarter in our application pipelines. Today, purchase mortgages is running better than 50% of total production. And in the applications, it's even higher than that. So we do think that there'll be a fairly sizable shift in mix in mortgage originations. All our lending applications continue to be up. We're seeing strength in those. We're seeing good production of new accounts on credit card. So on the consumer side of the house, I think we are seeing some improving signs of strength. In particular, I think the rise in home valuations in some of the more distressed markets that we serve, we've seen that provide some opportunities for financing, particularly on the equity side of the house. That was probably more than you asked for.","Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I appreciate the color. Just as my follow-up, I just noticed that the branch count was flat this quarter for the first time in a while. I wanted to get your sense for the branch network from here. Are you looking to continue to consolidate maybe some smaller branches? And then how should we think about that going forward?","O. B. Grayson Hall","We continue to rationalize our physical footprint. We continue to believe that the physical branch office is very relevant in our business model. But we also recognize that customers are moving to other channels, and we're investing in those channels. We will continue to consolidate some of our offices. We look at that. We go through a very detailed analysis on where consolidations make sense. And we have -- you'll see us continue to do that. We've been more aggressive. We were more aggressive earlier in that regard. And -- but we continue that, and you'll see a very limited number of new offices being opened. But on a net basis, I would say you should look for us to continue to be stable to slightly down.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","David, just a follow-up to what you're referring to, the premium amortization falling from $77 million down to $73 million. So you saw rates of 100 basis points, I think the amortization is down $4 million. First, is the $73 million a good run rate, assuming rates stay at the current levels, or should we see a step-down into the next quarter? And also should we think about a 100-basis-point decline would lead to roughly $4 million of decline on a go-forward basis?","David J. Turner","I think if you looked at rates where we are today, that you should see a reduction in the $73 million. This has been an awful volatile environment, so it's hard to pinpoint it. But I think directionally, you're correct to assume that the -- that $73 million would be down. And if you get an increase in rates from here, some go down, obviously, that much quicker. But yes, so that's the direction you ought to think about it.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up to a question that had been asked earlier, just in terms of the $12 million of reserves for customer funds, is that a one-time item, so should we expect that not to resume over the coming quarters?","David J. Turner","Well, we believe that we have evaluated all our refunds relative to -- to the policy change we made last year, $12 million was the additional number. So we -- based on what we know, that's our -- that's the final number, so we don't see that recurring. We constantly look at our service charges and how we treat customers and make adjustments, but we don't anticipate anything at this point.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And if I can just squeeze in one last question, I mean, you've obviously given us a lot of disclosure around the rate sensitivity. But if I were to look at your most recent 10-Q, I think it says for a 200-basis-point parallel shift, you'd see $312 million of rise in NII. Given the changes you've had, where moving securities, adding derivatives, so first, how has that overall sensitivity changed? And do you guys have any customer facilitating derivatives that will be rolling off over the next years, such that you -- we could see your asset sensitivity increasing over time?","David J. Turner","That's our -- we wanted to really maintain our asset sensitivity. So you saw an awful lot of actions that we took during the quarter, but we really have maintained that asset sensitivity, in particular by entering into receive-fixed swaps, if you will, with a portion of about $2.5 billion worth of receive-fixed swaps. To maintain that, I think we're up 6% on 100 basis points, and that's about where we are right now. Obviously, higher rates, that much more of an increase in income that we could expect. So we like that position and want to keep it.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","If you could just -- if you can give us some additional color on new money yields that you're seeing in your loan book, particularly on the commercial real estate and the C&I side given the steeper curve here.","David J. Turner","On the -- frustratingly, that the short end of the curve really has remained anchored, for us, 1 month LIBOR in that 19- to 21-basis-point range. Spreads have come under some pressure, but we still are off the lows that we have seen before. We're kind of -- we feel okay with those spreads. They've been in that 225, 250 range for a while, and we feel good about that. We are seeing some pressure on structure that we're not chasing, but we've seen that anecdotally in the marketplace. But from a spread standpoint, we feel good about that. What's important on spread is to think about the customers that are in there. Grayson touched on it earlier. We really are a middle-market company, a small business lender. And if we can get the small business segment really demanding credit, then our overall yield and spreads will improve. When you're at the larger end in corporate, larger end of corporate, the spread tightens up quite a bit. Not as profitable but, obviously, not as risky either. So you have to trade off risk and profitability there. But in our core middle-market business that we're in, spreads have hung in there.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, I mean, I think if you look at it early on in the crisis, spreads really widened. Obviously, they came under competitive pressure and have compressed. But I would say, appear stable at the moment. An awful lot of competition in the market, got some very strong competitors, and so you're seeing competition on every transaction. We still are staying very committed to our relationship banking model, trying to make sure that we're banking customers that have full relationships with us. And we believe that we're keeping our new, ongoing business set from a pricing standpoint, we believe we're keeping that stable at this juncture. You do see the strength of our customer base improving. I'd say the overall credit quality of our customer book continues to improve, which certainly helps those customers from a rate standpoint.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the expense side, I want to get a better feel of what is a good run rate in your eyes in terms of total expenses. I know you indicated that -- your answer on the comp expense seems to imply that it may not pull back from the jump that the comp expenses saw this quarter. So if that doesn't necessarily pull back, but you do see that negative unfunded provision go away, could that mean that your expense level, on the core basis x the debt extinguishment, could actually go up from here?","David J. Turner","Well, again, I'll start with the end in mind, that is we believe 2013 expenses will be down from 2012. We do acknowledge the unfunded commitment credit that came in. That line item has a tendency to be a little volatile. That being said, we are looking very hard at every expense category. Obviously, our largest one is related to salaries and benefits. We do, and have, made investments in talent. We believe that's important to us long-term. But we do continue to look at and make sure we have the right people and the right -- the right number of people and the right people doing what we need them to do. We'll look at occupancy and furniture and fixtures are the next 2 biggest ones and continue to look at square footage and trying to become as efficient as we can. So I think it's hard to get on a specific run rate, but we are continuing to stay focused on improving expenses each and every day.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, I mean, the conversation is really around creating positive operating leverage. We're trying to take a balanced approach running the business. We're very disciplined, a rigorous focus on expenses, but also understanding that not all expenses are bad. We need to figure out a way to grow our revenues, and that requires investing in people and technology. And so our determination is to deliver positive operating leverage. That's been challenging in this economic environment, but I think just focusing on expenses alone is not in the best interest of the long-term sustainability of this franchise. But at the same time, we realized in this environment, given the economy and given reduced demand for some of our products and services, we really have to be disciplined around expense management. And we will continue to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just one more clarification on the moving pieces in the net interest income. Clearly, the earning asset base is a little bit smaller at the end of the quarter, and I assume that's the level that you're talking about, kind of growing plus or minus. And then the NIM's up on a modest amount, with some additional kicker from the premium amortization coming down. So when you bring all those moving pieces together, do you think you can grow the net interest income dollars in 3Q versus here, call it assuming stable rates in your loan growth assumption?","David J. Turner","That was where we're kind of guiding in the prepared comments, that if rates will stay where we are right now, we think we could have some modest improvements in NII and the resulting margin there. It's just hard to gauge exactly, Matt, how much that is with this kind of volatility. But I think that would be the appropriate guidance.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just longer term, as you think about the mix of the balance sheet, the security, its earning assets, is there a longer-term target as loan growth, hopefully, eventually picks up for everyone, including you? Is there a longer-term target versus the 24% currently?","David J. Turner","Yes. We're sitting here at 81% loan-to-deposit ratio. So our ability to attract, maintain low cost deposits is really a strategic advantage for us. We haven't had the loan growth we wanted, so we've had to put the delta in the securities book. So today, we probably have the second highest concentration of earning assets in our investment portfolio. We've talked about that before. And within that portfolio, we, at one time, had them virtually all in mortgage-backs, and we've diversified a way by introducing a little bit of credit risk in the investment portfolio since we weren't growing credit in the form of loans. But we do believe that as loan growth comes about, the economy generally improves, then you go back to a more standard relationship of the securities book, which would be in the high teens. So the 18 -- call it 18%, so it's 6 points away from there right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions on credit quality. I was noticing in your NPL migration schedule, in the commercial segment, there was a fairly significant uptick, and I'm wondering if that was just one particular credit that moved or a combination of a few.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, I mean, if you look at migration and you ask what's changed, it's really the mix. You're seeing much more commercial industrial loans in that migration mix and less commercial real estate loans. That's just sort of where we're at in the cycle. Commercial and industrial loans, by their nature, are going to be a little more uneven. There is obviously more substantial credits in that category. The other thing we do is that if we have a credit come into a nonperforming status in a given quarter, we count it as gross migration into NPL. And even if we resolve it within the same quarter, this quarter we had that situation occur, and so you see a fairly large credit in our migration. But that's already been resolved and now out of our numbers for the next quarter. So with commercial lending credits, you're just going to see a little more unevenness. It's still in our 250 to 350 band, that we sort of think is normalized but will be some unevenness from time to time in that migration.","David J. Turner","And Eric, that's where we -- I was trying to leave you with comments that based on all that, if you look at criticized and classifieds and you see that continuing downward trend, early-, late-stage delinquencies getting better, everything tells us that credit quality is going to continue to improve from here. So we weren't overly concerned with that migration.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one quick one. The -- can you give us what you think your tax rate is going to be for the back half?","David J. Turner","Yes, we had a couple of points in the effective rate this quarter because of the lack of ability to deduct certain of the charges that came through, on the termination costs. That was 2 points, and we were at 31%. So if you take that out, we'd be in the 29% range, which we think is a reasonable proxy for going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gaston Ceron of Morningstar Equity Research.","Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I just had one quick question. Going back to the issue, I think, that you brought up of -- regarding cross-selling, I think, at the mortgage business. I'm just curious if you have any more detail on how exactly you're going to go about the cross-sell opportunity and how high you think you can reasonably drive that 13% that you referenced kind of in the near and longer term.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, what we've been trying to do over the last several quarters is really push a relationship banking model that focuses on the customers and focuses on delivering the full benefits of Regions' banking relationship to our customers. We sort of internally branded that as Regions 360. We've been having meetings in every single market across our franchise, pulling together different lines of businesses, mortgages being a very, very important part of that to try to stimulate more conversation between teams, more referrals between teams. We've seen referrals from our branch offices. They're predominantly focused on consumer banking. We've seen a lot more referrals from those offices into our mortgage bankers. Likewise, we've seen a lot of referrals coming out of mortgage banking into our branches. We're driving that across our company. There's nothing special about that effort. It's the effort you -- we'd probably hear of and be espoused by most banking institutions. The key is in the execution, is how well can we execute that. And part of what you're seeing in our numbers this quarter is that execution has materially improved over the last few quarters.","Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","But do you have an area where you'd like to drive that 13% kind of penetration rate to or no?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I don't know that we set a defined a limit on that. The way we're really measuring it today is sort of quality referrals from our branches. They've more than doubled in the last 9 months. We'd love to keep that number going higher. The -- obviously, with the way the mortgage market is changing at this point in time, certainly, changes the mix of those referrals, but we haven't internally set a penetration number that I know of.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Grayson, one for you and then maybe one for David. Grayson, given what appears to be a substantially greater level of capital flexibility with your -- with -- under the Basel III final rule, and I appreciate that you're still thinking about some other steps that you can take in terms of the reduction in your debt cost, but I'm curious if that -- if the Basel III -- your current Basel III position makes you any more confident about going for potentially bigger buybacks in the 2014 CCAR and capital planning process than you might have originally thought.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, I mean, clearly, we were encouraged by where the regional banks landed on Basel III and in particular, where we landed in that final set of rules. We believe it does provide opportunities for us to think differently to some degree as we go through our capital planning process. More than anything else, it provides clarity. And that clarity, I think, gives us all more confidence. And so we're integrating that into all of our capital planning thoughts and processes. And I do believe it gives us as a company some flexibility that, at one point, we were concerned we might not have. But today, I think, we feel pretty good about our capital position and are building the appropriate plans to manage that.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. David, a question for you related to the securities portfolio. I guess I'm just curious if you can provide a little more color as to what investments you moved into the held-to-maturity bucket this quarter. It looks like it's about 10% of your total investments at this point and if the portfolio duration has changed meaningfully from the 3-plus years that it was at the end of the first quarter.","David J. Turner","Yes, we really took those assets that are more sensitive to interest rate movements, so longer-duration mortgage-backed securities, that we've pushed in there. And our duration in our investment portfolio as a result of the rate change did increase. Now we're probably in the 4-year range today, and that's acceptable to us given the interest rate environment that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Coming back to capital, clearly, with the final NPR from the Federal Reserve, the Tier 1 common ratios for the regional banks comes in the 7%, you may have a small SIFI buffer, possibly 25 or 50 basis points. Recognizing that you're not probably going to want to run close to that 7% number, what level do you think you're going to see your Tier 1 common ratio, which, obviously, is currently over 10%, settle in that? What -- have you guys given much thought yet on where you want to put that number so that there could be greater amounts of return of capital down the road to shareholders?","David J. Turner","Gerard, we think about that every day, and it's hard to tell exactly where it will settle out. I will tell you, without OCI in there and having the volatility that would have been there under the original proposal, it was going to probably cost us 25, 50 basis points just for that. We have talked about being in that 8%, 8.5% range. We'll see how it settles out. I will tell you, really, the gating factor for us has been and we believe will continue to be the severely adverse stressed Tier 1 common ratio versus the spot capital. And so you really have to kind of reverse engineer that. We don't know what the severely adverse level will be under Basel III. Today it's 5% under Basel I. You would expect there to be some reduction in that given that the risk weighted asset number, in general, changed for everybody. And -- but we'll see what our regulatory supervisors do. But I think it's -- broad-based, we would put it, best guess, at 8%, 8.5% right now, but really reserve the right for that not to be the correct number based on how we see what the regime looks like through this next CCAR filing.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And speaking of that, do you think that the folks that do the CCAR, the Federal Reserve, the regulators, are they going to move -- now that the final NPR is in and, statutorily, everyone knows what the capital ratios need to be for banks. Will they move away from the percentage of -- assuming, of course, you pass with strong numbers on the CCAR. But will they move away from percentage of earnings to just -- or can you guys argue that, look at our capital levels, we're 200 basis points above where we should be, we should be able to give most of that back in some sort of time frame? Or they -- do you think they'll stick with this percentage of earnings thing?","David J. Turner","Well, clearly, our regulatory supervisors, as do we, want a safe banking system. And I think there's been a lot of change that's been pushed through the marketplace. I think there's been an awful lot of thought that had gone through trying to do the right thing by everybody. And we've had a recent change, obviously, in Basel III. We need to see how that thinking evolves. So it's a little premature to bet on exactly what will happen. Clearly, there's more capital in the industry than we've had. We expect that the amount of capital in the industry will not go back to where it was precrisis. And I know that's a pretty large gap, but I think we need to be careful about getting ahead of ourselves, and let's see how this thing evolves in an appropriate manner. But...","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And finally, on your securities portfolio as a percentage of assets, you pointed out that your loan-to-deposit ratio is lower than you'd like. Where should we see -- when things get back to normal possibly in 2 to 3 years, where should we see the securities as a percentage of assets? Where are you guys comfortable with that number?","David J. Turner","That came up a minute ago. We really think, if you look at history, we would have been in that high teens, call it 18% just if you want a spot number. So that's about 6 points away, and that's a percentage of earning assets. So it's 6 points away from where we are today, which is $6 billion, $7 billion.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Foran of Autonomous.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I guess most of my questions have been asked, but maybe one on deposits. If you could remind us, any embedded assumptions as you think about asset sensitivity? And then just more broadly, the way we measure it, you guys have one of the bigger jumps in non-interest-bearing deposits as a percentage of total this cycle from about 20% back in the mid-2000s to 32% now. And just thoughts around sustainability of that increase. Clearly, there's been a lot of efforts internally that you've made to increase that number. But clearly, also, in a low rate environment, non-interest-bearing deposits tend to be a little higher.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, and I think I'll make a few comments. Obviously, this is a very different rate environment for our depositors than we've seen before. And so a lot of the historical evidence we have, I'm not sure how valid that is coming out of this cycle. We're having to stress test our deposit portfolio to make sure we understand what some of the possibilities are, depending on how rates move and how fast rates move, the pace of increase in those rates. And when you look at our portfolio today, we have dramatically reduced our dependence on higher-priced deposits. In particular, time deposits, as well as some high-priced depository accounts that we just have been less competitive on in this kind of environment. Obviously, as the market moves, we'll all have to move, and we've run a number of scenarios to try to forecast what those movements might be. But clearly, in this environment, it's a little different than anything we've seen before.","David J. Turner","Yes, I think we need to be really careful that we don't allow history to unduly influence what can happen this go-round. Because we all -- our industry has a lot of non-interest-bearing on the balance sheets that could move. Historically, that's -- there's a core level of non-interest-bearing that's going to be with us. We have some pretty drastic moves off the balance sheet. I think we're like 25% higher than we experienced last time in terms of our assumptions. That's been baked into our guidance. And I think it's important to think about these moves not only in the sense of thinking about what our net interest income and margin would be, but liquidity risk management, which is as important to us. And although we are sitting here with an 81% loan-deposit ratio, we can never lose sight of that. So we -- you've asked a great question. It's something we look at all the time, but we have higher outflows assumed today, than we had before. And we shock it a number of ways just to make sure that if we're wrong, what does that mean to us, again, in particular as it relates to liquidity.","Operator","Your final question comes from Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","David, before I let you off the hook, I want to go back to your interest rate sensitivity analysis. And if I'm looking at this kind of steepening of the curve that you're doing on the long end. And I'm kind of drilling down into that premium amortization, right now we're running in the 70s. If you were to extend the duration by 50%, it seems like it would probably bring that down into the 50s, which would generate about $80 million to $90 million worth of benefit. Was just curious, if that's relative to the $132 million, is 65%, 70% of that coming from the premium amortization? Or is that out of line with what you're building into that number?","David J. Turner","Yes, we have a piece of that, pretty large piece of the change in the premium amortization coming into the margin guidance, that $132 million. So yes, about 2\/3 is built into that.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So about 2\/3 of the impact is from premium amortization coming down?","David J. Turner","Right.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's about what I was thinking. And then when you go over to the short-term increase here, what are you assuming on deposit pricing? Are you -- as the 100-basis-point increase, are you assuming that money market accounts and your CDs are going up 1:1? Are you giving yourselves some credit for lagging those deposit rates?","David J. Turner","Yes. I think that we'd end up having about 60% of those that would be adjusted pretty quickly. Again, maybe that's higher than what we've experienced before. But we have a pretty immediate increase in rates to the extent that, that starts happening.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So you're not really building any deposit lag into the benefit of the $81 million?","David J. Turner","Yes, less than before.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. Because it seems like, as we come off the floor at least for the first 100 basis points, we've typically seen, especially with money market, mutual fund accounts maybe not being as competitive, that there'll be room for some kind of lagging as you first go through that first moving [ph] rate.","David J. Turner","We're certainly seeing this at a really low deposit cost standpoint. So all these are best guesses, but we really need to -- we're going to be competitive with regards to our rates that we offer our customers. So it's really also dependent on the funding that our competitors and peers have, too.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Okay.

My name is Shelby, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Dana Nolan to begin.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer, will review highlights of our first quarter financial performance; and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the details of the quarter. Other members of management are also present and available to answer questions.","A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and earning supplement are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","Our forward-looking statements disclosure and non-GAAP reconciliations are included in the appendix of today's presentation and within our SEC filings. These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of today's call.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Grayson.","Grayson Hall","Thanks, Dana. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying we're pleased with our first quarter 2018 results, which represent a good start to the year.","For the first quarter, we reported solid earnings from continuing operations of $398 million, up 44%, and earnings per share of $0.35, an increase of 52% compared to the first quarter of the prior year.","Importantly, we delivered positive operating leverage with solid revenue growth and disciplined expense management, and this marks another strong quarter of respect asset quality.","We continue to benefit from our asset-sensitive balance sheet and strong deposit franchise, which drove a 6% year-over-year increase in net interest income and a 21 basis point increase in net interest margin.","Total new and renewed loan production increased 24% over the prior year, resulting in a modest adjusted average loan growth during the first quarter.","In terms of the economy, we remain encouraged by improving conditions, as well as customer sentiment. The consumer generally remains healthy, and we continue to experience growth in our consumer loan portfolios, as well as consumer deposits.","During the quarter, we continue to experience broad-based improvement in most credit metrics, including further reduction in nonperforming loans, which marks the best metric in over a decade.","With respect to our business strategy, we remain committed to diligent execution of our strategic plan, and we're making notable progress with respect to our Simplify and Grow strategic initiative.","As part of that effort, in March, we announced steps to streamline our structure, creating more distinct lines of responsibility and much clearer accountability. These changes simplify our organization, strengthen our connection with our customers, increase engagement with our communities and create greater alignment with our business and our strategies. In addition, through reinforcing our commitment to our communities, we believe these changes will further improve service quality and make banking easier for our customers.","Related, two weeks ago we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Regions Insurance Group subsidiary. This transaction further supports our efforts to simplify and streamline our company and focus on businesses where we can add the most value. It also demonstrates our strategic planning and capital allocation process in action and aligns with our Simplify and Grow initiative.","In addition, we continue to evaluate our retail network strategy and recently approved plans to consolidate between 30 and 40 additional branches during 2018. To facilitate growth, we\u2019ve also plan to open approximately 20 de novo branches in certain high-growth priority markets.","Rest assured, during this time of transformational change for our company, we remain focused as ever on providing customers with exemplary service. This is what relationship banking is all about, and it's at the core of our needs-based, go-to-market strategy.","Validating our approach, we recently received recognitions from several external sources for our superior customer service. For the fifth consecutive year, Regions was ranked among the top 10% of companies across a wide range of industries in the Timken Experience Rankings. And for the fourth consecutive year, Regions has received the Gallup Great Workplace Award for employee engagement.","Regions was also recognized by Greenwich Associates with 22 excellence awards for small business and middle market customer service, and Regions ranked second highest in customer satisfaction for advance guidance in the J.D. Power Retail Banking Sales Practices and Advice Study. Again, these awards provide evidence that our needs based, go-to-market strategy continues to resonate with customers and associates.","As we look forward, we believe there are four key areas providing considerable momentum for Regions. First is our asset sensitivity and funding advantage driven by our low-cost deposit base, which we believe provides a significant franchise value and a competitive advantage in a rising rate environment.","Second relates to asset quality. We experienced another quarter of broad-based improvements in credit quality and continue to expect modest improvements throughout the remainder of the year.","Next, robust capital returns as we move towards our target Common Equity Tier 1 ratio included the anticipated capital generated from the sale of our Regions Insurance subsidiary.","Finally, we expect additional improvements in core performance through our Simplify and Grow initiative, which is well underway as evidenced by our actions during the quarter.","I will now turn the call over to David to cover the details of the first quarter. David?","David Turner","Thank you, and good morning. As Grayson mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which reflect improvement in several areas and solid momentum as we head into the remainder of 2018.","Before we get started, it's important to point out that the decision to sell our Insurance business meets the criteria for reporting as discontinued operations at March 31st. My comments this morning will be limited to results from continuing operations, and our earning supplements provides recast historical results that exclude insurance.","Now let's start with the balance sheet, beginning with average loans. Adjusted average loan balances increased $620 million or 1% over the prior quarter. Adjusted loans exclude the third party indirect vehicle portfolio, as well as the impact of a $254 million sale of residential mortgage loans that occurred during the first quarter. This sale consisted primarily of Troubled Debt Restructured or TDR loans, which are punitive for purposes of the FDIC assessment and include elevated loss assumptions under adverse capital planning scenarios.","This, coupled with an improving market for re-performing TDR loans, provided an opportunity to further derisk our balance sheet. Within consumer, we continue to generate consistent loan growth across most categories.","Adjusted average balances in the consumer lending portfolio totaled $30.1 billion, reflecting an increase of $157 million. Growth in residential mortgage, indirect other consumer, indirect vehicle and consumer credit card was partially offset by continued declines in home equity balances.","Turning to the business lending portfolio. Average balances totaled $48.6 billion, reflecting an increase of $463 million as growth in C&I loans was partially offset by declines in owner-occupied commercial real estate and investor real estate.","C&I loans grew $775 million, led by growth in government and institutional banking, energy and natural resources and technology and defense. And related pipelines continued to improve. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans declined $108 million, reflecting a slowing pace of decline.","Additionally, investor real estate loans declined $204 million, driven by maturities and payoffs. However, we believe this portfolio will begin to stabilize and grow in the second half of the year. For the balance of 2018, we continue to expect full year adjusted average loans to grow in the low single digits.","Let's move on to deposits. We continue to execute a deliberate strategy to optimize our deposit base by focusing on valuable low cost consumer deposits, while reducing certain higher cost, brokered and collateralized deposits.","Total average deposits declined approximately 2% during the quarter to $95.4 billion. Consumer segment deposits experienced modest growth during the quarter, consistent with our relationship banking focus, while corporate segment deposits decreased 2%, driven primarily by seasonal declines.","Average deposits in the Wealth Management segment declined $221 million or 2%, driven primarily by a decline in interest-free deposits, as well as ongoing strategic reduction of collateralized deposits.","Certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits within the wealth segment, which requires collateralization by securities, continued to shift out of deposits and into other fee income-producing customer investments. Average deposits in the other segment decreased $946 million or 36%, driven by our strategy to reduce retail brokered suite deposits.","Looking forward, we continue to expect 2018 full year average deposits to grow in the low single digits, excluding brokered and wealth institutional services deposits.","Let's take a look at the composition of our deposit base. During the first quarter, deposit cost increased 4 basis points to 21 basis points, largely driven by indexed accounts and annual savings account bonuses.","Total funding cost remained low at 46 basis points, illustrating the strength of our deposit franchise. Further illustrating this strength, cumulative deposit betas through the current rising rate cycle are only 13%. And importantly, consumer retail deposit betas remained near zero. As expected, commercial deposit betas have been more reactive with a cumulative beta of approximately 39%.","As a reminder, over 2\/3rds of our deposit base is from retail customers, and those customers have been very loyal to Regions, as more than 45% of our consumer low-cost deposits are from individuals who have been deposit customers for more than 10 years.","We are well positioned to maintain a lower deposit beta relative to peers given our large deposit franchise, customer loyalty, market locations, small account balances and our strong liquidity position. We are also committed to paying our customers competitive and appropriate rates on their deposits.","Let's take a look at how this impacted our results. On an adjusted basis, net interest income was $909 million, representing an increase of $2 million from the prior quarter, and net interest margin was 3.46%, an increase of 7 basis points. These increases were driven by higher market interest rates, marginally offset by the incremental cost of our opportunistic bank debt issuance earlier in the quarter.","In addition, two fewer days in the quarter reduced net interest income by approximately $10 million, but benefited net interest margin by approximately 4 basis points.","As a reminder, offsetting the net interest margin benefit from day count is a permanent reset downward of approximately 4 basis points associated with the reduced taxable equivalent adjustment resulting from tax reform.","With respect to full year 2018, due to higher interest rate expectations relative to our original forecast assumptions, we now expect adjusted net interest income growth in the 4% to 6% range.","Specific to the second quarter of 2018, we expect net interest income and net interest margin to increase, reflecting the full benefit of the March rate increase and current expectations for higher short term rates.","Keep in mind, one additional day in the second quarter will benefit net interest income approximately $5 million, but reduce net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points. We expect continued growth in net interest income consistent with our improved full year outlook, and we expect net interest margin to be stable to up modestly.","Let's move on to fee revenue. Adjusted non-interest income totaled $503 million, reflecting a decrease of $3 million or 1% from the fourth quarter. Other non-interest income includes a $6 million increase to the value of an equity investment and $7 million in net gains associated with the sale of certain low income housing investments. Offsetting these gains were $4 million of net impairment charges related to certain operating lease assets.","Capital markets experienced another strong quarter. However, income declined from a record high fourth quarter. Although timing can be difficult to project, we do expect capital markets income to be a significant contributor to adjusted non-interest income growth in 2018.","Card and ATM fees were seasonally lower, reflecting lower interchange income. An increase in mortgage income was driven by improvement in the market valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity.","Consumer fee income categories are an important and stable component of fee revenue and are also expected to contribute to overall growth in 2018. With respect to full year 2018, we continue to expect adjusted non-interest income growth in the 3% to 6% range.","Let's move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expense decreased $7 million or 1% attributable primarily to decreases in expense associated with Visa Class B shares and FDIC assessments, partially offset by increases in salaries and benefits and professional fees.","Recent unsecured debt issuances and the residential mortgage loan sale, consisting primarily of troubled debt restructured loans, contributed to a reduction in the FDIC assessment.","Excluding the impact of severance charges, salaries and benefits increase nominally due primarily to seasonally higher payroll taxes, partially offset by staffing reductions.","Efforts to simplify our organizational structure, including previously discussed structural changes, contributed to approximately 350 fewer positions since year-end and 735 fewer positions since the first quarter of the prior year.","These efforts contributed to increased severance charges this quarter. We do expect to incur additional severance charges throughout the remainder of 2018 as we execute on our Simplify and Grow strategic initiative.","The increase in professional fees is primarily attributable to higher consulting fees. The adjusted efficiency ratio was 60.5%, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. Of note, the company also generated 2.3% adjusted positive operating leverage over the first quarter of 2017.","We experienced solid growth in adjusted pretax pre-provisioned income, increasing 11% and reflecting its highest level in almost 10 years. For full year 2018, we expect adjusted operating leverage of 3% to 5%, relatively stable adjusted expenses and an adjusted efficiency ratio of less than 60%.","The first quarter effective tax rate was 23.6%. However, we continue to expect the full year effective tax rate between 20% and 22%.","Shifting to asset quality. Broad-based asset quality improvement continue during the quarter. Non-performing, criticized and troubled debt restructured loans, as well as total delinquencies all declined.","Marking the lowest level in over a decade, non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased $49 million or 8% and now represent 0.75% of loans outstanding. We also reported a 9% and 13% decline in business services criticized and total troubled debt restructured loans, respectively, and a 4% decline in total delinquencies.","Adjusted net charge-offs totaled $79 million or 40 basis points of average loans, a 9 basis point increase over the prior quarter. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily attributable to larger recoveries in the prior quarter.","As it relates to the allowance for loan losses, a $30 million reduction of hurricane specific allowance and a $21 million reduction associated with the TDR sale, combined with payoffs and paydowns of adversely rated loans, resulted in a credit provision of $10 million.","The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased 12 basis points to 1.05% of total loans outstanding. The resulting allowance for loan and lease losses as a percent of total non-accrual loans decreased 4 basis points to 140%.","For the full year of 2018, we expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 50 basis points, and based on recent performance and current market conditions, we would expect to be at lower end of that range. However, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to large dollar commercial credits.","So let's move on to capital and liquidity. During the first quarter, we repurchased $235 million or 12.5 million shares of common stock and declared $101 million in dividends to common shareholders.","As Grayson mentioned, following quarter end, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our insurance subsidiary. Subject to regulatory approval, this transaction is expected to generate additional capital of approximately $300 million at closing, which is expected to be in the third quarter.","The capital generated is expected to be used to repurchase shares of common stock, subject to review and non-objection by the Federal Reserve, as part of the 2018 CCAR process.","Our first quarter capital ratios remained robust. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 capital ratio was estimated at 11.9%, and the fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.0%.","Finally, our liquidity position remains solid with a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 82%, and we were fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule as of quarter end.","Regarding 2018 expectations. With exception of an increase in adjusted net interest income growth, our expectations remain unchanged and are summarized again on this slide for your reference.","So in conclusion, our first quarter results provide a solid start to the year, and we believe our Simplify and Grow strategic initiative, along with other opportunities and competitive advantages position us well for 2018 and beyond.","With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I will now turn it back over to Dana.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, David. [Operator Instructions] We will now open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Pancari of Evercore.","John Pancari","Good morning. On the McKinsey study, just wanted to see if you can update us with your - any expectations you've developed out of that in terms of a targeted efficiency. And how much of that - of any target that comes out of that, would you expect would be revenue versus expenses? Thanks.","David Turner","Yes, John. This is David. So we've - we had elements of McKinsey built into the guidance that we've given you for 2018. We're still working through - we just kind of got the first part of this done in the first quarter. There's a lot more to do. And we're going to update you on kind of a three year, this is going to be a longer journey. This is not a 2018 only.","We'll have elements of this working through a couple of years, 2 to 3 years, actually. We're going to update all that at our Investor Day, which will happen in February of '19.","With that being said, there's elements of McKinsey of how we keep our expense number relatively flat this year, and there's elements of McKinsey on how we get the growth in revenue of 3% to 6% on NIR for 2018 as well.","As we think about the total commitment on revenue, it's about 70% of it is expense and about 30% of it is on the revenue side. That's our best guess, thus far. We will refine those as we go through the remainder of our Simplify and Grow initiative.","Grayson Hall","Efficiency ratio.","David Turner","From an efficiency ratio standpoint, we've given your guidance. It will be below 60%. As you know, we had - when the tax rate change that cost all of us, all of our peers, for the tax adjustment for us it's about 50 basis points going the other way. We did not change our guidance because we had Simplify and Grow, and we also had our insurance transaction in mind at the time.","So we think we're confident we'll have an efficiency ratio below 60% in '18. And that being said, we think, over time we're going to need to be in that mid-50s, and we're working towards that.","John Pancari","Got it. That's helpful. And then separately, on the capital side. You mentioned the insurance sale. And along those lines, can you just talk to us about how you're thinking about the business mix? If there's other areas of the business that you think you would possibly exit.","And then conversely, how are you thinking about additions to the business in terms of whole bank M&A, and maybe a thought on the environment? Thanks.","Grayson Hall","John, first of all, the Regions Insurance has been a part of our business for a while. It's a very - we made a very analytical, thoughtful evaluation to that. It was a valuable asset for us, a very talented team in the Regions Insurance Group.","But we had reached a point in our analysis where we had to make a decision on how best to deploy our capital and should we try to increase the scale of our participation in that segment, or where there - was there a more valuable asset for someone else.","And as you see, we came through what was a complex but thoughtful decision. It took what was a viable asset to us, and we think we made a good decision for ourselves, for our customers and for our team members that are in that business.","When we look at opportunities to grow, as we've said in the past, we're primarily focused on organic growth, trying to determine how to do that. We, on a very ongoing disciplined basis, look at how we're allocating our capital by product, by business, by geography. And we look for opportunities to acquire where it will help accelerate growth.","We've been fairly active in non-bank acquisitions. We continue to review those opportunities. We've been very studious on bank acquisitions but continue to look at the markets and how we trade versus banks that we might be interested in and still economically challenging.","So while we're looking at it, we're studying it. We understand where the markets are at. We just think the opportunity for bank M&A for us is fairly limited at the moment. And so we're trying to prioritize how we grow. And again, I think organic is the first way we grow, and non-bank acquisition is the second way we grow at this moment.","John Pancari","Got it. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey. Good morning, guys. Maybe I'll ask John's question a little different way. Was there a full business review done in making the decision to selling the insurance business. I know you're currently looking at other businesses to potentially sell that. You're either subscale or you're not achieving your desired returns?","Grayson Hall","I mean, Ryan, absolutely. I mean, we take a full business review of all of our businesses on a fairly frequent basis. But we - David has probably mentioned hundreds of times in terms of optimizing our allocation of capital, and we really spend a lot of time not only in our finance team, but also in our business leadership teams, determining exactly what a reasonable rate of return is for those businesses.","We set different hurdles for them. As you might imagine, we debate them back and forth because those profit pools expand and contract depending on where you're at in the cycle.","And so we look at - we try to look at these businesses on a long-term sustainable basis, not just a particular point in time. As you might imagine, our decision to divest Regions Insurance was a difficult decision because we've been in that business for a long time, and then like I said, a great team of people running it.","But when we look at the risk-adjusted returns in that business and what we had to do to improve those, we came to the conclusion, given where those assets are trading today, that the best decision for us was to divest that business. We look at all our businesses that way.","And not that we intend to share our debates, but you can rest assure that there's a rigorous debate going on all the time regarding businesses that we're in. David, you want to add to that?","David Turner","Yes. I would say that there are a lot of factors that we look at, as Grayson mentioned, in evaluating a business. We look at how synergistic businesses are or not. In this particular case, Insurance, we had more of a retail platform than BB&T did. BB&T has a wholesale platform that they can marry up with retail. They had more scale in the business than we did.","And for us, to get to scale, we thought we needed to have to become more efficient at it. As you can see now, the efficiency ratio is pretty high for us in the business. And to get the scale and the efficiency ratio, then it was going to require a disproportionate amount of capital investment that we felt we can use elsewhere.","And it's a good thing -- it's a good business, good people. As a matter of fact, we use them as well, and we think that BB&T can do more than we can, and we have -- we'll put our capital to use in a more appropriate fashion.","Grayson Hall","And we do think it is a good transaction for us and likewise think it was a good transaction for BB&T.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Thanks for all the color. And I guess, David, you noted in the slides that consumer betas are near zero, commercial is running just below 40. Can you maybe just give us a sense what's baked into your 4% to 6% NII growth for the rest of the year? And have you had to make any changes on the consumer side with the most recent hikes? Thanks for taking my question.","David Turner","Yes. So you're right. That consumer beta has been low to nonexistent. We do think we'll get pressure over time. We aren't seeing it on the consumer side yet, but we expect that to happen. And we have a beta still baked in that 35% range, going up to 60% over time.","The commercial side, a lot of that's indexed to the funds rate or other rates in Wealth Management. And we've been fairly conservative with our betas. They've proven out better than we thought. We're at 13% cumulative beta, and we think for the next -- maybe the next one or two moves, maybe we keep it low.","But over time, it's going to catch up to where we think it's going to be in that 40% to 60% range. As you think about Q2, we really don't put a beta forecast -- we haven't given you that, but we expect that to be fairly similar to what we just saw this past quarter.","Ryan Nash","Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to get a little bit of clarity in terms of timing of announcement regarding some of the conclusions from Simplify and Grow.","I think the market had been expecting some - an update, a more formal update in the summer. I'm wondering if there still will be a formal update in the summer in addition to during your February '19 Investor Day, or should we wait until the '19 Investor Day to get a more robust update?","David Turner","Yes, Erika, we - what we want to do is make sure we have a very solid footing on our Simplify and Grow, the effects of that on our business before we go to the market with it. I think what we've leaned over time since our Investor Day is credibility. We're doing what we said we're going to do.","We want to make sure we're ready and have the right commitment. We do know that will happen by Investor Day, so you'll have a lot of clarity at the Investor Day. And to the extent that we get further down the road, we'll give you an update as we determine that. I think we will have probably something incremental.","Each quarter, we'll give you something incremental, but the full-fledged, here's what it's going to mean for really '19 and '20 and beyond is at Investor Day. It is -- as you can imagine, putting things in motion today, you're really -- it takes time to receive -- to garner the benefit of those changes, and so we don't see a ton of change on our business in all of '18.","You'll see elements of that trickling in the back half of '18, and we'll give you that guidance as it becomes known, and perhaps, we'll give you some incremental in the second quarter.","Grayson Hall","But Erika, I would say you're going to hear from us every quarter on things that we're doing that we more broadly place under that umbrella. You clearly heard this quarter on our sale of the troubled debt restructured loans, that broadly falls under the Simplify and Grow umbrella.","We also had the Regions Insurance sale. We also, in the prepared remarks, gave you how much our headcount was down quarter-over-quarter, as well as how much it was down year-over-year. You've seen a number of public press releases on our reorganization efforts in terms of how we line up to go to market.","And so you're going to hear this every quarter. And this quarter was probably one of the more informative quarters we've had in a while. And you'll see that continue throughout the year.","To David's point, we'll continue to give those every quarter, but then you'll see us embed those in our 3 year forecast at Investor Day next February. But it's not like you got to wait for February to hear some of this. But clearly, some of these things we're doing, we can't preannounce prior to actually executing the transactions.","Erika Najarian","Got it. So my follow-up then is - the better way to think about it is simplify and Grow is part of your business-as-usual-way- of conducting your day to day. And so as we think about '18 and '19, even though, in the formal announcement, it's not until February, you're still simplifying and -- taking those initiatives that your shareholders can reap benefits in '18 and '19?","Grayson Hall","Absolutely. And I wouldn't say -- I wouldn't cast February as a formal announcement of Simplify and Grow. February is a formal announcement of our next 3-year plan, and our Simplify and Grow activity will be embedded in that plan.","Erika Najarian","Understood. Very clear. Thank you.","Grayson Hall","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Grayson Hall","Morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Morning. Couple of questions. One is on the 2018 expectations. You indicated a fee growth target. And obviously, you have sold the insurance business. I just wanted to make sure I understood that there's other areas that are going to be picking up and making up for the insurance business sale. Is that accurate?","David Turner","Well - so we put Regions Insurance Group in discontinued operations, and we've restated everything. So you've got to go back to the restated baseline as well. So we're talking about 3% to 6% off of that. We're not going to do 3% to 6% off of overcoming the gross revenue of insurance.","Betsy Graseck","Right. And so what you're suggesting is that the fee growth rate really was not being impacted by the insurance business?","David Turner","That's right. We had 3% -- that's right. We've had 3% to 6% regardless.","Betsy Graseck","Great, okay. And then just on some of the investments. You mentioned the de novo branches. Maybe you could give us a sense of size, scale, scope, market, timing?","Grayson Hall","I'll ask John Owen to respond to that.","John Owen","Good morning. This is John Owen. We were going to roll out probably 20 branches of this year. They'd be concentrated, really, in three markets. St. Louis will be the majority, where eight or nine of our branches will open in St. Louis in the, really, second, third quarter time period. Atlanta would be another market where we're going to open branches on this quarter. And the last would be Houston.","So those would be the key markets you'll see the roughly 20 branches open this year. There'll be a few infill markets in Memphis and Knoxville, and Charlotte and Williamsville as well.","The other thing on a branching standpoint that were mentioned, consolidation, we've got roughly 30 to 40 consolidations teed up as well. So you'll our net branch count will be down a little bit, but you'll see us continue to invest in key markets.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then the trajectory of investment and expense saves, obviously, fits into the efficiency ratio expectations you've got. Do you feel like this type of pace is something to continue into 2019, '20 -- over the next couple of years? Or do you feel like your branch network will be where you want it to be by the end of this year?","John Owen","I would tell you, over the next two to three years, you'll see us continue to build roughly 20 to 30 branches a year in select markets. We also have opportunities where we can to continue to consolidate. The opportunities on consolidation are getting a little bit harder, if you will.","We've consolidated, in the last two years, about 10% of our network over the last two years. And there's opportunity, and a lot of that opportunity is what I'll call two for ones or thee for ones, where we're taking a branch and expanding a branch to absorb two or thee of the branches that are nearby. So you'll see us balance out building and consolidating.","Grayson Hall","But Betsy, it's - our branch rationalization process is part of how we manage channels, in general, whether it's our digital channel, our contact centers, our ATMs, our branches. And it's a fairly dynamic review, and it's been one we've had in place for quite some time.","And to John's point, we'll continue to make annual adjustments to that as we see markets change and we see customer behavior change. And so it's a very analytical process. And so we make forecast out three years on that, but we review them constantly. So if we need to make in-flight adjustments, we can do that.","John Owen","The only thing I would add is the fact that the reason we've been able to consolidate as many branch as we have is our investments in our online and mobile space. We've had a lot of self-service transactions going online and mobile, and that's allowed, really, us to consolidate and not impact our growth.","Betsy Graseck","And just one last one, on video ATMs. When we were down there recently, it was interesting to see how much functionality that has. And I was wondering, is that strategy of video ATMs a kind of fill-in of existing footprint? Or is that more an opportunity to expand footprint?","John Owen","Yes, we've got roughly 90 video ATMs deployed. It really is -- we're finding out we're testing it a couple of different way. One, inside our branches, we're using the vestibules to extend banking hours. And to your point, customers can do most of their banking transactions on that video teller.","They have an opportunity to talk to experienced banker that can help them with those transactions, and we've seen good adoption in our branches and the vestibules. We've also tried it in a few drive-thru ATMs.","I would tell you, those are not quite as high usage because we don't have the ability to assist that customer and walk them through the process as well. So where we're seeing good adoption is in branch.","Grayson Hall","Yes, and, I think that if you look at our ATM network, we've continued to invest in that channel, and we've imaged-enabled all of our traditional ATMs. And we're seeing customer transactional behavior improve at what we would call a somewhat traditional ATM.","We've been encouraged by the video tellers. But it also has been a learning process. We found some places it worked great and some places not so great. We think it's an interesting technology.","We think that there is a place for it in our channel portfolio. But I would tell you, we're still in the early stages of that, even with 90 units in our portfolio. 90 units, even that regard, that is fairly small investment, but it's allowing us to learn how we might deploy it on a larger basis.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Grayson Hall","Hey. Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning. Hey, good morning, Grayson. Good morning, David. First question, just on the capital markets frontier within fees. It's not a good quarter, down a little bit, but expected. You talked about that being a big contributor to fee growth this year.","Can you talk about just pipelines, where it's coming from and how much more you might have to still hire to build -- bulk that business up? Thanks.","John Turner","This is John Turner. We expect it to be a nice contributor to revenue growth, non-interest revenue growth through the balance of the year. I think what you're seeing is the maturation of the various product offerings that we have put together and the capabilities that we've developed.","For the quarter, the growth in revenue over - year-over-year growth in revenue was broad-based across a number of different product categories, whether it was long-term real estate financing products, it was M&A, it was loan syndications, all improved year-over-year, and again, I think really reflect the maturation of the capabilities and our team's having better conversations with our customers about how we can meet their specific needs.","In terms of investments, we're continuing to recruit and will continue to recruit. We see some capabilities that we still probably would aspire to have or to continue to build out. And so we expect capital markets to continue to grow nicely in 2018 on into 2019. Pipelines are pretty good for the second quarter and into part of the third at this point.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Okay. And then my last - my second question, just on all things credit continue to look excellent, all measures and you had another big quarter of reserve release, some - I know you're saying bottom end of the charge-ups this year, but is it also fair to say that there's still an amount of release that we could still see even from here? Thanks, guys.","David Turner","Yes, Ken. So we don't forecast what the reserve percentage is going to be. We're at 105%. We still have nonperforming assets. While they're down 75 basis points, we think there's room to continue to improve. We're encouraged by that. The strength of the commercial customer, the strength of the consumer is there.","There are elements of consumer that ticked up just a little bit. Card would be one. But we see the consumer being very stable. We just don't think that the consumer credit metrics improved as much as we believe the commercial credit metrics can continue to come down, which manifest themselves in past -- I mean, nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets.","So there's always a possibility for a reserve release, it depends on what happens with the criticized and classifieds and we'll let the model run and speak for itself.","Grayson Hall","Well, I do think you saw this quarter the very encouraging improvement in our credit metrics. A big part of that was payoffs and paydowns on some adversely rated credits that quite frankly we did not anticipate.","Those are very difficult to forecast, but it's also encouraging that those customers can find alternative forms of financing today. And so we do anticipate that there's an opportunity for that trend to continue through the rest of the year.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Thanks, again.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Spahr of Wells Fargo.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Spahr","Hi, good morning. My question is just a follow-up on the Simplify and Grow strategy and the role of technology. And the March reorg that you had, where you're putting technology under John Owen, the philosophy behind that? And also a lot of the tech spend seems to be self-funding. Do you think that's going to continue through 2018 -- I mean, sorry, 2019. Thank you.","Grayson Hall","Yes, I mean, if you look back historically, we've had a very consistent investment strategy into technology. We've not varied that a lot year-to-year. I think we've been pretty disciplined in that regard. And we're quite proud of the technology platform we've built. My background for the bulk of my career was in technology.","John Owen has a similar background as well, and John has worked hard to strengthen and align the strategy, in particular, around our consumer customers with all the attention to digital channels that we have.","As you know, Scott Peters runs our Consumer Banking Group, and he and John work together. We have an approach, from a technology perspective, of not being the leader, but being an aggressive follower of proven technology. And that strategy has worked well for us.","We have done a number of upgrades in technology over the past few quarters, substantial upgrade on human resources work -- technology; wealth management, complete upgrade of that infrastructure.","And so -- and in addition, treasury management. So we continue to make improvements. We get a lot of internal, external benchmarks that would indicate that that's working. So John, elaborate, if you would.","John Owen","Just a couple of points to reiterate. From a technology standpoint, we've been consistent even through the financial crisis with - and really significant investments in technology. If I think about consumer for a minute, we're very fortunate to operate on one consumer platform across all of our 1,470 branches.","That gives us an advantage over competitors that have multiple platforms that they have to maintain and change over time. We also offer really good digital capabilities, invested heavily on our digital space in both online and mobile banking. Our customers give us good feedback.","We have J.D. Power. They really survey our customers every quarter and give feedback on where we can make changes and where we can improve. And we come in every quarter in the top quartile in terms of our channel capabilities. From an ATM and video teller standpoint, rolled-out deposits, smart ATMs across our entire footprint, about 90 video tellers, we mentioned earlier, were testing.","So a lot of investment both in the digital space and ATM space and branch channel. I'll move on to the wealth business. As Grayson mentioned, we converted about 14 platforms on our SEI platform, which really is a state-of-the-art platform, great customer experience, great associate experience, also gives us a better price point, if you will, going forward.","From a commercial standpoint, our team has done really good job of inputting new iTreasury platform, which gives us a much better user interface, better reporting, better analytics in the iTreasury space. And they're working very hard with nCino to roll out new small business and commercial platforms.","So a lot of good things happening. I'll tell you, it's one of those areas where you'll never be done. We're going to continually have to invest in the digital space and really balance out where we make our investments and where we place our bets. But I feel good about the platform we have in place.","Christopher Spahr","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Moss of B. Riley FDR.","Steve Moss","Good morning. I just want to flesh out the margin expectations for the second quarter here a bit more. In particular, obviously, you should benefit from the rate hike. But it looks like your borrowings came down at period-end and probably have a little bit more margin expansion than what I would just expect from a straight rate hike.","David Turner","Well, so we have a day count change going into the second quarter. So don't forget that's two points going the other way, and we were up four points this quarter as a result of day account.","When you consider that and you consider the full quarter benefit of the rate hike and where we are, that - we would expect stable to up modestly in terms of margin, overcoming that two point decline for day count.","And we feel much better about our NII growth for the year, which is why we changed our outlook for the entire year to that -- to the 4% to 6% range.","So we think we're well positioned to take advantage of not only this past rate increase but what might be coming in the future, which we have one full rate increase baked into our expectations for the remainder of the year.","Steve Moss","Okay. And then with regard to the capital deployment and targeted CET1. I know you're still pretty high here. Obviously, you did an aggressive asset last year. How close do you think you can approach your 9.5% CET1 target by June 2019?","David Turner","June '19, we would get pretty close by then. We really have been talk about trying to get to 9.5% by the end of this year. We've messaged we can't quite get there, but we'll get awful close, I think, by the middle of the next year based on what we know today, that we'd be right on top of that. Now things can change. Risk profiles can change, the world can change, that's a long time. But based on our forecast right now, we'll be right on top of it a year from now.","Steve Moss","Okay. And do you expect the -- okay, and then by the -- do you expect the proposed NPR -- with the proposed NPR, you could lower your capital target further?","David Turner","Well, the way we think about it, forget regulatory supervision and that. We set our capital base on how much capital we think we need to run our business appropriately based on the risk profile that we have. It's not about running our capital down as low as we possibly could get it. It's the optimization. It's the right amount for that.","And so as risk profiles change up and down, those capital targets will change up and down. What happens in the NPR, if it makes it a little easier for us to manage it, based on our own capital planning process versus waiting for a non-objection once a year.","We do see it as favorable and not having risk-weighted assets and increasing. We see at this favorable that you don't have to consider share repurchases in an adverse scenario. So I think it would be incrementally helpful. I don't know that, that changes how we think about what our target needs to be though.","Steve Moss","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe staying with the capital points. In the past, you've talked about preferred issuance as a possibility. I mean, does that kind of go away now? Or is that something that you still might need to do as you bring the CET1 down to the 9.5%?","David Turner","Yes, Geoffrey. We've always believed that we need - again, optimization is -- optimization in terms of total capital and the capital stack that is common and preferred. And we've espoused having preferred, that's about 1.5 points more than our Common Equity Tier 1.","We've been satisfying that preferred component of the stack with common. And that's awful expensive for us. So we see, over time, that we will trade out some common for preferred, and you ought to expect that to happen sometime in 2019 as we get our Common Equity Tier 1 down closer to that 9.5% level, but I have to backfill our Tier 1 with the preferred issuance.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Grayson Hall","Morning, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","Hello. I'm not sure you guys commented on it in some of the early remarks. But just on the securities book, the size of the securities book going forward, how should we think about that going from here?","It came down a little bit versus the fourth quarter levels. And obviously, also a function of both loans and deposit growth, but how do you think about the levels there going forward?","David Turner","Yes, Matt. It's David. I think if you look at the percentage of earning assets and earning securities, I think that's going to be relatively stable. I do think if things change with specific designation and things were LCR are as important, you could see the makeup of certain securities changing out.","For instance, we're using Ginnie Mae [ph] securities to help us on our high-quality liquid assets. And perhaps, we could put those to work a little more effectively for us in time.","So I think that we would - we're going to continue to evaluate that and make sure we have an appropriate amount of liquidity, that we have the proper duration in the book. And as we continue to grow earning assets, we'll have some portion of that in securities.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And what's the yield pickup if there was some flexibility on the liquidity rules that you would get on a securities book overall?","David Turner","Yes, I don't think that's -- I don't think, Matt, that's fairly meaningful right now. It's not that much. I do think we have more ability to continue to pick up yield, if you will, on just the front book rolling off and the back book coming on in terms of investments, given the rate environment right now.","So we have about $3 billion that'll roll out, that'll help us pick up about 70 - roughly 70 basis points of yield.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, Grayson. How are you?","Grayson Hall","Doing great.","Gerard Cassidy","Good. Couple of questions for you. You obviously have very strong credit quality like many of your peers. And it was interesting to see that the criticized loans have steadily declined now for over 12 months quite materially. And can you share with us, was that energy related where you had to put some on two years ago and now they have finally come off?","Or did - and the second part of that, too, did the change in the tax laws in any of your nonperforming loans or criticized loans? Did the company just get a benefit because of lower taxes and, therefore, they may have come off the criticized list?","Grayson Hall","Yes, I think I'll ask John Turner to speak in a little more detail. But clearly, we had a material exposure to the energy sector, and it's taken some time to work through that exposure as well as we had some weather-related exposure because of some hurricanes that came through Texas and through Florida.","And so as time has elapsed and the economy has stayed fairly steady, and quite frankly, as liquidity has been so available that you've seen an awful lot of the composition of our loan portfolio shift and change, and as you pointed out, has improved dramatically. But I'll ask John to speak with a little more color in that regard.","John Turner","So I would say, clearly, we benefited from some improvement in the energy sector. But I would suggest the improvement is really the result of the focus that we've had on derisking certain asset classes, certain portfolios, over the last 2-plus years and improving the overall quality of our portfolio. And as we've done that, what we've seen is a significant shift in the quality.","At the same time, we've had the opportunity to either see companies exit the bank or, over time, we're a payer because of the work that we've been doing with them. And naturally, I think what's had the greatest impact on asset quality is our focus across the bank on derisking and managing the overall credit quality of our portfolio origination.","Credit quality is much better over the last couple of years as well, and so I think that's what you're seeing. With respect to the question about taxes, it's too early, I think, to have seen any benefit, for companies to have seen any benefit that would impact credit quality.","We certainly would expect that some would experience improved cash flows, and that will help us likewise in the energy business. We still have some portion of that portfolio that's adversely rated as prices continue to firm up. And we see cash flows improve there as well. I think you can expect some additional improvement resulting from the energy portfolio improving over time.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. And then as a follow-up, changing tack here. You guys gave us some good color on the investments you're making in technology, particularly on the consumer side of the business. And there's been a lot of talk about all of the biggest banks spending billions of dollars on technology and how are the regional banks going to compete.","The question is, do you look at your technology and the innovations you're making as a competitive advantage? Or is it really just the ticket to get into the ballpark, and to play on the field you got to execute?","And if you don't have the technology, you're not going to even get into the ballpark, rather than that, again, being your competitive advantage. How do you guys look at it?","Grayson Hall","Well, it's a great question, and I think one that there's a number of different narratives in the marketplace that are driving fairly substantial technology investments across the industry. I do think that the industry broadly benefits from the investments being made in bank technology.","As we said earlier in the meeting, our strategy is not to be necessarily leading -- on the leading edge of a lot of these technologies, but to be an aggressive follower of proven technologies. We believe that customers enjoy using all of our channels.","And we see activity across multiple channels by the same customer on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. And we try to work hard on trying to make that a very friendly, consistent experience when a customer comes into one of our branches or comes through a digital channel or an ATM channel.","We want to see the same information and be able to do -- have the same capabilities across those channels. We think it's making a big difference in our business, but all of our channels are still relevant.","I do think you're seeing this narrative about the dollars being spent on technology and that providing some level of competitive advantage. Whether that advantage is sustainable over time really comes back to execution.","And we think we're doing a particularly good job of that. We're growing accounts. We're going households. We're growing balances. We really tried to rationalize the composition of our deposit balance sheet, and we've made some tremendous strides in that regard.","I'm really proud of where we're at on deposits today. Very loyal, very granular, have a high customer satisfaction rate. And technology is a big part of that. But it's not all of it. John, I wouldn't add to that if you would.","John Owen","The only thing I would add, a couple of comments to Grayson. I'll go back to what I said earlier in the digital and mobile space. We won't spend more than some banks in that space, but we look at it through a different lens. And the lens I would look at it from is, what are our customers telling us about what our channel offers today?","And I'll go back to J.D. Powers. Again, J.D. Powers assesses our branch network, ATM network, mobile and online and our call center as well. And when we look at it from a customer standpoint, we're consistently ranked in the top quartile. I think that's, to me, a more important metric than how many dollars you spend on it.","So when we stack up in top quartile, and our branch network, our online actually came in number 2 out of top 23 banks last quarter, I think that's the land that we'll spend more time looking on.","As far as innovations and things like that, a couple of things I'd point to, I think our remote deposit capture. We were not the first bank to launch remote deposit capture. But what our consumer team did, I thought was very innovative, which is they came out with a remote deposit capture several years ago that offers the customer choice.","And that choice is around when do they get credit for that deposit. Is it immediate, and I can pay for that and get immediate credit, which is great for small businesses that are working free cash flow? Or they can do standard, which is a pre-deposit. So things like that. We're not going to be first but, we can improve on what we're doing there.","The only other thing I would point out would be AI. There's a lot of discussion and talk about AI in the market. We've been working with it now for over a year. In our contact center, we're using AI for our agents to be able to really chat with IBM Watson and answer customers' questions quicker in a more accurate way. And there are things like that, that we're doing that are just happening behind the scenes, but we are innovating.","Grayson Hall","Thank you, John.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. If I could squeeze one more in, Grayson, because of your background. When you look at technology, we started back with the mainframes, then we went to minicomputers, then micros, then the Internet, now digital AI. Can you share with us from your experience, how revolution -- is the one we're going right now the biggest of them all or no, you remember 25 years ago, it was even bigger?","Grayson Hall","It all depends on how you measure it. We - obviously, this industry spent an awful lot on technology over the last two or three decades and really has sort of transformed how we serve customers and how we comply with regulation and compliance and how we analyze risks and how we extend credit. It's just transformed every part of our business.","And I would say that, for the most part, it's gotten better, faster, cheaper every year. Probably the largest transformation that has occurred has been the mobile phone. That mobile device, that mobile smartphone is just, really, has been the largest game-changer I saw in my career being involved in technology.","Because early on, computing was too heavy to carry on a mobile phone and was relatively slow and extremely expensive. And we've seen that really come down over the years.","And so the cost of storing data, the cost of computing data has really improved. It's made it available to most of our population. And so it's changed the way we serve customers.","The question is, is how much value, how much sustainable value do you achieve as a bank by investing in technology. I do believe you have to continue to invest. But as we've seen, computing becomes less expensive over time. And so you have to keep innovating, keep investing to, I think, to stay competitive and serve your customers the right way.","But I still believe the basics haven't changed because the people who win are real smart about what technologies they pick, and they're really good at implementing and executing that strategy.","And so I think the execution is a much bigger question than how many dollars you spent last year. Dollars matter, but execution determines who sustains the competitive advantage.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. I really appreciate that color. Thank you.","Grayson Hall","Thank you. Operator, is there any further questions?","Operator","No, there are no other questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to you, Mr. Hall, for any closing remarks.","Grayson Hall","Well, again, thank you for your time and your interest in Regions. We do hope that today's discussion was helpful to everyone, and we look forward to next quarter. So thank you. We stand adjourned.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"18113":["Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call April 15, 2016 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Dana Nolan - IR","Grayson Hall - CEO","David Turner - CFO","John Turner - Head of Corporate Banking","Barb Godin - Chief Credit Officer","Analysts","Michael Rose - Raymond James","Bill Carcache - Nomura","Tim Hayes - FBR and Company","Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners","David Eads - UBS","Stephen Scouten - Sandler O'Neill","John Pancari - Evercore IS","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Peter Winter - Sterne Agee","Jason Harbes - Wells Fargo","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna","Jesus Bueno - Compass Point","Jill Shea - Credit Suisse","Operator","Good morning and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Paula and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] ","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Dana Nolan to begin.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, Paula. Good morning and welcome to Regions first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Participating on the call are Grayson Hall, Chief Executive Officer and David Turner, Chief Financial Officer. Other members of management, including John Turner, our Head of Corporate Banking and Barb Godin, Chief Credit Officer are also present and available to answer questions. Throughout the call, we will be referencing a slide presentation. A copy of this presentation as well as our earnings release and earnings supplement are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","Also let me remind you that during today\u2019s call, we may make forward-looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance and you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary from expectations. These factors are described in the cautionary disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements in our earnings release and in other reports we file with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Grayson.","Grayson Hall","Thank you, Dana and good morning and thank you everyone for joining our call today. First quarter\u2019s results reflect a strong start to 2016 and demonstrate that we are successfully executing on our strategic plan. We are pleased by our continued progress, despite a challenging and somewhat volatile economic backdrop. For the first quarter, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $257 million, and earnings per share totaled $0.20. These results reflect growth in total revenue, lower adjusted expenses and positive operating leverage.","Importantly, we continue to deliver results in areas we believe are fundamental to future income growth by expanding our customer base as we grew checking accounts, households, credit cards and wealth accounts. A key driver to this success is our ability to leverage our approach to relationship banking. We are pleased that once again, we\u2019ve received external recognition for building a strong customer experience at Regions. This quarter, both the Temkin Group and the Greenwich Associates recognized Regions for providing industry leading customer experiences.","Looking at our results further, we achieved total average loan growth of 5% compared to prior year. Consumer lending is off to a solid start as loan balances exceed $30 billion. We have introduced new initiatives to expand our consumer product offerings, which led to year-over-year growth in consumer lending of 5%. Our new point of sale initiative within indirect lending led this growth with more loans that doubled over the prior year, exceeding our internal expectations. We do expect continued growth in this product category in 2016.","Indirect auto lending continues to grow as balances increased over 9% compared to last year. Credit card balances increased modestly as we remain focused on expanding a number of customers that carry and utilize Regions\u2019 credit card and we have experienced success on this front as our penetration rate of deposit customers has increased 140 basis points from one year ago and now stands at 17.5%. We\u2019re also focused on expanding our direct consumer lending capabilities as we recently announced and agreed with Avant. This arrangement allows us to offer additional alternatives to create stronger digital experiences for our customers and prospects.","We\u2019ve also had an encouraging quarter in business lending, with total average loans up 4% over the prior year. All of our business lending areas, corporate banking, commercial banking and real estate banking achieved growth over the prior year. Total adjusted revenue increased 7% over the first quarter of 2015, reflecting effective execution on our strategic plans to grow and diversify our revenue. Investments within capital markets are clearly demonstrating progress as capital markets income more than doubled versus fourth quarter of \u201815. Importantly, our efficiency initiatives are allowing us to sub-fund these investments as adjusted expenses declined 2% from the previous quarter. We ended the quarter with an adjusted efficiency ratio of 60.6%, an improvement of 280 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. With respect to the current environment, we continue to expect the US economy to demonstrate progress but at a measured pace. The global and macroeconomic environment remains a concern but we do expect modest improvement. Low oil prices continue to create challenges for certain industry sectors while benefiting others. Consequently, we continue to closely monitor our direct energy portfolio as well as portfolios subject to contingent.","As expected there continues to be downward migration in risk rates, we are supporting and working closely with our customers as they take appropriate and constructive actions to lower costs, reduce debt and improve liquidity. We do anticipate continued stress in the sector and will make appropriate adjustments. Additionally, we have established appropriate energy reserves which now stand at 8% of our direct energy exposure. But more broadly excluding energy in related industries, we do see continued favorable credit quality in the wholesale and consumer portfolios. Turning to capital deployment, as you are aware, we submitted our capital plan earlier this month, we continue to pull over capital effectively through organic growth and investing strategically in initiatives to increase revenue or reduce expenses. But we also will return an appropriate amount of capital to shareholders. In closing, our solid first-quarter results provide evidence that we are successfully executing our strategic plan with a continued commitment on our three primary strategic initiatives which are grow and diversify our revenue streams, practice disciplined express management, and effectively deploy our capital. These are all integral to the successful execution of our strategic plan and we are on track to deliver our long-term performance targets.","With that I\u2019ll turn it to Dave who will cover the details for the first quarter.","David Turner","Thank you and good morning everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and a recap of loan growth. Average loan balances totaled $82 billion in the first quarter, up $750 million or 1% from the previous quarter. Business lending average balances increased to $51 billion, up 1% from the previous quarter and 4% over the prior year. Commercial loans grew $373 million or 1% was driven by corporate banking and real estate banking. Specialized lending also contributed to loan growth driven by new relationships in technology and defense, restaurant as well as an increase in line utilization in energy and natural resources. Commitments were flat linked quarter and line utilization increased 110 basis points to 47.8%, primarily driven by energy lending which increased from 53% to 56%. Total production declined 26% from the prior quarter and we are beginning to experience softer pipelines in some areas due to less optimistic and uncertain macroeconomic conditions. However, consumer lending had another strong quarter as almost every category experienced growth and total production increased 3%.","Average consumer loan balances were $31 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior quarter and 5% over the prior year. And direct auto lending increased 2% and production increased 4% during the quarter. Other indirect lending which includes point-of-sale initiatives increased $76 million linked quarter or 15% as production increased 120%. Now looking at the credit card portfolio, average balances increased 2% from the previous quarter and our penetration into our existing customer base currently stands at 17.5%. Mortgage loan balances increased $75 million and total home-equity balances were relatively flat, up $8 million from the previous quarter. Let's take a look at deposits. Average deposit balances increased $262 million from the previous quarter and increased $2 billion over the prior year. Deposit costs remained at historically low levels at 11 basis points and total funding costs remained low at 28 basis points.","With respect to deposits, we are primarily core deposit funded with 67% of our deposits coming from consumer and wealth deposits. Low cost deposits make up 92% of our total deposits and approximately half of our deposits come from cities with less than 1 million people. Additionally, 50% of our deposits are from customers with $250,000 or less in their account. This is why we continue to believe our deposit betas will be a competitive advantage for us as rates rise. ","So let's see how it has impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $883 million, up 3% from the fourth quarter. However, excluding the impact of the fourth quarter lease adjustment, net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $12 million or 1% for the quarter and increased $51 million or approximately 6% compared to the prior year.","Higher loan balances and increases in short term rates along with items that are unlikely to repeat including lower premium amortization and higher dividend income related to trading assets were the primary drivers behind the linked quarter increase. This increase was partially offset by lower dividends recognized on Federal Reserve stock, higher debt interest expense and one less day in the quarter.","The resulting net interest margin for the quarter was 3.19%. Excluding the impact from the fourth quarter lease adjustment, the net interest margin increased by approximately 6 basis points. The 5 basis points of this increase was attributable to the impact of day count during the quarter and the previously mentioned items that are unlikely to repeat.","Total non-interest income increased 1% on an adjusted basis from the fourth quarter driven by growth in our revenue diversification initiatives as we successfully executed our strategies. In particular, capital markets income was strong on a linked quarter basis, up 46%. This was driven by contributions from the recently expanded mergers and acquisition advisory services group. ","Additionally, revenue was bolstered by fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers as well as syndicated loan transactions. And due to the nature of the business, and the fact that we are building out our capabilities, capital markets income will likely experience some movement from quarter to quarter. However, we are very pleased with the impact our added capabilities are producing.","Wealth management also experienced a strong quarter despite a challenging market environment. Income was up 6% quarter-over-quarter due to higher seasonal insurance income and impact from recent acquisitions. Investment services income was up 7% attributable to an increase in annuity sales. However, investment management and trust fees were negatively impacted by market conditions.","Seasonality and posting order changes that went into effect in early November last year impacted service charges which declined 4% from the fourth quarter. Now, looking ahead, we expect modest growth in service charges as we benefit from last year's 2% checking account growth and continued account growth in 2016.","In addition, seasonal declines in consumer spending drove the decline in card and ATM fees for the quarter. However, on a year-over-year basis, card and ATM fees increased approximately 12%. Other non-interest income included reductions to revenue of $12 million reflecting market decreases in relation to asset sale for certain employee benefits which is offset in salaries and benefit expense.","Quarter-over-quarter, mortgage revenue was up 3%. Additionally, in the quarter, we purchased the rights to service approximately $2.6 billion of mortgage loans bringing our total residential servicing portfolio to $40 billion and we will continue to explore and evaluate opportunities to expand our mortgage servicing portfolio.","During the quarter we also had a $14 million increase in income related to bank-owned life insurance. This was primarily attributable to claims business as well as a gain on exchange of policies. We expect the run rate going forward will be in the $18 million to $20 million quarterly range. ","Let\u2019s move on to expenses. Total reported expenses in the first quarter were $869 million. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $843 million, representing a decline of $18 million or 2% quarter-over-quarter as we implement our efficiency initiatives. As previously noted, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced plans to consolidate 29 branches as part of our strategic plan to close 100 to 150 branches. ","In the first quarter of 2016, we recorded $14 million of property related expenses, primarily related to the branch consolidation and additional occupancy optimization initiatives. In addition, we incurred $12 million of severance expense related to staffing reductions. Excluding the impact of severance charges in the current and previous quarter, salaries and benefits decreased $9 million or 2% linked quarter. And this decrease was primarily due to a 2% reduction in staffing as well as lower expenses attributable to market decreases in relation to assets held for certain employee benefits that I just discussed. This was partially offset by seasonal increases in payroll taxes of $12 million and increased incentives related to fee-based revenue growth. ","Professional and legal expenses declined primarily due to a favorable legal settlement of $7 million, which is not expected to recur going forward. FDIC fees increased $3 million from the previous quarter and as previously disclosed, we expect FDIC fees to increase by approximately $5 million on a quarterly basis when the FDIC assessment surcharge is implemented.","Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 60.6% in the first quarter driven primarily by growth in new revenue initiatives, which have been funded by expense eliminations. Our plan to become a more efficient organization is well underway. ","Let's move to asset quality. Total net charge-offs decreased $10 million to $68 million and represented 34 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $113 million and our allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 1.41% at the end of the quarter, which compares to 1.36% of total loans outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter. The increase in the allowance is primarily attributable to an increase in direct energy related loan reserves. Total loan loss allowance for the energy loan portfolio was 8% at the end of the first quarter compared to 6% at the end of the fourth quarter. ","Beginning primarily in the third quarter of 2015, low oil prices began to drive the migration of a number of large energy credits into criticized loans, primarily in the exploration and production and oil field services sectors. Continued low oil prices prompted further migration of some of those credits into classified loans this quarter. As a result, total business services criticized and classified loans increased $254 million, including an increase in classified loans of $703 million and a decrease in special mention loans of $449 million. ","Total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased $211 million from the fourth quarter. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance to non-accrual loans or coverage ratio was 116%. Additionally, troubled debt restructured loans or TDRs declined 2% from prior quarter. ","Now, regarding our energy portfolio, while oil prices remained volatile, exposures remained manageable. Should prices remain in the $30 to $45 range, we continued to expect losses in the $50 million to $75 million range in 2016. And should oil prices average $25 per barrel through the end of 2017, we would expect incremental losses in the $100 million range. In addition, weakness in energy, mining and metals, and agricultural are starting to put some pressure on certain commercial durable goods companies. However, we believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover inherent losses in our loan portfolio. Given where we are in the credit cycle and fluctuating commodity prices, volatility and certain critical metrics can be expected especially related to larger dollar commercial credits.","Let's move on to capital liquidity. During the first quarter, we returned $255 million to shareholders including the repurchase of $175 million of common stock and $80 million in dividends. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.6% and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.9%. On a fully phased-in basis common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 10.7%, well above current regulatory minimums. So let me provide an overview of our current expectations for the remainder of 2016, which remain consistent with those we delivered at our Investor Day last fall and also on our earnings call in January. We expect total loans to grow 3% to 5% on an average basis relative to fourth quarter 2015 average balances. Given current softer market conditions in the commercial space, we could track towards a lower end of that range. Regarding deposits, we continue to expect average deposit growth in the 2% to 4% range compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 average balances. Now commensurate with loan growth projections, we expect net interest income and other financing income to increase 2% to 4% on a full-year basis. Should we experience no additional rate increases, we expect to be at the lower end of that range. In addition, the higher end of the range is more challenging due to the lower dividends on the Federal Reserve stock.","Now with respect to the net interest margin, we will likely experience modest pressure if rates remain low. However, further increases in short-term rates will serve to stabilize the margin. As a result of our investments, we continue to grow adjusted non-interest income and expect that in the 4% to 6% range on a full-year basis. We will continue to make investments in 2016. However, our plan to eliminate $300 million of core expenses is underway and we expect to achieve 35% to 45% of that number in 2016. Therefore, we expect total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2016 to be flat to up modestly from the level in 2015. We expect to achieve a full-year adjusted efficiency ratio less than 63% and positive adjusted operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range in 2016.","We also continue to expect net charge offs in the 25 to 35 basis point range. However, given the volatility and uncertainty in the energy sector, we would expect to be at the top end of that range this year. In closing, the first quarter was a strong start to the year and we are encouraged by our results. The investments made in 2015 and before position us well for 2016 and beyond and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year as we continue to build sustainable franchise value.","With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning and I will turn it back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, David. Before we begin the Q&A session of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up in order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning. We will now open the lines for question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James.","Michael Rose","Maybe we can just start on the energy portfolio, can you give us a sense for kind of how much, how far you\u2019re through the kind of the spring borrowing base redetermination, I assume you\u2019re just kind of in the earlier stages. And now that we\u2019ve seen the rebound in oil, I mean, how confident would you be if oil stayed around these levels that you might come in closer to the lower end of your kind of charge-off range for the year, about $50 million to $75 million related to energy? Thanks.","Barb Godin","Michael, it\u2019s Barb Godin. I\u2019ll go ahead and answer the question in terms of our spring redetermination. We\u2019re roughly 25% of the way through and so far to date, we\u2019ve seen roughly 20, perhaps 25% reduction in the oil base is our expectation and in terms of the guidance that we\u2019ve given relative to charge-offs for the rest of the year, again, we\u2019ve run our models. We feel very good about where our numbers are. We do still anticipate that there will be volatility in the oil prices. And again, that\u2019s the reason that we\u2019re looking at $25 a barrel over the next two years, which would again create $100 million of incremental loss we think next year and $50 million to $75 million this year.","David Turner","Michael, we\u2019re continuously working with our customers and monitoring their financial situations as they\u2019re trying to rationalize their expenses, their spending base as well as trying to restructure their capital base. Obviously, if we saw stability of oil prices at this low, it will be a benefit to those customers, but as we go through our credit analysis, we aren\u2019t making that assumption. We continue to stress our portfolio to what we think the possibilities of the volatility are and so if it turns out to be stable at a higher point, then I think that\u2019s a good day for our customers and a good day for us, but we aren\u2019t necessarily trying to anticipate that in our credit review process.","Michael Rose","Okay. And that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, it looks like the unfunded commitments were down about $150 million quarter-to-quarter, are you guys actually trying to grow new credits at this point and where should we expect maybe that unfunded balance to close out over the next year or so? Thanks.","Barb Godin","Again, Michael, it\u2019s Barb. As we look at the unfunded balance, you\u2019re right, it was down $165 million. A lot of that was paid down at the lines. They were a handful of draws that we saw, not that many and there was a little bit of new business that was primarily in our midstream section. Midstream continues to perform well and even in a down industry, there are some very good customers out there and the credits that we put on the books, those are four credits, three of them in fact, which is existing relationships. We knew those customers very well. One was a new customer that we\u2019ve been quoting for a while. Very pleased with the quality of the credits that we\u2019ve done. We don\u2019t see a lot of additional credit, but again, we will continue to look for opportunities in the segment, if they present themselves and if they meet our credit quality guidelines.","David Turner","And Barb, if you could just comment on level of commitments year-over-year and where we see that going forward?","Barb Godin","Certainly. We started January of \u201815 with commitments at $6.9 billion and we right now sit at $4.8 billion. So we\u2019ve come down a fair bit on commitments. If I do the same comparison for you on outstandings, those outstandings went from $3.3 billion down to $2.7 billion at that same timeframe. So again, as we think about utilization, what happens as you know is as we do our borrowing base redeterminations that reduces our outstanding commitments and just as a general rule of thumb for every $100 million that we reduced at our commitments, that will naturally, just favor to your math, increase your utilization rate by 85 basis points.","Michael Rose","Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And maybe just one follow-up for me David, just to clarify, I think you said that there is no more rate increases this year that you\u2019d expect to be at the lower end of the NII guidance, did I hear that correctly?","David Turner","That\u2019s correct.","Michael Rose","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Carcache of Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on some of your -- the comments you just made, can you share with us what kind of utilization rate assumption is implicit in your current allowance and the methodology that gets you comfortable with that?","Barb Godin","Yeah. We don\u2019t really use a utilization rate per se. What drives our allowance is our risk rating process. The risk rating process takes into account all the information that we know about the customer, what\u2019s going on in the industry. Looking at their financials deeply and again, yes, we do refer to what they would have for example in their borrowing base, what our petroleum engineers say about it. So again, we don\u2019t have a specific number that we use, what I can tell you about the draws and the utilization is as we look at the energy and production customers, the E&P customers, again they are governed by borrowing base, so we see some natural ability for draws not to happen there. And then as we look at our oil field services customers, we have a number of covenants, a number of leverage covenants that are there. We also have anti-cash hoarding provisions that we have been putting in for the last several months as accounts have been coming up for renewal. So again that will naturally reduce their ability to draw on those lines. ","Bill Carcache","I see. That\u2019s helpful. So under this stress scenario that you guys lay out, where you show that if oil prices average $25 a barrel through 2017, the expectation that will result in additional $100 million of charge-offs in that kind of stress environment, it would seem that there may be more draws on existing unfunded lines, but I was trying to understand to what extent that was being captured in the methodology, but it sounds like the increase in draws under stress scenarios is not something that is captured. So maybe if you could just give a little bit of commentary on that. ","Barb Godin","Yes, there is a difference between how we reserve and how we do our stress testing. And on our stress testing, we are actually looking at our entire committed book and reviewing that and finding all the various stresses against the committed book. ","Bill Carcache","Okay. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR and Company.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Paul. ","Tim Hayes","Hey, guys. This is Tim Hayes for Paul Miller. First off, in regard to your Avant relationship, where do you see annual originations trending there and where exactly on the balance sheet of those loans being held?","Grayson Hall","So as you have seen, we have invested in a number of digital partnerships to try to improve our offerings to customers, predominantly consumers and small businesses in the digital space. We have announced a partnership with Avant. That partnership while communicated will not launch until third quarter. So we have not provided any forecast on revenues and originations to the market at this day. ","Tim Hayes","Understood. And then you had just mentioned that barring any type of interest rate hikes this year that you will stay at the low-end of your NII guidance. Where do you see NIM tracking barring any hikes, are you able to sustain the current level of your abnormality [ph] see any type of deterioration? ","David Turner","Yes, thanks. So we had a couple of things in the quarter on my prepared comment, take out the end piece of that, and we had some things won\u2019t repeat. So we said five points of that really are things that you won\u2019t see going forward. After that, if rates continue to stay where they are right now, we will see our net interest margin continuing to decline, so we do need some rate lift to stabilize the net interest margin. As most of us in the industry have been focusing on NII growth, it\u2019s really the guidance that we have given you that 2% to 4% and we think is more meaningful, but margins will come under pressure if rates stay here. ","Tim Hayes","Understood. Thanks for the color. ","Operator","Your next question will come from Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners.","Christopher Marinac","Thanks, good morning. I want to get back to the energy commitments and I was curious if the case of the decline in the commitments could accelerate just naturally as the business flows for the rest of the year?","Barb Godin","Again, it\u2019s Barb, and again, if you do just a back of the envelop and assume that 25% reduction in the borrowing bases, again, that would naturally translate into roughly a $1.2 billion in reduction on existing commitments taking them down from 4.8, somewhere down to the 4.5, 4.6 range, so yes, it will reduce. ","Christopher Marinac","Okay. And then Barb, is the ongoing SNC exam going to influence the criticized numbers come out had we seen a lot of that change already this last quarter. ","Barb Godin","Yes, we have fully incorporated the Shared National Credit exam into our results this quarter. ","Christopher Marinac","Okay. Very good. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from David Eads of UBS. ","David Eads","Hi, good morning. You made some comments at the beginning about seeing a little bit of softness in from commercial side in terms of demand for loan. I was curious if you could flush that out a little bit. Is that related \u2013 you also talked about some pressure on some of the ancillary energy companies, is it related to those type of companies or more broad based and are there any specific areas where you are seeing some softening loan demand?","David Turner","I think if you look at what we\u2019ve started seeing in the fourth quarter and certainly carrying into the first quarter, while we\u2019ve seen good growth in balances in our wholesale book and our consumer book, we have seen some softness in demand when you look at our sales pipelines for wholesale credit. Clearly the industry segments that are energy related are energy dependent in particular metals, minings and assorted commodities. Those industry segments obviously are very soft, but we\u2019ve seen a general slowdown or softness, if you will, in wholesale credit demand.","We don\u2019t know if that is a sustainable trend or whether that\u2019s sort of a first quarter anomaly, but at this point in time we were just signaling that we see demand just a little softer, still very competitive market and we are still able to find ways to serve our customers and extend credit. We feel good about our level of engagement with our customers, but I think given the market volatility since the first of the year, we are just seeing customers be a little bit more reserved, if they will, in terms of accessing credit facilities. ","David Eads","All right, thanks. And then maybe just I am curious if you have any color on \u2013 you\u2019ve got the final DOL fiduciary rule, if that\u2019s going to have any real impact on your wealth management business? I am just curious whether \u2013 how that interaction kind of plays?","David Turner","Well, I mean, I think it\u2019s a great question and one that as the rule has come out, out team is working on, but I think the positive news is we\u2019ve been working under a fiduciary model in our wealth management group for a very, very long time. We are very familiar with the fiduciary model and comfortable with it. We feel like we know how to operate in that environment. We do think that given the rules, we\u2019ve got a year to implement rules as they proposed and our teams are working closely with that, but given the history and the makeup of our book, we think it\u2019s a very manageable process for us. ","David Eads","All right, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill. ","Stephen Scouten","Hey, guys, good morning.","Grayson Hall","Good morning.","Stephen Scouten","Question for you on the kind of the efficiency ratio and the continued operating leverage. I mean, obviously you had a great quarter here in 1Q and well positioned for the rest of the year, but can you kind of give me some thoughts about the \u2013 on the sub-63% guidance relative to how you are already at the kind of 60.6% level today and what the trends might look like?","David Turner","Yeah, it\u2019s great question. So we want certainly guidance factor this just under 63% as we shared with you before because we are continuing to also make investments to grow revenue. There is timing differences that can get in our numbers. If you read our supplement carefully, you will see there is some timing differences there as well. We are very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on controlling our expenses in this first quarter and see that continuing throughout the year and frankly for years to come as we have $300 million expense program.","But remember the point of that is not just to improve efficiencies, it\u2019s really to make room for the investments we want to make to continue to grow and diversify our revenue steam and you will see continued investments there. There is some new things like our M&A advisory group that just came onboard in the fourth quarter. They had a pretty solid first quarter as we mentioned. We expect that to continue to grow and you will see their revenue growth, but you will see expenses associated with that business continue to grow as well. So we think it is more appropriate to go back to the 63% in the last efficiency ratio versus leveraging the 60.6%.","Stephen Scouten","Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks. And then maybe one follow-up on the NIM conversation, so if I understand it properly, we are kind of using maybe 3.14 as a real starting point as we look into the subsequent quarters, I know you're trying to focus more on NII but as I look at that NIM, I mean do you think that could be a 2 to 3 basis points a quarter kind of compression at higher rates?","David Turner","Yeah I think so, you start point is fair. So there are five points in there that we want to reset down from 3.19 to your 3.14 number. And there it's really kind of rate depended, I think if we stay at low rates, you\u2019ll see that coming down some. If you get an increase maybe that stabilizes a bit. So I think you'll have margin pressure unless we get the move - get a move sometime in 2016.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore IS.","John Pancari","On the color that you gave around the NIM this quarter and some of those items, on the premium am, I just want to if you can clarify that you know the tenure was down through the quarter and mortgage rates saw a little bit of that. So how do you actually see lower premium am, I would think it would be higher?","Grayson Hall","Well it's a little bit of, John stated, there is little bit of a lag effect there, you\u2019re right we actually saw the other way half our premium amortization was a little lower in the first quarter than it had been in the fourth quarter, so to the tune of about $5 million. And that's as we see the tenure drop, you would expect more activity coming through in the second quarter and more premium amortization and that's part of what we are trying to signal that won't recur from an NII standpoint. So you have a $5 million, $7 million roughly of NII benefit in the first quarter, all things being equal that you won't see in the second quarter.","John Pancari","Then secondly, on the loan loss reserve for energy, I know you gave us the direct energy reserve of now it's 8% versus 6% before. What is the energy reserve for the total energy book, so direct energy and the indirect, what is the reserve for that because you gave us the criticize for that but not the reserve.","Barb Godin","And we don't reserve it that way, again they fall into different categories, so as we look at both the individual customers et cetera, they roll up differently, don't have that detail but remember that the reserves that we have in total is available to absorb all loan losses irrespective of if they were in energy or not.","John Pancari","And then lastly, on expenses just want to see if I can get a little more color on the comp expense this quarter came in lower than expected and just want to see if you can give some color on the outlook there. Thanks.","Grayson Hall","Yeah, so our comp expense was down even though we had favorable taxes, there are some things that as I mentioned we are continuing to make investments. And I do think that we have our marine increase that happened kind of mid-quarter, we have our certain incentive grants, they are long-term grants that start in the second quarter but you will see expenses coming through on that too. So I think that we are off to a good start, we are down 538 full-time equivalents start to finish in the quarter. You\u2019ll see some run on benefits because all then happened January 1. But, you should see us, you don\u2019t see that pick up a bit even though we have favorable tax benefit that won't repeat. We do have some investments and what I mentioned on the compensation increases that will come through in second and later quarters.","John Pancari","And then related to that, sorry one more thing just around, I wanted to get your updated thoughts on operating leverage for the full year given your NIM expectation and spread revenue expectation that you mentioned but also what you just said here around expenses where they're trending?","Grayson Hall","So we are guiding you to 2% to 4% operating leverage. I think if rate stay flat and we have NII close to that 2 or below or end of the range that\u2019s a big driver of our operating leverage. And so you would expect to be at the lower range on operating leverage. We feel pretty confident that we\u2019ll be within that, I know we are well ahead of that range in this first quarter but we think it's more appropriate to guide you towards the 2% to 4%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Rob from Matt\u2019s team. I was just curious how, have you guys disclosed how much energy charge-offs were this quarter, did you guys take any?","Barb Godin","Yeah. This is Barb again. We had no energy charge-offs this quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. So as we think about the $50 million to $75 million of losses for the rest of the year, any additional granularity you can give around what segments you expect those losses to come from and timing of those losses?","Barb Godin","Yeah. I would primarily see the losses coming from by and large the oilfield services segment. The E&P segment, we know our collateral is, it doesn\u2019t go bad on us, not like it\u2019s been and is in a truck that we have to worry about. And again these are customers that we\u2019ve worked with for a long time and so we\u2019re going to continue to work with those customers. Some of the oilfield services customers are getting pressure, getting squeezed as the E&P customers reduce their CapEx, reduce their cost structure. So that\u2019s really where it\u2019s coming from.","Unidentified Analyst","Got you. And just secondly, I was wondering if you can give an update on credit trends you\u2019re seeing in the energy heavy markets, Texas, Houston, Louisiana?","Barb Godin","In general, in terms of what we\u2019re seeing there, I\u2019ll start with Texas. Texas, in particular Houston is pretty well diversified. We\u2019ve got some information as to how all breaks out in the supplement as well for the four gulf states but we\u2019re seeing good things in Texas still, things aren\u2019t as robust as they were, but they\u2019re not doing badly. On the consumer front, we\u2019re really not seeing much. We\u2019re actually looking at all of our consumer portfolios and our customer assistance programs in particular to say, are any customers calling relative to being dislocated from their unemployment or having an issue because they\u2019re either in the energy sector or things such as restaurants and they go to a restaurant and the restaurant business is now down, because of people in the energy sector not going as often. ","We have seen virtually things are stable, since the beginning of the year, we\u2019ve had 39 customers across all of our states calling, saying that they\u2019re somehow tied to the energy sector and that they\u2019re looking for some customer assistance and this is primarily around the auto sector and again, that is up probably maybe 1% over what we would normally assume.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Good morning, guys. Maybe I can follow-up a little bit on the last question, Barb, you talked geographically, but I just wanted to ask a little bit of the question you said earlier about seeing [indiscernible] metals and mining and agriculture and putting some pressure on durable goods companies, can you just help us understand how big a portfolio that is and if we don\u2019t see a pickup in oil, are you expecting to actually see losses in some of these portfolios or is it more that you\u2019re seeing negative migration?","Barb Godin","Thanks for the question. Firstly, in total, the metals and mining is about an $800 million portfolio with durable goods about $110 million and primarily metals just under $500 million, $480 million and we\u2019re seeing some pressure in terms of migration into other asset classes. And again that\u2019s tied, some of it to energy and as I think of customers who build specifically manufacture the pipeline, those customers clearly have reduced demand. Of course, you\u2019ve got the pressure because of the strong US dollar and the pressure of what\u2019s going on in places like China. So we do see more of that migrating over into the non-past weighted categories. Again, our sense around losses on that still comes back to our overall range of 25 to 35 basis points for the year and that would appropriate the use on that. Our ag portfolio is roughly $800 million as well, primarily in low crops and what we see there again is pressure on those commodities, again given what\u2019s going on globally.","Ryan Nash","Got it. David, maybe I can ask a question on the non-interest income, if I look in the first quarter, you\u2019re growing at about 10% as a percent of a clip on an annual basis and I\u2019m just wondering given the fact how strong it\u2019s been and the fact that, you\u2019re now articulating service charges are likely going to be up for the year, given customer growth, could we actually see our non-interest income growing at the high end, or maybe even a little bit above again, just given the fact that you\u2019ve done acquisitions, the customer growth is coming in very strong, and there hasn\u2019t been -- there don\u2019t seem to be that many headwinds in terms of the fee income.","David Turner","Yeah, I think, Ryan, that we have a shot at being at the high end of that. I\u2019ve cautioned you to extrapolate what you are seeing for the full year. I would like to say we could get above the 6%, but we are going to guide to the 4% to 6% right now, because there are certain things, capital market\u2019s revenues have a tendency to move around a bit, just depends on when transactions get closed. So you could see that move somewhat. Mortgage is susceptible to the rate environment as we see. We feel good and second, third quarters are always strong quarters in mortgage.","So we feel good there, but you have things like - from a trust standpoint it continues a little bit on where the market goes. And of course we had the bank-owned life insurance, so I think we carved that out. That\u2019s not going to recur. So I think that we feel good about the investments that we made. We feel good about the performance of those investments, but we need \u2013 this is one quarter, we need to get few more under our belt before we can call it above the 6%. ","Ryan Nash","Got it. If I could just squeeze in one last quick one, if I look the capital payout was almost 100% this quarter, clearly the stock is trading at or below tangible book value, so I appreciate you wanting to be tactical, but can we continue to return capital at this kind of pace and as you think out over the next couple of quarters assuming if the stock continues to trade in this range, do you think we can get more aggressive from the 2015 CCAR level?","David Turner","So we\u2019ve made our submission, we can\u2019t talk specifically about what\u2019s in it. But I think if you look at our capital where we are today from capital ratio standpoint, it was an expectation over time that we could expect to move our common equity tier 1 into that 9.5% range. The question is what pace will we have to get there. So if you just think about our payout being in the mid-90s last year and growing our loan portfolio 5%, let\u2019s just call that $4 billion for easy math, that\u2019s about 40 basis points of capital. So do what we are doing right now, we will continue get our capital ratio down and for us we want to make appropriate investments.","We understand we trade below tangible book value. It is pretty good investment to buy your shares back which is why we\u2019ve been doing what we are doing and you should continue to expect that we have an appropriate return to our shareholders, although our focus really is to use our capital for organic growth. Our capital is to be used to expand our business to grow new revenue to make investments in technology and process improvements and of course pay an appropriate dividend to our shareholders. And then after that if there is excess capital and earnings and it\u2019s repurchasing share from our shareholder which is what we did last year and you should expect that same approach this year.","Ryan Nash","Thanks for taking my questions and great quarter.","Grayson Hall","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Jennifer.","Jennifer Demba","Good morning. You just covered my question. Thank you.","Grayson Hall","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Grayson Hall","Hi, Geoffrey.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello, thank you for taking the question. On the capital markets business, can you give us a bit more color on what drove that doubling in revenues from last year, what the areas are, where you\u2019ve been making investments and how much you think you can continue to grow the business?","David Turner","Geoffrey, so we made a number of investments over the past couple of years and the most recent one was our M&A advisory firm that we acquired in the fourth quarter last year. They really are just getting going, so they had a little bit of activity in the first quarter that was nice to see. We expect that business to continue to ramp up and grow over time. We had made investments to get a license under the Fannie Mae DUS program for placement of real estate loans and we had a good quarter there as well. Loan syndication, we have built that out a bit by hiring Stifel and that continued to benefit. So capital markets had a very good quarter and as I mentioned earlier is that that can move around on you from quarter to quarter, but what we see from those investments we are very encouraged. ","Grayson Hall","I mean, Jeff, that\u2019s a momentum business. We are very pleased with how they performed this quarter. We obviously feel like we invest a lot in people and product and technology in that space, but today this point, earnings in that business can move around from quarter-to-quarter. But we believe we are on a very positive trajectory and we are continuing to look for opportunities to make more investments in that part of our business. And so we anticipate over time of becoming more and more important to our franchise. ","Geoffrey Elliott","And thinking out longer term, what are the sort of capabilities that you might like to add to that business? ","David Turner","Well, I think what we are going to be careful of is not getting ahead of our sales too much. We have made quite a few investments in capital markets and really have brought on some very talented people, and I think our focus is to continue to execute and grow what we just discussed. I think the purpose of expanding our capital markets is for two primary reasons. One, we want to grow and diversify our revenue and this gives us a chance to grow non-interest revenue. But maybe the most important component of that is we want to be able to bring the entire Regions to our customer to be able to help our customer to succeed. So we have made investments in capabilities that we think can do that. We didn\u2019t have -- our capital markets business has been part of Morgan Keegan for a lot of years and when we disposed of that, we disposed the capital markets opportunity. So we are having to rebuild that and we made the investments to do it by acquiring the talent that we need to have and we want to be careful not to go too fast and like I said, we are encouraged by where we are. ","Grayson Hall","And just to be clear, our focus is on debt capital markets platform, David mentioned, Morgan Keegan. There are a number of things that we used to do that we don\u2019t aspire to do, but I would say that as we think about building our debt capital markets platform with a focus on meeting customer needs, other capabilities are fixed income, sales and trading. Today, we participate in fixed income underwritings. We would like to lead those opportunities. Just as our syndications revenue is growing. As we win more lead roles, we want to build \u2013 lead those fixed income underwrites as well, so that\u2019s one capability we don\u2019t have today, we will have hopefully in the near future. Low income housing tax credit is a really good business for us, we would like to have some syndication capabilities as we think about building out our origination and distribution model. And so we see a lot of upside in capital markets and debt capital markets revenue over time. But we will be thoughtful in that regard. We are trying to diversify our revenues across a lot spectrum of services for our customers. And to David\u2019s point, most important part is to build capability to service our customers. ","Geoffrey Elliott","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Good morning. I wanted to kind of go on the other side of the capital markets equation, which is as you saw the uptick in the revenues, typically that business has corresponding uptick in expenses, which would accentuate to drop that you saw this particular quarter. So just wanted to kind of see if there was any other way that you\u2019re approaching it or was that already embedded in the expense number we saw this quarter? ","Grayson Hall","Marty, what we saw along is we really are trying to focus on expense initiatives, so that not only can we improve the overall financial performance of the company and create positive operating leverage, but we also want to do it in a way that allows us to make investments we need to make in other parts of our business. And as David mentioned a moment ago, we had a substantial reduction in workforce over the last quarter. That\u2019s helped us mitigate a lot of the expense growth, but at the same time, make some of these investments. And I will ask John Turner to expand and get a little more color on capital markets and what the expenses there may hold. I would just say that recognizing that our primary investment is in people and people with significant skillset, so to your point there is cost associated with that. I think we are trying to be very thoughtful about the businesses that we enter and the returns that we get in this business making sure that while we are really compensating our associates, we are also earning a fair return for our shareholders as well and to Grayson\u2019s point, in order to make those investments, we\u2019ve got to reduce expenses elsewhere which we\u2019ve been successful doing thus far.","Marty Mosby","David, when you said lower expenses associated with liabilities on employee benefits, was that the BOLI impact or was there something else maybe in the pension plan that you made adjustments to that you may have a sustainable benefit going forward and can you put a little number around that, if that is that? ","David Turner","So, Marty, if you go back, I mentioned the non-interest revenue income was down because truck related trading assets associated with certain of our benefit plans, offset to that was your \u2013 the expense you are talking about, so it\u2019s virtually a one for one. It\u2019s in the $10 million, $12 million range.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Mutascio of KBW.","Chris Mutascio","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","David Turner","Thank you.","Chris Mutascio","Hey, David, I\u2019ve just got some follow-up. I just want to clarify couple of things, make sure I have it right. The dollar amount of the, I won\u2019t call non-recurring, but the things you mentioned that benefitted net interest income in the quarter, was that the $5 million to $7 million I think when you are discussing the premium amortization or was it higher than that including the dividend income from the trading assets?","David Turner","It\u2019s both. The 5% to 7% takes both of those. It\u2019s 4% to 5% on premium amortization, another 2% to 3% on the dividend.","Chris Mutascio","Okay. I kind of backed into it. I think that was the total amount of the two when I looked at the margin. The second one, just to clarify, I think I had this right too. So you are resetting kind of bar if you will for second quarter for those on the margin, so instead of 3.19 maybe you are looking at adjusted 3.14, but any type of margin compression due to the lack of rising interest rates would be off of the resetting 3.14 number, not the 3.19 number?","David Turner","That\u2019s correct.","Chris Mutascio","Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you hear me now?","Grayson Hall","Yeah.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Can you guys share with us what you are seeing in spreads on your corporate loan book or have they \u2013 some of the banks have reported that they seem to be stabilizing. Are you guys seeing that in the C&I portfolio or the commercial real estate mortgage portfolio?","John Turner","Gerard, this is John Turner. We are seeing stabilization in pricing still very competitive market and I would say we are competing more on tenure and structure than we are on price. It has been nice to see some stabilization in pricing over the last quarter or two.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then in regards, I just want to go back, I think you guys mentioned about the special mention loans coming down as the energy portfolio has migrated to different classes, was the drop in special mention entirely energy or were there some others that cause that number to decline.","Barb Godin","It\u2019s Barb again. Pretty broad based decline, in fact if you look at our delinquencies, 30-day delinquencies were down, 90-day delinquencies were down and action what we did in energy all of other credit metrics would be down as well including our reserve. We would not have built as much reserve, we may \u2013 we even had a small release had it not been for us providing for energy.","Gerard Cassidy","I see. And were the actions you\u2019ve taken in energy this quarter as a result of the Shared National Credit exam as well as your own internal observations or what\u2019s going on with the portfolio?","Barb Godin","As we mentioned, we did incorporate the Shared National Credit exam, but again looking at these credits on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, we are in constant contact with our customers. Our portfolio is very granular. Between oil field services and the E&P customers there is less than 80 customers in total, so we are staying in constant contact with them, working with them and real understanding of what\u2019s going on with them and that\u2019s one of the reason that we moved credits into various classifications as we\u2019ve got better information from them.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And just last question, I apologize if you have addressed this already. In terms of the loans that went into non-performing status, the energy loans, what percentage of those loans were part of syndicated credits were you were participant versus loans that you may have originated on your own?","Barb Godin","That would be the majority of them. I don't have an exact percentage for you but it would be the majority of them.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Winter of Sterne Agee.","Peter Winter","When I look at the balance sheet, it tends to be more levered to the long end of the curve then most of your peers. And with the tenure really coming down so much during the quarter, I\u2019m just wondering if the tenure were to move back up, would that help stabilize the margin. And then secondly, is there anything you can do in terms of like remixing the balance sheet to be a little bit more reliant on the shorter end of the curve?","Grayson Hall","Well, so you\u2019re exactly right, if you look at our sensitivity, our sensitivity is more so to the back end to the long end than the short end. And as tenure does pick back up then you would see that manifests itself in two ways, one better reinvestment rates and two lower premium amortization. And we\u2019re forecasting our premium amortization to go up because of the reduction in the tenure but that can be short lived as you know pretty volatile and we\u2019re positioned exactly where want to be. It was intentional and we think it was the right thing to do for us.","Peter Winter","And then just one quick follow-up. On the loan portfolio commercial real estate, the owner occupied that continuous to decline and I'm just wondering if there is light at the end of the tunnel where it starts to flatten out maybe you can get a little bit growth going forward?","John Turner","Yes, I mean if you look at our loan portfolio, almost every category is now growing and the vast majority of the markets we operate in are showing that loan growth but the one lending segment that's been slow to demonstrate growth has been the only occupied space which is predominantly small to medium size businesses and a lot of that is in amortizing portfolio that\u2019s used to expand plant and equipment. We still not seen that small business owner return to the market with courage to invest and expand. We keep thinking, we\u2019ll reach a pivot point in that business. Production is remarkably strong in that part of the business over the last couple of quarters but you know outstanding on a net basis is still continues to decline. We still think our expectations are that it will pivot at some point but we still think we\u2019re ways away from that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Harbes of Wells Fargo.","Jason Harbes","Most of my questions has been answered but just wanted to follow up on the coverage ratio guidance, I think you guys gave back at the Investor Day, you said you know 120 to 140 basis points is about the right range this quarter pretty much the high end of the range with the energy-related reserve built. Just wanted to get a feel for it, is that still kind of the right way we should be thinking about in light of some of the makeshift with the greater focus on card and some of the other peer-to-peer lending activity.","Barb Godin","And again 120 to 140 that we touched on back then you know that's just a general rule of thumb, you\u2019re going to see some of our peer companies still lower than that, some go higher than that. So there is more specific sweet spots that we\u2019re looking for regarding our process play out each quarter and if we did look at the higher end, a little over as 140 this time but again that will be different each quarter as we taken in all of the information that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jack Micenko of Susquehanna.","Jack Micenko","Most of my questions have been answered but wanted to ask about auto, it's been a bright spot for the portfolio has grown nicely. Have you made any changes there around underwriting a product type with some of the concerns that are sort of cropped up at the lower end of the market? And then I guess secondly, do you think if SAAR is down something modestly make sure you can continue to grow that portfolio?","John Turner","Well, I mean I think it's been a very good as you say, it's been a good growth market for us and if we\u2019ve shown some fairly good growth rates, albeit from a fairly low level of outstandings that we had in the balance sheet. It\u2019s a business we reentered a few years ago. We have continued to adjust our credit underwriting standards on that business overtime as we\u2019ve seen the market change. We tried to stay very rigorous and disciplined in that regard. We have modified some of our adjustments to try to reduce the duration of the portfolio. We\u2019ve made some adjustments that have tried to narrow the part of the market that we\u2019re willing to lend into. ","I think that our actions have, to a certain degree for all of the amount of volume that we get, but volume that we\u2019re getting is of a quality that we feel good about and the performance that we see is strong. I just remind you that we only deal with preferred dealers, we don\u2019t anticipate in the subprime market, to any great extent, and we do not have any leasing products. So we feel, we\u2019re pretty plain and simple in how we approach the auto market and trying to stay disciplined in how we participate. I do think the latter part of your question is depending on what sales volumes are for that industry will clearly drive what opportunities we have for origination growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jesus Bueno of Compass Point.","Jesus Bueno","Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Very quickly, you touched on small business lending, do you have any update on the foundation partnership and perhaps how that did and now that you have one kind of full quarter of that and perhaps even expectations for this year?","Grayson Hall","I would say it\u2019s still too early to call. We\u2019re pleased with the early results of that partnership. We\u2019ve not publicly released any of those performance metrics, but I would say that while we\u2019re pleased, it\u2019s still too early for us to make any sort of public announcement on where we think that\u2019s going and it\u2019s still relatively small contributor to our origination, you\u2019ll see us doing a number of these innovative partnerships. In aggregate, they should be very meaningful, but on an individual basis, they\u2019re all incremental.","Jesus Bueno","Great. Thank you. And just again on the reserve build for energy this quarter, approximately how much of that, kind of 2% increase in the energy reserve was directly related to the results of that exam, would you say primarily the whole thing or was there a large portion of it?","David Turner","Well, again, as Barb Godin had said earlier, we\u2019re not going to comment directly on that exam. What we\u2019ll tell you in general is that we use all input that we get, both internally and externally in talking to our customers and all of the input we\u2019ve gotten from all sorts and have been accounted for in how we reserve this quarter.","Jesus Bueno","Fair enough. And I\u2019ll just slip one more in. On mortgages quickly, I guess the volumes were pretty solid this quarter and looked to be better than I guess what was anticipated, I guess how do you feel kind of in the first three weeks of the second quarter, I guess going into this quarter, how are your pipelines and I guess have you also had any lingering effects from trades still in the first quarter and anticipating that for the second quarter?","Grayson Hall","Well, I would tell you, first quarter, we\u2019re very encouraged by how the fundamentals of the company are performing. We are seeing good solid results across almost all of our businesses, and almost all of our geographies and so if you look at the fundamentals of the company and how we performed, I think we think we had a good solid quarter. We do have some headwinds in the energy portfolio and metals and mining and we are addressing those in a very rigorous and disciplined manner, but on a net basis, we feel pretty good about it and we think that the fundamental performance that we\u2019re seeing in the first quarter should continue into the second quarter. ","As we mentioned earlier, we have seen a softness in our sales pipelines in the first quarter, which should make second quarter a little more uncertain than we would like. But I would say that we continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making. We don\u2019t think there has been any impact of TRID at this point in time and don\u2019t anticipate that in the second quarter, but continuing to make mortgage \u2013 continuing to make progress. And as David said earlier, if you look at our mortgage business in particular, second and third quarters always seasonally the best quarters we have of the year and so we do anticipate second quarter being better in that regard. ","Jesus Bueno","Great. Appreciate the color. Congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking my questions. ","Grayson Hall","Thank you.","David Turner","Thank you.","Grayson Hall","I believe we have more questions. ","Operator","We have one more question. Your final question comes from Jill Shea of Credit Suisse.","Jill Shea","Good morning. Just on the deposit service fees, I mean, held up quite well in the quarter just given the seasonality and the full quarter impact of the posting order changes. Can you just talk about the underlying account growth momentum you\u2019re seeing and sort of how that ties into the outlook for fee growth going forward?","David Turner","So as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we actually had grown checking accounts last year about 2%, we have grown checking accounts this year, and we have our full quarter service charges from the posting order impact that started November last year, so we kind of got a mid-quarter last quarter, full quarter this quarter, we think we are off to seeing service charges increase modestly as we go throughout 2016. A big driver of that is our ability to grow customer accounts, both last year and this year. ","Grayson Hall","Jill, I would tell you that the account growth has been very steady and very solid and broad across our franchise footprint. Really encouraging is that consumers continue to build liquidity. We are seeing very strong liquidity metrics on the consumer side. And we are also seeing the number of active cards, both debit cards and credit cards, number of active cards are up as well as the number of transactions for cards are up. I would comment that credit card balances are up modestly, it\u2019s usually the seasonal time of the year, but we saw average credit balances up 2% to 3%. We are probably up 8% year-over-year. But that\u2019s in the face of strong double-digit transaction activity on cards. But customers are being fiscally conservative and we are not seeing balances go up remarkably, but we are seeing go up modestly. But transaction activity is very strong and so we are encouraged. ","Jill Shea","Great, thanks. ","Grayson Hall","Well, if that\u2019s a last question, we appreciate everyone attending our call today. We thank you for your time and attention. And we look forward to seeing you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.

My name is Nicole, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.","M. List Underwood","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation on the call this morning. Our presenters today are our President and Chief Executive Officer, Grayson Hall; our Chief Financial Officer, David Turner. And also with us and available to answer questions are Matt Lusco, our Chief Risk Officer; and Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer.","As part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section at Regions.com.","With that said, let me remind you that in this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical information but rather are related to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Those statements are based on general assumptions and are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found on our forward-looking statement that is located in the appendix of the presentation.","Let me now turn it over to Grayson.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Good morning, and thank you all for participating in Regions' First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Simply put, this has been a quarter of significant accomplishment. In fact, I would characterize it as a pivotal quarter, with Regions now fundamentally stronger, strategically focused and well positioned to grow our franchise profitably. We certainly still have plenty of work left to fully accomplish our goals, but the past quarter's results position Regions well.","Let's look at the key milestones that have occurred over the past few months. We successfully completed an approximate $900 million public offering of common stock. The overnight offering was significantly oversubscribed and priced at a premium from the previous day's close. Our equity rates, following the results of the Federal Reserve's large bank capital analysis review, there were no objections to our plan, demonstrating what we believe is the strength of our capital planning process. ","Subsequently, a major credit rating agency upgraded Regions, restoring us to investment grade status and attributing the upgrade to improving profitability, rise of asset quality and capital trends. Also, we completed the sale of Morgan Keegan, which closed on April 2, reducing our overall risk profile and improving liquidity and capital. ","And finally, on April 4, we redeemed the entire $3.5 billion of Series A preferred stock issued in the U.S. Treasury. On an ongoing basis, the redemption eliminates the payment of preferred dividends, as well as the amortization of the discount, which cost us in total $214 million or $0.17 per share in 2011.","In addition to these important milestones, we also achieved broad-based asset quality improvement, providing strong evidence that we are at a long-awaited inflection point in overall credit quality trends. Plus, we continue to demonstrate disciplined progress in improving customer service quality in all of our business locations.","Further, Regions' first quarter earnings from continuing operations were a solid $0.14 per diluted share and despite seasonal factors and legislative headwinds, adjusted pretax, pre-provisioned income approximated $419 million, a level that we believe will mark 2012's quarterly low point. We're off to a very good start in 2012 and given our recent capital accomplishments, as well as the ongoing successful execution of our business plans, Regions' outlook for the full year is encouraging.","There's no question that the first few months of the year has been busy and eventful for Regions. We have accomplished a great deal and all these actions served to enhance our overall risk profile and allows us to focus on core fundamentals. As a result, we're a fundamentally stronger company that has encouraging momentum. ","Let me turn the call over to David who will provide first quarter's financial details. After which, I'll return for some closing comments before opening the call up for questions. David?","David J. Turner","Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 3 with a quick snapshot of our first quarter 2012 financial results. We reported net income available to common shareholders of $145 million or $0.11 per diluted share, and income from continuing operations totaled $185 million or $0.14 per diluted share. A net loss from discontinued operations of $40 million or $0.03 per diluted share is attributable to an increase in professional and legal fees.","Pretax Pre-provision Income, or PPI, was $438 million as reported. Net interest income declined linked quarter. However, net interest margin increased 1 basis point to 3.09%.","Non-Interest Revenues increased 3% on a linked quarter basis and Non-Interest Expenses, excluding fourth quarter's goodwill impairment, were up 5%.","From a credit standpoint, Net Charge-Offs were down 23% and the Loan Loss Provision declined 60% from the previous quarter. As you could see, our first quarter results from continuing operations were solid, reflecting core business strengths and a marked reduction in credit costs. We do expect this quarter to be the low point for PPI.","Unless I note otherwise, my comments will focus on results from continuing operations, excluding goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of last year, as we believe this provides a clearer picture of fundamental trends. Let me start with asset quality on Slide 4.","In the first quarter, we experienced broad-based asset quality improvement. Virtually all credit metrics improved during the period and most should continue to do so throughout the year. Notably, first quarter's Loan Loss Provision was the lowest in more than 4 years. Net Charge-Offs were down significantly, resulting in a decline of $98 million or 23% linked quarter and exceeded the Loan Loss Provision by $215 million.","Inflows of Non-Performing Loans declined to $381 million, or 32%, from the fourth quarter's $561 million. Non-Performing Loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased $221 million or 9% linked quarter and $936 million or 30% year-over-year.","Total Non-Performing Assets declined $1.3 billion or 33% from prior year. Also, it's important to note that nearly half of all Business Services' gross nonperforming loans were current and paying as agreed at the end of the quarter. This is up 11 percentage points from a year ago.","Notably, Business Services' criticized and classified loans continued to decline, with criticized loans down 6% or $391 million from the fourth quarter and down $3.2 billion or 35% from 1 year ago. As a reminder, criticized and classified loans are one of the best and earliest indicators of credit quality.","Our allowance coverage ratios remain strong. At quarter end, our allowance for loan and lease losses to Non-Performing Loans stood at 118%, up 15 basis points from last year. Meanwhile, our loan loss allowance to loan ratio remains strong at 3.3% at the end of the first quarter.","Bottom line, we continue to make significant progress on asset quality and from almost every metric observed, you will find improved credit quality at Regions. However, each quarter has its own unique characteristics and some volatility should be expected going forward due to the uneven nature of the economic recovery.","Now let's look at our balance sheet trends starting with loans on Slide 5. Ending loans for the first quarter were down $874 million or 1% linked quarter and the loan yield decreased 6 basis points to 4.29%. But this decrease in yield primarily reflects the impact of previously terminated balance sheet hedges. Ending earning assets, however, increased 2% linked quarter attributable to growth in the investment portfolio, which I will discuss in a moment.","Investor real estate balances reflect a favorable decline of 6%. At quarter end, balances stood at $10.1 billion, which is down $4.7 billion from 1 year ago. This portfolio now comprises 13% of our total loan portfolio, down from 18% a year ago. We expect this portfolio to continue to decline at a more moderate pace.","Mortgage balances declined 1% linked quarter, reflecting our continued strategy to sell fixed-rate conforming mortgages. The company also experienced additional loan declines in the home equity portfolios as consumers continue to refinance and or deleverage. ","Regarding the credit card portfolio, balances were down slightly on a linked quarter basis. However, we do expect growth later this year once we assume servicing of the portfolio and control the customer experience.","Commercial and industrial loan demand remained healthy in the first quarter, driven by our specialized lending groups. On an ending basis, loans grew $576 million or 2% for the first quarter. While growth was broad-based geographically, we experienced particularly strong growth in Southwest Texas in the energy industry, as well as Central and West Tennessee in the health care industry.","Pipelines have also picked up as customers continue to make capital expenditures and to some extent, build working capital. Line utilization on commercial and industrial loans was up 45 basis points linked quarter.","Indirect auto continues to be an area of growth, as loans increased 5% linked quarter and we now have almost 1,500 dealers in our network. Total consumer loan production totaled $2.3 billion in the first quarter.","We have been disciplined and judicious with respect to capital deployment. As a result of our capital actions and credit ratings upgrade, we are in a better position for our balance sheet to work harder for us in the future. Loan balances should end the year relatively stable compared to the beginning of the year, as loan growth in C&I and non-real-estate consumers should offset more modest declines in investor real estate.","On the liability side of the balance sheet, as shown on Slide 6, deposit mix and costs continued to improve in the first quarter. Average deposits were up 1% linked quarter, driven by a $1.6 billion increase in low-cost deposits, partially offset by a $721 million decline in CDs.","Given our continued success in growing low-cost deposits, average time deposits fell to 20% of average outstanding deposits, down from 24% a year ago. This positive mix shift resulted in deposit cost declining to 37 basis points for the quarter, down 3 basis points from fourth quarter and 22 basis points from 1 year ago. On a related note, our total funding costs improved 3 basis points linked quarter to 65 basis points.","However, we expect to be able to drive additional improvement in deposit cost. We have approximately $4 billion of CDs that are scheduled to mature in the second quarter that carry an average interest rate of 1.1%. There's an additional $5.2 billion at 1.9% that will mature in the second half of the year. This compares to our current average going-on rates for new CDs approximating 25 to 30 basis points.","Now let's turn to net interest income on Slide 7. Seasonal factors, including day count, along with the residual effect from previously-terminated derivatives reduced net interest income on a linked quarter basis. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income was down $22 million or 3%. However, the resulting net interest margin was up 1 basis point to 3.09%, which was impacted by declining deposit costs, gains on previously-terminated balance sheet hedges and a decline in the low-yielding cash reserves at the Federal Reserve. ","We are optimistic about the course of net interest income and net interest margin over the balance of the year. As always, the course will depend on the trajectory of interest rates and prepayment levels, particularly in the investment portfolio.","In order to utilize a portion of our excess liquidity, we purchased approximately $3 billion of investment securities during the first quarter, almost $2 billion in agency-guaranteed securities and $1 billion of corporate bonds. We are focused on ensuring that we can retain flexibility to adjust the size of the investment portfolio in all rate environments if more attractive loan opportunities arise. We believe these investments will increase the aggregate earnings of the portfolio, and also protect the investment portfolio from the negative impact of higher interest rates.","Consequently, in the first quarter, the remaining excess cash reserves negatively impacted the margin 13 basis points, an improvement from fourth quarter's 14 basis points. In addition, the impact of non-accruals on the margins declined 3 basis points to 10 basis points in the first quarter.","Let's turn to Non-Interest Revenues on Slide 8. First quarter Non-Interest Revenues were up 3% linked quarter. As expected, service charges declined modestly by 3% or $9 million linked quarter despite the negative impact of Regulation E and debit interchange legislation. These results demonstrate our ability to quickly adapt our business model. We've been able to successfully mitigate these hurdles by generating new revenue streams and through the ongoing product restructuring of deposit accounts. As a result of these changes, we expect to completely mitigate this legislative impact over time.","Mortgage banking revenue was particularly strong in the quarter, aided by the government's HARP 2 program, which is serving to increase refinanced volume. Revenues were up $20 million or 35% over fourth quarter. We estimate HARP 2 will add over $1 billion to our full year 2012 mortgage refinance volume. As we evaluate the mortgage refinancing opportunities, we believe our capacity to handle refinancing activity more expeditiously is enabling us to take market share. We anticipate that mortgage revenue will continue to benefit from HARP 2 in the near term, but will moderate over the latter part of the year.","Moving onto expenses on Slide 9. Non-interest expenses were up 5% linked quarter. However, expenses were down 2% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we experienced a seasonal increase in expenses primarily related to an increase of payroll taxes, as well as an annual subsidiary dividend of $13 million. ","In addition, we experienced an increase in pension and 401-K related expenses. This increase was offset by a reduction in certain credit-related expenses, in particular, other real estate and held for sale expenses. Combined, these expenses improved $19 million or 56% linked quarter and this is an area where we are making clear progress. We also reduced headcount during the quarter. And over the past year, we've experienced a decline of 737 positions or 3%.","As we have noted before, we will continue to seek expense savings without compromising prudent investment opportunities or sacrificing the high service levels our customers have come to expect and deserve at Regions. In fact, this quarter, we are rolling out new technology to our teller platform that will leverage image technology to support a streamlined process for associates and customers. This will also enhance our cross-sell abilities and allow tellers to interact with customers in a way they were not able to before. We continue to focus on process improvement, technology investments and improving operating efficiencies.","Looking ahead, we expect overall 2012 expenses from continuing operations, and excluding goodwill impairment, to be slightly down from the 2011 level, as a result of our continued and disciplined focus on expenses.","Turning now to our strong capital and solid liquidity on Slide 10. As a result of our capital actions and events this past quarter, our Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter stood at 14.3% and our Tier 1 common ratio increased by 110 basis points to 9.6%. Adjusted to exclude the government's preferred investment, the Tier 1 ratio was 10.6%. At quarter's end, our pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common and Tier 1 ratios were 8.9% and 12.5%, respectively, and are above the proposed policy minimums.","As a quick reminder, as a result of the Series A Preferred Stock repayment earlier this month, Regions' second quarter net income available to common shareholders will be impacted by the acceleration of the accretion of the discount associated with the repurchased shares. The charge associated with the accretion is expected to be approximately $70 million.","Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company remains solid with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 79% and cash held at the Federal Reserve totaled approximately $5.2 billion at quarter end.","Lastly, based on our interpretation, our liquidity coverage ratio is above the 100% Basel III requirement. Overall, this quarter's results show the significant accomplishments that we've made on several important fronts. We have substantially enhanced our asset quality. We have proven that our core business performance is sound and we further strengthened our balance sheet from a liquidity and capital standpoint.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Grayson for his closing remarks.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Thank you, David. And let me close just by quickly recapping the notable accomplishments in the past few months. We are pleased that a number of significant events are now largely behind us. We have raised capital, selling $900 million of new common stock. We have completed the sale of Morgan Keegan. We have repaid the government's preferred investment. We have made significant strides in addressing our asset quality issues as confirmed by the notable improvement in asset quality metrics. And we continue to deliver excellent customer service while investing in new technology and process improvements.","As a result of these actions, we can now focus more of our resources on fundamentals and on executing our business plans and growing our franchise. I am proud of the progress we've made and I believe the second quarter of 2012 marks the start of a new chapter for Regions. We look forward to a shift in focus where the emphasis will be on profitable and prudent growth. I am confident that we have the right business plans in place and the talent to execute successfully. I'm also increasingly optimistic about the opportunities ahead, even in what we assume to be a relatively slow growth 2012 economy. We are committed to taking advantage of these opportunities and deliver improved, high-quality results to our stakeholders.","Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Your first question is from the line of Jefferson Harralson of KBW.","Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can we talk about the ability possibly to be -- to have a 1% ROA? You guys have always had a 1% ROA in the past. But you have a balance sheet that's $19 billion smaller than peak, you got $21 billion less loans than peak. Can you get to a 1.0% ROA on this size balance sheet with this expense run rate?","David J. Turner","Jefferson, what we've kind of guided to is that over time, we believe we can be in that 1% to 1.2% ROA. The question is timing. And clearly, as the economy improves, our ability to attain that level is more achievable. We are continuing to look at credit. We had substantial improvements in credit. But that's going to be uneven. And so, we need to continue to focus on credit, as well as having our balance sheet work harder for us now that we've received our ratings upgrade and we're outside of TARP. So we'll start working towards that range of ROA that I mentioned. It's just timing.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Because Jefferson, as you look at it, we've been in a very defensive posture over the last few quarters from a capital and liquidity perspective, and we do believe we are at the point that we can move a little more off of defense, onto offense in terms of prudently generating new business. We do see the opportunity starting to increase for us in our markets. Obviously, our strengthening position will help us from a competitive perspective.","Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And my follow-up, David, you mentioned you're optimistic about spread income and margin. Does that mean that you think that most likely, they'll both move higher from here throughout the year?","David J. Turner","Well, we do believe that because of our deposit repricing opportunities that I mentioned, that our margin will -- you'll see improvement in our margin throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just one follow-up on the non-interest income. It seems like the securities that you added were done towards the latter part of the quarter. So I'm just wondering what the full run rate benefit of that would be as you think about 2Q and beyond.","David J. Turner","Matt, we really haven't given guidance quarter-to-quarter. What we said is we expect that, if you look at the year, that -- it goes back to Jefferson's question really, that we expect our NII and margin to be improved over where we were in 2011, so that's back-end loaded. And it's back-end loaded primarily because of the deposit cost, but also, to the point that you brought up -- getting the balance sheet working harder for us, really didn't begin in earnest until receiving the ratings upgrade and having the TARP repayments. So you saw a little bit of that movement in the repositioning of the investment portfolio. So it will take to the back half before you start seeing it.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And as we think out a little bit longer term, I realize the credit rating boost will help and if more come, that will help more. But if we look at the cost of your long-term debt, it's still pretty high especially versus your other funding. And given your low loan to deposit ratio. Like, how do you think about remixing the funding overtime and what that might mean for the NIM beyond this year?","David J. Turner","Well, we have a couple of maturities that are coming up this year and next year. We'll have to -- we continue to watch our credit spreads. They are coming in. They're still wider than we expect, and hope for over the long term. We do have a pretty low level of long-term debt compared to our equity and especially compared to our peers. But we will look for opportunities to take advantage of our tightening of credit spreads. And to the extent we see opportunities to refinance. In particular, we have one series of the trust preferreds that are at 8.8%. We'll be looking at that in particular.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And the just separately if I may. Obviously, credit was better than expected, pretty much across-the-board. I mean, what stuck out to me is the reserve release was quite large and I guess, being sensitive that the credit metrics can be choppy, you talked about being uneven yet you're confident enough to bring down a lot of reserves. So I mean, do you feel like we're past the point where you kind of have 2 to 3 quarters of good credit and there's a little blip that ends up, maybe catching some folks off guard? So maybe we'll still be choppy uneven but fewer bumps or smaller bumps?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Matt, I'll make a few comments and I'll ask Barb Godin if she'll add to this. But what we've seen is we had a very good quarter from a credit quality metrics standpoint. Our allowance methodology has been a pretty rigorous process that clearly, over the last few quarters, has been enhanced and strengthened and we're very rigorous about sticking to that. The metrics all look very positive this quarter. We do anticipate some level of unevenness. But clearly, what we're seeing, absent any unexpected economic shocks, that the credit quality trends will continue to be favorable and -- but we're going to stick to our process. We're going to stay disciplined in the way we look at the credits and the way we look at the allowance methodology. Barb?","Barbara Godin","And Matt, as we think about the allowance as well, as we've been making progress and strides on putting on better quality credits and rolling off of those weaker credits that too has an impact, a positive impact against our allowance needs. And as it relates to what we expect for further quarters, the only guidance I would give you is just remember that for each of the last couple of years, in the third quarter, we see a seasonal bump. There's no reason I wouldn't anticipate that this year, albeit hoping it will be muted from prior years. But it will be clearly choppy as we have come out. And as Grayson said, we are going to follow what the economy does.","O. B. Grayson Hall","And, Matt, if you look at the most problematic segment of our portfolio, it's been the investor commercial real estate, down 32% over a year ago. We ended the quarter at roughly $10.1 billion but if you get a little more granular into that portfolio, you'll see that construction's down over 50% and that portfolio is now slightly under $1 billion, $955 million. You look at some of the more problematic groups, the land, the single-family and condominium, down 40% year-over-year and all of those components, land's down slightly under $800 million; single family is about $800 million; and condo's down to $130 million. So as you look at the makeup and composition of that $10.1 billion, it continues to be a stronger story.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies & Company.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I want to ask a quick couple of question on the expense side. David, can you breakout for us what part of the salaries increase was related to pension cost that will stick around for the year versus the FICA and stock option stuff that will tail off?","David J. Turner","Yes. Let me answer in maybe a different way than you asked it. If you look at the expense run rate from the first quarter and you try to figure out what is kind of the seasonal component, there's $35 million to $40 million of that number that you would not expect to recur going forward. So you can put that in your model and that will get you an approximation on where -- the question you just asked.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay and my follow up on that is then also, your credit related expenses were really nicely lower and I just wanted to ask you to kind of walk us through some color on that. And also, have we now -- in that line, also now gotten back to a nicely lower run rate? Or could that still be lumpy and episodic?","Barbara Godin","Ken it's Barb Godin. I'll answer that question. As it relates to what we're seeing in our OREO expense, there's less write-downs that we're taking due to appraised values coming in. We're seeing some bottoming in some of our markets. In fact, in the handful of markets, we're actually starting to see some rates starting to move in the opposite direction. And beyond that, we've simply just not put as much into our OREO portfolio. So therefore, overall expenses have tailed down nicely. And again, we'd anticipate that they should, absent any large moves to OREO, should stay low.","David J. Turner","I would add that we did have some gains in the transactions related to held for sale and that's a function of our aggressive write-downs we take. The market, as Barb mentioned, in some cases is recovering. And we're seeing quite a few buyers coming to the market looking for these assets. So that's helped bolster prices. Get a little concerned to try to give you too much guidance as to where that could go in the future. I think we need to be careful that we don't get ahead of ourselves trying to predict that. So that's one of the uneven things that we want to continue to watch. But our OREO and held for sale portfolios have now gotten down to a relatively small level. And so, the volatility with that shouldn't be that great.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one just quick final one. Just coming back to the NII story, I just want to understand that first to second with average earning assets, you got rid of the $3.5 billion of TARP and you've raised the $900 million, that's a net reduction of $2.5 billion or so. So do we still have a step down to come just from balance sheet side before we then see the second half growth?","David J. Turner","Well, I think averaging can mislead you a little bit, that's why we put into the prepared comments that our ending earning assets are actually up 2%. So I think you ought to look at that as maybe a better indicator of where things could trend.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right that TARP was after the quarter end.","David J. Turner","That's right. And so, we have the money sitting in at Federal Reserve and that...","O. B. Grayson Hall","At quarter end.","David J. Turner","At quarter end so we utilized our excess cash at the Fed to make that repayment.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Couple questions. One is on the liquidity pool and the opportunity to redeploy that into securities and loans. If you could put into effect all the excess liquidity that you hold today into the weighted average portfolio that you've got in securities and loans. What's your estimate as to how much that would improve the NIM?","David J. Turner","Betsy, I think if you looked in kind of round terms, you're talking about a 13-basis point reduction due to that excess liquidity. Now getting back to Ken's point, we utilized some that excess cash post quarter end so our excess cash is now closer to the $2 billion, $2.5 billion range today. And we would look to continue to deploy our excess cash in the most meaningful way. We also would rather deploy our balance sheet into loans, more so than we have in the investment portfolio. That grew close to $2.5 billion and we'd much rather put it into loans but we want to put it into loans that have the right risk profile and are properly priced. So we are continuing to look for those opportunities and what you'll see over time is that we will have more aggressive plays on our balance sheet now that we have our ratings upgrade. In particular, looking at our investment portfolio, just an example is our deployment of $1 billion this past quarter into the corporate bond portfolio. It takes a little more credit risk. It helps us to meet the extension risk that we have in the investment portfolio from rising grades. And those things over time, will help us from an NII and end resulting NIM.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then separately, I hear the improvements in credit and then I also hear your prepared remarks, comments about volatility and expect some lumpiness or bumpiness. Is that lumpiness or bumpiness that you're expecting really because you need to say that just for legal reasons? You're obviously -- it's unsure 100% is what's going to happen because the trajectory looks like things are obviously getting better on the credit side.","O. B. Grayson Hall","I think that clearly, when you look at the first quarter, we had some very strong improvement in our credit metrics. I think that we've been in this cycle so long. We're going to always be -- if we're going to err, it's going to be to the side of caution and we do -- we do spend a lot of time stress testing our portfolio and forecasting what we believe the future to be. But we tend to always sort of anticipate that it could be somewhat uneven or bumpy as you would call. And Barb, you may want to add to that?","Barbara Godin","Betsy, as well if you think about last year, a year ago, I would just point everyone to that where we all felt the economy was moving in the right direction or better direction. And of course then we have Europe that happened and then next [ph] global that followed that. So again, we're simply being very cautious as to how we think about the economy. We would still say it will be in a fragile state.","David J. Turner","I'll add one thing to it. If you look at criticized and classified levels, those are clearly coming down. We think that's one of the best places, first places that you look in terms of assessing credit quality, and those are coming down. We'll be disclosing our potential problem loan number, which is the inflow of numbers that we've talked about before in the $350 million to $400 million range. So that is a -- we believe showing that -- an improvement. So I think that we want to be careful with regards to the provisioning. Did I say the range is $350 million to $450 million...","O. B. Grayson Hall","You said $350 million to $400 million.","David J. Turner","I'm sorry. $350 million to $450 million would be our range of potential problem loans.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right, which that's lower than what you had a couple of quarters or so ago?","David J. Turner","That's right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Going back to the credit quality again. What do you say in -- I know, we know you have a lot of exposure to Florida and other parts of the South and we've been hearing that the South is probably less competitive on loan growth and pricing than other regions of the country. Now, you might not see that, being in that region but how would you talk about the competitiveness? And then also on the follow-up, is where is most of the good asset quality improvement coming from? Is it coming from the state of Florida or other regions that you service?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, I'll try to answer that question in a couple different directions. I'd say one, from a competitive standpoint, obviously, we're operating in 16 states, predominantly in the Southeast. But I'd say, what we've seen is some pretty strong competition. And I would say most of that competition has been around pricing, not so much on covenants, but certainly, you've seen some pricing competition as there's been a strong effort from all of our competitors to try to grow loans prudently. So we are seeing that. I would tell you, when you look at the business side of our balance sheet, most of that growth has been in the commercial industrial lending, predominantly in the upper end of that --of the middle market. And I would say specifically, where we've seen our most success is in what we call specialized industries, which has been asset-based lending in health care and energy in particular. We've seen strong growth in those segments and -- but I would tell you, that's been sort of broad-based across the footprint. Florida has never particularly been a strong commercial industrial state but we are seeing some improving signs in the state of Florida. I would tell you most of the borrowings tend to be around CapEx. There's a lot of investment in technology and in equipment that we're financing at this point in time. I'll tell you on the consumer side, we're still seeing, as David mentioned earlier, we're seeing very strong growth on the residential mortgage segment. We had about $1.6 billion in production in the first quarter, $200 million of that was in a HARP 2 segment and about 60% was refinancing. Our refinance and new home purchase is running about 60-40. We are seeing even stronger pipelines in both consumer and business in the early part of the second quarter. Auto, indirect auto lending continues to be strong with us -- for us, I would tell you that obviously, pricing has gotten more competitive in that segment as well, but we're still pleased with the spreads that we're seeing.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And you say -- and you're also -- you talked a little bit about on the mortgage side, on the purchase side. You're seeing an increase in purchase throughout your footprint or just in specific states?","O. B. Grayson Hall","It varies by state. Obviously, purchase has been a more dominant -- more dominant in states like Florida. We've had a stronger purchase percentage out of Florida just because of the inability for many of those mortgage holders to execute or refinance. Obviously, HARP 2 has changed that to some degree and our application volume for the first quarter, applications for HARP 2 is about 20% of total volume. We think it will be stronger than that for the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, just thinking about aggregate period end loan growth here relative to the negative 5%-ish range here there the first quarter. I'm just wondering, how do you think this will trend? How quickly will this recover? And do you think residential mortgage is going to play a larger role in your aggregate loan growth, just given unattractive returns really in a lot of other earning asset classes and also, some weak demand in some of your core lending segments.","O. B. Grayson Hall","You got -- I would tell you that the sort of way we look at our loan growth is you'd look that first quarter obviously, as David mentioned a moment ago, you need to look a little beyond period-to-period averages and look at ending balances. We actually were a little stronger on ending balances than the averages would tend to -- indicate. We do anticipate that we'll continue to see growth in the segments I've previously mentioned. But that -- and we'll see a more moderate decline in commercial real estate over the year. Commercial real estate was down about $600 million period-to-period, which is a more moderate decline than we've seen previously. We think there's still some moderation in that. But it's still declining. We do think that from start to finish, that our loans outstanding will be fairly stable but you'll continue to see modest runoff in the first half of the year and modest growth in the second half of the year.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And how has your appetite changed for  retaining conforming mortgages at this point?","O. B. Grayson Hall","We really haven't had much of an appetite for that. We've had -- we've retained very little of our production. Mostly what we're retaining is the adjustable rate mortgages as well as jumbo mortgages, which has been a relatively small percentage of our production. And at this point, we don't see that changing. We continue to evaluate it from quarter-to-quarter, and we're pretty rigorous about that evaluation and at this point in time, we still are holding on that strategy. David, do you want to speak there?","David J. Turner","Yes, we continue to look at that because we know that's where we're different than our peers. We can't come up with a compelling argument for us to keep those mortgages, primarily, the 15-year product that we normally would retain. But the spreads we can make, in terms of selling it -- selling the production versus putting it on our books and having what we think would be long-dated, pretty long-dated loans that we can take a proxy [ph] risk in the investment portfolio for that and have a better liquidity profile for that to be prepared for the loan growth that we really want to put on the books. So we'll continue to look at it, but we don't see that we would change that in the near term.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Erika Penala of Bank of America.","Erika Penala","My first question is a follow-up to Ken's. I just wanted to make sure I understood it correctly. David, are we looking at about an $875 million quarterly starting point for the expense run rate and the main message in terms of PPI improvement if you could keep it stable at that level?","David J. Turner","Well, what I said was if you take the existing expense number and back off $35 million to $40 million of that, that is -- $35 million or $40 million in that first quarter that should not repeat. We do believe for the year, which is consistent with our previous guidance that our expenses should be down from 2011. And of course, that's adjusting 2011 for the goodwill impairment and we're sticking to that.","Erika Penala","Got it. And with regard to your comments on the margin, do you expect loan yield compression of about 6 basis points that you saw this quarter to moderate? Or is the margin expansion for the remaining of the year really a function of savings that you could extract from your funding base and also lower cash balances next quarter related to using some of that to pay back TARP?","David J. Turner","Our guidance that we're giving you relative to NII and NIM takes all that into consideration including other hedges that we have on the books that will expire this year. So all in, we believe we're going to continue to have improvement in the margin. I think the -- we saw the change of 6 basis points. We don't see that necessarily repeating given the nature of how that unwinds in the first quarter, so you shouldn't extrapolate that.","Erika Penala","Got it. And my last question is on the home equity portfolio. I'm sure you saw larger banks this quarter report an increase in MPLs due to a change in the accounting methodology with regards to classifying a performing first if they're behind -- performing second if they're behind a problem first. Barb, have you complied with this or reserved for this?","Barbara Godin","Erika, in fact, we've had a look not only at our own portfolio but what we service and in total, that number is roughly $3.7 million of our home equity that we would need to have been to non-accruals that would happen this quarter. We've also taken that as a proxy and used that to look at the rest of the portfolio. So our anticipation is that there would be an incremental monthly $10 million that could also happen coming from where others have the first, and we are holding the second mortgage. So all in, I would say a relatively immaterial number.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","We've spent a little time talking about expense side of things. I'd like to get a little additional color on the fee revenue outlook for Regions. You've made a couple comments about HARP helping out the mortgage side of the business for at least the next quarter or 2. I'm curious as to where else you might see benefits in terms of fee revenues in the second quarter and third quarter. And within that, can you provide any additional color on what -- on the ongoing relationship with Raymond James at this point following the sale of Morgan Keegan?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Okay. Let me try to answer your questions. First of all, I think from a fee revenue standpoint, in terms of Non-interest revenues, clearly, the first quarter benefited from a very strong level of production in our mortgage group. We do not see that abating. That continues early into the first quarter. Our pipelines and our applications that we're receiving to date would not indicate that that's abating anytime soon. So we would anticipate a continuous strong quarter in that regard. On the consumer side, as we've mentioned before, the consumer checking account, we've really been in a transition for several months of migrating our consumer checking account base from basically a free checking offering to more of a fee eligible offering with hurdles around balances and transaction types and we've successfully sort of bridged that transition and starting to see good results from that regard. We also introduced a number of products into our consumer offerings, prepaid cards and some money transfer types of activities and check cashing kind of activities that have augmented our service charges. We continue to introduce products into the consumer suite that will generate some level of revenue, but that are meeting very legitimate customer needs and trying to grow the consumer side of the portfolio. I'd also mention, since we acquired our credit card portfolio, we're generating a pretty strong interchange revenue off of that portfolio, as well as we continue to see growth in the debit card transactions. We've seen year-over-year growth in debit card in spite of all the changes that have been made to that product. So we have said that we think over time, we can mitigate the impact of the revenue challenges we have on NIR. And so far, our results are tracking on target to a little better than target.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And if I could, just a follow-up on that specific subject. Are you assuming that the Q1 number for your capital markets revenues are basically the peak for the year and that they would begin to come down, similar to the trend that you saw last year?","O. B. Grayson Hall","We are not -- we, at the capital markets group, I think, had a good first quarter. But we actually are encouraged about what we think might happen through the rest of the year. And I do think that you mentioned earlier, the continuing relationship with Raymond James, they continue to be a good customer of ours, as well as a partner on a number of fronts. And so, we are hopeful that, that turns into business for us later in the year.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And if I can, one final question on asset quality. You've mentioned several times, you expect asset or credit trends to continue to improve, perhaps not in a straight line. I guess I'm just curious about how you're thinking about where ultimately reserves would be, would fall out relative to the loan portfolio? You're looking somewhere in the 2% to 2.5% range or possibly even lower?","David J. Turner","Well, this is David. We continue to monitor closely, credit. We have to all acknowledge that we're still in an unusual environment in the world economy. And we try to assess where reserves really end up. I think we would all agree that reserves are going to be higher than before we entered the crisis. And so, if entering in the crisis, you were in the 1.25 to 1.50 range, you're probably in that 1.50 to 2 range, and that's the best guess we have right now. We need to wait and see how this thing pans out. But I would think -- I know that's a wide margin, 1.50 to 2, but that's probably the best guidance that we would give you. And the question is in what time period -- we're at 3.3% today and what time period would that shift down? And that's a harder thing to answer because of the unevenness with regard to the economic recovery. So in time, I think we can get down to those levels.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Nomura.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I guess just one definitional one. I mean, so when we think about PPNR having bottomed here, is it as simple as just kind of making the expense adjustments you talked about, $35 million to $40 million and the $13 million subsidiary dividend, and looking out to 2Q, there is a PPNR base that is $50 million higher or so or is there anything else that we should adjust for in the same kind of seasonal element that would either bring it back down or push it back up in terms of looking for a run rate as opposed to guidance?","David J. Turner","Yes. I think if you look at the first quarter, that certainly is your starting point with the expenses we talked about. But you need to be thinking about our deployment of our balance sheet in a more meaningful manner, including our excess cash to work, getting our investment portfolio to work, being able to participate in loan syndications now that we have our ratings back that we hadn't had before. All those help drive earning asset growth. And so, I think there's something in -- there should be more than just taking out those expenses that help drive improvements and overall PPNR.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Having the investment credit rating back and having what I said [ph], a better position of strength from a capital perspective will allow our commercial bankers to compete more effectively in this market.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then as I think about that maybe as part of the loan outlook, I know you don't break out run off versus core [ph] loans that way than some of your peers do. But if the assumption that loans will inflect this year, I guess is a prerequisite of that just that the run off headwinds will slow or does the core loan origination run rate actually need to accelerate from the current levels in order to get to growth in the back half of the year?","David J. Turner","Well, I think as we talked earlier, we are experiencing pretty good growth in our C&I book and our pipelines remain strong. We're very encouraged there. We do have headwinds, which are continuing a moderation of a decline in Investor real estate. So that will slow some, but still decline and we still have the consumer that's deleveraging. In particular, our home equity line of credit book that continues to attrite [ph] because of this refinanced and or deleveraging that's occurring. It also is -- what impacts us versus our peers, is our decision not to retain the resident mortgages originations on our books versus selling them into the markets. So as we mentioned earlier, we think, if you look at the beginning of the year loan portfolio and you look at the end of the year, you're going to be about flat year-over-year. We're down about 1% end-to-end this first quarter and we'll see a little bit of attrition. But the back half, we expect the growth will take over that and get on the run rate in the second half leading into 2013.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And I guess just a last one, I know TruPS isn't a huge number for you but can you remind us what you're thinking in terms of timing and also, would those be expected to be something that would be just, cash on hand would take those out or should we build in some kind of replacement debt cost?","David J. Turner","Well, we continue to look at that. We have 2 issues, a roughly $500 million issue at 6.6% and then we have a $350 million issue at 8.8%. We have put ourselves in position to be able to deal with either one of those. 8.8% is the more likely candidate given where our credit spreads are and I think that if -- a caller earlier had mentioned about our credit spreads. If our credit spreads tighten like we think they will over time, or hope that they will over time, then that gives us even better opportunity to either take them out from a cash standpoint and or replace them with cheaper debt. We still have to maintain our policy of cash at the holding company, which is 2 years worth of cash to take care of all debt service and dividends and so forth. And we're over that policy today, we will continue to maintain that, which if we took out that piece, would put us, depending on how things trend this year, could put us in the market. But for $350 million, we might be able to take it out for cash. We'll have to wait and see.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kevin Fitzsimmons of Sandler O'Neill.","Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just a quick question on the service charges. You mentioned how there's been a big impact over time from the regulatory hurdles, and you've made changes to offset that. Is there any additional hit to expect from, for instance, sequencing change for overdrafts or is that already complete? If you could just comment on that.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Kevin, we -- if you have to, when you look at the service charge revenue streams that we have, the revenue stream for overdrafts and insufficient funds, I think is the revenue stream that continues to be some level of debate over in the industry and part of that debate is around posting sequence and part of it is about funds availability and also parts of it is about sort of different institutions stances on waivers and refunds regarding the NSS. That revenue stream continues to decline for us and we anticipate that it will still continue to decline for some time to come. And we're repricing our products and readjusting our business model on existing products and addition of new products to offset that. We do still have -- we do anticipate that there will be rule changes -- further rule changes regarding this process that we'll adapt to and adjust to. But I think it's premature to speculate as to what those might be.","Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And Grayson, and one -- just a follow up. You mentioned a few minutes ago about some of the additional products on the consumer side like money transfer and check-cashing activities and that there's a real need for that. You made that point and are those kind of opportunities that you run by the Consumer Finance Bureau just to make sure there's no trouble with that down the line or are we just way early on that front to be thinking about that?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I think that we're way early. Obviously, we've had a lot of conversations with our supervisors, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But those conversations are confidential and I would tell you that we try to go through a risk assessment on all the products that we introduce. We try to make sure that they're fair and responsible, that they're treating customers fairly. I think those are all objectives that all of our supervisors agree with. But I do anticipate changes in this space and it's just too early. From my vantage point, it's just too early to call.","Operator","Your final question is from the line of John Pancari of Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Barb, you had indicated that you expect OREO expenses to stay low through the year here. I just want to clarify that. Do you still expect further decline and you're just being conservative there? And I guess I have a similar question on the related credit cost throughout the expense base beyond the OREO expenses. Do you also expect continued declines through the year and into '13?","Barbara Godin","Yes. And John, as long as we're looking at what's happening with real estate values and prices, that's where I'm basing my remarks. That is that we have seen, as I've mentioned earlier, some of our markets stabilize. Some of the markets start to improve a little and of course, that directly impacts our OREO expense and cost. So as we see those things getting better throughout the year, hopefully, we won't be taking as many marks and our expense will be lower throughout the year. But again, depending on the economy.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So what is your -- would you say is your total environmental cost in your expense base that could come out as of today? I believe it was north of $800 million a few quarters back. So I wanted to see what -- how do you quantify that total amount as of today?","David J. Turner","John, that number had been in the $300 million range. I'm not -- we might be talking about something different on your $800 million. That's $300 million. We said over time, 3 quarters of that would come out as just -- when it comes out is based on improvements in the economy. Clearly, we have seen that in the first quarter. And we think that, that continue -- those costs will continue to abate. It's not just OREO and held for sale cost but it's all the people that we have that manage problem assets for us as well in terms of where we deploy them. And today, it's in dealing with problem assets to market to be elsewhere in the organization to help serve customers.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. I might have included some of the legal expenses in my number then. Then separately, in terms of securities, can you just give us what the durations were of the securities you put on during the quarter and what the yields were approximating?","David J. Turner","Well, we had been -- our duration had been 2.5 years. Today, it's probably closer to 3. We put some corporate debt on the books, not a lot, about $1 billion this past quarter. And that duration's in the 4- to 5-year range, which is what drove that duration. But we like that asset class relative to the mortgage-backed securities given the volume that we had there.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And the average yields that are put on that?","David J. Turner","John, somewhere in the 3.25 range versus 2.50 range that we put on mortgage-backed.","Operator","I will turn the call back to Mr. Hall for any closing remarks.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Just again, let me thank everyone for your time and attention today. We certainly appreciate your interest in Regions and we look forward to next quarter's call. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

And welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name is Shelby, and I'll be your operator for today's call [Operator Instructions].","I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions' third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. John Turner will provide highlights of our financial performance and David Turner, will take you through an overview of the quarter. Earnings related documents, including forward-looking statements, are available under the Investor Relations section of our Web site. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the Q&A segment of today's call.","With that, I will now turn the call over to John.","John Turner","Thank you, Dana. And thank you all for joining our call today. This morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $385 million, a 9% increase over the third quarter of last year, resulting in earnings per share of $0.39, an increase of 22% over the prior-year.","This quarter, we also delivered the highest pre-tax pre-provision income that we produced in nearly a decade, while generating 3% adjusted positive operating leverage year-to-date. All-in-all, despite lower interest rates and significant market volatility, it was a very solid quarter.","Over the last two years, our core messaging has reflected our intention to generate consistent and sustainable long-term performance through all phases of the economic cycle. We've been planning for the time when we would no longer benefit from a rising rate environment, and when credit would begin to normalize.","Since late 2017, we began taking incremental actions to reduce our interest rate risk, build a stronger and more resilient balance sheet and improve returns on capital. We executed a robust hedging strategy that will protect us in a declining rate environment, and allows us to maintain a healthy and stable margin without having to stretch for loan growth.","With respect to credit, our team has spent the better part of the last 10 years fundamentally changing and improving our credit risk management framework. Today, we have a robust and dynamic process, sitting on appropriate concentration risk, sound underwriting, rigorous client servicing and early identification of potential problems.","We've also intensified our focus on risk adjusted returns and appropriate capital allocation, balance sheet optimization, derisking, and repositioning. Just as important we launched our continuous improvement initiative called, Simplify and Grow, focusing on our desire to make banking easier for our customers and associates, accelerating revenue growth and driving efficiency and effectiveness.","We've already benefited significantly from these efforts and we have much more to do. We have completed 16 of 67 initiatives, and expect to complete seven more by year-end. These efforts have allowed us to make significant investments in technology to better serve our customers and we're seeing the benefits of those investments.","For example, through our digital platform, year-to-date checking and credit card production have increased 24% and 91%, respectively. Loan applications have increased 55% and with mortgage in particular approximately 60% of all applications are completed online. Mobile deposits have increased 60%, now represent 13% of all deposits. These efforts are paying off and positively impacting the performance of our businesses.","Simplify and Grow has allowed us to make investments in talent, improve services and capabilities and in our markets, all while prudently managing our expense base, and these investments are also paying off. We continue to grow consumer checking accounts and households, as well as wealth assets under management. We're also succeeding in our priority growth markets, Atlanta, Houston, Orlando and St. Louis. Consumer deposits and checking accounts in these markets are growing more than two times faster than the consumer bank average.","Similarly, Corporate Bank revenue and loans are growing faster than the Corporate Bank average. Although, it's relatively early, we are very pleased with the performance of these markets as we are delivering results above our expectations.","With respect to the economy, our customers are still generally optimistic about their businesses. But they are becoming more cautious, given continued market volatility and uncertainty regarding trade and tariffs. Many are taking a wait and see approach when it comes to business investments. However, pipelines remain steady, good, but not great.","So in summary, we have a lot of positive momentum and feel good about how we're positioned. Our plan is to remain focused on the things we can control; meeting the needs of our customers with best-in-class service, while leveraging technology and making it easier for our customers to bank with us. We're also focused on the fundamentals of our business; generating positive operating leverage through disciplined expense management, while making prudent investment decisions. We're focused on soundness, profitability and growth and that order of priority. We believe our efforts will keep the company positioned to deliver consistent, sustainable results through every economic cycle.","Thank you for your time and attention this morning. I will now turn the call over to David.","David Turner","Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Adjusted average total loans decreased approximately 1%. Adjusted average consumer loans increased modestly, led by residential mortgage and indirect other consumer lending. Adjusted average business loans decreased 1% and were impacted by our continued focus on client selectivity and overall relationship profitability. Average business loans also reflected ","Average business loans also reflected lower line utilization and elevated paydown activity during the quarter, including increased capital markets activities.","We continue to focus on risk-adjusted returns and are not interested in pursuing nominal loan growth for short-term benefit. And as John noted, due in part to our hedging program, we are not pressured to stretch for growth. With that said, we continue to expect full-year adjusted average loan growth in the low to mid single-digits.","Turning to average deposits. Despite interest rate decreases on deposits and seasonal declines in public fund accounts, average deposits decreased less than 1% during the quarter, exhibiting the strength of our deposit franchise. So let's look at how this impacted net interest income and margin. Despite lower rates, net interest income was down just slightly compared to the second quarter and net interest margin declined only 1 basis point to 3.44%. Net interest margin and net interest income were negatively impacted by lower market interest rates and lower average loan balances, partially offset by declining deposit costs and the benefits of repositioning strategies in the investment portfolio that were executed in the second quarter.","Net interest income also benefited from one additional day in the quarter, which negatively impacted net interest margin. As expected, total deposit cost declined 4 basis points compared to the second quarter to 49 basis points and interest-bearing deposit cost declined 5 basis points to 77 basis points, one of the lowest in the industry.","The deposit beta associated with declining interest rates was 25% this quarter, and we expect to experience a deposit beta in the 25% to 30% range in the fourth quarter. In an effort to reduce net interest income sensitivity to long-term rates, we repositioned out of approximately $1.2 billion of mortgage-backed securities into prepayment protected securities this quarter. These reallocations reduced our exposure to mortgage-backed securities by approximately 7% and our related book premium by approximately 8%. We're also exploring additional opportunities to further reduce sensitivity to long-term rates. In fact, we added additional hedges subsequent to quarter-end that are intended to reduce the impact of lower long-term rates on 2020 loan originations.","Assuming two 25 basis point reductions in the Fed funds rate by year-end, we expect some near-term pressure on net interest income and net interest margin in the fourth quarter, which we can partially mitigate through reductions in deposit costs. Net interest margin is expected to move in the high 330s in the fourth quarter. However, we expect the first quarter margin to expand into the low 340s, as the benefits of our hedging strategy began.","Now let's take a look at fee revenue and expenses. We delivered strong results this quarter with adjusted non-interest income increasing 9% compared to the second quarter, led by growth in service charges, wealth management and mortgage, as well as favorable market value adjustments on employee benefit assets. The increase in wealth management income includes a modest benefit from the recent acquisition of an institutional investment firm, Highland Associates.","Total mortgage income increased significantly, driven primarily by increasing hedging and valuation adjustments on residential mortgage servicing rights. Additionally, mortgage production and sales income also increased, consistent with elevated production, highlighting the benefit of our strategic focus and our decision to add mortgage loan originators earlier in the year. Partially offsetting these increases were declines in capital markets income and card and ATM fees.","The declining capital markets income was attributable primarily to decreases in M&A advisory services and loan syndication revenue. Customer swap income was also negatively impacted by CVA adjustments during the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect capital markets to finish this year on a strong note with fourth quarter revenue exceeding this quarter's reported results. The decline in card and ATM fees reflected the impact of favorable commercial interchange rebate adjustments recorded in the prior quarter that did not repeat. We continue to expect full year adjusted revenue growth of approximately 2%.","Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expense increased less than 1% compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by higher salaries and benefits, partially offset by decreases in professional fees and outside services. The increase in salaries and benefits was driven primarily by an increase in the market value on employee benefit assets, as well as higher production-based incentives, one additional weekday in the quarter and the addition of Highland Associates. These increases were partially offset by continued overall staffing reductions.","The decreases in professional fees and outside services were primarily due to lower legal costs, and our continued success in reducing overall third-party spends. The company's third quarter adjusted efficiency ratio decreased 90 basis points to 57.4%, and the effective tax rate was approximately 20.6%.","As John mentioned, we continue to benefit from our continuous improvement process, and several Simplify and Grow initiatives are exceeding our initial expectations. For example, at Investor Day, we committed to reducing our total square footage by 2.1 million square feet and our third-party spend by $60 million to $65 million by 2021.","We also told you we plan to consolidate 100 branches during the same period. We are proud to say that we are on track to exceed our targets in each of these areas, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to pull forward or expand on initiatives where we can. These efforts exhibit our commitment to achieving positive operating leverage. Based on our results through the first nine months and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we expect full year 2019 adjusted expenses to be relatively stable with 2018. With respect to our effective tax rate, we tightened full year 2019 range to 20% to 21%.","So let's shift to asset quality. Overall, credit results remained in line with our risk expectations during the quarter. We saw improvement in several categories, while experiencing some normalization in others. Net charge-offs were unchanged at 44 basis points, in line with our expected range of 40 basis points to 50 basis points for 2019. The allowance for loan losses amounted to 1.05% of total loans, and 188% of total non-accrual loans.","Non-performing loans decreased 13%, while delinquencies and total troubled debt restructured loans decreased 4% and 7%, respectively. Business services criticized loans increased 9%, driven primarily by increases in classified loans, partially offset by reductions in non-accrual and special mention loans. The largest increases to classified loans were attributable to energy, retail trade and manufacturing sectors.","As a reminder, our third quarter credit metrics also include the results of most recently completed Shared National Credit exam. Provision exceeded net charge-offs during the quarter, primarily due to these downgrades as we've begun to see some stress within the energy and tariff-related sectors. However, potential losses associated with these credits are expected to be modest and within our expectations. Moreover, we anticipate several will cure in full over the next few quarters.","Let me comment briefly on the CECL. In our second quarter 10-Q, we disclosed an expected increase in our allowance for credit losses of approximately $400 million to $600 million due to the implementation of CECL. As we get closer to adoption, we expect subsequent disclosures to include a tighter range of impact and will reflect evolving macroeconomic conditions and forecast, as well as any appropriate updates to loan composition and quality.","So let's take a look at capital and liquidity. During the quarter, the company repurchased 39.7 million shares of common stock for $589 million and declared $150 million in dividends. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio is estimated at 9.6%, in line with our target level of 9.5%. And we anticipate managing at this approximate level going forward. The loan deposit ratio at the end of the third quarter was 88%. And as of quarter end, we remain fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule.","Wrapping things up, in light of the challenging and changing economic backdrop, we are pleased with our third quarter financial results. We have a solid strategic plan, designed to deliver consistent and sustainable performance throughout any economic cycle.","With that, we're happy to take your questions. But do ask that each caller ask only one question to allow for more callers. We will open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. ","Ryan Nash","So I wanted to ask a handful of questions. Maybe just first on deposit costs. So we saw them come down nicely on the high-end of peers 25% to 30% decline next quarter. I just wanted to double check to make sure that's based on September and the potential for an October. And I guess, you know, you're one of the only banks we saw a top quartile performance on the way up. And now you're outperforming on the way down. So could you maybe just talk about what you're seeing about across both consumer and commercial and if Fed is to cut in October beyond a couple of times next year, is there further room to bring down deposit costs?","David Turner","Yes, Ryan, this is David. So we've talked an awful lot about how to manage net interest income and margin in changing rate environments and deposit costs being a key input is important to manage both. So let me start with consumer. We've done a really good job of adjusting our deposit cost while staying competitive in the markets we are competing in. And that's been a big driver of our deposit cost declining.","I think what you'll see going forward is probably more contribution coming from the commercial side they've done a pretty good job. A lot of those deposits are indexed, if you recall in the first quarter, we increased deposit cost because we had above average loan growth that we had to use deposits to fund that loan growth that's clearly subsided and we're looking at adjusting those deposit cost on the way down. So we have a beta of 25% to 30% that we are giving you guidance for and we think that will apply to the two rate -- potential rate cuts that we see for the remainder of the year.","Ryan Nash","And then if I could follow-up on expenses. I mean clearly the revenue environment has been challenging, you guys are doing a better job than others to defend the margin. David, you talked about completing 16 of 67 initiatives for Simplify and Grow and you're going have a handful more done before the end of the year, and you talked about upside some of the areas that the three big areas that you're saving on cost. So as you think ahead, you're clearly holding cost stable this year, but are there enough levers for you to continue to invest in things like technology and grow the business and continue to hold expenses flat beyond 2019? Thanks.","David Turner","So I won't comment quite on '20, yet. But the way we think about it is, we are continuing to make investments in talent, mortgage loan originators, commercial ORMs, wealth advisors. We've continued to make investments in technology, 42% of our $625 million is spent on new things that we need to have to continue to make banking easier for our customers. We have to do that and we will continue to do that. But in order to make room for that and control costs, we have to get better at literally everything we do.","So John has asked all of us, all 20,000 people that work here, how do we get better at whatever we do tomorrow than we did yesterday, so that we can continue to make room for investments that we want to make. We have inflation in our expense base of about 2.5%. So we have to overcome that inflation plus the investments to be able to hold our cost relatively stable like we've done for the last couple of years.","We will continue to seek to hold our cost down and we have a goal of efficiency to get to the 55% range, we mentioned that at Investor Day. We were 57.4% today, obviously it's very challenging in a low rate environment, but we are not giving up. We're going to continue to seek becoming more efficient as we go forward. So there is still room to control -- control cost into 2020.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","I was wondering if you could just talk about kind of big picture, how you think about balancing, protecting the profitability ratios versus growing the balance sheet, you've been keeping deposits relatively stable, it's helping NIM, you're obviously seeing good growth in service charges. So there's some puts and takes. But talk about the trade-off between the focus to protect the profitability. But then also thinking about trying to grow the balance sheet?","John Turner","Yes, I think it is a great question. It is very much a balance. We are focused on building a business that's going to be consistently performing, that's going to be resilient, it's going to be sustainable. And that means we've got to build a balance sheet that it is resilient through every economic cycle. We've clearly traded-off some growth for quality and we'll continue to do that, Matt.","As we focus on, we think it's a period of time in the economic cycle, and we need to be thoughtful, careful, client selectivity is really important to us. Early identification of problems, exiting relationships that may become problematic, really important to our future. So we talk often about the importance of soundness first then profitability and growth last, we are not going to grow just to grow. We don't need nominal growth.","We think the balance sheet is positioned to deliver consistent and sustainable performance and the profitability that we believe will adequately reward our shareholders and that will continue to be our focus.","David Turner","I'll add, Matt. We do expect to grow, as we said we would grow low to mid single-digits in terms of loans for the year. We were up about 4.8% year-to-date on an adjusted basis. And so what we're saying is, we do expect to grow. We're just not going to force growth on the balance sheet to generate nominal revenue and nominal income if the return gets harmed.","Matt O'Connor","And I guess just following up, I mean, you obviously had really nice loan growth in the first half of the year, a little bit of run-off this quarter and I think one of your other portfolios might start to run-off by end of the year. It's as you kind of put all it together in the comments that you made, what's kind of a more medium term outlook in terms of -- grow loans. And then also just comment on deposits as well. Thank you.","John Turner","Well, with respect to loan growth, I think what we've said is that we anticipate growing low single-digits typically with the economy, plus a little in the markets that we operate in. We think that that's appropriate if you look at year-over-year business services loan growth has been about 7.5%. We do have some run-off portfolios in consumer in particular.","We've seen some declines in equity lending and indirect auto. We're capping our exposure to indirect unsecured lending, but we believe that our focus on continuing to build out the consumer business. At the same time, our commitment to business services lending particularly middle market commercial lending will drive an appropriate amount of loan growth and allow us to continue to grow the assets on the balance sheet.","And with respect to deposits, we're focused on core relationships. And when you look at our consumer business, we believe that 93% plus of our customers maintain their primary operating account with us. We're continuing to grow consumer checking accounts at a rate we think faster than most of our peers, consumer demand deposits and consumer low-cost deposits growing over time. Similarly, with a focus on small to medium-sized businesses, winning their operating business, we think we can still continue to grow low-cost deposits, which is really the core of our business and the strength of our franchise.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","David, could you talk a little bit about the balance sheet protection, a little bit more. Just reading in the deck, you added a little bit more on the hedging side to impact of lower long-term rates. So you said the program is largely completed, I guess, can you just help us understand the math of the magnitude of the step-up that helps get the NIM up as you look from fourth to first and then how that will cascade on its own throughout the year. Thanks.","David Turner","Yes. So I'll start Ken with the end in mind. We talked about the -- going into next year, we think our margin could increase into the low to mid-3.40 range. We have a chart with regards to our sensitivity our short-term sensitivity is taken close to zero. By the beginning of the year through all the hedges that kick in and starting, little bit in the fourth quarter, but primarily the first part of the year. What we want to do is we have more exposure on the long-end than a lot of our peers. So we wanted to kind of neutralize that a bit.","So we've entered into a couple of million dollar worth of hedges that would really be -- that kind of got tied in when the tenure was in the mid-low 170 range to help us from the long-end. And that's really manifests itself and reinvestment of cash flows that come off the business every month. So that's baked into the guidance that we're giving you. And we believe that we're not going to have a disproportionate correlation to the tenure relative to our peers after this.","Ken Usdin","And on the left side of the balance sheet, can you just discuss the MBS repositioning that you did and what premium was and how does this change that magnitude that you'd expect. Thanks, David.","David Turner","Yes. So premium amortization was relatively stable in the quarter about $28 million in the quarter. What we did is we took some low-yielding investment securities that we could sell, we took those, we repositioned those into longer, a little more duration, a little more carry to help us. Just again boost a little bit from an NII standpoint, but they were really lower yielding mortgage-backed securities that we sold and reinvested.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","So couple of questions. You know the background for the question just has to do with the longer-term outlook for ROTC which I know you put out at. I think it was like 15% to 18%, is that right at the Investor Day?","John Turner","Actually, 18% to 20%.","Betsy Graseck","Sorry 18% to 20%, yeah, 18% to 20%, sorry.","John Turner","Little different interest rate environment.","Betsy Graseck","So the question that I have is, how are you thinking about that, you know, when I'm looking at it, I'm hearing. Okay. You've got a lot more opportunity on the expense side and maybe that expense -- operating leverage improves as we go through the next couple of years. But then I'm also wondering about the capital side of the equation here and how you're thinking about that. I know you have your 9.5% target, but given the tailoring rule that came out and everything else that's been happening for banks in your sizes, 9.5% still the right number for you?","David Turner","Yes. So I'll start with your last question. We calculate the amount of capital we need to have based on our models. Not, it's not regulatory driven, and yes, we are encouraged by the tailoring relief that we have, but does not change one iota the amount of rigor that we put in the capital planning and management. We still have, every other year our CCAR submission. So for the time being, 9.5% was our target. We try to put that in our prepared comments to even though our math really says, we could get to 9%.","We've added 50 basis points of cushion to enable us to take advantage of opportunities should they arise. As the market uncertainty and the economic conditions continue to decline a bit. As it relates, and the 9.5% was going to allow us to get to the kind of returns we think are appropriate given the circumstances that we're under.","Now the 18% to 20% was, as John was saying in the middle of your question that we had, and that was very different interest rate environment, we all thought rates were going to go up this year and they're clearly are down and they are forecasted to be down through the period of time we have covered by that Investor Day. So getting to 18% to 20% would be very difficult to do without taking some unusual risk, which we will not do.","So we're going to come out and we'll update the exact targets for you later, but clearly, there has been some decline in terms of return expectations. I think that's what's our -- the stock prices in our industry have reflected. But exactly, where those will be, we need to get a little better handle where we think rates will go. We have two baked in for this year, there's probably another one coming in '20 as well. So more to come, Betsy.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","I wondered if you could talk a little bit more on the investments you're making in IT. I believe, you're currently evaluating, replacing your core deposit system and -- so I wonder if you can give us some details around that in terms of what's the timeframe around that type of project, what's the cost impact that we should be considering here, could it impact next year's numbers. And then, and then is there other systems -- are you looking at the core system on the loan side as well as or just the deposit system issue. Thank you.","John Turner","We just had our strategic planning offsite meeting with our Board, spend a lot of time talking about the topic and so I ask John Owen to address it.","John Owen","Yes, just to go back to Investor Day, we spend about $625 million a year on technology, have about 1600 plus technology professionals at the bank and every year in our strategic annual planning process, we go through about a three year to five year view and find out and we'll talk about what systems need to be upgraded, consolidated or replaced. And each year, there's about 15 systems that we identify that will need to go out and either upgrade or replace. So this is just a normal case of business from a cause of business today.","You mentioned some of the core systems around deposits. We are going to have an RFP that will go out in the first quarter for our deposit system. We will get those results back probably mid-year and we'll make a choice on what's the right platform for us. The timeframe for that, it's probably a three year to six year journey for this. What you'll find with us, when we do upgrades. We don't do very many big bang upgrades. This will be an incremental approach over a multi-year time period. So again this is a probably a four year to six year system exchange in this particular case.","But I would tell you, we do about 15 of these a year, this would be a larger one, of course, but again, to go back to our wealth platform, we did SCI a couple of years ago. We consolidated 14 systems into one. We're fortunate to operate on one consumer platform and we're in the point of implementing and seeing now at this point in time. So what I would tell you, it is large. We are in the RFP process, but this is nothing that we don't do 15 to 17 of every year.","John Turner","In our analysis John, we indicate that we can complete the work within the context of our current technology spend. So we don't see any outsized sort of allocation to expense associated with any of the core system changes.","John Pancari","And then one, I apologize, this is little bit off the radar a little bit, this question. But on Friday, you issued in 8-K that you're -- you announced that you're expanding your change of control provisions to -- an additional component of the management team beyond the C-suite executives. Can you give us just a little bit of color, what that relates to and how common is it that you're modifying your change of control.","David Turner","Yes, thank you for the question. I guess, we really did two things to -- both were intended to standardize, you can imagine with the truest announcement, there's a lot of concern about what our future is what our intentions are, a lot of questions about what may happen going forward. It caused us to look at our change of control agreements and because the bank was the combination of a lot of banks over a long period of time, what we quickly concluded was we had a fair amount of inconsistency in our agreements both with respect to change of control and severance.","And so we asked our Board to consider a change in the or modifications to both change of control and severance, to make them more consistent, so they apply to both an appropriate group and they applied similarly to that group. And so it simply was the housecleaning sort of initiative for us to get everything in order. No real, significant change for our shareholders or frankly for our associates. But it does create some consistency.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Given your outlook for continued low to mid-single-digit loan growth and clearly, you laid out a very specific path for net interest margin. Is it too optimistic to think that net interest income could be flat next year?","David Turner","Well, we don't want to give guidance yet on what next year is. We have -- still have things that we don't know about, what will the rate environment look like. Clearly, that puts pressure on growing net interest income, we do think that, we've talked a lot about being able to grow the balance sheet consistent with with GDP and then some, then a little. Now, we've also done a lot of capital recycling to make sure that we're getting good relationship business on the books. And so you've seen some pressure on absolute loan growth there. But we expect to grow, and our teams have that expectation. So we have that piece of it, we feel good about. Let's just see what the rate profit gives us going into next year. Lower rates obviously put some pressure on us.","Erika Najarian","And as I think about your earlier response is clearly the ROTC range is potentially out of reach with given the interest rate outlook, but you did say you're not giving up on 55%. And as we think about the context of revenue challenges and potentially on that because of REITs and fees potentially peaking this year. I guess is there room for expenses on an absolute basis to actually be down if you get to continued efficiency improvement?","David Turner","Well, so our commitment has been and continues to be generating positive operating leverage in any environment. So we are seeking to grow revenue faster than the expenses. So where revenue continues to be challenge, we will continue to work even harder on expense management, feel that we can do that. So I think that clearly revenue is going to be challenged, kind of back to the last part, the last question is revenue will be challenged because 65% of our revenue comes from spread, and we had higher rates in the first half of the year versus the back half. And so on a comp '19 to '20, it would be very hard to grow revenue in that at least NII. So loan growth, will help us there a bit.","We'll see what the rate environment is, but we have good NIR, we have good investments that we've made, we expect that to continue to grow and as we just talked through our continuous improvement program to help and control expenses, we believe will generate positive operating leverage and continue to work our efficiency ratio down at the same time.","Erika Najarian","And I just want to be clear, even in an environment that you mentioned where it's very hard to grow revenue, Regions is still committed to deliver positive operating leverage.","David Turner","That's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS.","Saul Martinez","Couple of questions. First, more of a clarification, with the 25% to 30% deposit beta in the fourth quarter. Is that what's the denominator on that, is that on two cuts and hence it's a 12 basis point to 15 basis point reduction in deposit cost, it's not. I am just trying to make sure it's not on an average, the average fed funds rate because obviously you had July and September cut that's fully in the fourth quarter. I just want to make sure I understand the numerator and the denominator there.","David Turner","So it's based on two rate cuts that are baked in in October and December right now.","Saul Martinez","So it would be at the 12 basis point to 15 basis point reduction.","David Turner","Round numbers, that's right.","Saul Martinez","I guess more important question on loan growth, I hear what you're saying that under over the long run -- under normal conditions, you can grow your balance sheet in line with C&I -- and hopefully then some. But if I look at your loan growth this quarter period end it up I think 1% year-on-year.","Going forward, do you have indirect vehicles rolling off to maybe a few hundred a quarter, you have GreenSky as a headwind. Home equity is still a little bit of a headwind, your CRE book isn't really growing. It's contracting. I think on mortgage owner occupied, how, I mean, I'm struggling with how you get loan growth and interest earning asset growth next year. Can you just help me understand where you see the offsets, where -- I know you're not giving guidance for 2020. But how do I think about it conceptually, given you have pretty material headwinds from in multiple loan lines.","David Turner","So yes, there is a lot of stories inside the loan book. Let's kind of start at the top. So our big driver of loan growth has traditionally been our C&I book. Those can be lumpy from time to time. It depends on access to capital markets. It depends on line utilization, and you've seen some of that happen in this year. I mean it's, we had a lot of growth in the first quarter and no growth in the second, in the third quarter. We feel good about our pipelines, we feel good about our conversations. We're having with our -- with our clients, they are cautious, there're optimistic but they're watching this uncertainty with regards to trade and tariffs clearly put some pressure and downward sentiment in terms of wanting to make the next dollar fixed capital investment.","But that being said, we still think there is going to be some growth there from an investor real estate standpoint we've probably have the second-lowest concentration of investor real estate of our peers, we have some opportunities there. We are being very careful and selective with clients. So from time to time, you'll see that move up and then pay-offs will move it back down, but I think investor real estate is an opportunity.","Resi-mortgage continues to be an opportunity. We had a little bit of growth this quarter, production was up. About a third of that was refinanced and two-thirds of it was purchased. And we keep about almost half of what we, what we produce. So I think that'll be a plus in our direct consumer, we think it's going to be a plus. We making investments in unsecured even though GreenSky is running off, we have other avenues. I think John mentioned, we're going to cap unsecured, but we continue to see opportunities for a little bit of growth there.","Now home equity has been on -- quite a bit of decline over time, and we think that that will slow down a bit. So I think that when you and you had mentioned indirect vehicles being down. Those are really the key drivers. Again, we're not looking for a lot of loan growth, but I think, we'll have solid loan growth that will be profitable for the Company.","Saul Martinez","Can you remind the GreenSky is roughly $2 billion. And can you remind -- I believe and how quickly does it. What's the average, the weighted average life of that?","David Turner","It's about $1.9 billion actually. It has little low right at two years in terms of duration. There will be pieces of this at linear for a while, but the bulk of that's two year.","David Turner","And Saul while it's -- begins to run off. We've modestly increased our commitment to so far to grow that portfolio and we are investing in our own unsecured lending capabilities and we believe that we can match the timing of the run-off and the increase and so far with unsecured lending capabilities, all of which should help us on the consumer side in addition to growing mortgage, yearly bank card and growing direct lending.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys share with us, we hear and you guys already touched on your technology spend. I think you had mentioned $625 million is what is expected to be expense this year. How can we as outsiders, we hear a lot of stories about the big banks taking market share from the smaller banks, how do you guys measure whether you're keeping -- I know the dollars you're spending, but how do you measure whether you're keeping up from a digital technological standpoint that you can remain competitive with the bigger banks. What are some of the metrics should we outsiders look to -- to determine whether you're keeping up with these bigger banks?","John Owen","Yes, just real quick on that, this is John Owen. Like I said earlier, we spend about $625 million, about 42% of that is based on new initiatives and new projects and looking forward into new things which digital would be a big part of that, about 48% is around how we maintain the bank, maintain systems and really, our infrastructure going forward. About 10% is on cyber risk.","The way we think about -- are we keeping up and keeping pace. We use a few external factors. Number one would be JD Powers -- JD Powers ranks all of the top 23 banks are on their list and they come out with a quarterly ranking and they rank everything from how we perform in the branch all the way through to our online banking and mobile banking. So that's a data point we use consistently. We are in the top quartile for branch and online, mobile moves between top quartile and second quartile. So again that's an area where we're trying to always keep that in the top quartile.","The other source should be Gallup. Gallup also gives us good insights from our customers on how we're performing in digital and areas where we need to advance. The other thing I would point to is just the rapid growth of our digital at the bank. Over the last three years, our digital logins to our online and mobile properties were up 90%. You heard John talk about earlier on digital sales. Our digital sales are up 90% year-over-year. In credit card, our digital sales and savings accounts were up 35% and checking accounts, about 24%. So we kind of look at it from a couple of factors, how do our external parties validate what we're doing and also our internal growth rates.","John Turner","Yes, I'll just add, Gerard. The other thing I look at it is, are we growing consumer checking accounts? Are we growing low cost deposits and who are our new customers? And roughly half of our new customers are under the age of 30. And so all of those things for me are indicators that we are in fact competing and having success, offering compelling technology to our customers.","Gerard Cassidy","And David, you talked a bit about the CECL increase, you mentioned, you guys put out the number in the second quarter Q. I think you said $400 million to $600 million, which if you compare that to your existing level of reserves over a 50% increase. Everybody can -- appears to be able to handle yourself included the day one impact that you just described, how can you frame out for us. If you can what the day two impacts are going to look like? Should we as outsiders assume that we're going to see loan loss provisions of similar increases to what the day one impact was for everybody, or how are you guys looking at that at this stage?","David Turner","I would not say that day two would be anything remotely close to day one. Day one just kind of level sets and we are -- we'll see what other peers are coming out and what their -- what their numbers are really is dependent on portfolios those with consumer or longer dated loans are going to have higher CECL charges than those that are business services oriented that have shorter-term duration of their loan books. Day two, you need to think about, you still have charge-offs that come through. You have to provide CECL reserves and provisioning on loan growth, those have a tendency to be somewhat higher than we have today. Under the incurred model and again, very dependent on what type of loans you're growing, so mix makes a big difference.","So if you're growing mortgages versus commercial real estate, mortgages are going to carry a higher provision than commercial real estate as odd as that sounds. And then the last key factor is what's the economic outlook, how is that changing from time to time and that's why we put in our prepared comments, we've given you $400 million to $600 million, but is really dependent on what it looks like December 31\/January 1, what do we think the -- the forecast looks like going forward. That makes a big difference in day two, when that change occurs things getting better or worse, you see in particular when they get worse or forecasted to get worse.","You can see much bigger provisions than you do other than in current model and that's what the standard was supposed to do. It was trying to have your reserve much quicker. And that's why we've talked about pro-cyclicality of the standards is as pro-cyclical as you can get because in a down rate cycle, you're going to be reserving more for loan growth, which is -- which causes one to be concerned about the cost and availability of credit in a downturn.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Foran of Autonomous.","Brian Foran","I guess I had a couple of questions on your slide appendix. First of all, thank you for this level of detail on the commercial loan portfolio or some of the key areas you're highlighting. It is quite a lot. I guess, as I look through Slide 14 or really maybe Slide 15 through Slide 17 because the energy you've talked about before. The restaurant, the retail, the manufacturing, transportation. How are you positioning this? Is this just being responsive to investor questions or are these areas you're actively concerned. Are there any sub portfolios where you seen opportunity to maybe take some market share. I guess how should I interpret all this detail why you're highlighting restaurant, retail, manufacturing and transportation?","Barbara Godin","Brian, this is Barb Godin. On that note, we do have some concerns in the restaurant portfolio that we seeing some softening in the restaurant portfolio. There's certainly been some softening in the energy portfolio, a little bit manufacturing, but by and large, we decided to be much more transparent providing you with information on our portfolios, so that -- all of you have an opportunity to look and say, look, we see what's in their portfolio, we feel good about their portfolio, we feel good about our portfolios and our ability to manage it and we just felt that now was the time to be, as I said, much more transparent, particularly as we go into with potentially looks like a credit cycle that will happen in the next couple of years.","Brian Foran","And then maybe in a similar vein on Slide 12. I mean, I almost hate to ask this, but it's always a little bit of a lightning rod for investors. The leverage loan balances certainly recognizing the $6 billion is a much bigger number than the standard definition of which would produce $2.5 billion, you highlight in the slides. But I think when you first gave this is about $5.5 billion. So why is it kind of crept up a little bit over the past six months to nine months, is that you participating more or is that just some credits tripping into your leverage definition. Why is the number gotten a little bigger?","Barbara Godin","We do have a number of credits that again based on the way we define it, will become leverage even though they started off as not leveraged. Additionally, we've got Ronnie Smith here, who runs that portfolio and I'm going to ask him to make a couple of comments on it.","Ronald Smith","Yes, just a couple of comments. And one of your responses is exactly on target. We had a couple of really long-term relationships publicly traded companies that had positive credit events that pushed it over into our definition of leverage lending and if you combine those two, it was just over $400 million. We feel good about those particular companies and we'll see at least one of those resolved within a very short period of time. The other will resolve given a little bit more intermediate period of time, but there is not really a focus on growing that portfolio, other than continuing to support our existing relationships where we can build broad and deep relationships outside of the lending transaction online.","John Turner","I'd just add we actually manage it as a concentration risk like we do every other part of our portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott.","Christopher Marinac","I wanted to ask further on the credit explanation that you just gave, should we see a higher level of total criticized than we do now or will that number kind of vary. I know you had the spec change driving a lot of this quarterly shifts?","Barbara Godin","Yes, it's Barb again. In the criticized portfolio on particular classified, I think is what you're pointing to which drove that number up. So let me first start with saying, despite all that, our credit metrics for the quarter were within our broader risk expectation. We experienced improvement in several areas. As you know, delinquencies were down 4%, TDRs down 7%, NPLs down 13%, and charge-offs were flat. So we feel good there. And as well as you mentioned, David, did our Shared National Credits were included.","And just to comment on the Shared National Credits, we weren't agent on any of those credits by the way. If I speak specifically to our classified loan category, I'm going to categorize what happened this quarter as follows, which is really over half of the increase came from five energy credits that moved into the category, but since quarter-end, one of these credits has totally resolved and the other three credits are to a large energy services customer, that's staying with us for well over 50 years and they have the proven ability to perform through the cycle.","So for energy in general, I'll make the comment that our book right now was only 13% oilfield services and we also have gone through and have stressed our price deck on which we both lend as well as service our accounts down to $39.20. And that's against today's price, last I looked this morning. It was about $54 a barrel, give or take. So based on all of this and we've done a lot of work, we believe our energy losses will stay somewhere within a really manageable range of about $30 million to $50 million over the next year, in addition to energy -- next three year, sorry.","In addition to energy, we also had some asset-based loans that we move to classified this quarter with all of them currently being well within their asset values. So as such, we anticipate minimal to no loss on those credits. And lastly, we also review the top 80% of credits that moved to our classified category this quarter and again based on this, we're comfortable both our loss range of 40 basis points to 50 basis points for this year and 40 basis points to 65 basis points over the next year based on a slowing economy.","So I would summarize by saying, we don't see what happened this quarter as being a systemic issue, we are where we're coming off a period of historically low numbers and as such, we believe that some increase was to be expected.","David Turner","I will add, Barbara. The 40 basis points to 65 basis points loss rate was over the next three years.","Barbara Godin","Three years. I'm sorry.","Christopher Marinac","Okay, great, that's helpful background. And again with the inclusion of the additional categories, does that imply that restaurants and ABL and others had deterioration in the quarter or again, you're just giving more transparency to those in general?","Barbara Godin","There is some marginal deterioration, but we're really are just trying to get much more transparency.","Operator","Your final question comes from Stephen Scouten of Sandler O'Neill.","Stephen Scouten","I just had a follow-up question maybe to Betsy's earlier question around the ROTCE guidance and kind of this -- maybe more specifically why that would move down, I just remember from your Investor Day, you guys had a pretty not negative, but maybe a muted view on the economy kind of where, GDP was going to go. Fed funds were roaring to a zero range policy and even the tenure, I think around $150 million. So granted a lot of what we're seeing today is kind of what you guys predicted. So I'm wondering, what specifically is driving the change in expectations relative to what you said that?","David Turner","I think, Steven, our expectation of the tenure was closer to 3%, than the $150 million. At the time we gave that out. So there are two things that drive return is the numerator and denominator and that denominator impact on lower rates is pretty tough. When you have falling rate environment, clearly, the fair value of the investment portfolio and therefore book value increases and it's the same thing on all the derivatives that that we've added the fair value of those have obviously increased putting pressure on the denominator. So that's a -- that's more meaningful than you might think.","When you go through the calculation from a net income standpoint, clearly, we had rate expectations and margin guidance that had been as high as 370, down to a low of 340. That's where we are. And so 18% to 20% wouldn't predicated on being at the low end of the range. So I think, if you look at our industry and you think of just good core commercial banking, at 20% return on capital can get -- you can get there when you have a rising rate environment margins are continuing to expand. We don't have that. We have low rates, a relatively flat yield curve and no -- at least the market saying, no real expectations for rates to change over the next couple of years.","So it's really hammering out net income growth and return through making good investments to grow in IR, watching expenses, keeping tabs on credit quality. And that's what we're doing. But it's, it's, you can't get to those type of returns in this environment, if it persist.","John Turner","Okay, since we have no further questions. So thank you all for your interest today. Appreciate it very much. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Paula and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.","List Underwood","Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. We appreciate your participation on our call today. Our presenters this morning are Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of management are present as well and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also, as part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","Finally, let me remind you that in this call and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking statement that is located in the appendix section of the presentation. Grayson?","Grayson Hall","Thank you, List and good morning everyone. We are pleased you could join us for today\u2019s call. Second quarter results reflect our continued momentum in 2015 as we reported earnings of $269 million, or $0.20 per diluted share. These results demonstrate we are successfully executing our strategic priorities.","In the second quarter, we experienced increases in metrics that we believe are fundamental to future income growth, including households, checking accounts, credit card accounts and Regions360 relationship. This growth has been broad-based geographically as all of our areas continued to expand and deepen relationships through our needs-based approach to relationship banking.","Total revenue was particularly strong as both net interest income and non-interest income grew. Benefiting net interest income was loan growth of 2% and production increases of 28% and our pipelines continued to expand. Business lending growth was achieved by all three businesses: commercial banking, corporate banking and real estate banking. Within real estate, real estate corporate banking and our REIT business growth was particularly strong. Commercial and corporate growth reflects the strength of our business model as local bankers\u2019 partner with industry and product specialists, particularly in Regions Business Capital, government institutional banking, healthcare and restaurant banking to grow our loan portfolio. We also had a strong quarter in consumer lending with growth in every loan category. Of note, the home equity portfolio balances increased for the first time in more than 6 years. Also, new point-of-sale loan product offerings drove additional growth in consumer lending.","Further, we continued to diversify non-interest income as most categories achieved growth in second quarter demonstrating that Regions360 and our investments are beginning to pay off. Adjusted non-interest revenue increased 7% from the previous quarter, reflecting growth in mortgage, capital markets and card and ATM fees in addition to deposit-related service charges. We continued to refine our retail network strategy as we identified certain parcels of undeveloped land that have been purchased for future branch expansion. We no longer intend to build on these sites, which resulted in additional expense in the second quarter. At the same time, our occupancy expenses declined due in part to branch consolidations executed in prior periods. This quarter also included some legal and regulatory-related matters that impacted earnings. First, we recorded a charge related to a contingent legal and regulatory item for previously disclosed matters. And second, we received an insurance recovery related to the settlement of a previously disclosed class action lawsuit.","During the quarter, asset quality was stable to improving. Net charge-offs, non-performing loans, troubled debt restructurings all declined. The provision for loan losses increased and exceeded net charge-offs. This increase was primarily attributable to loan growth and reflects the results of the recently completed Shared National Credit exam. We are continuing to monitor our energy portfolio and have experienced some downward risk rating migration. If oil prices remain at low levels for an extended period of time, additional migration is likely. We are however staying engaged with our customers and taking necessary actions as appropriate.","Before I turn it over to David, let me mention that we are extremely proud that we were the recipient of two prestigious honors this quarter. First, we were recognized by the Reputation Institute and the American Banker Magazine as having the highest reputation with our customers among U.S. banks. And second, we were honored by Gallup as one of the Best Places to Work. These honors provided strong evidence that our focus on building a culture based on our core values is resonating with our associates and with our customers. We are also focused on delivering strong financial results and equally important is how we obtain these results. The principle is central to fulfilling our mission of creating share value for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders.","With that, I will now turn it over to David who will cover the details for the second quarter.","David Turner","Thank you and good morning everyone. I will take you through the second quarter details and then wrap up with our expectations for the remainder of 2015. Loan balances totaled $80 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $1.9 billion or 2% from the previous quarter. Year-to-date, loans have increased $2.8 billion, or 4%. Business lending achieved solid growth as balances in this portfolio totaled $51 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 3%. Linked quarter production was strong, increasing 29%. Commercial and industrial loans grew $1.7 billion, or 5%. And as Grayson noted, all three businesses within business lending experienced growth. Also, line utilization increased 97 basis points and commitments increased 3%.","Consumer lending also had a strong quarter. Loans in this portfolio totaled $30 billion, an increase of 2% and production increased 24% linked quarter. Mortgage loan balances increased $171 million and production increased 26% linked quarter. Indirect lending for vehicles increased 2% as production increased 12% and other indirect lending increased $111 million linked quarter and was driven by new partnership that focuses primarily on home improvement retailers.","Now, looking at the credit card portfolio, balances increased 3% from the previous quarter and our penetration rate now stands at 16.4%, an increase of 80 basis points from last year. And finally, total home equity balances increased $45 million from the previous quarter as new production outpaced portfolio runoff in the second quarter.","Let\u2019s take a look at deposits. Supported by our multi-channel platform, average deposit balances totaled $97 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion during the second quarter. Deposit costs remained near historical low levels at 11 basis points, while total funding costs were 25 basis points in the quarter.","And let\u2019s look how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $839 million, an increase of 1% from the previous quarter. Driving this increase was an additional day in the quarter, higher loan balances and a decrease in the cost of wholesale borrowings. This was partially offset by the continued low rate environment and modest compression of spreads in the loan book. The net interest margin was primarily affected by pressure on asset yields, resulting in a 2 basis point margin decline to 3.16%.","Total non-interest income increased $120 million, which included $90 million related to insurance proceeds received in the second quarter related to a previously disclosed matter we accrued for in the fourth quarter of 2014. And this matter settled during the second quarter. Excluding this item, adjusted non-interest income was robust, increasing 7%, reflecting our investment in and commitment to diversifying and growing fee-based revenues.","Mortgage had a solid quarter as income increased 15%. Loan production volume and market valuation of mortgage servicing rights also improved. Capital markets was a significant contributor with a $7 million quarter-over-quarter increase in fees. This was primarily related to the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers, an increase in broker dealer revenue associated with corporate fixed income underwriting and the successful completion of our first M&A advisory engagement.","Card and ATM fees increased 6% as a result of increased debit and credit card usage as customer spending increased 7% and transactions increased 9% over the prior quarter. Commercial credit fee income increased from the previous quarter due to the reclassification from net interest income. This lowered net interest income by $3 million, and the future run rate of commercial credit free income should be approximately $20 million. And finally, service charges increased 4%.","Now let\u2019s move on to expenses, total reported expenses in the second quarter were $934 million, which included two charges totaling $75 million. First, as Grayson mentioned, we transferred some properties originally purchased for future branch sites to held for sale and incurred a $27 million write-down. Second, professional legal expenses totaled $71 million. However, this included $48 million net accrual for contingent legal and regulatory items for previously disclosed matters. Importantly, based on current information, we expect the estimate of recently possible contingent losses to decrease by a significant amount. Salaries and benefits increased 4% from the previous quarter. Annual merit increases impacted expenses along with an increase in incentive compensation. This increase is partially due to unusually low incentives in the first quarter as well as additional incentives tied to revenue growth.","Outside services increased $9 million, partially related to fees paid in connection with revenue generation as well as increases in our other costs associated with risk management activities. However, due to the nature of these expenses, we believe there are opportunities for improvement going forward. Deposit administrative fees declined from the first quarter primarily due to refunds from prior periods and the expected run rate for this line item is in the low $20 million range. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 64.5% in the quarter, an improvement of 40 basis points from the prior period, as we continue to make investments in talent and technology for future revenue growth and long-term efficiencies. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 30.1%, which included a benefit of $7 million related to the conclusion of state and federal tax examinations. Excluding this benefit, our income tax rate would have been 31.8%.","And moving on to asset quality, total net charge-offs declined $8 million and represented 23 basis points of average loans, an improvement of five basis points. The provision for loan losses was $63 million, exceeding net charge-offs by $17 million. And as Grayson mentioned, this increase was primarily attributable to loan growth and reflects the results of the recently completed Shared National Credit exam. Our allowance for loan losses was 1.39% at the end of the second quarter, down one basis point from the end of the first quarter. Total commercial and investor real estate criticized and classified loans increased $126 million or 5% from the prior quarter. However, they remain relatively flat as a percentage of total loans. The increase was driven by some weakening in large within the energy and other portfolios.","Compared to the prior quarter, troubled debt restructurings or TDRs declined 7% and our non-performing notes decreased 6% linked quarter. And at quarter end, our loan loss allowance for non-performing loans or coverage ratio was 149%. And given where we are in the credit cycle, the large dollar commercial credits in our portfolio and fluctuating commodity prices, volatility and certain credit metrics can be expected.","Let\u2019s move on to capital and liquidity. During the quarter, we repurchased $172 million or 17 million shares of common stock and declared dividends of $80 million. During the quarter, we returned 94% of earnings back to shareholders. And under the Basel III provisions, we maintained industry-leading capital levels as the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 12% and common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 11.2%. On a fully phased-in basis, common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 11%. Liquidity at both the bank and holding company remains solid with a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 83%. And regarding the liquidity coverage ratio, Regions remains well positioned to be fully compliant with the January 2016 implementation deadline. It is important to note that no major balance sheet initiatives are expected in order for us to be compliant.","So let me give you a brief review of the expectations for the remainder of 2015. We continue to expect total loan growth in the 4% to 6% range on a point-to-point basis. However, if current momentum continues, we should skew towards the higher end of that range. Regarding deposits, we continue to expect full year average deposit growth in the 1% to 2% range. And with respect to margin, our expectations for the year are essentially unchanged and we look for margin to remain relatively stable over the balance of 2015. However, we anticipate net interest income growth under our baseline expectations for loan growth and an increase in interest rates later in the year. Finally, we expect to continue to benefit from revenue initiatives, while at the same time, prudently managing our expenses and we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time. The second quarter was evidence of our continued momentum in 2015 and we remain focused on executing our financial priorities of diversifying revenue, generating positive operating leverage and effectively deploying our capital.","With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I will turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","List Underwood","Thank you, David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session of our call. In order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning, I would like to ask each caller to please limit your self to one primary question and one related follow-up question. Now let\u2019s open up the line for questions, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","Grayson Hall","Good morning John.","John Pancari","Good morning. Question on the margin again, Dave thanks for the guidance there \u2013 for your expectations for relatively stable, just \u2013 how would you define that, is that give or take a couple of basis points and if so is it fair to assume just given this rate environment, that we continue to see some modest degradation, maybe a couple of bps a quarter or so, until we get the Fed really move in?","David Turner","So John, you are right. We have tried to maintain the definition of relatively stable throughout this last year or so as one to two points either side of where we are right now. And so when we say that that\u2019s what we are looking for the remainder of the year, obviously if we get rates turning on us a little bit and we have the loan growth send the message on the NII growth that we expect to have. And we should see margin move in that direction. But right now, our call is relatively stable for the remainder of the year.","John Pancari","Okay, alright. And then separately on the expense side, I know you had initially given some efficiency ratio expectations and you are talking about the low-60s by the end of \u201815 and I am wondering how you feel about that at this point and then also, high-50s or so in \u201816, I am wondering if that is still something that you view as achievable.","David Turner","Yes. We have continued to target being in the lower-60s. To get into the 50s, we do need to have a rate increase for that. Clearly, we need two things to happen, revenue increases and continued focus on expense management to get our efficiency ratio down. And we had a 40 basis point improvement in the quarter. And I think with our internal focus on expense management and continuing to make investments in the right areas to grow our revenue, things are working out. We are moving in that direction. So, to get into the lower 60s will require us to continue on the path that we are on right now.","John Pancari","Okay. And on that, the low 60s, you don\u2019t need higher rates, any kind of rate hike to get to that though?","David Turner","We \u2013 like I said, we have forecasted to have rate increase this year and that is in our discussion and conclusion on improvement from here of our efficiency ratio.","John Pancari","Okay. Alright, thanks David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Scouten of Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Stephen Scouten","Yes, hi. Thanks guys. I was wondering if you could give us some more color around your existing SNC portfolio, what the overall size of that portfolio is and kind of what concerns you might have coming off that SNC exam?","Grayson Hall","Okay. If you will, I will ask Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer, to make a few comments on that and John Turner, Head of Corporate Banking Group. The two of them can provide color on that.","Barb Godin","The overall size of our outstanding SNC portfolio is roughly in the $16 billion range. But as it relates to the results of the SNC exam so that cannot be disclosed, that is confidential supervisory information. So, I would not say much more about that. But we are comfortable with the book in terms of the credit quality that we see in that book. It\u2019s very well rated. I will turn it over to John Turner to make a few more comments.","John Turner","Yes. Just in general terms, the SNC book represents a little less than 45% of our total commitments within corporate banking group. We do think it\u2019s an important part of our business. It\u2019s a business that we have grown some clearly over the last two or three years. And it\u2019s a business we think that will provide us significant revenue opportunities. As we talk about shifting the mix of revenue within the company, one of our key focuses is to grow our corporate banking to grow our capabilities to serve those customers that we are now interacting with in a more significant level as part of the Shared National Credit portfolio. So, we view it as being very strategic and giving us an opportunity to grow significant relationships with customers who can drive NRR.","Stephen Scouten","Okay. And then maybe one other question here, just in regards to other opportunities for capital deployment, what are you guys thinking about from an M&A perspective at this point in time? Are there any increased conversations or increased desire on you all\u2019s part to get something done in that regard, especially given BB&T the approval of their Susquehanna deal? Does that give you any greater level of confidence or move up the timeline for potential M&A for you guys?","David Turner","Well, I think the first and foremost, we are focused on organic growth. We are focused on executing our business strategies and trying to build a better bank and have a better team. We are closely monitoring all M&A activity. We are preparing ourselves in the eventuality that opportunities present themselves. We think that some of the activities in the M&A spaces of late have been constructive. We think that\u2019s helpful as we sort of prepare our long-term strategies. That being said, at this juncture, our efforts are predominantly around preparation if opportunities present themselves, but our primary focus is growing organically.","Stephen Scouten","Okay, thanks guys. I appreciate taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom","Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions on credit quality, you were very clear on the dynamics about what led to this quarter\u2019s provision. But as I look at the relationship of the reserve to loans, it seems to be stabilizing at around the 1.4% level, whereas some peers have continued to take it down closer to 1.25%. And I am just wondering what you sort of view as adequate going forward if there isn\u2019t any incremental migration in the SNC portfolio?","David Turner","So, it\u2019s David. We don\u2019t have any particular percentage that we aim for. We let the model run. There is obviously some judgment at the end of the day, but a lot of it is model-driven. When you have 23 basis points worth of charge-offs and that can continue \u2013 if that continues over time, you should see a migration down to some point. I will tell you the loan growth we have had have been larger commercial credits. We tried to give you some color on the volatility that you can expect when you have larger credits and one of them trends negatively. We have \u2013 we feel good about the reserve. We feel good about our overall credit quality and trends and our non-performer is coming down. And \u2013 but we also have loan growth that we have to provide for. When you mix all that together, if we can continue to see a reduction in non-performers and a reduction in charge-offs, you would expect the coverage to come down, but we need to see that on a quarter-by-quarter basis and let our model run.","Grayson Hall","No, it\u2019s got to be \u2013 we are committed to a very data-driven process and we are letting the data drive that number. We are \u2013 as David said, we are not targeting a particular ratio. But instead, we are targeting a process where we evaluate the credit quality of our portfolio and let the data drive that decision.","Barb Godin","However, I don\u2019t think it will go back to the old days of the goal of 1%. There will be a new floor established at some point, but it will not go back we don\u2019t believe to those pre-recession levels.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great, thanks. That\u2019s very clear. And just one quick follow-up obviously an outstanding quarter on the brokerage and investment banking line item, how do you suggest we think about sort of the sustainable run-rate of revenues in those business lines going forward?","Grayson Hall","Well, there is really \u2013 I think in a lot of ways, it\u2019s very important quarter for us. We really saw growth across \u2013 more broadly across our markets and more broadly across products. We have been making a number of investments in parts of our business that grow non-interest revenue. We have really started to see the traction that those businesses are able to gain in this market. We believe that their contributions will continue to increase. And when you look at the growth across the company, it\u2019s very encouraging, just starting to be reflected into the numbers, but very promising as we look forward. And David, do you want to chime in a little more over?","David Turner","Yes, we were encouraged with \u2013 as Grayson mentioned, we have made investments in people. We got our first M&A transaction. We are looking at growing that space. We have made an investment in the Fannie Mae DUS license not quite a year ago. That\u2019s paying off for us. So, these investments that we have made, we feel good about the continued improvement. There was nothing in revenue that causes us to believe there was a one-time issue there in terms of favorability that won\u2019t repeat. We are looking to continue to grow that. The pace of which depends on the businesses that we can execute. So, we are very encouraged by that in our NRR growth and how broad it was.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. Can you guys provide the premium amortization within the bond book this quarter and maybe how that compares to previous periods?","David Turner","So, we are at $41 million this past quarter, Matt. It was about $2 million different than previous quarter.","Matt O\u2019Connor","$2 million lower, I would assume?","David Turner","That\u2019s right.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. And then just I mean looking forward, does that drop more significantly if the backup in rates holds here?","David Turner","I think we are showing a relatively stable kind of a moderation of that premium amortization from here.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. And just I mean in terms of why that would be, is it just \u2013 there are some banks out there where it\u2019s really sensitive quarter-to-quarter and I think yours incorporates both the rate outlook and the actual prepayment. So, is it just a little bit of a smoother impact than maybe some other banks?","David Turner","Yes, I think others can have a different method of amortization. Ours are fairly \u2013 should be fairly resilient, like I said from here. We used to have our premium amortization was a much bigger impact to us, but our total premiums that exist in the book is down. We also have more 15-year product, so it\u2019s a little less impactful to us than perhaps some others.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. And then just separately the deposit service charges, obviously nice bounce linked quarter there, probably on seasonality, but as you think about you implementing some of the changes you have talked about, I think it\u2019s the high to low and some other, just provide an update of that, the magnitude and the timing and if there has been any change versus what you thought maybe six months ago?","David Turner","So, our service charge \u2013 that was seasonality that you saw, if you compare it year-over-year, the main difference between the prior year had already advanced product in there that you know we are out of that product now. We have continued to investigate changing of our posting order. We still are committed to that effect on us. When we implement, being the $10 million to $15 million range, we expect to implement that towards the latter part of the year, so we haven\u2019t changed our timing from our last call. But you should see that go in the latter part of this year. So there will be some impact in \u201815.","Grayson Hall","Additionally, Matt, we have seen steady growth in consumer checking accounts since the first of the year. And so as we continue to grow accounts and that gives us an opportunity to continue to grow that line item, so pretty encouraging news in that regard.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, thank you very much. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale of Janney Montgomery Scott.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Sameer.","Sameer Gokhale","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the last question you got, the follow-up on that, to clarify I think that you have switched or switching to a chronological format for posting order, is that right or are you doing high to low I thought \u2013 I just want to clarify that?","Grayson Hall","Chronological.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay.","Grayson Hall","And to the extent possible, I think chronological in the purest sense is not possible, but chronological to the degree the transactions allow us to do that.","Sameer Gokhale","Yes \u2013 no, I understand. There seems to be a lot of complexity and lack of clarity around exactly what the final rules will be. But just to kind of further flesh that out, I was curious as to your adoption of the chronological order, because in talking to other banks, it seems like many of them have not yet done anything. They are waiting for the final rules to come out. And if and when the final \u2013 when the final rules come out, if they are different from what you kind of implemented, then would you need to change that again, so I am just trying to get a sense for the thought process there and kind of going ahead with the chronological process \u2013 the chronological order?","Grayson Hall","Yes. Sameer I mean as we think through it, we are absolutely focused on trying to serve our customers in the way that we believe to be appropriate, and we think there is a growing perception on the part of customers that some type of chronological based posting is a more appropriate way to go. We are in close communication with the regulatory authorities about faults on process, faults on posting and we appreciate that that may change on us. We believe we are building the process that we are almost all of our transactions will be time order posted. That being said, because of the complexity of posting, you never quite get the perfection. But we believe this is the right thing to do, and so we are pressing ahead with it.","As David said, right now our project plans would have us completing that this year. And so we are on schedule to do that. And if changes occur in subsequent quarters, we will make changes as they are deemed necessary and appropriate. But I think we waited long enough and we feel like that it\u2019s the right time from a purely from a customer standpoint that we need to do this. It\u2019s got \u2013 obviously any change can have a mixed reaction on the part of the customers and we just want to be careful that our customers \u2013 we communicate well and we are transparent and we do this not only to do the right thing, but do it the right way and so we are trying to do that.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay. And then just a quick one if I may, I know you did talk about the home equity loans growing for the first time in a long time, I don\u2019t know if you had mentioned what the reason for that is and if you could give us a sense for what those proceeds are used \u2013 being used for, are they being used up to pay down consumer credit cards or something else, that would be helpful? Thank you.","Grayson Hall","Well, I mean \u2013 we have been \u2013 we a few years ago we were predominantly an equity line of credit, is the product that we went to market with. I think that as you saw quite a while back, we introduced amortizing home equity loan that has proved very attractive to our customer base. What we have seen is in this quarter when you consolidate the net of home equity lines and home equity loans, you are seeing customers did \u2013 you are seeing that pivot point where on that basis for the first time in 6 years, we have started to grow that portfolio, that\u2019s the combination of the runoff of the equity line portfolio has slowed, and the increase in the home equity loan has increased substantially to accommodate that. I would say anecdotally, most of the home equity loans we are making are for sort of a smaller dollar home refinance. Also home repairs and to a less degree and last on that list would be debt consolidation. Strong FICO score probably averaging close to 7, 7.78, LTV around 60%, so good product going on and I think serving our customers well.","Sameer Gokhale","That\u2019s great. Thanks Grayson.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. I just had one follow-up question on credit. Barb, it looks like the way I am reading the charge-off breakdown, in C&I this quarter and in owner occupied CRE last quarter, the single basis point loss rate implies to me that there could be recoveries in those two categories. And I guess, the question here as we think about provisioning and reserving going forward, is it 23 basis points to 28 basis points charge-off range that we saw in the past two quarters sustainable or given potentially outsized recoveries, should we look to the range prior to those two quarters of between 35 basis points to 40 basis points?","Barb Godin","Yes. Erika, recoveries actually do play a role in what we saw this past quarter, but it also played a role in prior quarters. The one thing I would caution on it, I think recoveries is, a lot of the loans that we charged off those are recoveries that we have already received as our charge-offs have come down and this was an opportunity for recoveries going forward. The 23 points of loss that we are pretty pleased about this quarter is great, but we do believe again that that\u2019s probably close to the bottom of where we are going to be. We might get another point to two out of it. But again, we will probably move somewhere between that 25 basis points to 35 basis point range as we think forward.","Erika Najarian","And as my \u2013 the second question to that is, how long do you think from a credit standpoint, we could stay in that 25 basis points to 35 basis point range and I guess a better way to ask that is, do you see anything near-term that could move you outside of that band?","Barb Godin","Yes. The only thing I could see near-term at all is something that we can\u2019t see. What \u2013 from everything that we see that\u2019s in front of us, we feel comfortable that we will stay in that band. But again, you never know if you have some other factors that happens in the economy that will create an issue for us, and we will disclose at that time.","Erika Najarian","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, Grayson. I was wondering if I guess a question on expenses in an absolute sense. So David, you talked about having a little room in some areas to improve, but then you talked about also the kind of normalization of that deposit administrative line, so what are the puts and takes about \u2013 in future expense growth and how much of that kind of continued investment burden, do you still bear from here?","David Turner","Well, I wouldn\u2019t categorize investment as a burden. Some of that is good. Investments we are making to grow our revenue generators is a good expense. We will do that all day long and expect a return for those type of investments. I will tell you, though as we think about managing our expense base, again we got to look at salaries and benefits. I can see furniture and fixtures in our outside services, so those four categories. And in that, we can tighten up a little bit in terms of some of the investments we have had to make over time to deal with regulatory environment that we are facing in this banking industry things that are related to risk management, capital planning and those kinds of things that in compliance and audit. All those over time will rationalize. And you should see some opportunities for us there. Also, as you know we have done branch consolidations in the past. That\u2019s brought down salaries and benefits. It\u2019s brought down furniture and fixtures. It\u2019s brought down occupancy expense. And while we don\u2019t have any current plans for branch consolidations, we are continuing to look at our branch footprint as part of our retail network strategy to ensure that channel is optimized that we will make investments where appropriate and we\u2019ll tighten up other areas that \u2013 other branches where the revenue generation isn\u2019t strong enough for us. And then lastly, I will tell you we have a number of Six Sigma initiatives underway in our company. Firstly, every department has an obligation to look at how they can become more efficient. We haven\u2019t had a named expense initiative as you know, but internally, we have an intense focus on expense management. And so there is not an expense that is off the radar screen, but the areas we will move the meter of those four, five areas I mentioned.","Ken Usdin","And I \u2013 sorry, go ahead, Grayson.","Grayson Hall","No, I just add to what David said, I think we are absolutely committed to rigorous expense management across the company. You can never be as good as you want to be in that regard. We continue to challenge ourselves internally that are we being good expense managers? In this environment, it\u2019s a critical skill. But we also are more than willing to make prudent investments that allow us to grow prudently. And so we will continue to do that. We think those have been smart decisions. They certainly are paying off. And to David\u2019s point, we will do that every day. And we have done that in terms of recruiting new bankers on to our team making investments in our current team to allow us to grow more appropriately, but prudently. And so as part of \u2013 if you look at, if you backup and look at our efficiency ratio and you look at it both expense and revenue side, we have done much better on the expense side than we have on the revenue side. And we are trying to take a very balanced approach to expense management, a thoughtful approach that gets us where we want to be. And to David\u2019s point, we are trying to make incremental improvement every quarter to get down to that lower 60% efficiency ratio, but it\u2019s going to require work on both sides of that formula.","Ken Usdin","Yes, I understood. And just as a quick follow-up on that, though working on it and is it the type of stuff that I know you don\u2019t have a program or a number, but as you think about the things you can work on, is it more just about monitoring the rate of growth or do you think you would have the ability to actually at some point get the expense base back down?","Grayson Hall","Well, let me \u2013 it\u2019s not to make it more complicated than it is, we clearly have been making investments in risk management and we have been making investments in bankers and growth opportunities that we see. We tried to self fund a great deal of that expense and have process improvement in a number of our back offices. We have tried to do that process improvement in a lot of our support offices such as legal and in vendor management, but we also have tried to rationalize our channels. And in particular, the branch channel has been, we think, pretty aggressive in rationalizing channels and trying to make them as efficient as we can without reducing our effectiveness for the customer. And so it \u2013 while we don\u2019t have a branded program, rest assured, we got lots of internal programs.","David Turner","Yes. And Ken, we were down in expenses four years in a row. We didn\u2019t commit to having expenses in \u201815 lower than \u201814, because we knew we want to make investments in the revenue generators and some are still coming on board, so that generated the revenue. We think that\u2019s the right kind of spend for us. Can we get down to the expense level that we had in \u201814 at some point? It just depends on the investments we make going forward. I think the first order of business is to watch the spend, so that the rate of growth is the most appropriate rate of growth and then we can look at how efficient can we get over time with the use of things like Six Sigma and so forth.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Geoffrey.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. How are you?","Grayson Hall","Well.","Geoffrey Elliott","Question on the energy portfolio, I was interested to see that was kind of down a couple of percent over the quarter, which is lower than the pace of decline that we have seen at some of the other banks. So, I am curious is that a deliberate strategy on your part? Are you trying to pursue more of a stick with the customer keep providing credit strategy than you think some of the other banks might be or do you think that could just be differences in structural portfolios?","John Turner","Geoffrey, this is John Turner. First of all, we say we are committed to sticking with our customers on where that makes sense. And I think as you think about what we are doing today, we are approaching our evaluation business on an ongoing basis with a healthy skepticism, but staying very close to our customers so that we understand what\u2019s going on their businesses. When you look at the reduction in commitments, primarily occurred in the E&P space, where as a result of borrowing base re-determinations, we reduced commitments by a little over $320 million, or on average, about 16%. We also had a number of our customers access the capital markets. And in fact, over the last seven months, I guess they have raised over $7 billion in the capital markets that used those funds to both to add additional liquidity to potentially make investments, to reduce their leverage, and so that certainly had an impact as well. And we think our clients are doing all the right things. And so as a result, we have a \u2013 we are cautiously confident about the performance of the book. When I say doing the right things, our customers have reacted quickly to market conditions. They have reduced their expenses, reduced their CapEx. They are raising liquidity and reducing leverage where appropriate. And as a consequence, I think we will continue to see some reduction in the business until the market turns and reinvestment occurs.","Grayson Hall","And John, if you would speak for a minute about customer selectivity and limited number of things in our book?","John Turner","Yes, I think just another aspect of the way we think about the risk in the book is as I said this before, we have really a small number of larger names, we think colossal activity has been one of the hallmarks of our energy book. These are customers that we have known for a long time. Most of them, at least of any size, are very recognizable in the industry. Management teams are very experienced. As I mentioned, good access to capital markets and liquidity and we think that they are doing all the right things. We have spent a lot of time internally reviewing the portfolio. I mentioned that we have a quarterly review process for our oilfield services book. We have now looked at internally over 91% of our oilfield services exposure within the last four months. We also have done borrowing base re-determinations on all, but one of our E&P relationship, so 98% plus or minus, of that book. And then our energy portfolio has been subject to a number of external reviews, including the SNC exam, where we think 67% of our total energy book was reviewed as part of the SNC exam. That\u2019s about 89% of the E&P portfolio and over 55% \u2013 or about 55% of oilfield services. So, a lot of eyes on our energy portfolio and we think a lot of transparency given the fact that there are smaller number of larger exposures, which is a good thing. On the downside, there is some single name risk associated with deterioration. But all-in-all, I think we feel like we have a pretty good handle on the exposure in the energy portfolio.","Geoffrey Elliott","And to follow-up, the increase in the right exposure, what happened there over the quarter?","Grayson Hall","We had some reclassifications as we can\u2019t continue to look for indirect exposures that are in some way impacted by the energy business. So as an example, we pulled in some of our investor real estate portfolio, where we have income-producing properties that are leased to third parties which happen to be in the energy space. And so as we capture that as an indirect exposure, that had an impact on outstandings, as example.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo.","Grayson Hall","Matt good morning.","Matt Burnell","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. David maybe a question for you, you mentioned branch reduction. And obviously that\u2019s been a positive story for you, all down about 3% year-over-year with them, somewhat more positive momentum in the last couple of quarters, but also looking at the transaction services only line, that\u2019s been pretty stable, I guess I am curious how you all are thinking about the product delivery capability over the next couple of years as you think about rationalizing branches, full service branches, should we begin to see the full service branches continue to come down, but at the same time the transaction services presumably smaller, less costly branches, rise?","Grayson Hall","Well, you asked the question to David, but if you don\u2019t mind, I will answer it. I think it is we have said about a number of our businesses around the company, we tend to be very data driven. And we think it\u2019s important to make sure we understand the data and what\u2019s going on in all of our channels. And branches, in particular, we are doing a lot from an experimentation and an innovation perspective with new branch formats, less people, more technology. We also are experimenting with a number of innovative designs around drive-throughs and our capabilities of our ATMs and all sat locations. All are being said, we still \u2013 when you look at the markets we operate in and the customers that we serve, and we serve almost 4 million customers across 16 states, they all have different needs. And when you look at our customer base, still 59% of our customers will visit one of our branches in the next 30 days. So we still have a lot of customer traffic. In fact, we got a lot of branches that are operating at over capacity levels. And so we\u2019ve introduced a number of digital capabilities.","Deposit \u2013 smartphone deposit capture, remote deposit capture for our small business and corporate customers. We tried to use innovation to try to take more transactions out of our branches that allows us to be more efficient, but also dedicate more resource to sales and service. And so we have been introducing technology into our ATMs. Roughly 75% of our ATMs today have the ability to take a deposit through image technology. If you look at how efficient we have got, almost 21% of the deposits are company \u2013 are coming through the digital channel as opposed to coming through one of our branch offices. So making good progress, but we are letting the data drive the number. So when we see a bench that is \u2013 that transaction volumes and customer accounts in a particular branch is \u2013 drives that decision so that we don\u2019t do that anecdotally, but we do it with a lot of data and data analytics. And so we will continue to do that. I do think customers are showing a preference for additional channels, but it varies per market. And a lot of our markets are still very, very branch dependent and so we pay attention to that.","Matt Burnell","Okay, that\u2019s helpful color. And David, maybe I can direct this one to you, specifically on the earning assets, you saw about an $860 million decline, 29% decline in other interest earning assets which I presume is mostly cash at the Fed, how does that number trend in your current outlook for margin through the rest of the year?","David Turner","Yes. You are exactly right, so we put the excess cash to work, so that pushed in terms of the loan growth. We should see some growth in earning assets that will come with deposit growth picking up. And now the question is where will that be deployed in the securities book, cash at the Fed or in loan growth and we feel good about our loan growth, gave you a little bit of good guidance in terms of what we thought we will do, skewing towards the upper end of our previously announced range. So we expect that to pick up slightly.","Matt Burnell","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Grayson Hall","Good morning Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning. Thank you. A couple of questions, one could you guys just go over the Shared National Credit outstandings, I didn\u2019t hear it clearly and I think the transcript may have gotten a number of incorrect\u2026?","Grayson Hall","Barb, could you speak to that.","Barb Godin","Yes, I will speak to it. In fact, it\u2019s $18 billion roughly in outstandings that we have for the Shared National Credit.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And because the transcript I think said 50 is \u2013 I assume the transcript is incorrect then.","Barb Godin","You\u2019re correct. ","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Coming back to your loan portfolio, at one point you guys were de-risking the portfolio by allowing the commercial real estate balances to come down. And I believe that ended some time ago, but there is still shrinking. And maybe can you give us some color what\u2019s going on in the commercial real estate investor as well as on owner-occupied commercial estate mortgage portfolios?","John Turner","Yes. This is John Turner. First let me start with owner-occupied real estate. We are continuing to see that book run off a bit. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s much reflective of the fact that we are just not seeing middle market sort of lower end to middle market in our business banking, small business customers invest in expanding their businesses. So the volume of activity that we see is down. That portfolio amortizes every month and so we are continuing to see some run off, although the run off is slowing a bit and we expect that to trend to actually turn in the future. As it relates to investor real estate, we did de-risk the book. We have remade our business model, built it around professional real estate bankers working closely with real estate developers, again real focused on client selectivity. It\u2019s a business we want to grow, but it\u2019s heavily construction-oriented today, and we would like to see a shift more to have a better balance between construction and term lending. We are very committed to managing that book in a very disciplined and thoughtful way, applying our concentration limit methodology to make sure that we don\u2019t have too much exposure to any product type or any particular market, diversity is really important to us as we think about managing that business going forward. So I think you can expect to see it grow sort of as the economy grows, would be our plan, kind of the 2% to 4% range, but not much faster than that as we seek to manage that risk prudently and shift again the mix from construction to more term...","Gerard Cassidy","And then just as a follow-up, Grayson you gave us some good color on the branches and your digital channel and the activity you are getting through the digital channel. And it\u2019s certainly a topic of debate in the industry today about the retail branch model. I \u2013 with your 1,500 or so branches can you guys give us some color on the profitability, how many of those are meeting your return on equity or internal rate of return hurdles, how many are not profitable, so give us a flavor?","Grayson Hall","Yes. We would certainly \u2013 we calculate that data. We calculate that data on a real frequent basis. And we got different hurdles that we try to monitor to make sure each of our offices are meeting our hurdles. And where we are at today is roughly 98%, 99% of our branch offices are providing a positive direct contribution to our earnings. That being said, do they all hurdle over internal rate of return requirements for branches are we have to look at each individual branch and see whether that branch is predominantly servicing transactions or are they going accounts, are they growing balances both deposits and loans. Then we take all that into consideration. And we take into consideration the markets they operate in before we make that consolidation decision.","Quite frankly, we are seeing tremendous growth in digital channels, but the growth in digital channels is faster than the reduction of activity in our branches. A lot of digital activity is new activity. It\u2019s additional activity. But we are seeing patterns in our branches change and we make movements, take decisions based off those behavioral changes. But I will go back to my earlier comment, when it comes to the branch, our decision can\u2019t be anecdotal. It has to be based off the absolute numerics of that branch and it has to be in the best interest of the community that we operate in. Our engagement in our communities and our commitment to the communities we operate in is very, very important to us and so all of that has to be considered when we look at branches.","David Turner","Gerard, I\u2019ll add to that. One thing we have consolidated little over 20% of our branch count since the crisis. We stay focused on it. And one of the things we need to \u2013 we have to think through is even those that don\u2019t give us the return we would like is we have to look at what the next alternative is if we don\u2019t have that branch. Because anytime we consolidate a branch, we lose revenue. Now, the goal is to lose more expense from the revenue that we just lost and that\u2019s why you have seen the consolidation to be in a very measured pace. We will continue to look at that. And while we don\u2019t have any identified as of right now, you should expect us to continue to rationalize our whole retail footprint over time.","Grayson Hall","But I think an important point to make is that today we are seeing a higher level of sales growth in our physical points of presence. In fact, our branches \u2013 our sales in the second quarter \u2013 new account sales in the second quarter is the highest we have seen in four years, so very good performance out of branches this quarter.","Gerard Cassidy","Grayson and David, thank you.","Grayson Hall","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan.","Grayson Hall","Good morning.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions. Firstly, Barb, on your Shared National Credits of $18 billion, how much are you the lead on?","Barb Godin","We are the lead on \u2013 I don\u2019t have the dollars at my fingertips, but it is roughly 100 credits.","Vivek Juneja","100 credits.","Barb Godin","Out of a book of approximately 1,300.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, okay, great. And then secondly, maybe just for Grayson and David, let me turn back to the efficiency ratio question, when I look at your efficiency ratio calculation, I add back the deposit administrative fee refund that you got. Your core efficiency ratio is essentially flat with last quarter at roughly 65%, which is up almost 180 basis points from a year ago. And I know you are talking about it coming down into the low 60s. How much of that decline given that there is a lot of expense pressure, which you have touched on an investment that you are doing. So, how much of the decline that you are expecting are you factoring in from Fed rate hike benefit? I mean, going from 65 to low 60s, David or Grayson, how much do you expect to come from there?","David Turner","Yes, we don\u2019t have it broken out in terms of just related to the rate hike. What I will tell you is that the main driver of our efficiency ratio is growing our revenue appropriately. We do have the expense measures that we are looking at in that revenue growth is expecting those investments that we have made thus far to continue to generate the revenue growth and we are seeing that. We saw that this quarter with 7% NIR growth, but we have people we hired just an example our financial consultants were up to 200. We\u2019ve just got our 200th one, I think this week, but it takes time for those new folks to generate the revenue that we expect. It\u2019s about eight or nine months. So, we carry the expense load until the revenue comes. And so part of our getting into that lower 60s is rate, part of it is continued execution from the people that are here.","And then from the expense side, as I mentioned earlier in the call, continuing to look at the support groups, whether it be again finance, HR, risk management, credit teams, all that infrastructure that we look at we continue to work to rationalize that to use technology to help us deliver our products and services cheaper to our customer base. So, all of that has to work together to get our efficiency ratio down into the lower 60s. We really want to get to the higher 50s. That does take a rate hike to get where we are in a normal rate environment. So that will take some time to get there.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of David Eads of UBS.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Dave.","David Eads","Hello. Thanks for taking the call. Just I guess a couple of questions on the loan growth, maybe on indirect auto we have seen some talk about the CFPB and dealer markups on those loans. I am curious what you guys do when it comes to dealer discretion on pricing? And then I guess more broadly, what you think that those moves could mean for competition across the industry?","David Turner","Well, we have seen obviously a change in some of our competitors in terms of dealer markups. Today, we give 200 basis points discretion, which is a little lower than the average peer. The average peer has been to 300. They lowered down to 250. So, we are a little lower than peers. We have seen some go to flats. The industry really is looking, along with the captives, which have just come into the fold for the CFPB to really give the \u2013 those of us that operate with the rules of the game are. And what I will tell you is we will adapt and overcome. We just want to know what they are. We will figure out how to make money in whatever environment it is. So, right now, I think there is a measured pace as to whether or not we go to flats or whether or not we go from 200 to 100 or some other basis. But I think that if you looked at our business, half of it only has 100 basis points of discretion in it. So, we are positioned well to adapt to whatever the rules are. We just need some finalization to come from the regulatory side.","Grayson Hall","And I will just add to what David said. We have done a number of things strategically to try to position ourselves better for what David has outlined as an industry that\u2019s under change. And we are trying to measure that change, interpret that change. So, we have done some experimentation and some innovation around pricing. We have experimented with substantially reduced markups. We have experimented with something much lower than our standard. We have worked with our dealers and strategically we have reduced the number of dealers we do business with to make sure that we have got large dealer groups that we have got confidence in the way they run the risk management part of their business. And we will continue to make changes as the market changes. Today, though the commercial banks are only about a third of that marketplace and so commercial banks are responding to it, it\u2019s still been a good market for us, but been very selective in who we do business with and what kind of business we will place on the books.","David Eads","Great. That\u2019s some good color. And then I think you guys broke out this other consumer indirect category this quarter. And I am just kind of curious, you talked about that being partnerships with primarily home improvement retailers, is that kind of going to have the characteristics of a home equity loan or a card loan and kind of what you are looking to do with that business?","Grayson Hall","At its core, it\u2019s basically indirect lending through point of sale. And we have partnered with people who provide the front-end origination of those loans at retailers. And so we \u2013 it\u2019s just an alternative source. As you see, there is a lot of change in the consumer lending space, a lot of digital offerings in the market, but there is also a lot of offerings that are taking place at point of purchase, if you will, and home improvement is a big issue for a lot of our customers and what they want to get that financing when they walk into the home improvement store. And so we have partnered to try to capture some of that. And so we are trying to be innovative in consumer lending and this is just an example where we have had some good progress in that regard.","David Eads","Great, thanks.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. I will now turn the floor back over for closing remarks.","Grayson Hall","Well, listen, thank you for your questions.

My name is Paula, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.","M. List Underwood","Good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation in our call this morning. Our presenters today are: our Chief Executive Officer, Grayson Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Turner. Other members of the management team are present as well and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also as part of our earnings call, we will be referencing the slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com. Finally, let me remind you that in this call, and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking statement that is located in the Appendix of the presentation. Grayson?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Regions and participation in our third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Today, we reported earnings of $285 million for the quarter, demonstrating our steady focus on executing our strategic priorities and business plans. Our continued progress is reflected by many key measures. We grew total loans for the second consecutive quarter. We expanded our customer base. We increased net interest income both year-over-year and linked quarter, and we achieved broad-based asset quality improvement. Year-to-date, we grew loans nearly $2 billion, including just over $900 million in the third quarter. Importantly, this loan growth extended to both consumer and business lending portfolios. Looking first at business lending, commercial lending remained a significant driver of overall loan growth. We have a simple and yet effective model that focuses on relationship banking through high-quality customer service, coupled with industry expertise. The model is enabling us to expand our customer base and grow our loans outstanding. Despite this modest growth, uncertainties surrounding economic and political conditions as well as interest rates, continued to weigh on business demand for new loans in our overall business marketplace.","On the consumer side, we have realized steady increases in new credit card production, with active cardholders rising to highest number since we purchased the card portfolio 2 years ago. Over the last year, we increased our customer penetration rate by approximately 110 basis points, demonstrating a succes for our marketing and sales effort. Further, we grew our indirect auto loan portfolio for the 11th consecutive quarter. We currently have relationships with approximately 25% of the auto dealers across our 16-state franchise, and we continue to build on our dealer network. However, we do this while adhering to disciplined credit parameters.","In line with our expectations, mortgage loan production declined 16% in the third quarter. As we transitioned from a refinance to a purchase-driven market, we are adapting our business model to adjust for the overall production slowdown. Customers remain at the center of our overall strategy, and our commitment to providing products and services that customers need and want remain steadfast. This means constantly building and improving our technology infrastructure for both our consumer products and services and back-office platforms. To that end, we have made strategic investments in our people and technology.","During the third quarter, we added almost 400 new positions, many in customer facing, revenue-generating and compliance areas. We are also making investments on our risk management and compliance infrastructure, and will continue to do so in order to effectively manage the evolving industry demands. As we have consistently said, we will continue to make prudent investments in our future by adhering to an expense discipline. At the core of our strategy is Regions 360, which, as you may recall, is the approach we take to serving our customers and our communities. We believe this strategy of building a stronger relationship banking culture at Regions will drive revenue, increased associate retention and ultimately drive substantial growth.","Prudent risk management, another key component of our sustainable growth strategy, also continue to pay off in the third quarter. Net charge-offs, as a percent of loans, was 0.6% at the end of the quarter, as net charge-offs declined to the lowest level in more than 5 years. We achieved improvement in virtually every credit metric, as our credit asset quality continues to improve.","Finally, we were able to return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchase, and have now completed essentially all of the $350 million of authorized share repurchases. In summary, overall third quarter results reflect positive momentum, as we stay focused on moving the company forward. We still have work to do, but continue to successfully execute our strategic priorities and business plans to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. I'll now turn it over to David for a more detailed look at third quarter results. David?","David J. Turner","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Lets begin with the balance sheet. As Grayson mentioned, we achieved solid loan growth again this quarter, as total loans increased over $900 million or 1% from the second quarter. We grew almost every loan category with both business and consumer lending up quarter-over-quarter.","Starting with business lending, which includes our commercial and investor real estate portfolios, in total, these loans increased 2% from the end of the prior quarter. This growth continues to be led by our commercial and industrial portfolio, as ending loans grew 3% quarter-over-quarter. The growth in this portfolio was driven by our real estate corporate banking group, or our REIT lending, and our specialized lending groups also had a strong quarter, with healthcare and technology lending, in particular, achieving significant growth. Asset-based lending was also a strong contributor for loan growth in the quarter.","Total business lending production was $13.8 billion, an increase of 18% over the prior year. Commitments for new loans were up $306 million or 6% from the prior quarter, and pipelines remain solid, and we are beginning to see some pickup in M&A activity among our client base and modest increases in small business lending. Production in the investor real estate portfolio increased from the second quarter, and offset the pace of derisking, which has slowed considerably. Investor real estate loan balances totaled $7 billion at quarter end, a decline of $84 million or 1% from the prior quarter. Growth in the investor real estate production was driven by single-family and multifamily construction, and July and August were the highest production months in the last 3 years. While balances in the investor real estate portfolio may fluctuate depending on production levels, derisking and payoff activity, we believe that we may be close to stabilization in the portfolio.","Now turning to consumer lending, this portfolio increased 1% from the previous quarter, marking the pivotal shift in balance trends. Our indirect auto portfolio achieved 7% loan growth from the prior quarter. In addition to expanding our dealer network, we are focused on increasing our number of loans per dealer by developing technology that will improve response time for loan request, which should ultimately serve increased loan production. However, we will remain disciplined with respect to our conservative credit requirements and policies.","Credit card balances were also up this quarter, as our number of active cardholders increased almost 4%. Carried in balances totaled approximately $900 million, an increase of 3.5%, as we experienced 5 consecutive months of balance increases. Much of this growth was driven by our marketing efforts through balance transfer offers extending to our listing customer base.","Mortgage balances were steady from the previous quarter due to the slowdown of mortgage refinancing activity. In addition, declines in our home equity portfolio has slowed considerably. Strong customer demand for our fixed rate home equity loan product is offsetting the impact of customer deleveraging on the variable rate home equity line product. As a result, we expect the pace of decline in our overall home equity portfolio to slow. All in all, our third quarter loan growth was stronger than anticipated. And looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect loan growth to continue, but at a more moderate pace.","Let's move on to the liability side of the balance sheet. Deposit mix and costs continue to improve in the third quarter. Total average low-cost deposits increased $473 million from the previous quarter, and time deposits fell to just 11% of total deposits. This positive repricing and mix shift resulted in deposit costs declining 2 basis points, down to 13 basis points. As a result, total funding costs for the company declined 5 basis points to 35 basis points. Although opportunities to further reduce deposit costs are diminishing, we still have an additional $4.6 billion of CDs maturing in the next 12 months at an average rate of 31 basis points, and this compares to our current average going on rates for new CDs of approximately 19 basis points.","Now let's look at how all this has impacted net interest income in the margin. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $838 million, up $17 million or 2% from the previous quarter. The resulting net interest margin was higher than we expected at 3.24%, an increase of 8 basis points from the previous quarter. The liability management and investment portfolio actions we took late in the second quarter provided a 7 basis point lift to third quarter margin. These actions, as well as continued improvements in deposit costs, has helped to offset the effects of a persistently low interest rate environment. Although lower loan and investment yield pressure net interest margin, this effect has been largely offset in recent quarters by our improving mix and cost of deposits and borrowings. The opportunity for the margin to further benefit from lower deposit cost will subside in future quarters. However, the increase in long-term rates has provided some tailwind. Rising rates are expected to be beneficial to our net interest margin as our asset-sensitive balance sheet reacts favorably to increases in both short-term and long-term rates.","Higher long-term rates affect prepayment behavior. As a result, we experienced a positive impact from lower premium amortization in our securities portfolio. Lower premium amortization contributed approximately 5 basis points increase to the margin and totaled $59 million for the quarter. Of course, higher long-term rates also benefit reinvestment yields on fixed-rate loans and securities.","With rates at their present level, we expect net interest margin to remain relatively stable. Additional details surrounding our interest rate is in the -- can be found in the Appendix of the accompanying presentation.","Let's take a look now at noninterest revenue. Third quarter noninterest revenue was relatively flat from the previous quarter due to an increase in service charges that was offset by a decline in mortgage income. Also, during the quarter, we divested a non-core portion of our Wealth Management business, which resulted in a pretax gain of $24 million.","As expected, mortgage income declined in the third quarter, as production slowed as a result of fewer refinances due to the recent rise in interest rates. Mortgage revenue declined 25% and loan production declined 16% over the prior quarter.","New home purchases continue to drive mortgage origination volume and accounted for 60% of total mortgage originations compared to 37% a year ago. Importantly, we have already started adjusting our mortgage operations model to account for the reduction in applications. Some cost, like commission expense, declined immediately. However, the other expenses will experience a lag before the savings are realized. We expect fourth quarter production volumes to continue to decline another 15% to 20% from third quarter levels.","Service charges increased $14 million from the previous quarter. Importantly, new checking account production increased 4% over the second quarter, which should serve to facilitate future cross-sell and revenue opportunities. The products like our Now Banking suite continues to gain traction and a number of households using these products increased 66% over the past year. Of note, almost 60% of these customers are new to Regions, providing us with additional opportunities for revenue growth. Also, Now Banking prepaid cards increased 57%.","Let's take a look at expenses on the next slide. Noninterest expenses totaled $884 million in the third quarter. As you may recall, expenses benefited last quarter from a lower level of legal and professional fees and unfunded commitment expense. Also, last quarter included $56 million of debt extinguishment costs related to the early termination of certain debt and preferred securities compared to the $5 million we incurred this quarter. Also this quarter, legal and professional fees increased 6% compared to the prior year and totaled $34 million.","Salaries and benefits increased slightly this quarter due to additional staffing in many revenue-generating and customer-facing areas. Expenses have also increased related to investments that we have made to our compliance and risk management infrastructure. We continue to rigorously review all expenses on an ongoing basis, which includes personnel, occupancy, furniture and equipment, as well as branch rationalization opportunities, and you should expect some fluctuation in expenses on a quarter-to-quarter basis as we make investments to generate revenue growth in the future. However, if the revenue does not materialize, we will reduce expenses accordingly. We expect fourth quarter expenses will approximate those of this quarter and the 2013 expenses will be modestly lower than those of 2012.","Let's move on to asset quality. We're very pleased with the overall improvement of our asset quality. Net charge-offs declined 21% linked quarter and 64% from the prior year, and reached the lowest level in more than 5 years, representing 60 basis points of total average loans. Total loan loss provision was $18 million, which was $96 million less in net charge-offs. As a result, the allowance to loans declined 15 basis points, and was 2.03% at quarter end. Our nonperforming loans declined 10%. In addition, inflows of nonperforming loans declined 39% to $199 million. Our loan loss allowance to nonperforming loans was 114% at the end of the third quarter.","Notably, criticized and classified loans, which is one of the best and earliest indicators of asset quality, continued to decline, with commercial and investor real estate criticized loans down 10% from the second quarter. Classified loans have declined 67% from the peak in the fourth quarter of 2009, and based on what we know today, we expect continued improvement in asset quality going forward.","Let's look at capital and liquidity. Our capital position remains strong as our estimated Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter stood at the 11.6%. Our estimated Tier 1 Common ratio was 11.1%, which is relatively consistent with the prior quarter. We estimate our fully phased-in pro forma Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio will be approximately 10.4% and is well above the minimum threshold. Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company remains solid with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 82%. And lastly, based on our understanding of the new amendments, Regions remains well-positioned to be fully compliant with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio.","So I'd say, in summary, our third quarter results reflect our focus on moving the company forward, and we will continue to seek opportunities to build on this positive momentum and maximize shareholder returns. I'll now turn it back to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of our call.","M. List Underwood","Thanks, David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Now let's open it up, the lines, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay so a couple of questions. One is on loan growth. You indicated that you are likely to see a little bit of a deceleration rate in loan growth as we go into 4Q. And I just wanted to understand where that's coming from because you do have good momentum in many of your asset classes and you indicated that home equity was likely to shrink less. So if you could give us some color on where the moderation comes from.","O. B. Grayson Hall","So I think that when you look at the loan growth that we had in the third quarter, this was a little stronger than we had initially anticipated. We began the third quarter, we had signaled that we thought the third quarter typically, which is a seasonably slow quarter for a lot of our lending activities, we fully expect it to be a little more modest than it was in this quarter. We exceeded our expectations. We still continue to temper our expectations for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter typically is a strong seasonal quarter for us in terms of lending activity. Last year, in particular, was strong due to a lot of anticipated tax structure changes. We don't anticipate a repeat of that this year, but we do anticipate that fourth quarter will be a good quarter. We've got good solid momentum, but we do -- we are being a little conservative, if you will, on what we think our opportunities are in the fourth quarter. We'd certainly be delighted to exceed those expectations, but right now, we've tried to moderate our expectations given the economy.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. But you were -- you're also looking at year-on-year growth as opposed to linked quarter annualized growth?","O. B. Grayson Hall","That's correct.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on indirect auto, nice increase there. Could you maybe give us a little bit of more color? I know that you have been increasing the auto dealers that you've been working with. Could you give us a sense as to what types of products? Are there incremental product types that you're going into as well?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes. We really have not expanded our product types. We've stayed pretty close to the structure we've had all along. We continue to encouraged by the growth in that market, although that market has become more competitive, and I do see some competitions on both rate and term in that segment of our portfolio. What we tried to do is continue to grow our dealer network, and we've been pleased with the number of dealers that we've been able to add. But quite -- but we've been very focused on trying to sell deeper into the existing dealers that we have on board to try to generate more volume from those dealers. But we really have not expanded our product set or our credit criteria for that space. We've tried to remain very disciplined. We probably may be giving up some volume, given the credit disciplines we've got in place, but we still believe it's the correct strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nash of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Nash","Just a follow up on the expense outlook. So you talked about 4Q being flat with 3Q, and just as you're looking forward to 2014, I mean, you're one of the few banks that actually generates some top line growth, and I understand that -- and this is showing that some of the investments are working. But just beyond 4Q, how do we think about the trajectory of expenses into 2014? Should we expect expenses to be down again? Or are you more targeting positive operating leverage? And how should we think about the path of the efficiency ratio?","David J. Turner","Brian, this is David. I will tell you, and it's a little premature for us to give you the '14 expense numbers, but let me give you -- try to frame it up. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, we have made investments to grow our revenue. We've done a pretty good job of managing expenses, and if you look at our noninterest expense in just about any category, average assets at the yields [ph], we're one of the lowest in our industry. We need to grow our revenue, which is why we've made the investments that we have. So an example of that would be in Wealth Management, where that is a relatively new business group for us where we've invested in financial consultants, and we expect that revenue to come. It just doesn't happen in a particular quarter. So I think you kind of nailed it with operating leverage. Our goal is to generate positive operating leverage, and we think we can do that by making smart investments. If you look at the efficiency ratio, obviously, our efficiency ratio was up this quarter. We still expect, over time, to be in that 55%, 59% range. Need a rate increase to help us do that, but our focus is on growing revenue because that's really where we think, overall, the generation of shareholder value comes from, and that's really what our game plan is.","O. B. Grayson Hall","I'd say, Brian, I'd say, additionally, and as we've seen a slowdown in mortgage, that's going to take a little while to play out from an expense standpoint. Clearly, we're adjusting our operating model to what we anticipate to be the volume of activity coming through that channel.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, and then just as a follow-up on the interest margin. Does this kind of play in the changes in the rates or liability, management actions from here? I mean, your outlook's calling for stable, but you still have some funding levers. The securities portfolio appears to have bottomed. Loan yields are declining at a decelerating pace. So I'm just trying to understand, given the move in the margin this quarter, is this just your guidance is coming in a bit conservative? Or is the competition that intense, such that you see a pickup in asset yield pressure from here?","David J. Turner","Well, we had an increase of 8 points on NIM, and we're calling for that to be stable. It's obviously dependent on rates. We benefit from short-term and long-term rates, and so I think we need to see what impact that prepayments will have. That was a big driver of our improvement in NIM, as our premium amortization came down from about $72 million to $59 million. We think if rates will stay kind of where they are right now, we know we've had a little bit of rally today but -- in rates. But we think that stability in the margin for the fourth quarter, in particular, can continue. We do have a couple of levers, as I mentioned, on the deposit cost. There's not as much there as we have seen in the past, but we can pick up a couple of points perhaps. And we still have some -- as we look at long-term debt and think about that, that's less available to us because most of those debt instruments are really tied to capital. So we'll have to consider that in our CCAR process, but we worked our funding cost down to 35 basis points. We have little bit more to go there. But, again, I think our focus is on generating the asset side of the balance sheet, and we're seeing growth. We've now grown in a couple of quarters, and that's encouraging to us.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, and I would just add from a loan competition, loan pricing, loan yields perspective, then I would agree with your earlier comment. You saw pressure on that for several quarters, but the level of pressure seems to have subsided to a degree. Rates seem to have stabilized sort of where they're at today. That could change over time, but right now, we don't see a lot of pressure on that particular category.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Back to the loan yields, quickly, as a follow up there to that discussion, the loan yield was only off about 2 bps in the quarter. Based upon your commentary, you sound pretty confident in the sustainability there. I mean, should we expect that this is the range of a quarterly compression that we could see in that yield? Or could it accelerate a bit?","David J. Turner","John, I think that our guidance was really all-in versus breaking it in individual parts. I think we did have a modest decline in loan yields there. A lot of that's really dependent on mix changes that you see. I think that in this low-rate environment, the longer it persists, you should continue to see a grind down in terms of loan yields, albeit our pace, which was only 2 basis points. Maybe it's not quite that low. Maybe we have a little more of a decline, but I think our funding side protects us quite a bit there. So that's why we're able to give you confidence on the stability of the margin, all-in.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then on the loan growth front, can you talk a little bit more about -- I know you mentioned it quickly in your prepared comments around the commercial real estate inflection, and particularly, in the investors' CRE book. Can you talk about your confidence of seeing that and when we could really see a material turn in that book?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, I think that what we said this time is that we've seen new production improve, albeit from a very low level, and we also would say that new production is more broad across different commercial real estate asset classes than you would have seen 1 quarter or 2 before, but it's still relatively small. And we think that, given where our commercial real estate -- investor commercial real estate portfolios today, is that we could be reaching a point of stabilization, and an inflection point would assume that we have rapid growth beyond that point. I do think we'll stabilize or start to grow modestly in that portfolio, but we're remaining very disciplined and prudent in what we put into that portfolio and -- but I would say that, at this juncture, we're encouraged by some of the increased demand for that product.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And is that 1 quarter or 2 away, that stabilization, Grayson?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I think a lot of it, knowing what we know today, I think that's a reasonable assumption, but some of this is the entities behind these asset sometimes accelerate payoffs and pay downs that we can't necessary anticipate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is a follow-up to Ryan. We're calculating an adjusted efficiency ratio of 68% this quarter, which is higher than the mid 60s that you've been trending over the past quarter. As we look out into your near-term efficiency goals next year, could you get back to that mid-60% level? And is message on this call is that getting back to that mid-60% level really going to come on the revenue side at this point?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, Erika, I think it predominantly comes from revenue side, but it will also come from expense reduction on the mortgage side of our business as well. David, anything you want to add?","David J. Turner","Yes. I think we have been at the 63% range. We popped up to 67%. We expect to work that down on both sides. Also, we have levers on expense all the time. But we really want to be careful that we don't just shoot for a particular goal in any given quarter on efficiency. We want to make the proper investments for the long-term growth of our business. So I think the predominant driver will be revenue. And we expect that to come through our investments that we've made. Now if it doesn't, we adjust expenses accordingly to work that down, because we're not going to sit here and accept a 67% efficiency ratio.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And as a follow-up to that, could you give us a little bit more color on which business lines you're currently investing in?","David J. Turner","Well, it's been across-the-board. So I gave one example earlier. Wealth Management was our new business group that we started investing in this year. We've hired quite a few financial consultants. If you look at our headcount additions, almost half of those are revenue generation folks. So Wealth Management is one area. We've hired additional people in our branch distribution channel. That's where the vast majority of our products are sold. And we needed more people to grow revenue, grow households out in that channel. So those are two. We're also invested in relationship managers across the board in multiple geographies, and especially lending and general business. We have the capital liquidity. We're ready to go. We're ready to invest and make -- and grow our revenue, because you cannot generate shareholder value in the long-term from expense reductions. You got to make prudent investments to get the revenue going and we are -- that's our bet we're making, and if that doesn't come, we'll adjust accordingly. But it's really across the board. There's no one particular place.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray of ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I'm going to beat the expense horse one more time. Just curious, when you think about the headcount additions, let's say, in areas like Wealth Management, how much more hiring do you think needs to occur? And then what kind of revenue lift or productivity goals do you have there and sort of what's the breakeven? Does it take 6 months, 12 months, 18 months? Just curious on that.","David J. Turner","Yes, I think, we make -- so you picked on Wealth Management on that particular one. We make investments in people who'll pay for themselves within a year. And so it's pretty quick. And different businesses have different time frames in terms of when they pay for the investment. So again, we can react pretty quickly. We mentioned the reaction we can make on mortgage. Our mortgage, the production for purchases is up. We have mortgage loan originators dealing with that, but then we have adjusted the back office. So we're moving our expenses around to give us the best return we can. But these investments that were making in revenue generation areas, we should see revenue growing quarter to quarter to quarter. The question is different investments have a different length of time to return.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if we just switch sides to the overall balance sheet, I know loan growth was very healthy this quarter. But total interest-earning assets declined a little bit versus second quarter. Where do you see the overall balance sheet heading? And should we just expect more of a mixed change, meaning more loans, less securities going forward?","David J. Turner","Yes, Keith, what you saw on the earning asset change was really the recognition of the transaction that we made last quarter, the deleverage. We sold some investment securities late in the quarter last quarter, so they weren't -- they didn't manifest themselves until a decline in the average assets, until this quarter. We're kind of there. We think we've stabilized earning asset levels, and we grow from here. So that was really the anomaly that you saw. If you go back and look at ending, you can kind of see what I'm talking about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","As we think about some of the compliance and regulatory costs that you mentioned, are you able to size how big they are either in tax-free terms or maybe the change versus a year ago? And are you fully ramped there? Or is there still some increase to come related to those areas?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Matt, I think that the -- clearly, in the environment we're all operating in, we're -- it's an evolving, involving [ph] environment that we continue to make investments in audit, in compliance and in risk management. I think those investments will continue to mature over time. As we're obviously able to recognize more of these processes and be more productive, you'll see some rationalization of those resources. But for right now, I think, we still see an involving and increasing risk management environment, and we're continuing to make investments as we see appropriate. That being said, we have to figure out a way to fund that, pay for that on the business side of the house. And that's why we're investing equally in the customer-facing, revenue-producing side. That tends to be somewhat optimistic -- I mean opportunistic because we are looking for talented team members to add to our team, because our primary focus is serving our customers and we need good bankers to be able to do that and we are finding those in select markets and making those investments when we believe they've got fairly rapid payback.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just switching gears on the premium amortization. I think, it's about 23 basis-point drag to the net interest margin this quarter. And as we think about that drag going away over time, assuming rates stay here, do we just think about kind of an average life of the portfolio 3 to 4 years? And it's probably not exactly straight lined, but that thought process or...","David J. Turner","Yes, Matt. So we were down quite a bit. Our duration is right at 4 years. You can't straight line it, but you can do that as a proxy. I think starting the quarter, we had right at $800 million of amortizable premium. We amortized $59 million, so the delta is left. We do make investments in each quarter, but -- so we're down to $740-ish million of amortizable premium. So you can do your math to get a proxy for that over the 4-year duration.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess with where the rates are right now, are you still buying bonds or premiums? Or -- I'm sure the premiums are a lot smaller than they were before, but is it still mostly premiums that you're buying?","David J. Turner","That's true. They're just not as large as you mentioned, but yes, we do.","Operator","Your next question come from the line of Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was going to ask you about deposits. As you're making the significant shift to the lower-cost deposits, are you seeing total deposits kind of continuing to move lower? It does look like, if you look at the period in numbers, you're at an inflection point that you might start to see deposits growing again. Is that kind of what you're thinking about and starting to see some stabilization, even grow there?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, Marty, as we sort of going through the cycle, and to David's earlier point, deposits costs are down to 13 basis points. Not sure how much room there is, but if they go lower, maybe it's a point or 2. But what we've seen is now time deposits are 11% of our book. We're still growing low-cost deposits but not growing the time book. And as that time deposit book, as they have maturities, we're retaining just over 70% of the customers who have maturing CDs in the Time Deposit segment. Those that we don't retain, some portion of them are putting monies in their -- into money market or into savings, we're at -- we're very close to the point where we believe, we can start showing net growth in total deposits depending on customer behavior. But as we've got our book down to this roughly 11% mix of time deposits, I think we're a much better position as you look forward. We think this has been a good strategy for us. We think it's really helped us during this point in time. That being said, as rates increase, we're trying to model what happens to deposits. There's not a lot of historical models for how deposits will react in this kind of market because we've never really been here before. But we're spending an awful lot of time understanding what we believe to be customer behaviors in a rising rate environment.","David J. Turner","Marty, I'll add something that's quite interesting this quarter on deposits. So we had been retaining in total about 70% of our deposits, whether it be in CDs, rolling over into a new CD or other core deposits. That number was up to about 80%, so 70% of it, as Grayson mentioned, went into -- retained as a CD. But we had -- the delta there going into core deposits. So it's quite -- it wasn't the run-off that we had seen earlier. And I -- we can suspect that was related to rates have just been lower and the delta between what's maturing and what's going on is not as great as it was. But we feel good about our deposits balances. The investments we've made that we've talked about in terms of people should also help us grow those deposits, and we're looking forward to that, because you never have enough low-cost deposits.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","When I was just looking at the period end numbers, if you look at interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing, the total number actually was up over the average. So it looked like it was starting to signal that inflection point. And then, lastly, David, I was just curious, as you've made this big shift out of time deposits, when rates start to go up, do you think you can kind of go back in and start recapturing some of that market share when the time and the market's appropriate?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Marty, this is -- what we've tried to do is during this time period, we're actually running some number of different strategies in some of our markets to try to determine what the customer behavior will be. That -- today, our loan-to-deposit ratio is 82%. So we don't necessarily need additional deposits today, although we're always looking for new customers and trying to grow our deposit base. And so, we are running a number of different strategies across our markets so that we can find what's the best strategy for raising deposits when that time occurs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, looking at charge-offs, it looks like much of the sequential improvement came from lower C&I and owner-occupied CRE. And I'm curious to know there if that was a function of lower units of charge-off or lesser degree of severity, or higher degrees of recovery, or what the lot loss content experience was.","O. B. Grayson Hall","We've got our Chief Credit Officer, Barb Godin, with us today. We'll ask Barb if she'd answer that question.","Barbara Godin","Certainly. It's a little bit of both. What we've seen is the granularity of our portfolio has clearly gotten a lot smaller. We really don't have that many credits, particularly those that charged off, that were more than $1 million. We've only had a handful. So that explains a lot of those averages coming down. Same thing with number of units came down and the loss of [indiscernible] that had also came down.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then maybe just jumping back to the NIM for a moment. Looks like you've got a couple of chunks of long-term debt coming up in '14. I think it's $350 million and something like $850 million in '15. What would be your intent with respect to refunding those maturities at this point?","David J. Turner","Yes. We constantly look at our maturities a couple of years in advance. We will get to a point we need to add new long-term debt. So we do have a slug coming due in the latter part of 2014, and we've dealt with that already in our liquidity profile because of our policy. So we would -- you should expect us to be in the market at -- in the not-too-distant future.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And if I may just sneak in one more. The -- with respect to the -- it looks like, sorry, back to your credit. The 30- to 89-day past due seem to be sneaking up in a number of buckets. And I'm just wondering how we reconcile that with the overall decline in asset quality trends. So that's it for me.","Barbara Godin","It's Barb Godin again. A lot of that does have to do with seasonality, especially as you think of any -- at the consumer bucket. With back to School, et cetera, happening, we typically do see the 30- to 89-day delinquencies go up. On the Business Services side in general, that's usually 1 or 2 accounts. We've looked at all of them. There is nothing in there that suggests that there's any trends at all.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rose of Raymond James.","Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to get the little sense on the Now Banking initiative. It seems like there was good increase in utilization there. Can we just kind of get an overview for that contributed to deposit service charges and what your outlook is there?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I mean the -- we continue to look at ways to improve our product set to serve our customers. And the Now Banking suite has been an attractive offering for us. It's growing from a relatively low base. So the contribution to our earnings from that product set are still relatively small, but growing. And so -- but more importantly, it's given us the opportunity to really serve our customers and to try to attract new customers into our branches. I think the most exciting part is 60% of the customers are new to Regions. So it's given us an opportunity to really attract more people into our branch offices and garner more utilization of that branch channel to try to serve an even greater number of customers. David, do you want to talk a little bit about contribution?","David J. Turner","Yes. I think, as Grayson mentioned, they're still relatively small. I think, kind of if you look at the run rate for the year, we'd be in the $15 million to $20 million range and growing. So we're encouraged by the growth, not because of just the dollars today, but where we think it can go over time, serving customer segments that hadn't been served before as well. And it gives us a chance to grow households there. And if you look at our footprint, you look at the opportunities for Now Banking suite, it's pretty large. So we're encouraged by that.","Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-on to that, is there updates is kind of working with the CFPB in regards to this product? And have they given you any additional feedback?","David J. Turner","Not on this product. No, this is really prepaid debit card and check cashing and expedited bill pay. Those are the kind of products [indiscernible] and funds transfer. So they're really not a -- these are good core products and we don't see issues relative to that agency on this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on commercial loan utilization rates. A number of your competitors have said that those softened in the third quarter versus the second quarter. I'm curious if you've had the same experience on what your expectations are for the fourth quarter.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Matt, we haven't seen that. I mean, our utilization rates of lines is relatively flat, didn't move much at all during the quarter. If fourth quarter follows historical trends, we'll probably see a little increase in utilization. But so far, just really haven't seen much movement in it this quarter.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just pulling up a little bit, in terms of the buyback, you mentioned that you're pretty fully used, your current authorization. And is it fair to assume that you would not really plan on doing much more in the buyback front until you are out of the 2014 capital planning process?","David J. Turner","Yes, I mean as you know, any account actually requires approval from our regulatory supervisors. So we executed, as we mentioned -- when the CCAR came out with what our plan was, we executed in accordance with that plan as our board allowed and as regulatory supervisors authorized. So if we want to have additional return to the shareholders via buyback or dividend, it requires us to submit a CCAR filing and ask for permission. [indiscernible] as we do 2014 CCAR.","Operator","Your next mission comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I had to jump off, so I apologize if you've answered this question. Can you guys share with us, on indirect the auto, you've had obviously good growth here. There's been some commentary in the media about the Consumer Protection Bureau going after the dealers with the dealer reserve. What's your guys' view on that? How can you manage that process if they're forced, the dealers, to lower that reserve going forward?","David J. Turner","Couple of things, Gerard, that I'd point to. First, the banks represent about 42% of this market. So there are captives [ph] and others that are in this market. There has been some indication of wanting to get that down. We have seen competition come down to where we've been. And we continue to monitor that, monitor our dealers. We have an aggressive program to go in and make sure our dealers are being fair to the customer. And when we find the dealer is not, we don't do business with the dealer. It's pretty straightforward, and we feel very confident with what we're doing. That being said, we'll have to wait and see. And as we know, there's a -- the regulatory environment can change, and we have to adapt and overcome. We've done that over and over through the numerous changes that have occurred over the past several years, and we'll continue to do that in this case. But we feel confident where we are right now that we're doing the right thing by our customer.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question, shifting gears, obviously you guys are very well-capitalized. And I know regional banks do not know what their Basel III Tier 1 Common ratios will be under the new rulings. Clearly, 7% is the minimum, but maybe there'll be a small SIFI buffer. When you do your CCAR, what's to prevent you from -- for asking for a 100% payback -- or return of capital, I should say, of earnings 2014?","David J. Turner","Physically, nothing is to prevent us. The -- what we don't want that happen is -- it's incumbent upon us to manage our capital in an appropriate manner. And that starts with our Board of Directors and goes through all of us at managed capital. And there's a lot of us through this capital planning process to that. So we want to make sure that we have an appropriate amount of capital. And then whatever we deem to be appropriate is submitted to our regulatory supervisors for their sign off. And that includes spot capital and stress capital. So nothing prevents us. It just needs -- we need to put in something that makes sense that's credible that's based on our strategy and what we're going to do with our balance sheet. And there are a lot of factors that go into managing capital. So it's not as easy to say just -- clearly have plenty of capital today to be able to return 100%. We haven't seen that in our industry. We clearly want to utilize our capital in the most efficient way when that's -- whether it be dividends or share buybacks. But most importantly, we use the capital that shareholders gave us and that we generated through our operations to invest in our business going forward. And that's what we primarily want to do first. And we think loan growth, investing in businesses, like our credit card portfolio that we bought, sometimes M&A, will come back and that'll be a place to utilize capital. And if we can't do those things, return it to the shareholders is right thing to do. So all of that goes into our thought process. We're in the middle of that as we speak, and we think we'll have a very good -- we have a very good capital planning process with good governance and we'll exercise that and file our CCAR in 2014. And you'll see the results of that soon afterwards, but nothing's technically to prevent you from doing it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gaston Ceron of Morningstar Equity Research.","Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the issue of loan growth for a second. As you look at across your key markets, whether you're looking at Florida or Alabama, or some of the other large ones, I mean is there any way to kind of parse through quickly and get some color on how loan growth is behaving different -- demand for loans is behaving differently in some of these key markets? Or is it pretty even across the board, would you say?","O. B. Grayson Hall","No, I think that if you -- you look at sort of our loan growth, and I would -- actually, we decipher that geographically and also by lending segment. And you've got, geographically, clearly a lot of the growth is -- has come out of the markets that have energy-related activities, Louisiana and Texas. A lot of our growth also has come out of some of the Midwest markets in St. Louis and also Indianapolis, been particularly strong in those markets. But even in the markets that have been the most challenged, if you will, like a Florida, we're seeing the pace of loan run-off there materially slow and the pace of new production improve. So as I mentioned earlier in my comments, I believe I mentioned this, is that we grew -- in our 16-state footprint, we grew loans in 70% of our markets. We divide those 16 states in 19 markets and we grew in 70% of those. And so it's broader this quarter than it was last quarter, geographically. It's also broader from a lending segment as well. Still -- there's still a lot of dominance in the large commercial and corporate space, but we did see more activity in the commercial middle market and even in small business, and even in consumer this quarter, than we saw previous quarter. So incrementally better, incrementally broader is what I would say. And geographically, geographically not all geographies are behaving the same today, but closer than they were.","Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And are you growing any more optimistic about Florida, would you say, or not?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Ask your question again, please?","Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, are you growing more optimistic about Florida getting even better or not? It's holding steady...","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, we are. I mean the housing recovery, we say, is real. Florida was at the center of this economic storm, and so recovering a little slower and later than some of our other markets, but clearly recovering and we're optimistic about it. We think long term it's going to be a good market for us. We've just got to be disciplined in how we do business there.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","A couple of clean-up ones here. So, David, I was just wondering, can you help us dimensionalize the magnitude of the cost reduction that could come out of the Mortgage business as you get around to that point of level setting that back to the new revenue run rate?","David J. Turner","Ken, it's hard to come up with a point estimate on dollars. I think what we need to do is adjust it according to what the revenue opportunities. Our revenue opportunities are different than the other areas. Remember, we're more of a purchase shop than we were a refinance shop. So I think, that we've seen still pretty strong demand over our purchase mortgage. We want to make sure we have mortgage loan originators out there. We've grown that, but we've reduced our back office 22% thus far, and that's primarily through reductions in temporary staff and overtime, and some people. But that's really what the driver is. Obviously, if revenue is down, commissions are down. You see that pretty quick. So I think, what I'd leave you with is we're confident we can adjust mortgage pretty rapidly. It just may not follow a given quarter. That being said, that business is very strong over the past couple of years. Gains on sale were large. All that's starting to rationalize a little bit, but it's a great shop. They do a fabulous job in the Mortgage group, in the Mortgages Servicing group. And we will continue to make investments in appropriate places and we'll cut back on other areas and adjust accordingly.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","All right. And then just in terms of just -- you're continuing to fund this growth build-out, is there anything you guys are contemplating or have in place on the branch and stamping side to also cut out of that side of it as well?","O. B. Grayson Hall","We spend -- it's a great question, and we spend an awful lot of time looking at all of our sales and service channel. And the branch channel is one of our more expensive channels and we continue to monitor the behavior of our customers and the utilization of our customers in those offices. You'll continue to see us. We've got 1,700 -- a little over 1,700 offices. We continue to look at the size of those offices and the technology that's embedded in those offices, and in terms of where there's opportunities for us to make that delivery system more efficient and more effective. And you'll continue to see that out of us. We don't have anything to announce today. But when you look at the way we're servicing our customers, we continue to invest in each channel, but we continue to rationalize each channel at the same time. And then we do that on a regular basis in our branch channel.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","All right. And a little clean-up one. Relative to this Wealth Management business sale, can you talk about any revenue and expense impact that that'll have going forward?","David J. Turner","Well, we've made investments in the -- in our Wealth Management Group. Those financial consultants I was talking to you about, we've added probably over 100 [ph] people during the year. If you could just compare our third quarter of '13 in terms of some of our fee income-related to this business, we're up 67%. And I think that that's really important to us. We have cut businesses out. You saw us -- we had a disposable on a segment -- or in Wealth Management that wasn't as profitable as we wanted it to be. So we've made adjustments there. But Wealth Management is relatively new and we'll continue to make investments to grow that revenue and feel very confident that revenue comes pretty quickly.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes. So David, on that sale piece, will that be a noticeable change, either the revenues that go away or the expenses that go with it, to the point of it not being a very profitable part of the business? Does it have a noticeable effect on the financials going forward?","David J. Turner","Ken, I doubt you'll even notice, that you'll even see it. It does it impact us some, but it was pretty negligible. So I don't think you'll -- I don't think you miss it net-net after expenses that we're taking out after revenue loss.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my last, last one on expenses is professional fees you guys are spending for the regulatory side and getting ready for CCAR and whatnot, does that eventually crest and roll back over? Is that bit of a temporary blip that you're seeing there, or does that roll over at all?","David J. Turner","Well, you can see volatility in professional fees. You can look at any particular quarter and see the kind of volatility we have. We're in a unique environment, our whole industry is. And so you seen that a little higher than we want to be. So we think, in time, if we can get the environment stabilized, we think those costs rationalize as well and come down to a more acceptable level, I should say.","O. B.

My name is Paula, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.","M. List Underwood","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation on our call this morning. Our presenters today are our President and Chief Executive Officer, Grayson Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Turner. Also here and available to answer questions are Matt Lusco, our Chief Risk Officer; and Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer.","As part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","With that said, let me remind you that, in this call, we may make forward-looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical information, but rather, are related to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Those statements are based on general assumptions and are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found on our forward-looking statement that is located in the appendix of the presentation.","Now that that's covered, let me turn it over to Grayson.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Thank you, List, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Regions and appreciate you taking the time to participate in our third quarter 2012 earnings conference call.","Regions performed well in the third quarter, growing both fee-based revenue and bottom line profits as we continued to successfully execute our business plans and realize continued asset quality improvement. Earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.22 per diluted share.","Our third quarter performance builds on a solid first half of 2012 and reflects the positive change underway at Regions, a change that is better positioning us for long-term outperformance and change that is enabling us to prudently and profitably grow our business and expand our customer base despite a sluggish and uneven operating environment.","To accomplish this, Regions has been and continues to be focused on diversifying and building our revenue sources, streamlining our processes to better serve our customers, improving our productivity and efficiency and providing new technology that supports our customers' ever-changing needs, ensuring superior risk management and further strengthening our balance sheet.","Turning to third quarter results, you can see earlier evidence of the progress that we're making. Fee income posted strong growth during the third quarter, driven by record mortgage banking revenues. Mortgage continue to benefit from HARP 2 refinancing, and total refinancings improved 15% from the second quarter. Through HARP 2, we have refinanced $1.2 billion of home mortgages through the end of September. Notably, approximately 50% of the applications were for customers new to Regions mortgage.","Total loan production increased 2% linked-quarter, fueled by mortgage and indirect auto. Loans outstanding were down 1% as customers continued to deleverage and political economic uncertainty weighs on demand. However, commercial and industrial loan growth remain healthy, helping to somewhat offset the favorable decline in Investor Real Estate portfolio.","We continue to improve our funding mix, growing our low-cost deposits while reducing our higher-rate time deposits,  and there is further opportunity for improvement in deposit cost and funding mix. Let me also point out that according to the FDIC deposit data recently released, we have maintained our top 5 market share position in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and in Tennessee.","In the third quarter, our net interest margin declined sequentially, partially due to a prolonged low-interest rate environment. David Turner will provide more details in just a moment.","The Federal Reserve's QE3 program announced mid-September calls for purchases of large quantities of mortgage-backed securities for an indefinite period, driving down reinvestment yields and putting greater, longer-lasting pressure on yields than we previously assumed. While the third quarter decline in our net interest margin was disappointed -- disappointing, we are hopeful that we'll be able to hold it and our net interest income reasonably steady over the next several quarters, while improving funding costs, partially offsetting these pressures. Keep in mind that our low loan-to-deposit ratio provides considerable opportunity to add profitable loans to our balance sheet once customers have greater confidence in the economic and political outlook and are more willing to borrow.","Let's move on to expenses. As discussed previously, expense control remains a top priority at Regions, and we are focused daily on identifying opportunities to improve our productivity and cost structure while providing products and services that our customers want and deserve. To that end, in the third quarter, we continued the implementation of new technology in our branches that will not only lower operating costs, but will improve cross-sell capabilities and enhance the overall customer experience in Regions' branches.","During the quarter, we also completed the conversion of our credit card portfolio to Regions systems, introducing a new suite of card offerings and launched a new card advertising campaign. Although these actions resulted in elevated third quarter expenses, we are confident that they will provide attractive long-term returns. Currently, only about 14% of our customers has a Regions credit card. Over time, we believe we can increase penetration rates to more than 20%.","Importantly, we delivered another quarter of asset quality improvement, allowing us to invest more of our time and resources in developing and executing profitable growth strategies. Simply put, Regions is transitioning to growth, prudent and profitable growth. While current low interest rates, sub-par economic growth and political uncertainty are creating headwinds, we are making solid progress, executing our business plans and building a foundation that is better positioning Regions for long-term outperformance.","Before I turn the call over to David, let me briefly note that earlier today, we announced that, assuming market conditions are favorable, we do expect to consider issuing preferred stock in the near future. David will elaborate a bit more later. However, we're limited in terms of what we can discuss at this time in this meeting.","Let me turn the call over to David, who will discuss the third quarter's financial details. Afterwards, I'll come back and make a few closing comments before taking questions. David?","David J. Turner","Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin on Slide 3 with a quick snapshot of our third quarter 2012 financial results. We reported net income available to common shareholders from continuing operations of $312 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Pretax pre-provision income from continuing operations, or PPI, was $481 million. Net interest income was $817 million, and the resulting net interest margin was 3.08%.","Non-interest revenues increased 5% on a linked-quarter basis, and total revenue increased $5 million linked quarter. Non-interest expenses were up 3% and, from a credit standpoint, net charge-offs were steady linked quarter, while the total loan loss provision was $33 million.","Let's get into some of the details, starting with the balance sheet. Overall balance sheet trends this quarter were driven by continued growth in our commercial and industrial portfolio, as well as indirect auto.  However, this growth was offset by declines in investor real estate and owner-occupied commercial real estate. As a result, average loans for the third quarter were down $973 million or 1% linked quarter. Average balances were impacted by a decline of $623 million or 6% in the Investor Real Estate portfolio. At quarter end, investor real estate stood at $8.7 billion, down $3.2 billion from 1 year ago. This portfolio now comprises only 12% of our total loan portfolio compared to 15% a year ago. We expect this portfolio to continue to decline, however, at a moderate pace over the next several quarters.","Our owner-occupied commercial real estate portfolio, which is comprised primarily of community banking and small business and which tends to exhibit the same behavioral trends as consumers, declined this quarter, largely due to deleveraging. Linked quarter, we experienced an average loan decline of $338 million or 3%. Although price competition has increased, a majority of the decline was related to payoffs, prepayments and scheduled paydowns.","However, as noted, commercial and industrial loan demand remained solid in the third quarter, driven by our integrated approach to specialized lending, where our local bankers work with experienced, specialized lenders to meet customer needs. Total production for this portfolio was a solid $9.7 billion.","During the quarter, we transferred $185 million of remaining loans related to the Morgan Keegan sale off of our balance sheet. Excluding these loans, commercial and industrial loans on an ending basis grew $570 million or 2.2% linked quarter. Pipelines remain solid and are slightly above the same level at this time last year as our clients fund capital expenditures, working capital needs and, increasingly, M&A activity. Line utilization on commercial and industrial loans was up 60 basis points to 43.9%, and commitments have increased 12% over the last year.","Our consumer services portfolio, which makes up 39% of our total loan portfolio, remained steady this quarter despite consumer deleveraging and our continued strategy to sell fixed-rate conforming mortgages. As I will discuss in a minute, these sales led to a material increase in mortgage income this quarter.","Declines in our home equity portfolio continue as customers take advantage of opportunities to refinance. However, this quarter, we launched a new home equity loan product to attract a new set of customers that will increase our overall home equity production.","And moving on to credit card, as Grayson mentioned, during the quarter, we successfully converted the servicing of our Regions branded credit card portfolio. It's important to note that we are focused on expanding our relationships with our current customers now that we can better control their experience with us. Although overall credit card balances are down due to consumer deleveraging, year-to-date production has increased 44% compared to the same period in 2011.","Indirect auto experienced a record quarter of production since we re-entered the business in the second quarter of 2011. The loan production in this portfolio increased 10% over the last quarter, and average loan balances increased 6.3%. Currently, we have over 1,700 dealers in our network and plan to have over 2,000 by year end, all within our existing footprint.","In total, consumer loan production increased 7% linked quarter, totaling $3 billion in the third quarter.","Total loan yields were down 11 basis points linked quarter to 4.18% due to the prolonged low-rate environment and increasing pricing competition, primarily within our middle market segment.","Moving on to deposits, as shown on Slide 5, deposit mix and cost continued to improve in the third quarter. Average low-cost deposits increased $385 million from last quarter and $4.3 billion from 1 year ago. Average time deposits fell to just 16% of total deposits, down from 22% a year ago, as a result of our continued success in repricing these deposits and growing low-cost deposits. This positive repricing and mix shift resulted in deposit costs declining to 28 basis points for the quarter, down 4 basis points from second quarter and 18 basis points from 1 year ago. And we expect to drive additional improvement in deposit cost. We have approximately $3 billion of CDs that are scheduled to mature in the fourth quarter that carry an average interest rate of 2.1%.","Looking ahead to 2013, we currently have $7.2 billion of CDs that will mature. Of that, $4.9 billion mature in the first half with an average rate of 1.69% and $2.3 billion in the second half with an average rate of 0.66%. Now this compares to our current average going-on rates for new CDs of approximately 20 basis points. Further, our overall total funding cost improved to 56 basis points, a decrease of 4 basis points linked quarter and 19 basis points year-over-year.","Now let's turn to net interest income on Slide 6. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $830 million, down 2% or $20 million linked quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.08%, down 8 basis points from second quarter's 3.16%. As a reminder, last quarter included approximately 3 basis points of temporary lift resulting from a larger-than-normal volume of full payoffs of interest and principal on non-accruing loans. Overall, prepayments and reinvestment of maturities of higher-rate fixed loans and investments contributed approximately 6 basis points of net interest margin compression and $16 million of net interest income pressure quarter-over-quarter. Of course, an offset to mortgage prepayments is the positive impact associated with mortgage non-interest revenue, which I will discuss in further detail shortly. Also, the low-rate environment increases the unrealized profits associated with our investment portfolio.","For QE3, the Federal Reserve has sustained and recently intensified its efforts to keep interest rates low. As a result, interest rates on long-term fixed-rate mortgages are at record lows, as are yields in agency mortgage-backed securities. Therefore, it will be challenging to grow net interest income and net interest margin materially if the current economic conditions persist. However, we continue to see opportunities to protect the margin by further reducing deposit costs, which will help to support a relatively stable margin into 2013.","As Grayson alluded to earlier, assuming market conditions are favorable, we expect to consider issuing preferred stock in the near future. If commenced, the proceeds from this issuance will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include redeeming certain trust preferred securities. At this time, we are not able to make any additional comments regarding this potential issuance.","Now let's turn to non-interest revenue on Slide 7. Third quarter non-interest revenue was up 5% linked quarter. Mortgage banking revenue reached a record high in the quarter, driven by refinances and new home purchases, aided by the government's HARP 2 program. Approximately 63% of mortgage loans were refinances, and 37% were new home purchases, and 21% of total loans were HARP 2 related. Earlier in the year, we established a goal to reach $1 billion in HARP 2 related loan production, and as of the end of this quarter, we reached $1.2 billion, exceeding our original goal by over $200 million. As a result, mortgage revenue totaled $106 million, up 18% over second quarter and more than 50% over the prior year. Mortgage loan production of approximately $2.2 billion during the third quarter reflects an 8% increase from $2.1 billion in the second quarter. We've been able to increase market share by providing customers access to local market -- mortgage bankers and increased capacity through 2 new HARP loan production facilities.","Let's move on to expenses on Slide 8. Non-interest expenses totaled $869 million, an increase of 3% linked quarter. During the quarter, credit-related expenses increased $12 million, primarily attributable to quarter-over-quarter fluctuations and net gains realized on held-for-sale property. Specifically, last quarter, credit-related expenses benefited from net gains of $26 million as compared to $17 million of gains in the third quarter. Also, other real estate expenses increased $3 million linked quarter.","In addition, marketing expenses were elevated this quarter due to the credit card conversion. Salaries and benefits were also up 4% linked quarter, partially related to an increase in incentives associated with record mortgage production and an increase in long-term incentives.","Looking ahead, we continue to expect overall 2012 expenses from continuing operations to be down from the 2011 level, excluding the 2011 goodwill impairment, as a result of our continued and disciplined focus on cost control.","Let's look at our credit metrics on Slide 9. We continued to make progress with respect to asset quality in the third quarter as several credit metrics improved, including criticized loans, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. Net charge-offs were down 1% linked quarter and exceeded the loan loss provision by $229 million, resulting in a total loan loss provision of $33 million. Inflows of nonperforming loans increased to $463 million from $315 million linked quarter, but are down 39% from last year. As increase is primarily driven by the seasonality of our credit process, it does not impact our overall expectations for continued gradual improvement in credit metrics.","During the quarter, we had one customer loan for $40 million that transferred into nonperforming loans and was subsequently resolved prior to September 30. Additionally, there were approximately $30 million of letters of credit that funded at quarter end, resulting in nonperforming loans. We currently estimate that we have approximately $300 million to $400 million of potential problem commercial and investor real estate loans which could migrate into nonperforming status in the fourth quarter. Nonperforming loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased $31 million or 2% linked quarter. Held-for-sale loans decreased $68 million or 34% linked quarter, and the other real estate owned decreased $17 million or 8%. As a result, total nonperforming assets decreased $116 million or 5% linked quarter, but were down 35% from the prior year.","Notably, Business Services' criticized and classified loans, one of the best and earliest indicators of asset quality improvement, continued to decline, with criticized loans down 6% or $305 million from the second quarter, and down $2.2 billion or 30% from last year.","Our coverage ratios remained solid. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance to nonperforming loans stood at 109% or 1.1x. Meanwhile, our loan loss allowance to loans was 2.74% at the end of the third quarter. Based on what we know today, we expect continued improvement in asset quality going forward.","Let's take a look at capital and liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong as our estimated Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter stood at 11.5% and our estimated Tier 1 common ratio increased 50 basis points to 10.5%. Tangible book value reached $7.02 per share in the third quarter, up from $6.69 in the second quarter, which is an increase of 5% linked quarter. We're all waiting to receive additional feedback regarding the proposed Basel III NPRs. However, based on our interpretation of the NPRs, we estimate our pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will be approximately 8.7%. Now the NPR comment period has ended and changes could result, which could differ materially from capital ratios that we've estimated.","Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company remains solid, with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 79%. And lastly, based on our interpretation, we are well positioned with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio.","So in closing, this quarter's results reflect our ongoing efforts to focus on what we can control. We increased loan production by 2% over the last quarter. We achieved record mortgage revenues, asset quality improvement, and we continue to focus on providing our customers with new and innovative products and services that help them succeed financially. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Grayson for his closing remarks.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Thank you, David. Regions is entering the final quarter of 2012 with a solid foundation for growth, a foundation that we are strengthening each and every quarter. We are diversifying and improving our business mix to help maximize our growth opportunities, as well as identifying and building profitable revenue streams that have the potential to expand throughout the current economic cycle. We are focused on improving our productivity and efficiency, including controlling our day-to-day expenses, undertaking initiatives to streamline operations and investing in technology that enhances delivery and productivity. We're working hard to understand customers' needs and offer advice, guidance, and the best products and services will help them make better financial decisions. We believe we can create the kind of shared value our communities need to thrive by offering competitive products that are delivered in a transparent and trustworthy manner. And finally, we remain disciplined in our risk management, committed to growth that is both prudent and profitable.","While our work isn't complete, I am confident the business plans we're executing will lead to ultimate outperformance for Regions and reward our stakeholders over the long term.","Operator, with that, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Pancari of Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","A little bit more about your margin outlook here. I knew you indicated that you expect a relatively stable outlook, but can you help us quantify your expectations, just given the compression we saw on the loan yield and the securities yield this quarter? Just curious how that may interpret into continued compression further out.","David J. Turner","Yes, John. This is David. We -- just to make sure we level set, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we were at 3.16% in the last quarter, second quarter. We had guided to 3.13% being kind of the normal recurring margin for that quarter given that we had 3 points of favorable interest reversals. From that, we had indicated we would be relatively stable. Obviously, QE3 came in, in the latter part of the quarter, which put pressure on rates, in particular the reinvestments that we have in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. We are doing a couple things. I mentioned the amount of deposits that we have maturing in the fourth quarter and the improvement in our diversification of our investment portfolio. So when you look at some of the things we're doing in the investment portfolio, changing that risk profile, moving new investments into new issue CMBS and corporate bonds, we think that, that will serve to offset some of the downward pressure we see in the reinvestment rates. So with that, we believe we can guide to a stable margin from where we are today. And we say relatively stable. You can look at where we are today and give us a point or 2 either way, but we think those would be relatively stable in the fourth quarter and into 2013.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","All right. And then secondly, back to credit. I know you indicated the potential movement of $300 million to $400 million of investor real estate onto NPL status for the quarter. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing there? What types of loans are these and what changed during the quarter to highlight these?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Be glad to. When you look at the guidance we've given after the second quarter, we thought the migration to nonperforming status would be in the $300 million to $400 million range. If you look at what happened in the quarter and you look at sort of our loan portfolio today, and in particular the distressed loans in our portfolio, we've really gotten our portfolio down to the point that, even though we've gotten very granular, there still is the opportunity for just a handful of credits to move that number from one quarter to another. If you look at our overall credit trends, we continue to be favorably encouraged. Most of our trends have a very favorable direction to them. And if you look at the composition of those loans, we continue to believe that for the fourth quarter, we'll be back in that $300 million to $400 million range. In addition, as David had indicated earlier, if you look, there are a few credits that were late in the quarter making that transition, but early in this quarter, leaving that status. We've still continued to be encouraged by the level of resolutions that we're seeing. And I think that as we move forward, we still remain confident that the quality of our loan assets is improving. And I'll ask Barb Godin, our Chief Credit Officer, to add some color to that.","Barbara Godin","And the only other thing I would say, John, beyond what Grayson said is, I would remind everyone that typically our third quarter is our seasonal quarter. And for the last couple of quarters, as you'll note -- the last couple of years, I'm sorry, is you'll note our third quarter typically goes up, followed by a better fourth quarter. I would anticipate that seasonal pattern continuing again. As we look through the numbers and what we saw coming in, there is nothing that really stood out. I would also note that 53% of our nonperforming loans in total are now current containing as agreed on the Business Services side, an improvement from the 46% we saw last quarter. So again, there's nothing of major note that we saw or nothing that was disturbing that we saw coming in. As we did point out, there were a couple of large items that moved that number this quarter, and again, we hope to -- even the letters of credit, have those resolved as we move into the fourth quarter.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Like we've said before, there's going to be some unevenness in our numbers from quarter-to-quarter, but from our perspective, no change in our direction. Our direction is still moving in the same direction it has been for the past several quarters.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I don't know. So no impact on charge-offs or provision as a result of this move that you're expecting?","O. B. Grayson Hall","No. I mean, in fact, we look at our portfolio today, the composition of our past portfolio, our prime portfolio continues to improve, as well as Barb mentioned, the composition of our nonperforming part of our portfolio. Like she just said, 52% of it is paying as agreed. We feel like we've got it appropriately reserved. And while our level of nonperforming loans are high relative to our peer group, so we think that our charge-offs will stay elevated for some period of time, but our allowance is sufficient to cover that, and we continue to keep a higher allowance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up to John's question on the margin. Can you give us a sense of how much premium amortization there is left in the portfolio? And I believe, David, you commented that you are hopeful to keep NII flat. But if you look, you're seeing loan yields compressed. We only saw 1 month of QE in the quarter. So do you think you can actually grow the loan portfolio over the next few quarters to offset margin pressure?","David J. Turner","Your first answer is, we have about $1 billion in premium amortization and booked premium at the end of the quarter. And in terms of loan growth, we obviously are working hard, but want to be prudent with regards to the loans we've put on. We want to make sure we're being paid for the risk we take. And demand is challenged, especially in the small business and commercial middle market. That being said, we are continuing to have an increase in production, a nice increase this quarter-over-quarter, and we believe that the investor real estate, which ran off about $700 million this past quarter, starts to moderate, declining but at a moderate pace. We did have $200 million, I think I had mentioned that $185 million in my prepared comments, of loans that we have as part of the previously established agreement with -- in the Morgan Keegan transaction, to sell those. So that's $200 million that you won't see coming out in the future quarters. So we will continue to work to grow loans, which would help us stabilize and increase our net interest income.","O. B. Grayson Hall","I think, if I could just add to that real quick, is that when you look at our loan production, we continue to be very confident in our ability to produce loans outstanding. To David's, if you sort of walk through our different lines of business, we're seeing good, strong growth in commercial and industrial, and indirect auto and in mortgage. But we've made a few decisions that certainly are impacting our net out -- our net loans outstanding at the end of the quarter. And that is, number one, we're not holding a lot of our mortgage production. Most of our mortgage production, we're releasing that into the secondary market. And if you look at our commercial real estate, as David said, it was -- industrial\/commercial real estate was down approximately $700 million for the quarter and we released $185 million as part of the Morgan Keegan-Raymond James transaction. And net-net, that was the decline in our loan portfolio. And so we continue to be encouraged by production. As deleveraging by customers starts to slow down, I think we can start to see some decent growth out of our portfolio.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And this is a question for both, I guess, for both Grayson and David. Just when you think about performance, we obviously saw a top line pressure from declining margins and we did see expenses increase now. I know you noted that expenses will be down year-over-year, and it makes sense that you are trying to invest for growth in the future. But can you talk about some of the things that you're doing internally to control expenses? And as you look out, assuming we don't see a huge change in the revenue and growth environment, at what point do you start to take a hard look at expenses, particularly on the branch side, and start to take out some significant costs?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, I think that -- we've had a focus on expenses for quite some time, and expenses were up third quarter versus second quarter. As David mentioned earlier, part of that increase in expenses, obviously, was our credit card portfolio conversion. We spent quite a bit of money there, not only on the conversion itself, but on the advertising of that, in communication with our customers, and as well as increased staffing to accommodate the telephone calls and the support of those customers as they went through that transition. But when you look at expenses overall, we continue to drive down total staffing in the company, become more efficient. We've been heavy investors in technology. We've implemented quite a few new technology projects in the last few months that have really improved our efficiency, but at the same time, improved our service level. If you look over the last 4 years, we've probably consolidated our branch franchise more than any of our peer group and continue to look at ways to extract efficiency out of our branches. I think you should anticipate that we'll continue to have a strong focus on expense management. That being said, there still are times when we're going to spend to grow. We've got opportunities to grow our business. And as our business managers and market managers come to the table with ideas where we can spend some money to grow this organization in a prudent and thoughtful manner, we're going to take advantage of those opportunities, but you should anticipate core expenses will continue to incrementally decline over time.","David J. Turner","And I was going to add to that. I did want to point out that, you'd mentioned expenses were up, revenue was up as well. And expenses, we pointed out a couple of things shouldn't be recurring. I would tell you that we're in the middle of budget season, as is everybody else. There is not a meeting that we don't go to where we talk about expenses at the end of the day. And as every expense that we incur, that we continue to challenge ourselves on that spend. We do want to make sure that we're making investments for the future, though, and we will continue to do that as, Grayson mentioned. So you haven't heard of a named expense initiative from us; you will not, because it's something we do each and every day. And we'll give you more guidance in terms of what we think expenses for 2013 will look like on the next call.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just as maybe a quick follow-up, how much core expense are you actually taking out versus how much are you reinvesting in technology and growth for the future?","David J. Turner","Well, just different projects have different -- I don't have a number, a consolidated number, in terms of how much savings we have that we've reinvested. We really don't look at it that way. We look at making investments that are prudent, that pay themselves back in a reasonable period of time and also help our -- from a customer service standpoint. So we can get back to you and get a more definitive answer on that, Ryan.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Penala of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on some of the questions with regard to the NPL trends, and I wanted to make sure we were taking away the right thing. Of the $463 million in growth NPL additions this quarter, David, am I interpreting it right that $40 billion -- or $40 million of that was subsequently resolved after the quarter?","David J. Turner","Erika, it was resolved within the quarter. What we did is we believed that, had those not been resolved by September 30, they would have been an NPL. So we thought the right thing to do was to show that gross migration. So it's not in NPL because the loans are gone, but we showed it transferring in gross and then we have it resolved. When you look at our supplement, you'll see it coming -- you can't -- it's embedded in the resolutions, but in and out in the same quarter.","O. B. Grayson Hall","But the $463 million is a gross migration and the $40 million was netted out of total NPLs.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I see. And, Barb, could you explain to us what is unique about your market or your loan portfolio that you typically have a seasonal increase in NPLs in the third quarters?","Barbara Godin","Certainly, Erika. What we do is we continue to credit service our loans throughout the year. But again, as we look at the spring, when everyone files their taxes, we sit down and we have that much harder look with the audited tax returns from our customers and have those conversations with them, as well as getting updated appraisals. And just by those sheer conversations, if we hear anything in those discussions from our customers that leads us to believe that we may not get paid back our full principal and interest completely over the time horizon, we will then go ahead and make that determination to put it into nonperforming loans. And we have a large book that actually comes due for servicing in that same timeframe.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just one follow-up question, one more follow-up, if I may. David, on the liability side, could you remind us what the opportunity is in both the size and the rate of the TruPS that you could potentially redeem and whether or not that rate is hedged out? Additionally, given that -- our fixed income team, for example, thinks that you can issue 5 year senior much more cheaply than where your long-term debt is costing you right now. Could you give us a sense of whether or not your trajectory for a stable margin includes some liability levers that you could pull off in the wholesale side beyond the trust preferred?","David J. Turner","Sure. I'll tell you, our guidance does not include all the liability management initiatives that we are considering at this point. Specifically, to the trust preferreds, we do have 2 issues. One is a $500 million issue that is at 6 5\/8, and then there's a $345 million issue that's at 8 7\/8, and we continue to look at those, as we do our long-term debt and subordinated debt in the bank, to evaluate all the liability and capital management strategies that are at our disposal. So we will continue to do that and all of that has not been factored into the guidance that I gave you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","One more NIM question here. The $1 billion premium that you have in the securities book, obviously that's a high number, but you're amortizing a lot of that each quarter. Can you give us a sense of what the amortization is and maybe what it was this quarter versus what it was last quarter or a year ago?","David J. Turner","We had amortization in the third quarter of approximately $75 million, and that was up from about $69.5 million in the second quarter.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So you're obviously amortizing at a fairly high rate there. Just separately, the service fees, I know they bounced nicely quarter-to quarter, but I think last quarter had some one-time adjustments and you had been looking for the fees to bounce back a little bit more. Is that just lower NSF or overdraft usage or anything else going on there?","David J. Turner","We do expect that run rate to get back to, next quarter, where we are -- where we were in the first quarter. We did have some adjustments in the third quarter, approximately $11 million, that we believe will not recur in the fourth quarter. And so you can think of it, Matt, in terms of a run rate, being more consistent with the  first quarter.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Can you tell us what those adjustments were and maybe why they were not done last quarter when you had some other adjustments?","David J. Turner","That $11 million was just adjusting the estimate of the reserve that we booked in the second quarter. We got a better number in the third quarter and made the adjustment when we became aware of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask a question about just the earning asset trajectory. So the next couple of quarters, you've got $3 billion in CDs coming off and then $5 billion in the first quarter, so a significant amount of the balance sheet that's got the opportunity to reprice very near term. Can you tell us about just how you're planning on either retaining the CDs or should we continue to expect the overall size of the earning asset base to continue to shrink as it has the last couple of quarters as you've been doing this positive remixing on the deposit side?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, let me -- Ken, we've been executing a pretty aggressive deposit repricing strategy for a number of quarters now. We continue to be confident in that strategy. The results are apparent in our numbers. We still believe there's opportunity to continue to price down our overall deposit costs, but more importantly, we continue to be pleased with the mix shift that we're seeing. Time deposits are now down to 16% of our total deposit portfolio. And we do believe we've still got opportunity to continue to drive down that total cost of that book of business. We've been seeing retention of the time deposits that mature sort of in about the 70% range. We haven't seen that change over time. It's stayed fairly consistent through this strategy, and we would anticipate it continuing. That being said, a lot of those dollars that leave the time deposit category appear to be landing in other products to some degree with inside the bank. And so while we've reduced our reliance on time deposits considerably, our overall deposits have only compressed moderately. And so -- and we continue to, as we said earlier, to have a very healthy loan-to-deposit ratio this quarter of 79%. So at this juncture, we plan on continuing to execute this same deposit strategy and incrementally improve that deposit funding over time. On the earning asset side, we continue to have more of our earning assets and securities than we'd prefer. We're looking for opportunities to lend. We're finding traction in certain areas. As David mentioned, our pipelines look strong. On the commercial side of our house, the third quarter is always a seasonally low quarter for that activity, but our pipelines are probably about as strong as we've seen them in a long time. That being said, like you've heard on a number of these earnings conference calls, customers seem a little hesitant the last month or so, to borrow, to invest, but we anticipate, like we normally see, a pretty strong surge in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate that. But we are monitoring sort of the conviction and confidence of our customers as we move forward.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, Grayson. And then to just follow up on just the securities portfolio side, to your point about the portfolio being bigger than you'd like, it's continued to grow as an offset to the shrinking loan portfolio. So maybe, David, can you talk us through kind of your -- what's rolling off the book and what you're finding, what you're investing in incrementally, as the securities portfolio has continued to grow, to kind of fill this gap?","David J. Turner","Yes. We have just normal cash flow coming off the portfolio, $500 million a month, I think I've mentioned that before, that we have to put back to work. Some of that's gone into mortgage-backeds, but the rates on those are so low, we're looking for alternatives. Those alternatives include new issue CMBS, as well as corporate securities. You can see where we are today in our portfolio, being about $2.5 billion in those 2. That will grow and that will be a place where we put some of our cash flow that we have. We obviously -- our preference is to deploy that in the loan books, but we want to make sure that we're growing the loans prudently and being paid for the risk we take. We're encouraged by our pipelines on the loan side. We're encouraged by the conversion that we finished with credit card. There are a lot of positives that we have that are adding to help us offset this low-growth, low-demand environment that we have for loans. But we also will look to liability management, as we discussed earlier, and find the most prudent use of our cash flow.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And one, just quick one for you, David, on the expense side. You mentioned in the press release there's a whole bunch of line items that had -- that looked like they were just above trend, whether it was that long-term incentive comp and a couple of the card conversion, et cetera. Can you just give us a kind of a directional help in terms of how many of those things or can you quantify the things that were either one-time or above trend this quarter in terms of what expenses should look like next quarter?","David J. Turner","I can on the conversion. The conversion cost us roughly, in that line item you're referring to, in the $8 million range that shouldn't be there. The long-term incentive is the amortization of the grant that was made in the second quarter. So that amortization, obviously, is there through the award period. But that's the answer on the conversion piece.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","David, a question for you. You've mentioned a couple of times the opportunities that you're seeing to deploy cash flow out of the portfolio into new issue CMBS and corporate securities. Just curious as to where you're thinking those yields can be put on for your portfolio relative to the MBS opportunities that you're seeing.","David J. Turner","Yes, I think if you're looking at MBS today, you're looking at a 1.25 range. We think in the -- when we're talking about corporates, we're talking about the AAA tranche, a pretty safe tranche that's somewhere in the 1.5 to 2.5 range.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a question on HARP, if I can. You mentioned that about 1\/2 of your year-to-date originations in the HARP program have come from outside your own portfolio. Could you provide a little color as to where those mortgages were sitting previous to your refinancing them?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, I'll give you a little bit of color. So we mentioned we did about $2.2 billion in total mortgage production last quarter, this quarter. 21% of that would've been HARP II production, and down just a little bit from last quarter. Last quarter would have been about 22% So we're only down about 1% from where we're at. What we're finding is that, that production is really coming to us, both our customers and someone who had their original mortgage with someone else, and 50% of those to date have been from another competitor. I think if you look at the market share data for mortgages, without calling names, most of the mortgages are held by a handful of institutions in this country, much larger institutions, and that's where the vast majority of it's coming from. All of our mortgage office, mortgage bankers, are out in our local markets. And obviously, most of our production is coming from those states that we have the most dominant share in, which is Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas. So that's where the bulk of the majority of our production will come through. But the mortgage business is a very concentrated business in this country, and the vast majority of the mortgages are held by 4 or 5 players.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then if I can, a final question for you, David. I know you mentioned that you're considering issuing preferred stock. Is that something you would think about filling the entire 150 basis points of Tier 1 qualifying preferred, basically all at once? If I estimate that, that would be around $1.4 billion of preferred stock based on your Tier 1 risk-weighted assets of $91 billion.","David J. Turner","Yes, I want to be careful about mentioning any particular size based on our release earlier. But suffice it to say, you can see what our Tier 1, non-common Tier 1, is made up today, our trust preferred securities. I think it'd be prudent to have more noncommon Tier 1 instruments in there at an appropriate amount. And so preferred stock, obviously, can fill that. How that's done and how much and how many times is something that we have to address in time. And I don't want to talk specifically about how much we might have at any point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Mutascio of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","David, you had mentioned on the preferred offering, I really don't know what you can say about it, but that it could go to potentially redeeming trust preferreds. Can I look at that as a dollar-for-dollar transaction, that the preferreds we raised may be dollar for dollar with the TruPS that we may redeem?","David J. Turner","Again, I want to be careful how much I say. I think I pointed out that we have 2 issues, the $500 million at the 6 5\/8, the $500 million at 6 5\/8 and $345 million at 8 7\/8. So it's $845 million in total, and we have not and don't want to discuss what we would be doing with each or any of those issues that are outstanding.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, I was trying to figure out if the potential benefit on the margin from the TruPs redemptions or possible TruPS redemption will be offset by the higher preferred dividend, but I guess we'll have to wait to see what type of preferred is offered.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you guys give us a little more color on the $300 million to $400 million of potentially new commercial real estate mortgages? I know you gave us some color, but are they primarily in Florida or are they in Georgia or are they hotel loans or investment-owned properties? Can you give us some background on them?","O. B. Grayson Hall","The $300 million to $400 million is what we are estimating that will migrate to a nonperforming status during the fourth quarter. That's our estimate of what we anticipate for the fourth quarter. And the mix of that migration, I think you could look at the mix that we're reporting today for the third quarter, and we think that, that mix stays fairly consistent throughout. And again, with the large percentage of that being in the investor commercial real estate space. Barb, would you like to add to that?","Barbara Godin","You're exactly right. What we are seeing is investor real estate is coming down, generally, each quarter in terms of the migration of that book continues to shrink. So the C&I book is staying relatively flat. We're seeing the consumer book staying relatively flat. And again, that's why we feel good about positioning that our potential problem loans for the quarter will be between $300 million and $400 million next quarter. The other comment I'd make is on the second quarter as well. Go back 1 quarter and look at the $315 million that did come in. I think we mentioned on that last investor call, everything that could've gone right during the quarter went right during the quarter. So everything we had hoped would move in the right direction did. And what we saw in the third quarter, obviously, it's more of a normalized quarter, where certain things didn't happen in the third quarter but will happen now in the fourth quarter.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Some of the banks, the OCC regulated banks, have had to set aside higher nonperforming assets and charge-offs for these Chapter 7 loans that they're referring to. I know you guys obviously didn't have to do that, but do you have an estimate that if the non-OCC banks are required to do this, what your number might be in terms of increase in nonperforming assets and net charge-offs due to the change by the regulators?","Barbara Godin","Gerard, we're currently looking at that right now, sizing it up. At this point, we don't see it as being a material number for us. Remember again that we have a very active consumer assistance program and that program has been in place for a while. And what we have done on that program is when a customer goes through that program, we typically charge the loan down to value at that time and put the loan on non-accrual and TDR if necessary. So again, we will be coming out in the fourth quarter with any numbers associated with the change to the guidance. But at this point, as I said, we don't see this being a material number.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, your capital is obviously quite strong, especially under the Basel III NPR methodology that may be the final methodology. Last year, of course, in CCAR, you came out and repaid TARP. Should we expect that you would apply to return some capital to shareholders, whether in the form of an increased dividend or buybacks in this year's CCAR?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, I think that you -- if you look at Basel III and where our numbers are at, those instruments are based on the composition of our balance sheet today, without us taking any actions in terms of business models and products that we offer. So I think that Basel III number obviously over time will be different as we change our business model to -- in reaction to Basel III, depending on how that is finalized. But I think as you look at our capital position, we continue to strengthen our capital position every quarter. We'll be submitting the 2013 CCAR stress test, if you will, here in not too many months away. And we have any number of items under consideration. But I think it'd be premature on this call to disclose our thoughts on that. But clearly, we're making a pre-assessment at this time on exactly what should be included in that submission. And given our capital position, we are going to be very thoughtful in that regard.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to circle back and, David, just get a little more precision around the credit card expenses and the unusual one-time impact in this quarter and how quick that could maybe run off. I wanted to make sure we're including both the marketing, as well as the conversion costs. If you look at the marketing number, it's up about $7 million this quarter; outside services is up about $5 million. Maybe there's some -- you were mentioning $8 million of conversion costs. Can you put all that together and then how quickly does that, whatever the number is, run down in the future?","David J. Turner","Yes, Marty. I think if you -- that was the message I was trying to send is if you take the $8 million out of the run rate in terms of being a one-timer, and I think you're going to get pretty close to what the run rate -- the remainder is on the run rate there.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And that'll roll off in the next quarter?","David J. Turner","That's correct. It won't to be there in the fourth quarter.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I was just curious, as we've talked earlier this year about the debt rating and going back to investment-grade and how that was going up again to help you attract some of your traditional customers back in on the deposit side. Have you begun to see some of that benefit? And is that what's spilling over even into the C&I loan growth that you're beginning to see now?","David J. Turner","Yes, Marty...","O. B. Grayson Hall","Let me. Clearly, Marty, we've seen benefit as our credit ratings have improved, in particular, on the commercial side of our business, on both loans and deposits, and quite frankly, on overall relationship and ability to attract and retain those relationships. And so overall, it's been a net positive. How you quantify that is somewhat elusive, but anecdotally, I think it's been a very positive story.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then, David, one last question. If you look at the loan yield compression, in kind of seems like you went from first quarter to second quarter, you got some of those payoffs and prepayments that helped keep the yield on loans higher. So if you kind of smooth between the first to the third quarter and then kind of look at where it started to decline back in the fourth quarter, your loan yields are going down 5 to 6 basis points per quarter. And then on the flip side, if you look at your deposit costs, they've been going down probably 4 to 5 basis points per quarter. So in a sense of kind of holding margin flat going forward, if you bring in some of the other kind of funding costs in programs that you're talking about, you're almost matching deposit costs and loan yield compression on a quarterly basis, except for just an anomaly that occurred last quarter?","David J. Turner","Yes, I think if you look at last quarter, we had mentioned we had on the loan side about 5 points in our loan yields that were due to the interest reversals that we spoke about earlier. So if you take our about 3.29% in that quarter and reduce that 5 points, you're at -- I'm sorry, 4.29%, and reduce that 5 points to 4.24%, you can kind of see that now, little smoother to the 4.18% that we have today. The mix of our loan portfolio is a big driver. We're encouraged, again, by our pipelines that we see. We're encouraged by, while about pricing is under pressure, we still see a favorable spread out there that we can get. Our credit ratings helping us to get into places that we hadn't before, helps. Looking at things like credit card, which obviously give you a better yield. And having that conversion done, we expect the opportunities to grow there. So there is going to be continued pressure on loan yields, but we think we can offset those with the improvement in deposit costs. You can run the numbers. Based on the $3 billion of deposits that are maturing in the fourth quarter, at 2.1%, is a pretty significant buffer to the headwind that we're facing on the low-rate environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","You mentioned in your monologue that there was some pricing competition increase, particularly on the middle-market side. Just wondering if you could give some color on what you're seeing in commercial loan pricing right now, up and down the spectrum.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, we've got -- we're using quite a bit of analytics on pricing. I would tell you that, in the upper end of the middle-market space, large commercial space, we've seen obviously increased competition, and you've probably seen pricing moderate over the last few quarters, but it's been fairly stable. I think that it's down a little bit from the peak of a few quarters ago, but certainly at or above historical trends on commercial\/industrial lending. In investor commercial real estate space, spreads there are still much higher than historical averages. And so while there's a lot of competition and there is pricing pressure, we still see pricing holding up fairly well. As you get down into the business and community banking, the smaller credits, there's more pricing competition there. There's a few different players in that market, and we are seeing that part of the segment come under a little more pressure, and pricing has moderated lower, trended lower in the last couple of quarters in that particular part of the segment. Not a lot of demand in that segment and so a lot of competitors and few borrowers, so you're seeing a little more pressure there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Ketron of UBS.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You had mentioned, I think, on prior calls and prior guidance or outlooks that, in the longer term, normalized loan loss reserves maybe kind of settle in a 1.50% to 2% range and net charge-offs maybe somewhere around 75 basis points. In looking at the last couple of quarters, if you project out these loan loss reserve levels, you could be approaching that kind of 1.75% to 2% range, maybe in the middle of next year, realizing that the reserve releases will slow down. And if that -- one, I guess, the first question would be, in terms of the longer-term view of the reserve, the charge-offs assessed still intact. And then the second part would be, if that's the case, there's obviously some earnings that will need to be replaced. And maybe what are the things that you're looking at Regions in terms of the business strategy to try to fill that void that may be created by the provision expense going up?","David J. Turner","Yes, Greg, this is David. We do believe, based on what we know today, and obviously there's some accounting rules that are being proposed on the allowance, but let's use today's rules, we still believe in that 1.5% and 2% as a reasonable range. And I know that's kind of wide, but that's the best we can do at this juncture. We know where our charge-offs have been elevated. We said they would be elevated, but we have those reserved for. If you think about the 75 basis points of charge-offs, that's a through-the-cycle charge-off rate. That means you would expect that there are some periods of time where that's lower. And if you look at the type of credit that's going on the books today for us, it's pretty clean, it's pretty good, which is why our provision is where it is. The provision is taking care of the new stuff that we have or any diminution in the credit quality of what's on the books. And we're seeing that stabilize over the last several quarters, which is why we can provide where we are. The charge-offs are separate. And again, we already had those reserved for and, as they come through, we take care of them. So what you need to look at in terms of estimating provision is look at our credit quality, whether it be in terms of criticized and classifieds. I mentioned that in my prepared comments as being one of the best and first places one could look as to how your credit quality is trending. And criticized and classifieds continues to come down for us, which tells us what our -- informs us as to what our future provisioning and reserves will be. So don't put the 75 basis points in as the low watermark. That's a through-the-cycle number.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, very helpful. So really, as you look out and think about how things may evolve, and I know it's early, but think about charge-offs being potentially below that 75 basis point level longer term?","David J. Turner","At some point, you would expect that to be the case. To be able to articulate a 75 through the cycle, that means they have to be below that at some point.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gaston Ceron of MorningStar Equity Research.","Gaston  F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes, I just had a quick follow-up on that last question that -- a couple of minutes ago on the commercial loan space question. Indeed, it seems like you guys and other banks have seen -- have been seeing some nice growth in C&I. Again, following up on that last question, does it feel like, as things stand now in the competitive space, are the other banks in the space, do you think, are they -- as they chase the segment, are we at a stage where they're compromising loan quality for market share? Or would you say the competition is still pretty rational, if you will?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I would say that, from our perspective, we still see the competition as being very rational. Not that you don't get the anecdotal comment from time to time, but I would say that our general perspective is the competition is rational, but everybody's out looking for business. And so we run into competition in both customers' and prospects' offices, and we all are after -- after the business and competing for it. But we're not seeing -- we aren't seeing -- you aren't seeing a big change in underwriting structure. You are seeing competitive pricing. Clearly, pricing is part of the underwriting, but at this point in time, we just aren't seeing a lot of anomalies in that regard.","Operator","That concludes today's final question. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Hall for any closing remarks.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, just let me close and say thank you for your time and your interest in Regions Financial, and we look forward to meeting with you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"17972":["Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) Q4 2013 Earnings Call January 21, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","M.

My name is Stephanie, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.","M. List Underwood","Good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation on our call this morning. Our presenters today are our Chief Executive Officer, Grayson Hall, and our Chief Financial Officer, David Turner. Other members of management are present as well, and available to answer to questions as appropriate. Also as part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","Finally, let me remind you that in this call, and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking statement that is located in the appendix of the presentation.","With that said, I'll turn it over to Grayson.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Good morning, and welcome to Regions' Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. We certainly appreciate your participation and interest in Regions Financial. Overall, we are pleased and encouraged by our achievements and results in 2013. During the year, we focused on the fundamentals, serving the financial needs of our customers and communities and building stronger relationships with them. We began 2013 with 3 important business priorities: first, loan growth; secondly, customer relationships; and also third, prudently managing expenses.","Through the focused execution and dedication of our team, we accomplished these goals and made meaningful progress. For the year, total new and renewed loan production increased $4.5 billion or approximately 8%. As a result, we experienced $1.3 billion of balance sheet loan growth in 2013, which excludes the residential first mortgages -- mortgage loans transferred to held-for-sale, which I'll address momentarily.","This growth was achieved by expanding our customer base, and deepening our relationships with existing customers, aided by a new initiative launched in 2013 called Regions 360. This is a very deliberate and prescriptive approach to building a strong relationship banking culture on a foundation of trust. Further, we increased our total number of customers and households in a diversified manner. Business lending achieved solid growth in 2013, led by commercial and industrial segment. This segment increased $2.7 billion from the end of 2012, primarily driven by specialized lending teams. Also we believe our investor real estate segment is close to stabilization, as new loan production continues to increase and payoffs and pay downs diminish.","On the consumer side of the balance sheet, our indirect auto portfolio experienced a very strong year with production up 35% and loans increasing 32%. We accomplished this by expanding our dealer network by 12% and increasing our average loans per dealer by more than 50%. We also achieved growth in our consumer credit card portfolio, as the number of active cards increased 7% year-over-year. And we grew our home equity loan and line production by 78% from the same time last year. Additionally, our full year 2013 adjusted expenses were lower than 2012 expenses on the same basis, and we've did this while making significant investments in people, in products and in technology. We will continue to rigorously manage all expenses in a disciplined manner, as it is part of our culture, while ensuring that we have the right infrastructure and foundation in place for future growth.","In addition to successfully executing our business priorities, we also had a number of other noteworthy accomplishments in 2013: we increased net income available to common shareholders 10% over the prior year; we expanded our net interest margin by 16 basis points; we lowered our deposit cost by 10 basis points; we achieved broad-based improvement in asset quality, with every metric significantly improving; we raised our common stock cash dividend; we completed several actions that improved our debt and capital structure, while reducing overall funding cost; and again, we completed a common stock share repurchase program.","Clearly, we accomplished a great deal in 2013. With respect to the fourth quarter, there are several notable items that impacted results. David will cover these in more detail momentarily, but I wanted to highlight a few of them. First, accelerating our de-risking strategy. We transferred $686 million of troubled debt restructured loans to held-for-sale. This transaction has minimal capital impact and will improve the company's credit profile. Importantly, as results of this transaction, we can experience lower FDIC premiums and can redeploy the capital more economically. In addition, we recorded a $58 million nontax deductible charge related to previously disclosed inquiries from government authorities, concerning matters dating back to 2009.","And during the fourth quarter, we announced that we will consolidate 30 branches in early 2014. This will create additional efficiencies within our branch network channel and demonstrates our ongoing rigor and discipline with respect to expense management.","Looking to 2014, there are several underlying economic and political factors that have the potential to influence the U.S. economy, but nonetheless, consumer balance sheets are healthier than they've been in some time. Corporate balance sheets are in solid condition and the housing market in our communities continued to improve. These factors, along with an improving global outlook, should contribute to moderate and improving GDP growth in 2014. Again, we are encouraged with the progress we've made in 2013, but more importantly, we look forward to building on that momentum in 2014.","All team members at Regions are focused on building a stronger company each and every day. We believe that -- we believe in our company and we believe that by focusing on and serving our customers and communities will ultimately drive our results and benefit our shareholders.","I'll now turn it over to David to discuss fourth quarter results.","David J. Turner","Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Today we reported earnings of $219 million for the fourth quarter. And as Grayson mentioned, there were a number of notable items occurring in the quarter that warrant further explanation. I'm going to go with those first and then I'll get back to the core operating results later.","In the fourth quarter, we identified approximately $686 million of primarily accruing first lien residential mortgages that were classified as troubled debt restructurings and transfer them to held-for-sale. The majority of these loans were originated prior to 2007 and approximately 40% are located in Florida. We expect to execute a sale of these loans early this year. In connection with the loan transfer, we recognized incremental net charge-offs of $151 million, however, this was partially offset by $76 million of allowance for loan losses. As a result, the pretax net income impact of the transaction totaled $75 million.","Also in the fourth quarter, we terminated 2 leveraged leases, incurring a $39 million gain, however, the tax expense related to these terminations was $33 million, and therefore, the benefit to net income was $6 million.","In connection with the branch closures that Grayson mentioned, we incurred additional pretax expenses of $5 million in the quarter. In addition, as Grayson also mentioned, at the end of the quarter, we recorded a $58 million regulatory charge, associated with previously disclosed matters dating to 2009. We are in discussions with our banking supervisors to resolve their inquiries on these matters, and although you may have additional questions, please recognize that we cannot comment at this time beyond this disclosure.","Also the company incurred a $40 million reduction to overall income tax expense, primarily related to the valuation allowance for certain state net operating losses that occurred in previous years.","And finally, during the quarter, we incurred $25 million of additional legal expenses, resulting from adjustments to the indemnification reserve, established in connection with the sale of Morgan Keegan. And these legal expenses are reflected in discontinued operations.","Combined, all of these items lowered net income by $75 million and earnings per share by $0.05.","Let's take a look at fourth quarter operating results, starting with our loan book. Total average loan balances were up 1% from the previous quarter, however, ending loans declined 2%, due in part to the transfer of residential mortgage loans to held-for-sale at the end of the quarter. Excluding the loans transferred, adjusted ending loans declined 1% linked quarter. Specifically, average commercial and industrial loan balances increased $631 million from the prior quarter, however, on an ending basis, they declined $451 million. The decline in period in commercial loan balances resulted from repayment of loans, some of which were nonperforming, corporate clients accessing funds in the fixed income market and volatility in REIT lines in the normal course of business.","Finally, part of the decline was also driven by $104 million of leveraged lease terminations. This decline was partially offset by increases in specialized lending, led by technology and energy.","Encouragingly, commitments for new loans increased quarter-over-quarter by $500 million to $38 billion. Investor real estate loans were down 3% from the previous quarter, as the pace of pay downs and de-risking was only partially offset by new loan production, which increased 2% from the previous quarter, and new production is expected to remain strong going forward.","Indirect auto continued to lead consumer lending as loan balances increased 6% from the prior quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had more than 2,100 dealers in our network, and we remained focused on increasing our pull-through rates, primarily through technology enhancements.","The total home equity portfolio was steady, linked quarter, as the pace of new production in the home equity loan product offset customer deleveraging within the home equity lines of credit. As a result, balances in the fixed rate home equity loan product have increased 17% over the previous quarter.","Credit card balances increased 6% over the third quarter as we increased the number of active cardholders by 4%. We will continue to focus on expanding the number of customers that carry a Regions credit card and have increased our penetration rate by 50 basis points over the third quarter.","And finally, mortgage balances were relatively flat, excluding the transfer of loans to held-for-sale.","And looking ahead, based on what we know today and our economic forecast, we expect 2014 loan growth to be in the 3% to 5% range.","Let's take a look at deposits. Deposit mix continued to improve in the fourth quarter as low-cost deposits increased to 89% of average deposits. This positive repricing and mix shift resulted in deposit cost declining to a historically low level of 12 basis points. Total funding cost for the company declined to 34 basis points in the quarter. Let's see how this impacted our results.","Net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was $846 million, up $8 million or 1% from the previous quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.26%, an increase of 2 basis points from the previous quarter. For the fourth quarter, continued increases in long-term interest rates served to further reduce prepayments on securities, and the related premium amortization. Lower premium amortization contributed approximately 5 basis points increase to the margin and totaled $45 million for the quarter. Of course, higher long-term rates also benefit net interest income and net interest margin, over time, through higher yields on reinvested fixed-rate loans and securities.","In 2013, liability management strategies and an improving mix of deposits offset the negative impact of a persistently low-growth and low-interest rate environment. Although the pace of decline in deposit cost has slowed, the recent rise in long-term rates off mid-year lows help provide additional lift to the margin. Our balance sheet continues to be asset-sensitive to short-term interest rates, mainly attributable to floating rate loans. Moreover, further increases in long-term rates would provide additional benefit to the margin, but at a somewhat reduced pace, given prepayments and premium amortization have already slowed considerably. With rates at their present level, we expect the net interest margin to remain relatively stable in 2014.","Let's take a look at noninterest revenue. Fourth quarter noninterest revenue was up 6% from the previous quarter. The fourth quarter included a net gain of $17 million, related to the sale of certain low-income housing investments, as well as the $39 million gain, previously mentioned, related to leveraged lease terminations. Noninterest revenue continues to be impacted by lower mortgage revenue. During the quarter, mortgage production declined 23% and mortgage revenue declined 17%. As a result, we continue to optimize the mortgage operations model and reduced overall mortgage production expenses 10% in connection with lower revenue, and we expect mortgage expenses related to production to continue to decline.","As a reminder, the previous quarter included a $24 million gain related to the divestiture of a non-core portion of the Wealth Management business.","As previously disclosed, we will discontinue new enrollment for our Ready Advance product and begin working on a transition plan related to our existing customers. This transition plan will be executed during 2014, and includes the recently introduced new Savings Secured Loan to help meet the credit needs of our customers. In 2013, we've made significant investments in our Wealth Management group by adding over 100 financial consultant positions, and we expect these positions to be fully profitable in 2014.","Additionally, we were successful growing certain consumer product lines throughout 2013, that will provide future revenue opportunities. For example, we grew our Now Banking households 26%; our active debit card users, 2%; and our prepaid card users, 50%.","Let's take a look at expenses. Noninterest expenses totaled $946 million in the fourth quarter, and included $58 million of expense related to the regulatory charge and $5 million of expense related to the branch consolidations. Deposit administrative fees, or FDIC expenses, were lower in the fourth quarter due to an improvement in asset quality, overall business performance and refunds of previously incurred fees. As a result, these costs are expected to be lower in 2014 compared to 2013, and the run rate is expected to be between the levels reported in the third and fourth quarter.","Salaries and benefits increased 2% this quarter, reflecting an increase in headcount, primarily in customer-facing, revenue-generating and compliance positions. This was partially offset by a decline in mortgage incentives. Generally speaking, it takes about 12 months for these customer-facing positions to become profitable contributors.","Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved 100 basis points from the previous quarter and we expect this to continue to trend down over the near term. Some fluctuation expenses can occur on a quarter-to-quarter basis in order to generate ongoing revenue. However, if the revenue does not materialize, we will adjust accordingly, as we are committed to generating positive operating leverage. We have effectively managed expenses throughout the cycle and have consistently reduced full year adjusted expenses since 2009. Full year 2013 adjusted expenses were lower than 2012 expenses on the same basis. And we expect this trend to continue in 2014.","Now let's take a look at asset quality. Improvement continued in the fourth quarter as most credit metrics improved. As previously discussed, this quarter's results were impacted by the loans transferred to held-for-sale. Adjusted net charge-offs, which excludes the amount related to the transfer of loans, amounted to $127 million. The provision for loan losses was $79 million, of which $75 million was related to the loan transfers. Our nonperforming loans declined 20% linked quarter, and inflows of nonperforming loans declined 12% to $175 million, and our coverage ratios remained solid. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance to nonperforming loans increased to 124%.","Notably, criticized and classifieds loans continued to decline, with commercial and investor real estate criticized and classified loans down 14% from the third quarter. Troubled debt restructurings declined 14% from the previous quarter, and excluding the loans associated with the transfer, TDRs would have been down 32% or approximately $1 billion. Based on what we know today, we expect favorable asset quality trends to continue. However, at this point in the cycle, volatility in certain metrics can be expected.","Let's take a look at our capital and liquidity. Our capital position remains strong as our estimated Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter stood at 11.6%. Our estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 11.2%, an increase of 20 basis points. We estimate our fully phased-in pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio would have been approximately 10.5%, well above the minimum threshold. As you are aware, we submitted our CCAR earlier this month, and we expect to get the results sometime in March.","Liquidity at both the bank and holding company remains solid, with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 81%. And lastly, based on our understanding of the proposed rule, Regions remains well-positioned to be fully compliant with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio.","Let's say, in summary, our fourth quarter and full year results reflect our continued focus on moving the company forward. At the core, we remain focused on our customers by continuing to drive a culture of leading service quality across the company, while following a shared value philosophy. We believe, focusing on our customers, having an engaged workforce and making a positive impact on our communities will ultimately drive long-term growth and shareholder value.","Now, I'll turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","M. List Underwood","Thank you, David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session of our call. We have a number of you already in the queue, and we want to take as many as possible this morning. [Operator Instructions]","Now, operator, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I missed the very front end of your call, and I don\u2019t know if you addressed it, but you did give guidance of loan growth of 3% to 5%. Am I correct?","O. B. Grayson Hall","That's correct.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Can you just tell me, where do you think that's coming from? And is that just really through discussions through your customer base?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Paul, we've gone through our lending segments extensively and we had pretty solid growth in the fourth quarter in terms of average balances. There was obviously a lot of activity that occurred near the end of the quarter. We had a number of pay downs and payoffs that had taken place. I think, you had the transfer of the first residential mortgages over to held-for-sale. You had more customers taking advantage of the capital debt markets, that we've seen in the past. But we have continued to be encouraged by signs that we've seen in looking at our production, looking at our pipelines and looking at what we believe is an improving economy. We've seen particular strength in certain segments, I would mention 3. I think, we've seen good strength in both energy and in technology, but we also have seen strength in commercial real estate. We believe that our commercial real estate portfolio, for the first time, is close to a stabilization point. We're encouraged by the production. And we think we've got an opportunity, if you remember, we had indicated that we thought our loan growth, on the upside, might be as much as 4% a quarter ago. We've raised that slightly to 5% today. But we think, we've got -- we think we've got the opportunity to do that and we're optimistic about it.","David, you like to comment on that?","David J. Turner","Yes. I think, if you look at commercial real estate in particular, multi-family and the homebuilding portfolios look strong. We're sure comfortable with those going into 2014. Grayson talked about the other parts of C&I, but the consumer side is getting better for us, as well as our home equity loan product is just about to take care of the declines we've seen in the home equity lines. Our indirect auto continues to be a nice growth story for us, as we continue to expand on dealerships, and our penetration within those dealers. Our credit card continues to grow as well, so we're feeling good about a broad array of loan increases and production, leading us into 2014.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, I mean, if you look, the big thing I would say is we're seeing more diversified demand, both across lending segments and across markets. It's broader and more diversified than it was a quarter ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","David, you mentioned that you thought the expenses in 2014 were going to be lower than 2013's adjusted expenses. What's the adjusted expense level we should use for 2013 to measure against for 2014?","David J. Turner","Yes, Gerard, that number is $3.4 billion, $3.433 billion, to be exact, that you could calculate off of our supplement, taking all the adjustments out. So it's working off that number.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, just as a follow up. On the LCR ratio, I think you said that you're well-positioned to have -- to be fully compliant. Does that state that you're there already, meaning that you don't need to put more liquidity on the books that could pressure the margin, if you were to do that, to become fully compliant?","David J. Turner","We are quite at 100% today, as that number bounces around a little bit, we're pretty close to 100%. But we're close enough and feel confident enough that there's not a lot of restructuring we have to do, with regards to being in compliant with the rule, is effective.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that would imply that we should not hear any margin -- some of your peers, the reason I ask this is, is some of your peers have pointed out that margin pressure in '14 will develop because of becoming fully compliant with LCR. We should not expect that from you guys, is that correct?","David J. Turner","We expect our margin to be relatively stable, all in, through everything that we have to do. So perhaps, we're a little unique. But remember, stable margin for us, we've kind of giving guidance. So that's 1 or 2 points, either side of where we are. And we're sticking with that, even though the LCR is out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could give us some more color on your expectations for the efficiency ratio. We saw some good progress this quarter, and wanted you to give your thoughts on the 2014 outlook for that metric, as well as how you would think about it on a longer-term normalized basis?","David J. Turner","Yes, John, this is David. As we've -- we've been mentioning on our calls, we are looking very closely at our efficiency ratio and positive operating leverage as well. You notice our efficiency ratio went up to 67 points and change last quarter. We had talked about working that down into the lower 60s, without a rate increase, and we think, with a rate increase, we can be in the 50s. Our goal, ultimately, is in that 55 to 59 range, but we acknowledge we can't get there without a rate change, a rate increase. But while we're waiting for that, we do expect us to continue to drift down, during 2014, into the lower 60s. We've made investments in people and technology. They're the cause of our short-term -- our expenses to increase. But we expect the revenue to come with that, and as a result, we expect that efficiency ratio to continue to drift down. We've really looked at our efficiency more from a long-term perspective. We don't get so caught up on a quarter-to-quarter change, but that's kind of the broad guidance that, we think, over time, we can get it to.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then, also, my second question, just around expenses as well, do you have the quantification around the likely savings that you can get from the 30 branch closures, on a combined basis?","David J. Turner","We really hadn't quantified the savings from those 30 branches. I will tell you, you heard the number, we had about $5 million that we're going to incur this quarter, we'll have some more, related to people cost, that you can't accrue until that time. But we expect to pay back in less than a year on these type of expenses, and we're constantly looking at all areas of our company in terms of becoming more efficient. It is part of who we are and what we do, and we'll make -- take appropriate actions when we can see the benefit of that is -- the payback is relatively quick.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes. And I would just to add, I mean, closing branches is a very public action, but internally, there are a number of expense-save initiatives that we're working on. Clearly, even within the branch channel, we're working on a number of efficiency programs that allow the branches that we have to operate at a lower cost basis and trying to improve both the utilization of all of our channels, so that we get efficiency across the methodologies that we service our consumers on. We realize that 2014 is still going to be a year where expenses are very important. And so we'll continue to have a number of internal initiatives that look at staffing, look at workflow, look at the way we handle all of our operational processes, to improve that overall efficiency ratio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fitzsimmons with Sandler O'Neill.","Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just a few questions. With CCAR coming up, just was wondering if you can give us an update on your capital return priorities. I know buybacks were a big part of it last year, but the stock is higher versus tangible book now compared to last year. And if you can just give us a list of where you think those priorities sit today.","David J. Turner","Sure, Kevin. As we think about capital, we really want to use the capital we have to grow our business, we think that's what the shareholders gave it to us for. That being said, we acknowledge, we'd like to get our dividend closer to where peers are, which has been in that 25% payout on income. We didn't want to use of the rest of the capital to growth, whether that -- growing loan portfolios, we've talked about acquiring a portfolio like we did our credit card book, and other acquisitions, if there are opportunities that arise. And when we can't utilize all of our capital efficiently in those activities, returning it to the shareholders is important. Because we don't want it to build up and have trapped capital to build up on the balance sheet. So having an appropriate return, in the form of a buyback to the shareholders, is certainly something that we've looked at. As you know, we just filed our plans, so we need to let the process work. We really have a very robust capital planning process, the output, which happens to be, at times, a couple of regulatory filings, called CCAR and DFAST, but our capital planning process is built around the efficient use of that capital and getting the most appropriate risk-adjusted return on that capital. And that's what we've done.","Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up. If you can just talk about timing of the transfer of those resi mortgages to held-for-sale now? And is that more a statement about the improvement you've seen in those -- in the housing market? There's more of a market for those loans today, or just being teed up, going into 2014, with that in the rearview mirror.","David J. Turner","Yes. It's a good question. We had a couple of things working for us. When the market for assets is pretty strong, these were accruing first lien residential mortgage loans. But they were TDRs, and that's a designation that causes a little more of a charge when you go through the FDIC calculation. And mathematically, if you took a look at the return on capital, by holding those in our portfolio, versus how we could improve the return on proceeds from a transaction, we felt that was the best thing for us to do, at this time. We have not executed that transaction. We expect to do so in early 2014. But as a result of making that decision, not to retain those in the portfolio, required us to move them to held-for-sale and take a mark on those, to our estimate of fair value, which is what we did in the later part of the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, I just like to hit on the 2014 noninterest expense guidance, again, here. So if the annualized adjusted 4Q run rate was $3.5 billion, and the '13 run rate was $3.4 billion, with the guidance now south of $3.4 billion, this implies about a $100 million plus delta year-over-year. I'm just wondering, what are the biggest pieces here? Maybe you can give us some color, in terms of the biggest pieces, and maybe give us some sense of magnitude.","David J. Turner","Craig, let me help you with the start point, I think it's about $3.4 billion -- $3.433 billion should be your start point based on what we've released, and we believe that we can come under that number. And it's really no one thing. It's just a continued focus on every one of our expense categories. Obviously, our top 3 expenses are salaries and benefits, occupancy and furniture and fixtures. But there are other expense categories underneath those that we continue to focus on and make sure -- while we hadn't come up with an expense initiative that, we require all of our leaders to really take a look at the expenses they have in their businesses, and make sure they're being as efficient as they can be. So you really can't look at one area and it's just a -- it's a little bit here and little bit there, and over time, it adds up. If you look over the past several years, we've been able to do this because of this kind of cultural -- a crunch to expense management, and you'll see that again in 2014. I think, when you get your start point, the number is not as -- is not your start point that you had.","O. B. Grayson Hall","But I think, we just have to -- in this environment, until we see the results of more sustainable growth and a different interest rate environment, we just got to stay very diligent and very rigorous on expense management. And to David's point, we haven't done a branded expense program, but what we have done is we have literally dozens of expense initiatives across the company, and we have invested an awful lot in technology to improve efficiencies and workflow across all of our operating units. We still believe that there's opportunities for us to improve the efficiency. We've been working on this for a great long time, and when you look at our expense metrics, by almost any measure, we delivered some really good efficiencies, relative to our peer group. Some of our biggest challenges are on the revenue side. And so we're trying to work on both, we are trying to have a balanced perspective on it. And that's why we invested in people this past year to try to improve our revenue generation, because while we want to continue to be rigorous in our management of expenses, we do realize some spending is necessary to generate revenue growth. And so, we have a very balanced perspective on it. But given where we are at today, we still believe we have identified enough areas that allow us to continue to drive our expenses down, on a same cost basis, year-over-year.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just as my follow-up here. I just want to separate your expectations for overall earning asset growth, next year, versus this 3% to 5% loan growth guidance. So if loans are growing in a 3% to 5% range, but if you noticed, your deposit growth has not been positive, should we expect to see modest declines in the securities portfolio to fund that, and will the LCR even allow that? Or is it more likely that deposits will grow next year and potentially could grow from higher costing deposits like CDs?","David J. Turner","Yes, I think, Craig, one of the things that you saw was the level of higher cost CDs that, as we lowered the cost, some of those did not -- we did not retain those in the bank, and so that worked against our earning asset growth that we had. We do have a little over $4 billion of CDs maturing next year, but we don't have the price differential on those that we had in '12 and '13. So we don't see the retention issue with those like we just saw. So we don't see that working against our earning asset growth. I think the primary driver on earning assets, in total, will be the loan growth that we're talking about. And so, we think, we've hit the bottom of earning assets right -- right now. Remember, last year, we also did some deleveraging and had some liability management activities in our bank and holding company that also worked against us on that measure. But we think, we'd grow from here.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, well, I mean, our loan deposit ratio at roughly 81%. During '13, we made some very strategic decisions related to deposits. We have reduced our reliance on more expensive forms of deposits, in particular, time deposits are down to 12% of the total portfolio. But we also took a very different strategy on other high-priced sources of deposit such as public funds. And so we have -- we've seen the mix. Our mix -- our overall deposits have not grown in '13. We did see a real favorable shift in the mix of those deposits, and are very pleased with where we stand today. So from a deposits standpoint, we're feeling pretty good about our position.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question is could you just shed some light on the CCAR process in terms of -- under stress, do the regulators treat a TDR similar to any performing loans or they treat it worse? And I guess the real, just as a question is, is the derisking in your TDR portfolio reflected in your submission for this year's plan?","David J. Turner","Let me answer a little different than you asked because we want to be careful about what we turn into our supervisors. We have a capital plan and our derisking relative to TDRs is not just the impact of capital, although that is true. TDRs are treated adversely by us and the way we look at capital. So I think that as we think about derisking, you also have to look at the cost associated with maintaining a TDR, in particular, as it relates to FDIC insurance. Those are punitive in the calculation. And so being able to derisk helps us from an earnings standpoint and the expense discussion that a few folks have asked us about this morning, you'll see the benefits of that coming through in 2014.","O. B. Grayson Hall","But those derisk our credit portfolio. It accelerates the pace of that somewhat, but the economics are the primary driver.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And so the follow-up to that is, in theory, if this were included in a submission, you have a derisked balance sheet from a TDR perspective as these are sold. But not just that, the cushion for your PPNR should also improve under stress because of the administrative costs that go away. Is that the right takeaway to assume if it was in the submission?","David J. Turner","That's right. The cost to carry these are punitive in all of our -- whether it'd be your base or your 2 adverse runs. So being able to strip that cost out and have the assets, the proceeds reinvested in assets that don't attract as much capital and generate more PPNR is what we're trying to do, and we think we accomplished that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of the Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","This is the first question. To go back to the discussion about the headcount, I think you had mentioned 2 broad categories: one, compliance; and the other, customer facing. And I was hoping just to get a little more clarity. What was the rough mix of compliance versus client facing? And then if you could give us some insights into which specific businesses on the client facing side you added headcount to, maybe some geographic information, that would be helpful.","David J. Turner","Yes, I'll tell you that roughly half of our headcount -- I think it's almost 60% of our headcount were in revenue-generating positions. So we gave an example in our prepared comments. Our financial consultants that we put into branches this year, a little over 100 that we hired during the year. And then the other parts of this were really establishing more folks in our compliance areas and risk management as we deal with some of the changes and expectations that we all have in the banking industry. So the headcount that we've added, we expect the folks we've added to pay for themselves, in particular, the revenue generation -- generating folks that should be paying for themselves in less than a year. Our early read on that and our use of financial consultants, as an example, is we're a little ahead of schedule, and we feel good about that going into 2014. But we want to make those investments in people. We think it's the right thing to have done, as we battle the balance between generating more revenue, yet watching our expenses in total.","O. B. Grayson Hall","I think that given where the industry is at, and there's clearly an expectation for greater focus and resources on compliance and audit functions. We continue to invest in all of those functions across our enterprise risk management program, if you will, and so we're going to continue to invest there. We have to find ways to pay for that, and we find ways to pay for that through efficiencies in other parts of the company, and our additional revenue opportunities we have -- we fund by adding people or products where appropriate. I think if you look at geographically, we've added those resources opportunistically where we see advantage. Clearly, we've done -- we've seen a lot of growth across the markets that are more heavily invested in energy, South Louisiana and Texas being 2 great examples of that. But we've also saw strong growth in the auto sector, and in the southeast, we have a number of markets that enjoy margin plummet in the auto sector. So it's been pretty well dispersed across our markets, and we want it that way because we want that diversity.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's good color. And then just in terms of the auto business, I think in your prepared comments, you had mentioned that you expect a higher pull through from some technology enhancements in the auto business. I was just trying to get a sense for what you mean exactly by pull through. Is that more volume driven from the dealers because of the technology or just the ability to process more volume because of the technology enhancements, and maybe just talk about what these enhancements are? That would be interesting.","David J. Turner","It's all around speed of answer and quality of answer. We've got -- we had continued to grow the number of auto dealers that we are working with, partnering with. But we have higher expectations for the volume we get through those dealers. And in order to do that, we had to invest in technology and had to invest in people in the back office to ensure that we get applications for credit. The speed of our answers and the quality of our answers continue to improve. We've made some pretty dramatic improvements in that. As a result, we saw very good results in that particular lending segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","David, I wanted to ask you to go a little bit deeper into your comments about the investments in the fee businesses starting to get to profitability this year. So the wealth management line, it hasn't really broken out yet so to speak. Could you give us a little favor for how you expect the fee businesses to act this year, and can they more than offset the expected decline in mortgage that's just a matter of fact?","David J. Turner","Yes, Ken, we have -- we've just pointed to wealth management as an example. We don't have any one business that's going to light it up and take over all the pressures that we had in mortgage. We do believe mortgage didn't have quite the decline it had '12 to 13 as it does in '13 to '14. We think, as a matter of fact, we'll be down, production-wise, in mortgage about 10% to 15%, and we'll rightsize the expense side of that, and get to a -- what will be a normalized mortgage contribution. But wealth management, we have some new products and services that we're working on. We have the full run rate of those additions that we had, the financial consultants. So you'll see that. We've had some improvement in our investments in insurance that we think will also be a driver. So it's not one -- it's not just one area. We think all those really are contributors to help offset any other negatives that we have in our NIR, primarily mortgage.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Well, I think the important point is those initiatives are on track. In wealth management, in particular, our early results are exceeding our preliminary forecast that we made the decision upon.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And my second quick question is just on the new deposit products and the sunsetting of Ready Advance. Can you talk about any net revenue and income effect that you'd expect?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I mean, it's a little early for that. We've made the decision to discontinue new registrations or new enrollment of that product from our customers. That goes in effect in the morning, and we are working through our transition plan now. We have a fairly substantial group of customers who use this product, and we're being very thoughtful, very deliberate about how we transition them away from this product. So we've got our product teams working on those transition plans now. They're going to take a few weeks to finalize. You'll have more information from us forthcoming as this matures, but a part of it is trying to predicting customer behavior. And as we offer alternative ways of meeting this customer need, we're going to find out exactly how the customer responds to that, and it will sort of drive the end results. We are still committed to focusing on our customers and meeting their financial needs, and we try to do that with innovative products and really a focus on strong customer service. We'll continue to do that. It's just that on this particular product, we need to transition and focus our attention on other products in order to best serve our customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just provide an update of how asset sensitive you were at end of the year? I noticed your liquidity increased on a period end basis, and can you just provide an update of how much it benefit if rates rise, say, 100 basis points?","David J. Turner","Yes, Matt, we had -- right now, if you look at 100 basis points, parallel shift, it's about $180 million to us, down slightly from where we were. Last quarter, it was about $200 million. I think we drifted down to about $180 million.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just separately, as we think about credit going forward, obviously, the held-for-sale actions pulls forward some charge-offs, also uses some loan loss reserves. How should we think about both charge-offs and the provision expense, going forward, from here?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, Matt, when you look at the -- when we had this call for the third quarter, we really, at that point in time, indicated that we thought our credit recovery would continue. We thought the pace might moderate somewhat. But the fourth quarter, again, very positive results. It exceeded our internal early forecast, and so we continue at this juncture, still believe that, that recovery process continues. We -- as David said earlier, there may be some volatility in a particular metric quarter-to-quarter. We have a little bit of volatility in, for example, charge-offs this quarter. We had a couple of transactions that, had they gone a different direction, it could have been a much better number than it was. But you're going to see that sort of as we get down to where the -- our distressed loans are more granular in nature. You're going to see little bit more volatility, but we think the overall trends still continues.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of follow-ups on the NIM outlook. I know you've indicated that you're looking for relatively stable NIM if rates stay where they are. Is that in reference to current rates or that's in reference to the forward curve?","David J. Turner","It is really looking at the forward cure as it exist today.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So if the forward curve were to shift up, then that's where the NIM benefit comes from?","David J. Turner","That's correct.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then could you give us a little understanding of how you're thinking about non-interest-bearing deposits. I know we had a conversation earlier on the call around the fact that deposit quality has improved significantly. But how are you thinking about what happens to non-interest-bearing deposits in an environment where the forward curve is increasing, and particularly, north the belly of the curve in the 3- to 5-year section?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I mean, it's a great question, and one, we're spending an awful lot of time on trying to figure out how do you forecast sort of customer behavior in a rising REIT market after you've been through several years of such low rates, and there's really not a great empirical model that allows you to forecast this out. We have built that into our liquidity plans. We've built it in to our business plans so that we have quite a bit of variability, depending on changes in customer behavior. Anecdotally, what we're seeing from our customers is just a greater propensity for both individuals and businesses to hold liquidity. We've not seen a great movement when borrowing demands increased that liquidity diminishes to any great degree. We're watching it closely. I don\u2019t think we have the answer, but we absolutely realize the importance of monitoring that on a daily basis and looking for trends over each and every quarter. David, anything to add?","David J. Turner","Go ahead, Betsy...","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","No, I was just going to say it's interesting because you've highlighted that line utilization requests are up, and so what you're saying is at -- those customers, where line utilizations are up, their deposits did not -- have not been coming down ahead of those.","O. B. Grayson Hall","On average, that's true. I mean, you look at it on a customer basis, you'll see a little bit of differentiation. But still what we see both in the numbers and in conversation, anecdotally is still customers being conservative and still having a desire for increased levels of liquidity as compared to what you would have seen prior to the economic crisis.","David J. Turner","Yes, Betsy, I think it's a great question. And one, what we do know is you can take the history book, just about toss it out the window because we've been in this low-rate environment for so long. We all have deposits that our non-interest-bearing, in particular. We can go back and look at history. I mean, it's a data point. We study that, but we want to be careful that we don't lean too hard on history. We're sitting here at an 81% loan-to-deposit ratio. We think we're well-positioned for that. We look at liquidity as being the biggest risk we face, and what we want to make sure is what's the impact on profitability as other who aren't that low on loan-deposit ratio, if they start seeing deposits move out, what does that mean from a pricing standpoint? So I think that when we look at our forecast of liquidity, we've shocked that a number of times to see what might happen, and we shock it again after that just to be sure that we don't get caught in a liquidity play, but we still don\u2019t know yet exactly what that's going to mean to us.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Because then, you kind of think should you have an LCR that's even above 100% at this stage of the rate cycle. I don\u2019t know if that's too aggressive of a comment but...","David J. Turner","And we still have to work through LCR, as we mentioned on the prepared comments. We're pretty close to being there right now. We don't see that being a huge driver. It's clearly something we have to consider. But when we need to get to the point where all that's happening, if that starts to happen, that means we're in a lot better economic environment than we are right at this minute. And while it has its challenges, it has its rewards that go with it as well. So it's a great question, one for all of us, really, to pay attention to as we get closer to that time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can we spend a minute on expenses again? Just curious if there's any improvement in pension expense baked into your 2014 guidance, and if so, how much?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes, I mean, there's clearly some pension benefits. To my knowledge, we have not disclosed it at this juncture.","David J. Turner","We're going through all of that right now and getting updates, obviously, discount rate changes. We know there's a high rate environment, and therefore, there should be some benefit of pension expense going forward. And that's baked into our guidance that we've given you, but we hadn't been specific with disclosing that exact amount.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just moving to funding cost for a second, the improved basis points this quarter, you mentioned the CDs that are left repriced, not much of a savings there. Are you sort of out-of-room on the funding cost side?","David J. Turner","I wouldn't say we're out of room. I would just say the kind of improvement that you've seen over the last 2 years for us is slowing quite a bit. When you're 12 basis points of cost of deposits, it's hard to see how that moves. As I mentioned, we have a little over $4 billion of deposits maturing next year. It's almost about a $1 billion -- $1.1 billion each quarter. The first quarter has the bigger benefit, but I think what's coming off there is still -- it's pretty close to what's going on, like 42 basis points, what's going is in the 20 range. So there's not -- there's just not a lot to pick up there. We do have some liability management that we've done. We'll get the full benefit of that in '14 that we executed in '13. So you'll see some pickup there, and all that added together is one of the ways that we're able to give you the stable margin guidance for '14.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just another follow up on the funding side of the equation. Does stable net interest margin outlook contemplate any further liability manage actions outside of just repricing and deposits? And then related to that, you noted that premium am fell to $45 million in the quarter, how much premium amortization is left? What is the assumed duration of those securities today and what yields are you reinvesting today?","David J. Turner","I will tell you on the premium amortization, I think our number is closer to about $700 million. We'll flip pages and find that exact number. That number is slowing down considerably. What's really going on from the maturities and paydowns, going back into the mortgage-backed share in that 275 range, and that's kind of where we'll be. The asset funding, what was your question?","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Is there anything outside of deposit repricing that's contemplated in the liability management side?","David J. Turner","We really kind of run the course of the pure liability component of that. Anything that has to do -- that's tied to capital has to go through the CCAR process. So we need to -- we can't comment really on the capital elements of that, that could -- that manifests themselves at times in interest expense. So you have to wait until March to hear our CCAR results.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. I just have one quick high-level follow-up. David, if I tied together all the guidance that you've given with -- from loan growth, stable margin, lower expenses, is it fair to say that the operating leverage that you drive in 2014 will be more balanced between revenues and expenses relative to your, I believe, your prior guidance whereas it will mostly come from the revenue side?","David J. Turner","We've actually been working on operating leverage from both sides. It's obviously a little easier to move on the expense side. But this year, 2014, we see contributions from both, both revenue and expenses. As we mentioned pretty confidently, our goal is to generate positive operating leverage. We think we have the plan in place to do that. We could change that. It's a very different rate environment than what we're assuming, but we're fairly confident on that. The premium, by the way, is $700 million of amortized, which will be tied to the mortgage-backed. So I just want to confirm that with you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin with Citi.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I want to ask, you've been a bit more upfront than some of your peers about considering doing -- making acquisition. So in terms of getting a deal done or making an acquisition, has anything changed in terms of the number of conversations you're having or in terms of the regulatory burden that you have to clear to get a deal done?","O. B. Grayson Hall","I mean, I haven't -- I can't comment on the comparative analysis between us and the peers. But clearly, what we're trying to do is to strengthen our balance sheet, finish our derisking activities and put ourselves in position when and where opportunities present themselves, and when and where they're appropriate, but we really have no comment beyond that. I still think it's early yet, and that hold today [ph].","David J. Turner","And let me clarify what you may be getting at. The question we get often times, we got it today, is how do you think about capital allocation. And so we've mentioned acquisitions as the thought process before we get to the return to shareholders. The caveat is if and when those are available, and you need to -- not that we don\u2019t want to get the cart before the horse. There are lot of things that need to happen in order to get to that. We do believe acquisitions would be part of our industry. We think it will be part of us, but it will be at the right time. And we're not trying to signal anything other than the capital allocation process on how we think about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Maybe just a couple of quick ones for David. David, you mentioned that you -- we should probably throw out the history books in terms of thinking about deposit outflow. So let we ask the question in a slightly different way. If you were to assume something closer to 80% of the incremental deposits you have in this cycle flowing out rather than maybe the -- rather than a historical number that's closer to 50%, how much of a change would that create in your estimate of the interest rate benefit from higher rates?","David J. Turner","I don\u2019t know if I can answer it that way. Let me try to frame it up. When I say throw out the history books, we clearly look at what occurred last cycle, but we've all had deposits that have come into our balance sheets over the past several years. And what we think is happening is that the liquidity requirements of our customers, in particular, our commercial customers that have non-interest-bearing deposits, we think they're not going to -- we think there's a chance that they actually keep more on deposit and leverage up more to preserve that liquidity for a rainy day. We don't know that, that will happen. It may. That's why we go through multiple scenarios with regards to outflows. Clearly, something out of the ordinary deposit outflows. We shock -- we have multiple risk scenarios that we use to establish tolerance, risk tolerance, in the company, subject to board review. If we end up having more outflows than what we think our core is, we'll have a plan to address that. So if it's higher, markedly higher, then there'll be actions that we take well in advance of that occurring so that we don't get caught having to go out and put high price deposits on our books to fund ourselves.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then for my follow-up, in terms of the expense guidance that you provided, I'm presuming that your expense number for '14 is going to be on an adjusted basis as well when we begin that comparison to the 3.43 number that you gave us.","David J. Turner","Yes, I think we put our prepared comments on the same basis. That's what that was intended to do, be clear that it's apples-to-apples.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Matt, I'll go ahead and add. We have in our base scenario for our outflows and deposits a higher percentage than our history indicates. So I just want to point that out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got a question, going back, David, you've pointed out, like just to revisit the expense kind of guidance again. But if you look at the trends through the year, the adjusted operating number went down from around 850 to around 830 in the -- from fourth quarter last year to mid-year. In the mid-year to the end of the year, it increased from that 830 number closer to the 888 or 890-ish type of level in the fourth quarter. To get back down to the annual number, you got to really reverse that trend and get down something close to $850 million. So we're just making sure that the trend and the thought process of what's happened the last couple of quarters are going to reverse, and quarterly, we're going to see incremental declines.","David J. Turner","Marty, our guidance that we're giving you is on an annual basis, and we furthermore indicated that there could be some volatility in a particular quarter. We think looking at this as more long-term basis, one year, is a better indication of kind of our commitment to expense management. You saw our increases in the second half of the year primarily due to investments that we decided to make. We thought it was important to make investments in the revenue generation folks. I've talked about financial results and wealth a couple of times. We're dependent in other areas in -- that we've made those investments in. We also are working down cost. Cost and mortgage, we've talked about cost in our branch network, we'll continue to focus on. We've looked at legal and professional fees. We'll continue to watch that very closely. Our FDIC cost in terms of reducing the risk in our balance sheet such that we get lower charges coming from the FDIC there. So it's no one place, but if you want to get on the run rate, and you see the change that has to happen from the fourth quarter to the first, if you use history, it hasn't come down pretty aggressively, but our commitment is for the year right now. As we get going for the year, we'll be, perhaps, more specific on the quarters, but that's not our message today.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Understood. I'm just trying to get to the kind of benchmark you'd have to get to the full year. And then lastly, the follow-up question would be on the FDIC or deposit administration fees or expenses. You dropped from the mid-30s to $20 million this quarter. Is that a good run rate and does the sell of these TDRs eventually bring it lower than the $20 million per quarter that it was at this quarter so just kind of the continuation of the trend in that line item?","David J. Turner","Yes, we've put in our prepared comments that we thought the run rate would be somewhere between the third quarter and the fourth quarter's number. We did have some unusual things in this quarter that won't repeat so we're giving you guidance that would be between those 2, third and fourth. We do, in our overall expense guidance that were taken into account, changes that we're making on the balance sheet, which includes this quarter's transfer of loans to held-for-sale, and the ultimate disposition of those. So yes, that's already been baked in our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gaston Ceron with MorningStar Equity Research.","Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just quickly, I just wanted to go back to the branch consolidation issue. So you're cutting 30 offices. So that should take you to around, what, 1,675. I know you didn't say anything -- you didn't say, I think, the number of expenses associated with the offices. I'm curious if you've released the headcount associated with those branches. And also, I thought I saw a comment sort of intra-quarter from one of your executives in one of your conferences about how something to the fact that you're always looking at branch consolidations, but some of the low hanging fruit is gone, given the consolidation that you have done. So I'm curious what does this 30 office cut mean as far as anything we can expect in the future.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, I think we've gone through a fairly extensive review of all our branch offices and are -- and we do that on a continuous basis, and so the 30 consolidations that we announced in the fourth quarter shouldn't surprise anyone. This is not new for us. We look at our branch offices literally on a regular basis and make decisions. If you look at remaining offices, we had -- we had a little over 1,700 -- 1,705 offices. By reducing these 30, you have to look at the remaining balance of that and about 1,600 in -- sorry, if you look at full service branches, we had about 1,625 of those. A lot of those other offices, that 1,705 were drive-throughs, just purely drive-throughs, and so you have to back out those drive-throughs to get to full service. So even on the full service, we've gone through a fairly exhaustive process, looking at staffing, looking at transactions, looking at the kinds of technology we have in those offices, and have made decisions that improve the overall efficiency of that channel. We balance that. We're also looking at other channels in terms of our web-based services, and our mobile based services in our contact center, and there is a lot of changes in customer behavior across those channels, and we're finding ways to continue to serve our customers well, but differently. And so branch channels' still very relevant for a big percentage of our customers and a big percentage of our sales, and we'll continue to invest in physical branch offices, but we're going to do it obviously with a lot more discipline than we did, we've embarked on, as we've studied this issue much more closely.","Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Got it. And I'm sorry, and have you released the headcount associated with the 30 branches or no?","O. B. Grayson Hall","We have not.","David J. Turner","Not yet. That will be a first quarter...","O. B. Grayson Hall","That will be a first quarter event.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of questions. First one, how are you thinking about reserves? Levels or reserves to loans are down to 1.81%. And especially in light of the fact that you took a fairly large 22% mark on the loans you transferred to held-for-sale, and what that would imply for your ongoing provisions, David, [indiscernible] because your core provision were only $4 million when we exclude that portion of the mark that went to the provision line.","David J. Turner","Yes, so we're down to 1 8. We acknowledge the charge taken on the transfer, but those -- that charge is related to the fair value of the loans that exist. And those fair values are derived by the required rate that they would have on those assets today versus that -- the yield that's on that since when they went through a troubled debt restructuring. And if you think about a troubled debt restructuring, one of the ways that you reduce that payment, if you will, from the individual is to reduce the rate. So our primary mechanism of troubled debt restructuring at that time was rate reduction and\/or extension in terms, very little press for forgiveness. And -- but the market is demanding a fair value rate today. So when you calculate that, that differential has to go through your reserve, but that is not something that you normally can reserve for in your allowance. So I don't think you can equate the reduction to the adequacy of the 1 8. I will tell you, as our credit metrics continue to improve, including a reduction in nonperformers, reduction in credit size and class size, our reduction in the past dues, our reduction in the transfers going into nonperforming loan coming down, leaves us to believe that our reserve level will continue to decline. We're at a charge-off of 67 basis points this quarter. As Grayson mentioned, there are a couple of things in there that cause that to be higher than what we thought it might be, which was continue to be lower than that number. So we see charge-offs continuing to come down, but maybe see volatility in here. But we feel good about where we're reserving, and then our provision will continue to be lower as a result of that credit -- \"credit leverage\" that we have in the reserve, but we'll have to see.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, in light of that, though, David, if you take out that $151 million mark, your net charge-offs of $127 million and your provisioning, your core provision was $4 million, so how should we think about, going forward, even if that $127 million comes on, where does that $4 million trend to?","David J. Turner","Well, we'll have to see how things settle out in terms of the ultimate reserve levels. But we do expect that $127 million to continue to come down as a whole, again, with some volatility. Where it stops and where the terminal point is, we'll have to see. We would argue that it wouldn't be sustainable that it will be $4 million every single quarter. But given our reserve levels, compared to how our credit metrics are trending, makes us feel good that we have the right reserve levels today, and how low they can go, we're just going to have to see.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And Grayson, I have a follow-up for you. The loan growth that you said you raised by 1%, is that just reflecting the loan because you sold about 1% of loan? Is that simply that's what's being reflected there?","David J. Turner","It's actually -- it's we went and looked at our expectations of GDP growth for next year, slightly higher than we had a quarter or so ago. We feel incrementally better about that. And as a result of that, in talking to our business groups and team leaders, we felt that an increase from the 2% to 4% that we had indicated a quarter or so ago, that 3% to 5% was a better indicator of what that percentage of increase could be.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But then when you -- given that you did sell 1% of loans, would that mean that some dollar amount delta that didn't really change that much, right?","David J. Turner","Yes, it's because the base is so large. It's just not that big of a change.","O. B. Grayson Hall","There are no more questions, and so we thank you for your time, and attention on this call, and we'll stand adjourned.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call.

I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only, at the end of the call there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.","List Underwood","Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation on our call this morning. Our presenters today are Chief Executive Officer, Grayson Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Turner. Other members of management are present as well and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also, as part of our earnings call, we\u2019ll be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","Finally, let me remind you that in this call and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking statement that is located in the appendix of the presentation.","With that said, I will turn it over to Grayson.","Grayson Hall","Thank you, List, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Regions and participation in our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Today we reported earnings of $292 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Overall, we are pleased with our results, which reflect our steady progress as we continue to effectively execute on our business plans.","Total revenue was diversified among product lines and increased 2%. Meanwhile, our adjusted expenses decline, improving our adjusted efficiency ratio 270 basis points, 64.2% and importantly, our number of customers and quality households increased again in the second quarter.","We are continuing to build on our solid foundation by focusing on the fundamentals. This quarter we grew loans, deposits and checking accounts. In addition this quarter, we were able to increase our shareholder dividend to $0.05 per quarter.","Through the first half of 2014 loans increased $1.9 billion or 2.6%. Business lending had delivered strong growth this year, which has become more broad-based geographically and by industry time. We are seeing momentum in our upper middle market sector as companies are beginning to demand credit, the competition remains elevated in this lending segment.","On the consumer side, credit card and mortgage balances increased and indirect auto portfolio continue to expand. Growth in indirect lending portfolio was driven in part by process improvement initiatives instituted earlier this year. These initiatives improve loan processing automation and increased pull-through rates on loan closings.","As a result, sales production per dealer has increased 18% in the first half of 2014. Across the organization we are focused on driving process improvement to reduced variability, improve processes and performance, and accelerate efficiencies and effectiveness.","As with indirect auto example, our efficiency initiatives extent beyond expense reductions and also focus on ways to enhance revenue, we currently have several initiatives underway to optimize loan processing, enhance the customer experience, develop small business online banking capabilities and much more.","We are also continually working to identify customer needs and provide customers with the type of products and services they want and need, while making it easier to do business with Regions. It is the personal dedication from every associate that is making the difference at Regions.","This commitments not only from our customer facing associates, which are regularly recognized for their excellent customer service, but also for the back-office support associates who are constantly working to improve our processes, our products and our technology.","While the economic environment continues to improve and recover, we are staying focus on the things we can control. This quarter\u2019s decline in interest rates makes topline revenue growth even more challenging. However, we are committed to our prudent credit standards in order to increase revenue.","As a result, our asset quality continues to improve, as net charge-offs, non-performing loans, trouble debit restructurings declined in the second quarter. In order to create a more streamlined corporate structure focused on execution, we recently realigned our business units and geography leadership creating a general bank with consist of businesses and serve retail wealth management and business. And a small bank and a corporate, which consist of businesses that serve middle market and large corporate plants.","Importantly, we believe this realignment creates a more effective model for executing our business strategy, managing our performance and most importantly, serving our customers.","To close, we are pleased with this quarter\u2019s results, but we realized we must continue to remain focused and find ways to optimize our franchise in order to create long-term shareholder value.","I will now turn it over to David Turner, who will cover the details of our second quarter results. David?","David Turner","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s take a look at the detail starting with balance sheet. We achieved another quarter of steady growth as loan balances were up $833 million or 1.1%. Notably, both our business and consumer lending portfolio grew as total loan production increased 22%, reflecting an improving economy.","The business lending portfolio totaled $48 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 1% from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily driven by commercial and industrial loans, which grew $888 million or 3%.","C&I growth was led by our general industries group within the geographies, as well as our asset base and specialized lending groups. In particular, our technology and defense group achieved solid growth.","In addition to the seasonal impact we typically experience in the second quarter, we are seeing an increasing number of commercial customers utilizing loans and lines to fund working capital, general financial needs and to some extent M&A.","C&I loan production increased 26% and loan -- line utilization increased 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Meanwhile, commitments for new loans increased $1 billion. While ending investor real estate balances were down slightly from the first quarter, average balances were up. We expect to benefit from some incremental growth over the remainder of the year in this important loan category.","Total consumer lending increased $206 million linked quarter and represented 38% of our total loan portfolio at quarter end. The growth in the consumer portfolio was led by indirect auto lending.","Both balances and production increased 5% from the prior quarter. With our focus on process improvement and a positive outlook for auto sales, we expect continued growth in this portfolio.","Credit card balances increased $28 million or 3% from the previous quarter. This increase stems from a 14% increase in spending volumes and a 3% increase in new credit cards sales. We expect balance growth to continue over the remainder of the year.","Mortgage balances were up modestly this quarter, as production increased 31% linked-quarter and applications increased 18%. Also mortgage prepayments typically linked to refinancing activity slowed from the previous quarter. Originations continue to be driven by new home purchases and represented 76% of total originations.","Total home-equity loan balances declined $84 million as loan payoff continued to outpace new production. Total home-equity production increased 32% from the previous quarter.","Importantly, as customer\u2019s home values increased, they are taking advantage of both the fixed rate home equity loan product, as well as the variable rate home equity line product. Our direct consumer lending portfolio totaled $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 4% from the prior quarter.","We currently have several new initiatives and products under development that we anticipate will further expand this portfolio overtime. Looking ahead, based on what we know today and reflecting our current economic forecast, we continue to expect 2014 loan growth to be in the 3% to 5% range.","Let\u2019s take a look at deposits. Deposits continue to grow increasing by $429 million during the second quarter. Similarly, low-cost deposits grew by $697 million and continue to account for the majority at 90% of total deposits.","Deposit costs remained at historically low levels and totaled 11 basis points, while total funding costs declined to 31 basis points in the second quarter. We continue to expect 2014 deposit growth to be in the 1% to 2% range for the year.","Let\u2019s take a look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $837 million, an increase of $6 million. The resulting net interest margin declined 2 basis points to 3.24%.","Net interest income was positively impacted by loan growth. However, this improvement was offset by lower asset yields and loan spread compression, resulting from the persistently low rate environment and competitive pricing pressures.","Regions has been able to maintain a relatively stable margin, primarily due to improvements in deposits and borrowing costs, and due to the decline in rates that has persistent. Looking forward, we expect some modest net interest margin compression in the 5 to 7 basis point range. However, we expect to be able to grow net interest income concurrent with loan growth.","We remain asset sensitive and expect to benefit from increases in both short and long-term rates. Therefore if the improvement in economic conditions translates into an increase in rates, we would anticipate lift the both net interest income and net interest margin.","Let\u2019s move on to non-interest revenues. Total non-interest revenue increased 4% to $457 million in the second quarter. Service charges increased 1% from the first quarter, aided by an increase in checking accounts in the first half of the year. In addition, service charges are typically seasonally lower in the first quarter.","Card and ATM fees increased 6% from the previous quarter. Debit card transaction volume increased 8% from the first quarter attributable to higher spending and the growth in checking accounts. Credit card income benefited from a 3% increase in sales of new credit cards, as well as spending increase.","Now with respect to our ready advance product, as you recall, we discontinued offering this product to new customers in late January and existing customers will be phased out by the end of the year. While we were in this trial for short period of time relative to some of our peers, we learn how to offer small dollar credit to our retail customers in a more effective manner.","We will take this knowledge and build on our commitment to providing all of our customers with credit solutions that meet their needs. But we don't know how many of these customers will avail themselves of our credit products, just to help you frame it up, the contribution from the ready advance product on a pretax basis was approximately $6 million this quarter.","And to remind everyone, we have successfully dealt with many legislative challenges that have impacted our non-interest revenue to a greater degree than the ready advance product, which gives us confidence in dealing with these changes looking forward.","Let\u2019s turn to the expenses. We continue to focus on controlling expenses and our results reflect those efforts. Adjusted non-interest expenses totaled $827 million in the second quarter, down 2% linked-quarter. Salaries and benefits declined 3% from the first quarter, the majority of which was related to lower payroll taxes and benefits.","In addition, year-to-date, we have reduced overall headcount by 839 positions or 3.5%, primarily driven by new branch optimization staffing strategy and the impact of recent branch consolidations.","Deposit administrative fees declined $9 million, primarily related to our refund from previously incurred fees and going forward, the run rate is expected to be similar to that of the first quarter.","Although, our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 64.2%, we remain committed to driving continued efficiencies across organization. We continue to expect full year 2014 adjusted expenses to be lower than those of 2013.","Let\u2019s move on to asset quality. We continue to make progress in the second quarter as many credit metrics improved. Net charge-offs totaled $67 million, which represented 35 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $35 million or $32 million less charge-offs.","Our non-performing loans declined 16% linked-quarter and inflows of non-performing loans declined 8%. At quarter end, our loan-loss allowance to non-performing loans or coverage ratio was 137%.","In addition, total late stage delinquencies declined 2% and total debt restructurings or TDRs declined 15%, driven by payoff and paydowns. And while total criticized loans increased from the previous quarter, classified loans continue to decline and just to be clear, the results of the shared national credit exam have been reflected in the results for this quarter. Based on what we know today, we expect favorable asset quality trends to continue. However, at this point in cycle, volatility in certain metrics can be expected.","Let\u2019s move on to capital and liquidity. Our capital position remains strong as our estimated Tier 1 ratio at end of the quarter stood at 12.5%. Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.6%, an increase of 20 basis points from the previous quarter.","We estimate our fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio to be 11%, well above the minimum threshold and liquidity at both the bank and holding company remains solid with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 82%. Importantly, based on our understanding of the proposed rule, regions remain well-positioned to be fully compliant with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio.","Now, in summary, our second quarter results continue to build on the momentum established earlier in the year. We believe that by focusing on our customers and by creating products and services that meet their needs, we will grow our customer base, deepen existing relationships and strengthen the communities in which we operate.","Furthermore, we continue to create and foster an environment that attracts and retains top talent, allowing us not only better serve our customers but also successfully execute on our strategic priorities, all of which we believe will ultimately create long-term value for our shareholders.","Thank you for your time and attention this morning and I will now turn it back over to List for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.","List Underwood","Thank you, David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session. In order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning, I would like to ask each caller to please limit yourself to one primary question and one related follow-up question. Now, let\u2019s open up the line now for your questions, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Keith Murray of ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI","Thanks. Let me just spend a minute on trends behind the service charge on deposits, basically flattish quarter-over-quarter, down a little year-over-year. What\u2019s going on behind there?","David Turner","From a service charge -- Keith, this is David. Honestly seasonally low in the first quarter, generally picks up in the second. We have had couple of things going on. First of, we are growing accounts which is encouraging. The customer behaviors have changed as well. From what we see, the customers are being more careful with how they manage their accounts and that\u2019s reflected in some of the negative in terms of our service charge line.","We think the right thing to do is continue to create products and services that our customers need and will value. That is pay for what they get and we believe the way to continue to increase those service charge line item is through the customer growth that we are seeing and we have our -- all of our associates focusing on growing that line item.","Keith Murray - ISI","Thank you. And then just on the loan growth guidance, it looks like you're calling for a little bit slower growth in the back half of the year versus the first half. Where are you seeing little bit of decline in momentum category wise?","Grayson Hall","I\u2019ll answer and then I\u2019ll ask David to expand on it. We forecasted loan growth in sort of 3% to 5% range and we still feel that\u2019s an appropriate for us to forecast that at this juncture. We are seeing credit demand more broadly than we\u2019ve seen in the past, which has been an encouraging improvement.","I would just say that we have seen increased competition in that space as well, both from banks and non-banks. And so it is that activity is taking place, we still believe that we\u2019re doing a great job of getting in front of customers, our bankers are some of the best and we\u2019re winning lot of the business but given what we\u2019re seeing now from both the demand and a competition standpoint, we still believe our forecast is in line. David?","David Turner","Yeah, we started, Keith, the first quarter, really strong start with several conferences and were asked why we\u2019re in the 3% and 5% range when the run rate clearly would imply much larger. One quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, two quarters didn\u2019t quite make a trend either. But as we look out and we see the demands for credit, larger corporate demand, still not seeing quite a small business demand that we\u2019d like to see and we\u2019re still cautious about being beyond 3% to 5%.","We want to make good loans, profitable loans. We are saying no more today than we have been as a result of some of the competitive pricing pressures and structure -- structures that we see. So right now, we still think 3% to 5% is a right number. We'll see what happens in the third quarter and update that on the next call.","Grayson Hall","Pipelines are robust. We still feel good about the pipelines. To David\u2019s point, the production even in the small business sector has been good, it\u2019s been encouraging but it hasn\u2019t resulted in lot of growth in outstandings because of payoffs and paydowns. But we still see -- continue to see awful lot of deleveraging taking place out of bank debt. And while the demand is picking up and we feel bullish about where the economy is going, we still -- we still are concerned about the level of competition and the level of alternatives for some of our borrowing.","Keith Murray - ISI","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks very much.","Grayson Hall","Good morning Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of the forward-looking statements. With respect to your operating expense lines, if we were to simply annualize the first two quarters here, we\u2019d end up achieving the guidance. So I guess my key question on this is should we expect incremental improvements from the second quarter $827 million level?","David Turner","We\u2019ve -- as I mentioned in our prepared comments, we continue to focus on expenses every day given the challenges in growing revenue. Our guidance has been year-over-year guidance which we want to stick with right now. But every line item that you see in and a lot of line items are underneath what you see in our public financial statements. We are working hard on every single one of those.","Obviously, the driver on expense management -- the number one, our largest category is our salaries and benefits, occupancy. We continue to look at furniture and fixtures. We look at -- but we\u2019re having savings in some areas and investments in others. We've invested an awful lot in regulatory compliance, given what\u2019s going on in our industry and but I think we can continue to become more efficient. Our efficiency ratio was down quite a bit from last quarter.","We have given guidance that we would continue to work to the lower 60s over the year. How low we can go, we\u2019ll have to see. Large -- a big part of that\u2019s really the revenue side of the equation versus expenses.","Grayson Hall","And obviously also David, we\u2019re clearly focused on positive operating leverage and while we\u2019ve given guidance to our expenses this year to come in below last year\u2019s final number. We are focused on trying to deliver prudent growth and to the extent that this growth were to exceed our expectations than obviously some of the compensation around that would also increase. But right now, we still feel good about our guidance.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","On the service component, is there incremental headcount reduction to come or is that largely through at this stage?","Grayson Hall","I would say the majority of the headcount reductions that resulted in the rationalization of our branch staffing and also rationalization of the number of branches. Those who were in the numbers today but we continue to look for efficiency opportunities across the company and still confident in our ability to driver those efficiencies out. So incrementally, there are still opportunity and -- but the parts you saw coming out of first quarter, it had a lot to do with some of the branch rationalization work we do.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And if I may sneak in one more, can you -- I heard your comments on the asset quality outlook but how specifically should we think about the adequacy of the provision at this level down into the 1.4% range?","David Turner","You\u2019re talking about the allowance.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Correct.","David Turner","We have a pretty sophisticated model that as we go through the exercise every quarter in terms of, determine -- determining what the allowance needs to be. We will continue to follow that. You know, as credit quality continues to improve in particular non-performing loans, TDRs and charge-offs gives us more confidence that the allowance level can come down some as well.","Where that terminal value is, it\u2019s very difficult for us to come up with. We had originally given you guidance on a range of 1.5% to 2%. We think we can go south of that number given the improvement of our credit quality. But we have been reluctant to peg exactly where we think that can get to because it\u2019s really depends on what our model tells us. And so we\u2019re going to stick to that.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Matt.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Good morning. If I could follow up on the net interest margin outlook for down 5 to 7 basis points, I guess first to clarify, is that combined down 5 to 7 basis points for the back half of this year?","David Turner","That\u2019s down from where we\u2019re right now back half of the year. That\u2019s correct.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay, so in total over two quarters potentially down 5% to 7%?","David Turner","That\u2019s right.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then I guess just bigger picture, why is there the margin pressure? I guess if I look at short and medium-term rates, they haven't really changed. Obviously the tenure has come in. Is it some of the bond premium amortization or is it loan pricing or is it just that the shorter end of the curve hasn't moved up at all or all of them?","David Turner","We expected the short rates to be where they are. Long rates we have expected to rise a little bit towards the back half of the year, still do but the tenure persistently lower. If you look at LIBOR, LIBOR is down lower as well. So -- and I think it\u2019s just this continued reinvestment that we are having to make with our cash flows in the lower rate environment that continues to put pressure on net interest margin.","That being said, we continue to grow loan portfolio like we think we can. We think net interest income can grow commensurate with that loan growth that we will have. So from a competitive standpoint, we have -- we've been relatively stable from a margin standpoint. I think our peer average that we track were down about 6 points this quarter. And we've done relatively well but at some point we\u2019ve got to -- it's going to catch up to us from a NIM standpoint.","We've had deposit growth that we need to deal with, which is a good thing but you have extra cash flows put to work, some of that sitting at Federal Reserve where you don\u2019t get a lot of carry and they actually work against you from a NIM standpoint. So I would be overly focused on the NIM but we are going to have the challenges just like everybody else will have and our focus is really on growth of net interest income line.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay, that's helpful. And just separately, the deposit advance product, that has gotten a lot of focus and I think at $6 million a quarter, is materially less than people were fearing. Remind us is that included in the service charge on deposit? And if so, has there already been a little bit of decline in that product which is why the fees are flat or down $1 million year-over-year?","David Turner","That\u2019s right. Matt, it\u2019s all in the service charge line and so that\u2019s a result of discontinuation of new clients coming in January. Clearly, there has been some runoff there. That is reflected in the first and second quarter service charge line items, clearly a bigger impact in the second quarter than the first given our timing. So that\u2019s a little bit -- that may get little bit to Keith\u2019s point that he started with those service charges as well.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR.","Paul Miller - FBR","Yeah. Thank you very much. On the troubled debt restructuring, your TDRs, we know that there's a pretty hot market for that stuff right now and some of your competitors have been selling assets into that. I know you sold some a couple quarters ago, but I don't believe you sold any this quarter. Can you give me some thoughts -- are you just going to just let that portfolio run off or is there opportunities to sell that at some pretty good prices today?","David Turner","I think Paul if you look at the transaction that we had for the fourth quarter, we closed it in the first. It was unique. We felt given that pool of assets and pricing for that particular pool was the right thing for us to do. We continue to evaluate opportunities to sell assets, TDRs, when the economics make sense. And when the trade that makes us work, we\u2019re not going to do it just to unload troubled debt restructurings.","If you look at our TDRs, there\u2019s a disproportionate amount those that are paying us as agreed and accruing. We just have them in TDR classification because they met the definition of restructuring at the time. We do think that in particular in the commercial side, we\u2019re seeing credit improve. You can see that in our metrics from classified to criticized assets as loans continue to improve and they've been upgraded to better categories. And so overtime, we think some of those TDRs will be payoffs.","Again, they are paying us as agreed so there will be pay offs, there will be pay downs. And there will be some -- it just get better and upon renewal, those could go into different classification. So it\u2019s really about three or four things working there to help us improve TDRs, but it\u2019s all about -- the number one driver is asset quality improvement.","Grayson Hall","Will and Paul, I think additionally we look at the relationships we have with these customers and many of these customers may be in a TDR status, but they are paying as agreed and they have a deep relationship with our company. And so we take that into consideration. But to David\u2019s point, we continue to look at this category, that's on our balance sheet and try to make the best decision for what\u2019s best long term for the company and our customers.","Paul Miller - FBR","And you don't take -- I mean you do take more of a capital charge with the TDRs, would you rather take that capital charge if you can maintain a customer? Is that what basically you\u2019re telling me?","Grayson Hall","I mean, I think to David\u2019s point, we look at the economics and the economics is not only of the trade, but the economics is the value of that relationship on an ongoing basis.","Paul Miller - FBR","Okay. Hey, guys, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Hey, good morning, guys. So just to ask Eric's question a little different way. When we look at expenses in the back half of last year, there was a pretty big ramp. So I guess assuming your base case of 3% to 5% loan growth, assuming that does happen, should we expect to see a ramp from the current levels or do you think you can continue to keep expenses close to where we are today?","Grayson Hall","So if you recall last year, Ryan, we were investing quite heavily in our wealth management initiative and we had hired a number of people towards the second half of last year really to get that initiative up and running and we made a lot of progress on that, but that initiative is funded today. And so depending on what the opportunities are in the last half, we can\u2019t predict those. Right now, we are pretty pleased with where we stand from a staffing standpoint and absent any unforecasted opportunities to bring more talent into the company, we are going we think where we need to be.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Then Grayson, just on capital, unless I missed it in the release, you guys have one of the highest capital ratios of your peers. And it looked and if unless my math is wrong, it doesn't look like you guys used much of the buyback at all. Yet last year if I remember, you used over half your authorization right out of the gate. So can you just talk your decision to hold off on the $350 million or so buyback? I think we've seen a couple of others out there who have been constructive on the back half of the year utilizing large chunks early on, so I would be interested to hear your view on using capital.","Grayson Hall","Yes, absolutely, your memory is good. Last year we\u2019re fairly early in the process of executing buybacks. And this year we submitted the capital plan that\u2019s different than year. We think we\u2019ve done the right thing for our company, but it is a different plan than we executed last year. David?","David Turner","Yes, I think, Ryan, we -- let me just go through kind of steps on how we think about capital, clearly we want to get our dividend up. We want to use our capital for growing organically. We want to use our capital after that for growth of portfolios, growth of businesses, whether they be banks or non-banks and when that manifests itself to return it to shareholders.","So we submitted our capital plan early January based on our third quarter of last year. It\u2019s been a while and we put in there specific capital actions that we would like to engage, including the timing thereof. And without being too specific, we are executing according to the plan that we submitted to our regulatory supervisors that didn\u2019t receive an objection. So you know what our buyback is, we made that public and we will execute according to that plan.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Got it. If I could just sneak in one other quick one, I know you noted that the SNC exam was in this quarter's results. I do think some of us were surprised that we did see a 24% increase in the special mentioned loans. Was this driven by the SNC exam? And if not, can you just give us some color as to what drove the quarter-over-quarter increase?","David Turner","Well, we can\u2019t comment specifically on regulatory activities. I tried to put that in my prepared comments that the results from that exam have been incorporated and what you see in our numbers. You also as you look at the classified and criticized schedule, it\u2019s in our supplement. You will see the improvement classifieds moving some of that improvement moved into special mentioned. So net, net if you look at them together, we are up I think about 2%. We are still encouraged by the path of our credit quality. There is nothing that cause us to believe that our credit quality is turning to go the other way which I think is really what your ultimate question is.","Grayson Hall","As these credits migrate, you are going to see more credits move into that special mention category as that particular credit recovers.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Marty.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Good morning. Grayson, I want to ask kind of a strategic question. When you're looking at potential kind of pockets of further recovery, I look at the excess capital that's been built and it's continuing to go higher. You've got excess liquidity to deploy at some point and you've got the rate sensitivity that's sitting there. Can you just talk a little bit about strategically how you think of these three things and how you are wanting to use those for the best benefit of your shareholders?","Grayson Hall","Yeah, I think Marty as David was trying to articulate just a moment ago is that we\u2019ve made a conscious decision to try to position our company in this way. We think it\u2019s to our strategic advantage to position ourselves this way. We do know that we\u2019ve got some excess capital relative to peers. We do think we still have pockets of recovery that is still occurring in the markets that we operate in and in the portfolios that we have owned our balance sheet. We think that every quarter puts us in a little bit better position and still confident and encourage by the progress we are making.","That excess capital, excess liquidity is certainly something we discuss and work through from a strategy standpoint. I think that as we put together our capital plan for this year, we try to weigh those opportunities and what we thought timing of those kind of opportunities might be in. And we put our plan together accordingly. So if those growth opportunities don\u2019t occur as we thought or don\u2019t occur on the timeline we thought, we will make adjustments as we go forward, but right now we are pleased with our position. I anticipate questions on this issue, but we still remain pleased with where we are at.","David Turner","Yeah, Marty, I will add, from an excess capital standpoint, this gives us maximum flexibility to do some things. We realized that whatever those things might be don\u2019t manifest themselves that we can\u2019t continue to pile up capital and work against our return metrics and the fact that our common equity cost is still much higher than we want it to be. So we get the message. We know we have a plan for getting that deployed in a meaningful manner going forward.","From an excess liquidity standpoint, we are sitting here with loan deposit ratio of 82%. We do have this new thing coming called the LCR, liquidity coverage ratio that we all need to be very careful on what that means to our industry. It is a big change, and of course we don\u2019t have the final rules, but we feel confident based on what we see today that we are going to be fully compliant with that. But that will have a different liquidity profile when it\u2019s implemented than we do today. And so we need to be careful there.","From an interest rate risk standpoint, we are continuing to be asset sensitive. We would love for rates increase some. Unfortunately given the economy, given a lot of geopolitical issues we don\u2019t know that we will see that in \u201914. We think perhaps we see that in the latter part of \u201915. That being said, we think our balance sheet positioning is the right thing for us at this time.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","The other thing I was going to just kind of big picture is efficiency ratio. You've made a lot of progress in getting that down from like 70% into the low 60s. Traditionally the low 60s has kind of been where Regions has kind of plateaued so you've made a lot of progress even compared to historically where you've been with the ability to show at least when revenues pop on rising interest rates. So it just seems like to me the operating leverage is getting to a point where you could probably squeeze that pretty tightly and you're waiting on that next round to kind of get you down towards the 60% range.","David Turner","Yeah, I mean, Marty I think we work very hard. We made pretty solid progress on improving operating efficiency of the company and a lot of progress on the expense side of the income statement. We\u2019ve done a lot of things in terms of rationalizing our workforce and rationalizing our fiscal infrastructure. We reduced several million square feet of space, so we focused on a lot of process reengineering to take a lot of the labor out of different processes.","So we feel pretty good about what we -- we feel encouraged by what we have done on the expense side. At the same time we face some pretty big challenges in terms of revenue generation. There have been a number of regulatory and legislative activities that challenged our other revenue side of our income statement. And so if you look at our challenges today, it\u2019s much more apparent on the revenue than on the expense side.","All that being said, we still are spending an awful lot of time and still finding opportunities to reduce expenses in our company and we will continue to do so. But we likewise are spending an equal amount of time trying to figure out how we generate revenues inside our company. Obviously an increase in interest rate would be very helpful to our revenues, but today we can\u2019t depend on that, we can\u2019t expect that to happen quickly. So we are finding other ways to do that. And we are growing households, growing accounts, and growing the debt of our relationships, our customers and then start to make a difference.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Hi. Good morning, Grayson. The first question just a follow-up on the service charges. Thank you for quantifying the deposit advance. So I was wondering if you could just help us walk through those changes in behavior that you've seen in other parts of the service charges and maybe how much is related to changes on the overdraft side and then also just your further expectations about trying to help us size overdrafts. And hopefully we'll get them someday, this expected rules what type of potential impact we are still looking at there?","Grayson Hall","Well, I think it\u2019s a -- it maybe a challenge to our revenues, but I think it\u2019s a good news for our economy. We\u2019re really seeing much more financial discipline out of the consumers which are banking with us. If you recall back several quarters ago, we\u2019re predominantly a free checking provider and we went to fee eligible. So 97%, 98% of our accounts today are fee eligible based off of balances or transaction activity hurdles. And what we are seeing is people are managing to those requirements and doing a better job at that today than ever before. So they are carrying higher balances and we also are seeing customers who are avoiding overdraft activities.","And so you are seeing better personal discipline around that. It\u2019s interesting you see the same thing on the card side both the credit card and debit cards, spending is up, strong double digits on those cards, but balances on the credit side continue to be modest. So we would just continue to say that the economy of the consumer appears to be getting stronger and the financial discipline around those customers appears to be better.","As a result, a lot of the fees that we typically would have seen are not as strong as they were, but I actually think that\u2019s a good news and I also think that it bodes well for when deposit gathering franchises become valuable again. There will be a point when interest rate comes up and our ability to gather deposits is really the strength of this organization.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. And then secondly on the wealth management side, I just noticed two of the three lines looked pretty good but the third line, the biggest one, the investment management trust fee income was a little light sequentially and year-over-year. So I just wonder if you can give us an update on either specifically what impacted that this quarter and also your take up and relative growth expectations for that wealth management business looking ahead. Thanks.","Grayson Hall","Yeah, Ken, I would tell you that the wealth management line item that you refer to was down a little bit. I would say there is nothing systemic there that we can grow that and expect to grow that. We do that by executing our Regions 360 approach, which is making sure that our bankers that are out there with customers are taking the folks in our trust area to their client to continue to grow that. It has been slower than we want, but we really have a pretty good focus on Region 360 and expectations on our sales folks to perform consistent with the shared value and the Regions 260 playbook that we put together. So we do think that that will get back on track and growing. It was down just a little bit so nothing really systemic.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gaston Ceron of Morningstar Equity Research.","Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research","Hi. Good morning.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Gaston.","Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research","Just had a quick question to follow up on the issue of competition for loans. Just curious are you seeing the nature and I guess the strength of competition play out any significantly different this time than during other previous cycles that you've been through? And is there anything particularly unusual about how the competition is sort of ratcheting up here compared to other times that we've seen this sort of thing happen?","Grayson Hall","Yeah. I can't really say how differently this is from other cycles necessarily. I think this one still is playing out, but what we\u2019re seeing is that given the liquidity in the market, given the interest rate environments that in particular are upper middle market, corporate type credits help a lot of alternative, the public capital markets being one of those alternatives in.","So we\u2019re just seeing more customers taking advantage of the environment we\u2019re operating in. And I think a longer it goes on, the more competition we\u2019ll see. And so underlying all that is incrementally more credit demand than we\u2019ve seen in the past, we still are seeing strong pipelines for new business, but the competition around those relationships is as strong as I\u2019ve ever seen.","And an awful lot of pressure on our bankers to get out in front of those customers and try to convince then the value of our relationship, but no doubt, there is a lot of competition, a lot of alternatives today.","Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research","Okay. Fair enough, thanks. And then just very quickly as a follow-up, I know you talked about some margin compression in the second half of the year here and I hear what you are saying about focusing more on growing NII than just looking at the margin. But just to follow-up on that, I'm just curious -- I mean I don't know if it's too early to look into the first part of 2015, but would you have any expectations that after this pressure in the second half here that things might stabilize on the margin front in kind of the early part of 2015 or is it just too early to say?","Grayson Hall","Well, your two questions are more interrelated than you might have initially thought because I think that when you look at the credit quality or the credits that we\u2019re putting on the books today, it\u2019s some of the best. I mean a lot of our corporate customers, they have an awful lot of liquidity themselves and less debt than they have historically carried. Their balance sheets are in much better shape. And so they\u2019ve got a lower -- from our standpoint, they\u2019ve got a lower risk rating, a better credit quality picture and can demand better pricing on credit.","So as long as the economy continues to improve and as long as the credit quality of our borrowers continue to improve, it\u2019s going to keep placing pressure on the margin as new loans come on the books and you saw that compression in our own loan yields this quarter. And I think that just sort of continues as long as we\u2019re sort to own this glide plan. Hopefully, at some point in the future we start to see the interest rate environments modestly change upward.","Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Yes. Thank you. Good morning.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Good morning. My first question is just on the LCR. As we look forward to the rest of the year and you think about balance sheet actions related to LCR compliance, do you just plan to remix your current securities cash flows into HQLA? Or should we expect the balance sheet to grow faster in the back half of the year? And also, does the NIM outlook for 5 to 7 basis points, does it include any impact from LCR friendly balance sheet moves?","David Turner","Hey, Erika, this is David. Our NIM outlook incorporates all activity, all actions that we would take. From an LCR standpoint given we\u2019re well positioned, we have a relatively large securities book today. We have reinvested some of our cash flows into different investment classes like Ginnie Maes. We have a corporate bond portfolio. We\u2019ll recirculate some o those cash flows out of that portfolio into Ginnies and other high quality liquid asset.","So you should not expect a significant change in our makeup, especially relative to some of our peers. And that\u2019s a little bit of the beauty as to where we are with regards to our loan deposit ratio and the size of our securities book relative to some others.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Got it. My second question is just a quick follow-up on credit. If we think about encouraging loan growth signs, improving loan demand from here, as well as credit that continues to improve, but we\u2019re probably along the bottom. How many quarters away do you think we are in terms of provisions starting to match charge-offs?","David Turner","Yeah. That\u2019s a really interesting question. You say we\u2019re here bumping along the bottom. I will say we\u2019re encouraged by where our credit metrics have gone, but we expect them to continue to improve somewhat, the pace of which is a little uncertain. But today, we\u2019re at 35 basis points, 62% of our loan book is commercial, our business services I should say. And so we think there's a room to continue to come down and it\u2019s that pace of charge-offs that ultimately dictate how much reserve release we have and what ultimately our reserve levels need to be.","So I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve quite gotten to the bottom of the bump along just yet. And so I think look at one thing, look at what our NPLs do, what would our inflows do and what would our charge-offs do to give you better information as to what a go forward level might be.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Okay, helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Matt.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning, Grayson and David. Thanks for taking my questions. First of all, you mentioned that you are getting a little bit more demand for underwriting of home equity loans. Certainly make sense given the data that we have seen in terms of the improvement in home equity values. But I guess I'm just curious if you could give us a little more color as to how you are underwriting those and if there's any regulatory guidance that is being imposed on you in terms of trying to reduce the future rate shock on those -- on the HELOCs?","Grayson Hall","First of all, we have seen a shift in our equity product line. We have both the line of credit and are fully amortizing equity loan product. You\u2019re seeing a shift where there is more production now in the line product than loan product, that\u2019s been a recent shift. I think an awful a lot of the loan production historically has been interrelated to refinance.","In particular, the people who have small dollar mortgages, relatively small dollar mortgages and so as that refinance activity is going away, some has debt production. And so the line product is, you\u2019re seeing more production out of it. That production has been helped by the home appreciation values that we\u2019ve experienced over the last several quarters, but still being very conservatively underwritten and much more conservatively underwritten than what you have seen previous to the economic recession.","And so we\u2019ve changed a lot of our product features, as well as changed a lot of our pricing around those features. And we in addition have changed a lot of our underwriting criteria in terms of loan to values. And as you look at the quality of that book and I can't state it off the top of mind, David may can, is that loan-to-value ratios are very solid. The credit scores we\u2019re seeing on it are north of 700.","And we have the product does begin amortizing. I believe if I\u2019m right, it\u2019s a 10-10 product, 10 years interest rate, 10 years of amortization. And so we feel good about the product that we\u2019re underwriting from a regulatory compliance perspective. And I think the new LTV is averaging around 60% on new production.","David Turner","Now I\u2019ll add a couple of things. We were a little different then most of us going into this -- into the recession relative to this product where we had basically a 20 year IO. We stop that to have a 10-10 product, as Grayson mentioned. The benefit, if you will, of having that is if you look at Page 13 of our supplement, you\u2019ll see the future maturities of the home equity lines of credit we broke it down in first and second liens. And you can see what the resets are.","They really don\u2019t even start until 2019 and the bulk of these are in 2026. As a matter of fact if you look at 2014, our resets are $128 million, $195 million next year. So we don\u2019t have the payment shock issue in the near term like some others have. I also point you to Page 11 in the supplement, where if you look at our credit quality, our improvement was pretty noticeable with regard to our home equity product. In particular, if you look at second lien improvement terms of charge-offs, so that product performance is very well.","The credit quality has been well. Our pricing of that product before the changes when we grew the portfolio, we\u2019re little challenging and as we use to prime minus a half and prime minus one, so that\u2019s been our bigger issue versus credit quality more payment shocks.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thank you for that information and then just in terms of the -- a number of your competitors have mentioned this quarter about not just looking at net interest margin particularly on the commercial relationships. You have to -- we in the analyst community have to look at the broader relationship and the fee revenue component that each relationship brings in.","But if I look at that in terms of just the second quarter and maybe this is too short a view, year-over-year capital markets fee revenue was down a little bit year-over-year, commercial credit fee income is now down a little bit year-over-year. How are you thinking about growing those types of fees to improve the overall profitability of your corporate relationships, presuming rates don't really move up much before the end of 2015?","David Turner","Yeah. That\u2019s a good question. We\u2019ve continued to make investments in our capital markets group for that purpose to continue to bring in new clients for us. We have new capabilities in terms of underwriting there that we started about a year ago. And I think if we stay focused to capital markets fees, while we\u2019re focused on that, the interest rate environment is a big driver.","A lot of those fees are really driven by some of our derivatives we sell into the market. Interest rate swaps to be more specific. And we have rate environment that is as low as it is with no real expectations for increases. Clients are reluctant to lock in, so they will just take the interest risk themselves. That will change in time and when it does, you\u2019ll see that manifest itself in our capital markets income.","We have other income streams. We continue to work on, you mentioned the relationship. This is maybe the single most important thing to take from our company is we are relationship bank. We have Regions 360, which means taking our entire bank to our client base. Not just -- you cannot be just a credit only shop. We have other products treasury management, capital markets, whatever the case -- insurance.","We have other lines of business that our customers can use. And so it's really understanding the needs of our customer base and taking those lines of business and product and services and delivering those to the needs of the customer. That will be the differentiator for us over the long haul.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Gerard. Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Thank you. Thank you very much. Good morning. In terms of your loan growth, you gave us some color that you expect loans to grow in that 3% to 5% range and you talked about competition more recently being very strong. I guess the question I have though is your commercial real estate portfolio, both the investor-owned and owner-occupied, which has always been a strong part of your business, continues to steadily decline.","It's not just this quarter of course as you know and I know you were derisking the portfolio and that program I was under the impression was completed. So I guess is what's happening to that portfolio as it continues to shrink? Is it something you just want to be smaller in that business or what's going on there?","Grayson Hall","Not at all. I would tell you that production on investor commercial real estates has been pretty strong. And we continue to believe there is opportunities to grow that portfolio. We\u2019d obviously got to do that prudently and thoughtfully. And -- but we\u2019re out finding ways to grow that portfolio everyday. The owner-occupied segment of that, just for clarification is heavily influenced by small business and medium size businesses. And a lot of this is the facilities that they\u2019re operating out of and that portfolio continues to amortize and to pay down over time.","We got lot of work that we\u2019re trying to do internally around those particular lending segments to try to encourage that and we\u2019re seeing good production. But I would tell you all the customer segments we look at that small business, that small to medium-size business has been sort of late to recover late to come back and have a lot of demand for credit.","The stronger demand is up in the upper middle market, larger corporate customers and has been -- and the consumer has been fairly strong, especially, in the area of auto. But that\u2019s small to medium-size business, while, were seeing their production, we really still need to see to get a really healthy economy, really need to see that customer segment strengthen a little bit more and develop a little bit more confidence to invest in their businesses and that\u2019s predominantly driving that owner-occupied category.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Thank you. And regarding -- I know you guys have touched on the capital. Obviously your Tier 1 common ratio is very strong at 11%. If I recall in CCAR, your CCAR stress test I think reduced your Tier 1 common ratio by about 280 basis points and since 5% is obviously the bogey everybody has to get to, I would think most banks would want to stay around 8.5% not to get anything close to that 5% in CCAR.","What is your guys' thinking on where that Tier 1 common ratio should get to? I know you've got different strategies of how to use the excess capital but I am more asking at what level do you think you should be at under a normalized environment when rates come back a bit and maybe growth picks up a little more?","David Turner","Gerard, this is David. So you're right on the stress basis that we've -- if you look at our portfolio makeup at that time, we think that our improving credit metrics is part of it, our TDRs. There are elements about our balance sheet that consume more stress than we have in the past. If you look at where we think Tier 1 common could go and Basel I, you would be in that 8.5% to 9% range.","And clearly we\u2019re well above that. That goes back to the excess capital question that was ask by Marty and how do we really get that deployed in the most efficient -- most effective manner. So we\u2019re looking at alternatives today and but we do think we have capital to spend on host of things not only total capital. But we need to optimize our capital stack in terms of making sure we have the proper amount of common and proper amount of non-common Tier 1 as well. So there's still such things that we\u2019re working on to get capital levels and the stack optimized.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Do you -- not to pursue what those strategies are but is there a timeframe that you think you could get to an 8.5%, 9% level? Is it end of \u201816 or is it sooner or later than that?","David Turner","You that\u2019s a great question. That\u2019s a little harder to answer. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll snap the fingers and get to that level over night. I do think it\u2019s something over time. I think the first thing we want to do is not continue to accrete capital at the level and pace of which as to what we\u2019ve been doing and to get that deployed in the more effective manner.","So let\u2019s do that first and then look at what -- what options are out there for us to take advantage of with our capital mix. We think that gives us a lot of flexibility to see how things transition in our industry to be -- allow us to use that capital. And so I don't want to make any commitment as to -- really the level I gave you, kind of a rough range but I certainly don\u2019t want to give you a timeframe. It\u2019s -- we need to leave that open-ended.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Richard Bove of Rafferty Capital Markets.","Grayson Hall","Good morning Dick.","Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets","Good morning. This has been a long call so if you want to do this offline that's fine. But I was wondering if you could go through the process in this auto sector. We had this article in the New York Times last Saturday. It was pretty negative and what I am thinking about is are you adding new car dealers or used car dealers? Are you letting the dealer underwrite the loan? Are you checking the premium that the dealer is putting on the rate? Are you looking at the price of the car that is being sold relative to some kind of Blue Book situation to determine whether the dealer is gouging the customer? I mean, how do you -- how are you approaching this whole new process in the auto sector?","Grayson Hall","","I think the, clearly, the lot of attention on this particular customer segment and we spent a lot time on this segment from a compliance perspective and in fact we have -- we've actually reduce the number of dealers that we are operating with. We had -- it\u2019s in our disclosures but we actually have reduced the number of dealers we are dealing with by about 300 -- approximately 300.","So we are going through and rationalize which dealers that we are getting healthy amount of business from and getting it in a correct manner. Lot of dear oversight, lot of dealer monitoring around rates and spreads, and adjustments for those rates and spreads, and so you will continue to see us elevate our monitoring capabilities of that segment to make sure that we are adequately addressing compliance issues.","In addition we use a lot of third-party reviews. Third parties to come in and look at that, compare the numerics and make sure that we understand exactly what's going on dealer by dealer and loan by loan, I will be glad to have some of our team who is working on that full-time to give you more detail around that. It\u2019s -- but it\u2019s a complex endeavor and we are investing time and energy in there to make sure that we are doing this in a responsible way.","Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Chris Mutascio of KBW","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Good morning.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask the provision question, maybe a little differently, David, if we could? Did the inflection in the loan loss provision expense this quarter have anything to do with the spike in the special mentioned category?","David Turner","I would tell you that what -- our allowance model certainly takes into account our risk ratings that we have which would include special mentioned substandard so forth. So, by definition, if these incorporate in our provisioning and allowance levels that we established.","Chris Mutascio - KBW","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Your final question comes from John Pancari of Evercore.","Grayson Hall","Good morning, John.","John Pancari - Evercore","Good morning. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry for the long call here. But back to the deposit fees, I guess, this goes back to Ken's question, which you might have been looking at -- getting at is, have you been able to quantify a potential impact from check order processing changes, I know you have made a big step in helping us with the quantification of the deposit advance product, I wanted to see if you've got a similar quantification on the sequencing? Thanks.","David Turner","John, this is David. We continue to see how this issue is going to evolve. We know this has been pushed off a little bit. It\u2019s probably a late \u201815, \u201816 issue. We are continuing to do what we think is the right thing to do buy our customer. We\u2019re going to test the few things starting in the first part of 2015.","Because its not just check order processing or debt processing order, it\u2019s got deposits, it has funds availability, there are whole host of things that are had to be considered in this and that\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint specifically what it -- would mean.","Now what we do believe as we learn from our -- some of our test in the first part of \u201915 and as we get batter guidance we will share that with you, but we don\u2019t see this being an impact in \u201915 as much as it might be in \u201916 and that\u2019s depended on whether not to come up with further guidance.","John Pancari - Evercore","Okay. Thank you on that. And then, separately, on the excess capital discussion, can you just give us a little bit of your thought process around, if M&A is part of your plans and is that potentially more focused around business acquisitions or loan portfolio acquisitions or could it be whole bank deals? Thanks.","David Turner","Yeah. As I\u2019ve tried to mentioning our thought process, I\u2019ll go through the beginning of it, because it\u2019s important to know our full way of thinking is, we got dividend some and we continued to challenge, to make sure we have a faired reasonable dividend, given the limits in guidance by our regulatory supervisors.","We then look to deploy our capital organically, growing earning assets at our company. We also look to use that for acquisitions of portfolio like we did our credit card portfolio couple years ago. We look at non-bank transactions that would give us sources of revenue without utilizing a lot of capital that would help us from a diversification of revenue stream and we look at and have a whole teams looks at bank as well.","If and when that ultimately comes back, so we are going to prepare ourselves for that type of transaction and when all that doesn\u2019t work then we will return that excess capital back to the shareholder in prudent manner and subject to capital plans and no objections from our regulatory supervisors in the CCAR process. So, I guess, the short answer would be, yes, it is included, but that\u2019s the order that we think about in capital form.","John Pancari - Evercore","Okay. Thank you. And then lastly here, any -- on the commercial real estate front to help support growth there, any possibility there or any thought process around extending the duration a bit of your CRE paper that you're putting on the books in order to drive volume growth, for example, competing more aggressively with some of the permanent financing players for example?","David Turner","We\u2019ve talked about whether or not that\u2019s viable for us to date, we have not done anything to extent that duration. You can see our kind of what our portfolio looks like right now and it really is depended on what type of risk adjusted return we can get on this product. What our stress capital looks like on this product.","And so, I think that, if we really look that that the first place we would look is really in that owner occupied real estate space where we have a little different client make up, as Grayson mentioned earlier, usually a smaller business that has put up real estate as collateral out of an abundance caution in many cases and we are willing to take a little bit of duration risk with that. But I can tell you to date we have done a lot of it.","John Pancari - Evercore","Okay. Thank you.","Grayson Hall","Thank you.","David Turner","Okay.","Grayson Hall","I believe that\u2019s our last question. We appreciate everyone your time and attention today. Thank you and if there is any questions after the call feel free to call List Underwood and Dana Nolan. We will be glad to take your call. Thank you very much for being here today.

My name is Paula, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.","M. List Underwood","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your participation on our first quarter earnings call. Our presenters today are Chief Executive Officer, Grayson Hall; and our Chief Financial Officer, David Turner, along with other senior members of our management team. As part of our earnings call, we will be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","Also, let me remind you that in this call and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.

B. Grayson Hall","Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Regions First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. We certainly appreciate your participation and respect your time. We'll keep our comments concise and move promptly to your questions.","Regions continues to make substantial progress moving forward with first quarter 2013 earnings reaching the highest quarterly level in more than 4 years. Our results reflect continued execution of our business plans and our focus on capitalizing on our franchise's opportunities.","First quarter 2013 net income available to common shareholders was $327 million or $0.23 per diluted share, more than double a year ago and up 25% from prior period. In addition, the year is off to a good start by many other important measures. Loans on our balance sheet hold steady. Our net interest margin remains stable. We're growing our customer base. Our mortgage business, while facing headwinds, is performing well. Our operating expenses are being managed with discipline and rigor, and our asset quality continues to incrementally improve.","Let's begin with a closer look at the balance sheet. We remain on track, absent any unknown economic shocks, to achieve a low-single-digit loan growth this year. As loans outstanding steadied from first to fourth -- first quarter -- fourth to first quarter period in and overall new loan production increased 8% over last year. This new loan production helped offset first quarter declines in portfolio outstandings, such as Investor Real Estate and home equity. The pace of decline in Investor Real Estate portfolio has moderated to the lowest level in 3 years. As our pace of derisking slows, especially in the second half of 2013, we expect total loans outstanding to grow incrementally, marking a very important shift for our company.","Turning to deposits, we grew checking accounts in the first quarter. This is the first time in over 2 years that we have experienced a net increase in core checking accounts since shifting our strategy from free checking to fee-eligible pricing. We believe this turnaround demonstrates Regions' commitment to customer service, our emphasis on providing products and services that meet customer needs and preferences, and at a fair price.  Additionally, we continue to improve our deposit mix and further lowered average funding costs fourth to first quarter. Over the past 3 years, we have reduced our overall deposit cost by 82 basis points.","So let's discuss revenue for just a moment.  Mortgage banking remained a significant contributor to fee-based income and not surprisingly, dipped below fourth quarter's levels. The quarter-over-quarter decline reflects seasonality, less robust market activity and our decision to retain 15-year fixed-rate mortgages on our balance sheet.","The HARP 2 program continues to be a significant contributor to overall mortgage production at about 20% of our volume. It is important to note that approximately 80% of Regions' mortgage customers, eligible for HARP 2, have yet to refinance. We are pleased with the recent announcement regarding the 2-year extension of this program, we have a comprehensive outreach program underway to capture these opportunities and to assist our customers and their needs.","We did experience a noticeable but favorable shift in mortgage applications this quarter. New home purchases now account for almost 50% of the applications as compared to 35% just last quarter. According to the National Association of Realtors, the supply of homes on the market has returned to pre-housing pricing levels and is at a 4-month supply. Further positive evidence that the housing market is recovering.","So let's turn our focus to expenses. In the first quarter, operating expenses, excluding special items in the fourth quarter, declined slightly and are on track to meet our expectations for a lower full year operating cost versus 2012. The decline in the first quarter is particularly encouraging given the seasonal increase in favorable related tax expense. And additionally, in the first quarter, we continued to invest in technology that benefits our productivity and efficiency. The investment is consistent with our commitment to provide new, innovative services and delivery options that our customers want and need.","In 2012, we invested in updating branch systems and platforms. This year we're concentrating on upgrading our alternative delivery channels. For example, here in the first quarter, we enhanced our transaction capabilities at most of our ATMs. As a result of these advances in technology, over 90% of the transactions traditionally conducted through a branch teller, can now be completed at a Regions ATM. Mobile banking continues to be a rapid growth channel and a critical area of focus. Earlier this month, we launched a number of product enhancements that enable our customers to more fully bank with us by using their mobile phone.","Moving on to asset quality. Trends were broadly positive in the first quarter. As expected, nonperforming assets continue to improve, reflecting ongoing declines in both nonperforming loans and nonperforming loan migration. We remain confident that the pace of asset quality improvement will continue in 2013.","Finally, we are pleased with our 2013 CCAR results, and you will soon see us taking actions to execute the plan, including implementation of our announced stock repurchase program.","I'll now turn the call over to David for a more in-depth discussion of first quarter financial trends. Afterwards, I'll return for a few closing comments before taking questions. David?","David J. Turner","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Since Grayson has already provided a high-level overview, I'm going to jump right into the details. So let's start with Slide 3 on the balance sheet.","At the end of the first quarter, total loan balances remained steady from the prior quarter. Our commercial and industrial and indirect auto loan portfolios continue to produce solid results. In addition, we experienced a slower pace of decline in the Investor Real Estate portfolio. The Investor Real Estate portfolio declined 5% linked quarter compared to the previous quarter's decline of 11%.","At quarter end, Investor Real Estate ending balances stood at $7.3 billion, down $2.8 billion from 1 year ago. Overall, balances in the Investor Real Estate portfolio may fluctuate, depending on productivity levels, derisking and payoff activity. We estimate that we have approximately $800 million of derisking remaining in the portfolio, a portion of which will be offset by new production. And just to remind you, that compares to about $1 billion that we've mentioned to you before. In fact, new production in the Investor Real Estate portfolio has begun to pick up as we see more opportunities to make loans to qualify borrowers consistent with our risk appetite.","We experienced another quarter of solid growth in our commercial and industrial loan portfolio. Average loans in this portfolio grew 2% versus the prior quarter, and total new and renewed production increased 3% over the prior year. During the first quarter, we saw a broadening of our commercial loan activity across a well-diversified base of industries and geographies. Consequently, overall business loans increased $268 million linked quarter. Notably, line utilization increased 140 basis points to 44.8% from the end of the prior quarter and commitments are up 12% from the prior year.","Looking at consumer lending, this portfolio decreased just over 1% linked quarter as consumer deleveraging continued. As a reminder, during the fourth quarter, we began the process of retaining our 15-year fixed-rate conforming residential mortgages. This strategy supports our overall efforts to grow the balance sheet and effectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk. This resulted in approximately $180 million of additional loans held on the balance sheet in the first quarter.","Declines in our total home equity portfolio, which includes lines and loans, continue as customers take advantage of opportunities to refinance. However, we are encouraged by the results at our home equity loan portfolio, as loan production increased 60% over the prior year primarily due to the introduction of a fixed-rate loan product during the third quarter of 2012. Growth in this product is expected to continue to reduce the pace of decline in our home equity portfolio.","Indirect auto loans increased 6% quarter-over-quarter and total production is up 16%, as we continued to expand our dealer's network. At quarter end, we had approximately 2,000 dealers and plan to add an additional 300 dealers by the end of the year.","Although credit card balances were down this quarter, our production of new accounts was 10% higher than the prior year first quarter. Currently, our penetration rate is approximately 12% of our households, and we expect this to increase to more than 20% over time. We have planned a comprehensive marketing campaign for credit cards throughout 2013 to help facilitate this growth.","We were pleased with the progress we made in the first quarter in holding our loan steady, and we expect to see growth in loan production and anticipate that production will outpace attrition by the second half of 2013. And based on what we know now, we continue to project loan growth in the low-single digits for 2013.","And now let's move on to the liability side of the balance sheet. Deposit mix and cost continue to improve in the first quarter. Total average low-cost deposits increased $375 million linked quarter, and time deposits fell to just 14% of total average deposits. This positive repricing and mix shift resulted in deposit cost declining 4 basis points, down to 18 basis points for the quarter. Now we have an additional $5.6 billion of CDs maturing in 2013  at an average rate of 93 basis points. Now this compares to our current average going on rates for new CDs of approximately 25 basis points. Further, our overall total funding cost improved to 45 basis points, a decrease of 86 basis points over the last 3 years.","So let's take a look at how all of this has impacted our net interest income. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $811 million, down 2% linked quarter. And this decline was driven in part by a fewer number of days in the quarter, as well as a decline in earning assets. Total loan yields were down 7 basis points linked quarter to 4.14%. This was primarily related to the impact of a continued low-rate environment on the reinvestment rates of higher fixed-rate loans that are paying off. The resulting net interest margin was 3.13%, up 3 basis points linked quarter. Again, this was driven by a reduced day count, which really resulted in 2 basis points of the benefit and our debt management activities last quarter. These activities and the decline in deposit cost served to offset the reduction on earning asset yields, which is largely attributable to the low-rate environment. Now we continue to expect our margins to remain relatively stable throughout 2013, with potential upside if rates rise.","Let's take a look at non-interest revenue.  First quarter non-interest revenue declined 7% linked quarter, primarily related to a decline in mortgage and service charges income. As expected, mortgage banking revenue was down in the first quarter, but well above historical levels. And while 2012 was a record year, we still anticipate 2013 to yield solid results. As mentioned earlier, we started retaining 15-year mortgages on our balance sheet, which will impact mortgage income. Now you can find a breakout of mortgage revenue on Page 9 in the supplement to our press release.","Mortgage loan production was $1.8 billion, an increase of 13% over the prior year. And mortgage revenue continues to be driven by HARP 2, as approximately 40% of all HARP mortgage applications submitted were from non-Regions customers. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we purchased servicing rights on approximately $3 billion of mortgage loans, which will help offset some of the mortgage income decline going forward.","Service charges during the quarter were impacted by lower NSF fees, primarily related to seasonality. As Grayson mentioned, we experienced an increase in net checking accounts, as well as our number of households, which will serve to drive future service charges. Also, our Now Banking suite of products continue to grow. The number of households using these products has more than tripled over the last year. Almost 60% of these customers are new Regions customers, providing us with additional cross-sell opportunities.","Let's take a look at expenses on the next slide.  Non-interest expenses totaled $842 million. And excluding adjustments in the prior quarter, this resulted in a decline of 1% linked quarter. And during the quarter, we experienced seasonal increases in salaries and benefits, primarily related to an increase in payroll taxes. Professional and legal expenses return to a more normalized level due to the prior quarter benefit of $20 million and reduced legal reserves that we previously mentioned to you.","We continue to expect that 2013 expenses will be lower than those in 2012, illustrating our commitment to prudent expense management and the generation of positive operating leverage. Our tax rate for the quarter was 26%, which included a $9 million reduction in tax reserves, as well as a $4 million benefit to the valuation allowance. Excluding these items, our tax rate would have been closer to 29%, which is in line with our more normalized rate.","Let's move on to asset quality. We continue to make progress with respect to asset quality. The provision for loan losses was $10 million or $170 million less than net charge-offs. Total net charge-offs were flat linked quarter and net charge offs as a percentage of average loans was again below 1%. Both nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets declined linked quarter, 6% and 7%, respectively. In addition, delinquencies also declined 10% fourth to first quarter.","Notably, criticized and classified loans, which is one of the best and earliest indicators of asset quality, continue to decline with commercial and Investor Real Estate criticized loans down 9% from the fourth quarter. Our coverage ratios remain solid. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance to nonperforming loans stood at 110%. Meanwhile, our loan loss allowance loans remained solid at 2.37% at the end of the first quarter. Based on what we know today, we expect continued improvement in asset quality going forward.","Let's take a look at capital and liquidity. As Grayson mentioned, we were pleased with our overall CCAR results and the Federal Reserve having no objections to our capital management plan, which we expect to implement soon. Our capital position remains strong as our estimated Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter stood at 12.3% and our estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 11.2%. Now based on our interpretation of Basel III, we expect our pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will be approximately 9.1%.","Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company remained solid with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 79%. And lastly, based on our understanding of the new amendments, Regions remains well positioned to be fully compliant with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio. So overall, this quarter's results are solid and demonstrate the substantial progress we are making, and we look forward to continuing to build our momentum.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Grayson for his closing remarks.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Thank you, David. Well, in conclusion, Regions is moving forward and gaining momentum. We are executing our business plans. We're capitalizing on our franchise's opportunities. We're actively managing our strong capital base and incrementally improving profitability quarter-to-quarter.","Our first quarter results demonstrates progress we're making on several important fronts and these include: Prudently and profitably expanding our loan application pipelines; expanding and deepening our customer relationships; lowering our overall funding costs; continuing to stabilize our net interest margin while at the same time, continuing to reduce our overall risk profile, while adhering to disciplined expense management.","We are committed to further progress in 2013, as we continue to prudently work towards maximizing Regions franchise value.","I'll turn the meeting back over to List for the instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Thank you for your time.","M. List Underwood","Thank you, Grayson. We are ready to begin the Q&A session of our call. In order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning, at the top of the hour, I would like to ask each caller to please limit yourself to 1 primary question and 1 related follow-up question.","Now let's open up the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Obviously, you've had some real nice C&I loan growth and we've just heard from some other banks of pricing pressure and some terms being given. Maybe you can just comment a little bit on the rates that you're seeing and the underlying asset quality to what you're adding?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes. Matt, clearly, it's a pretty competitive marketplace today and we are seeing pricing pressure within the marketplace. I would tell you that looking at the data, it would seem to indicate that while the pressure's there, we're still holding spread margins slightly above historical rates. But it does appear that spreads continue to very slowly move downward. But I would say, our numbers seem to indicate holding fairly steady with a bias on the downside. But we continue to feel like -- that in our marketplaces and in the segments we're choosing to compete that we are still able to hold pricing at a pretty favorable point. In addition, our overall underwriting and structure, which includes pricing, we continue to believe that we are prudently adding to our balance sheet. And I'll ask Barb Godin, Barb's with us to sort of give you a little bit of color on what we're seeing coming on to the balance sheet.","Barbara Godin","Thank you, Grayson. Yes, what we're seeing right now, very happy with the asset quality that's going on the book, you have to risk some pressure on structures, the pressure on price. But all in, it's clearly within our risk appetite. In fact, below our risk appetite levels right now. So we anticipate that, that book will perform well, both now and in the future.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then credit quality overall is obviously very good, again, this quarter. But anything within the C&I book that caused the jump linked quarter in charge-offs. I don't know if it's seasonal or just some lumpiness there, but just looking at the charge-off dollars in C&I went up from $17 million to $58 million, down a little bit year-over-year, but anything that you'd highlight there?","Barbara Godin","Yes. Matt, it's Barb Godin again. We have 3 C&I credits -- large credits total of $39 million. We had a reserve against them of $32 million. And again, that caused a little bit of the bump in the release that we saw. But again, no trend. It's at the point right now that we're going to see some bumpiness as we move out of the back end of the cycle.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes. I mean, I think that C&I charge-offs, by their nature, always is going to be somewhat uneven. And we saw some unevenness this quarter, but still overall asset quality trends continue to be in the right direction.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of John Pancari of Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","On that competition question, do you actually have the average new money yields that you're seeing by product, perhaps, in C&I and in CRE, in terms of what you're bringing on the balance sheet right now?","O. B. Grayson Hall","John, let me ask John Asbury very quickly to speak to that issue. John runs our Business Services group and he can speak more specifically to those spreads and yields.","John C. Asbury","Yes. Thanks, Grayson. Obviously, it depends upon the exact nature of the client with the larger clients, who are among the most creditworthy commanding the best pricing, so you get into mix issues. I would say, typically, what you'll see in terms of going on spreads to LIBOR in the middle market is going to be something in the neighborhood of, say, LIBOR plus 225 to maybe 250; it kind of varies. If you look at the real estate world, it's a little higher. It's probably within commercial real estate average pricing to 60 to 75 over LIBOR on those lines. And you'll see variation; you're up and down, again, depending upon creditworthiness of the client and size.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of your -- the longer-term loan loss reserve level, I mean, you said you're continuing to see some opportunity there to pull back on the reserve. I just want to get your thoughts on where the reserve level could end up leveling out. I know it's at around 240 basis points of loans right now, so I want to see where that could go to.","David J. Turner","Yes. John, this is David. We have talked, historically, that we've got the reserve pending. There are some changes in accounting that are coming. So ignoring those for the time being, that our reserves would be in that 1.50% to 2% range. And I know that's a fairly wide margin, and as we get clarity on how things are shaking out, we will refine that. The question is, the time period on when that -- we'll get to that reserve level and is really based off, obviously, charge-offs and what's going on the books. And we're seeing continued improvement in all of our credit metrics. You heard about the 3 credits in C&I. So our charge would have been lower. But I think, going forward, that we would be -- we expected to be in sub-2% range. But the timing of that, we just can't be as clear.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin of Citi.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If the Basel rules are adopted as proposed and you have to mark-to-market the securities portfolio for changes in rates, how much of a capital buffer do you think you'll need for the impact of OCI volatility on regulatory capital?","David J. Turner","Yes. Josh, we continue to look at that in terms of our modeling. In just rough numbers, we would be in the 25 to 50 basis points of probably additional capital that we would have to keep to soften any change in market changes because of the rapid change that could occur there. Obviously, we're hopeful that certain things get carved out, the final rules. But right now, as is, that's what the capital impact would be.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And have you heard of anything from the CFPB regarding payday lending that might impact any of your businesses?","O. B. Grayson Hall","We obviously -- we have a short-term lending product that we offer today. And we've been in close communication with the CFPB. This juncture has not many clarification of our guidance come out on this types of products. We're working with them daily to understand sort of what the direction will be, and we'll adjust accordingly. We continue to adjust the products that we offer to be more customer friendly and continue to try to meet customer needs in that particular part of the segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gaston Ceron of MorningStar Equity Research.","Gaston  F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to dig in to the expense line a little bit more. I know you talked about this during your prepared remarks, but I'm wondering if you could give a little more color on the other -- especially the other expense line and how much room do you have to bring that down permanently lower from these levels? I mean, I know you said you expect 2013 expenses to be -- to come under 2012. But I'm just trying to -- as you continue to move, to improve operations or just trying to get a handle on what the normalized level is going to look like?","David J. Turner","Yes. Gaston, we've obviously given guidance on total expenses. As you get down into a more granular level, it gets a little more difficult. If you look at those other expense categories, in particular what you saw in there were OREO and held-for-sale expenses, we're seeing some gains on disposition of assets that are in those numbers that have kept those pretty low. Of course, our held-for-sale and OREO balances together are less than about $200 million today. And I'll you from OREO standpoint, that's below historically where we've been. So we see controlling that going forward as being really important to that other expense line item. We kind of like to think about our expenses in terms of the top 3: Salaries and benefits, number 1; occupancy, number 2; furniture and equipment expense, number 3. And so making sure we focus on ensuring we have the right number of talented people working for us is something we look at. We continue to make investments in talent, we'll do that going forward. We've looked at our infrastructure. In terms of branching, we've reduced branches more since 2007 than any other bank, about 16%. But nonetheless, we continue to look at branch locations and we had some consolidation last year of branches as we did the year before, and I'm sure we'll have some this year. And we'll have investments in new branches and new formats. So there's really no one big rock that you can look at in terms of expense reduction. That's why we don't come up -- we haven't developed a branded expense initiative. It is cultural, it is built into every expense line item that we have to make sure that we're prudent with regards to expenses. So I would look at those 4, 5 things that I pointed to in terms of understanding the direction of where our expenses may go.","Gaston  F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I'm sorry, just a very quick follow-up on what you just said -- regarding branches, I mean, is there any sort of target for a kind of year-end level or anything like that or no? And just kind of see how it develops?","O. B. Grayson Hall","No. Gaston, we continue to be very disciplined and rigorous around looking at our branches in terms of branch activity, in terms of transaction counts, in terms of new accounts open, as well as looking at the overall staffing in those branches. We, as David said, we reduced our number of branch outlets over the past 3 years -- last few years, approximately 16%. We continue to have fairly -- we still continue to make adjustments to those number of branches and that develops over the course of the year, as our process unfolds. But you should not anticipate any large swings in our number of branches. But we make -- we're making course corrections as we see the opportunities and we'll do that every year and we'll continue to do it.","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Murray of Nomura.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Do you mind touching on duration extension risk? And just kind of framing where you guys think you are now versus, let's say, 12 months ago? I know you've reshaped the portfolio mix a little bit here.","David J. Turner","Yes. If you look at our investment portfolio, we have extended duration slightly, it's just over 3 years. We've done a couple of things there though, we have some new asset classes in the investment portfolio, some new issue CMBS, some corporates that we didn't have that we think protects us a little bit on extension risks. But you really have to look at our balance sheet in total, and isolating it in any one spot can be detrimental. We are still asset sensitive as you see -- as you will see in our disclosures. You saw it in our 10-K, you'll see it in our 10-Q, and we continue to be that way, which is why we're, to the extent, we do have an increase in rates, you should see a fairly sizable improvement in our net interest income and the resulting margin.","O. B. Grayson Hall","I think when you look at the loan portfolio, you see we put 15-year mortgages on our balance sheet, but when you look at the absolute of level that, in relationship with the size of our portfolio it's fairly modest. The other issue is, if you look at our commercial lending, if you look at small business lending, the lower end of middle market, a lot of that is term-based lending with an amortizing loan. But when you -- the further up you go in that market, the less of that you see. And today, on a dollars basis, still 3\/4 of our business and commercial portfolio is variable rate priced. And so from a duration standpoint, we still think on the loan portfolio, we're holding ourselves in a pretty good position.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned that you purchased some mortgage servicing assets in the quarter. Just talk about your appetite there and do you view that as a little bit of a rate hedge as well?","O. B. Grayson Hall","We do view it somewhat of a rate hedge, but also as an NIR opportunity to generate some additional revenues for the company. When you look at it, our servicing portfolio, a little over $40 billion, and adding $3 billion to that, we think we have the capacity to do that. Our appetite, I would call our appetite limited, but still have an appetite for that asset and think it's incrementally favorable to our overall operation. We think we've got a team that's pretty good at that. We want to make sure that we don't create any capacity issues with that team, but we feel pretty good about where our appetite setting is for that business today. We're still a relatively small -- a very small player in that space.","David J. Turner","Yes. We're about the 23rd largest servicer roughly, which is about 0.44% market share. So we're really not that large, but we are good at it. And we have our team dedicated to this. Obviously, we went through all the issues and have done a great job, and we like the return profile. You mentioned the rate hedge, that's a part of it. The capacity is part of it too, and we have the ability to add some even from where you are today. And so we'll look opportunistically for those chances to improve that portfolio, increase that portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have a question about what's going on with housing in your region and impact on the NPAs and just delinquencies in general. I'm hearing that housing is been improving, and I wanted to get your take on what's going on, as well as opportunities to further accelerate the reduction and exposure to legacy assets there.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Yes. Betsy, I would tell you that we've been fairly aggressive in shedding distressed assets related to homebuilders through the cycle and really have a pretty low exposure to that segment today from a distressed standpoint. I would tell you what's changed this quarter from last quarter is, if you look across our 16-state footprint, a quarter ago we saw  signs of housing recovery in a number of markets, but not all of them. I would tell you it's more widespread today. We're seeing more signs of recovery more broadly across our franchise footprint than we did. We're seeing inventory levels that are getting back to very low levels and we're seeing homebuilders starting to construct home again -- homes again. So I would say it's more broad; it's more consistent, and we believe that we're in a position to take a very prudent position of opportunity on that -- in the home building space. I'll ask Barb to sort of talk about the disposition of what distressed assets we still have related to that segment. Barb?","Barbara Godin","Thank you, Grayson. We don't have as many assets in that asset class as we previously did, particularly in the distressed environment. In total, Betsy, I look at our OREO balance as an example, we only have $133 million of those. We were able to get -- move those relatively quickly and [indiscernible] some decent pricing. What we moved in to held-for-sale as a well, I mean, right now we only have $66 million left in our held-for-sale portfolio. Majority of that is being turned within a 12-month period. So we don't see as much coming in the front end, either at the held-for-sale or OREO from the Investor Real Estate classes. We're seeing more in the C&I right now coming in. And in terms of overall pricing, however, going back to that comment, we are seeing a number of markets across our footprint that have increased in pricing. South Florida is one example, we're even seeing the Atlanta market, the Birmingham market. Some of our major markets have clearly moved in a positive direction.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Your NIM is relatively strong compared to peers, and there's more resiliency there. As you look out over the next several quarters, would you consider using that to be a little bit more aggressive on pricing and loan growth generation?","David J. Turner","Betsy, we -- our NIM, obviously, is supported in large part due to our -- the liability side of the balance sheet, first and foremost our deposits. So I had mentioned that we have $5.6 billion from the CDs maturing at a 93 basis point rate going into 25 basis point rate. As we think about disposition of those assets, we've had a program for a long time to evaluate every one of those to get our best execution on disposition. And it's not just about getting rid of nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, but is what is the best long-term play -- best play for our shareholders. And where we see opportunities to sell, we sell. When we see opportunities to work out, we keep that. So we do understand that we can get our NPLs down a whole lot quicker if we just pulled them up and sold them, but we're not confident that that's the best execution for our shareholders, which we why we haven't done it. And Barb, you may want to...","Barbara Godin","No. I think you hit the nail on the head. I mean, we do evaluate, bottoms up, every quarter. We look at every single loans and look at what the best outcome is for our shareholders. And that might mean holding those loans a little bit longer. But having said, that if you look at some of our numbers our actual numbers that we keep more than a year in NPL has dropped dramatically. Again, in general, we try to turn our nonperforming loan book over in a 12-month period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","My first question, I wanted to ask you about the kind of the other side of net interest income story. So the NIM stability is certainly helped by a bunch of the mechanisms you mentioned on the deposit side and on the long-term debt footprint. But the earning asset balances continue to shrink even though it looks like loans have finally, in a good way, started to stabilize. So can you help us understand what your outlook is for when you expect earning assets to bottom and within that again, against a stable NIM backdrop, do you expect NII to grow from here?","David J. Turner","Yes. Ken, what you're looking at on the earning assets included the putting -- changes in cash and some of the liability management that we've had and we'll continue to see some liability management. We haven't been specific with those, but we still have opportunities on that front. So earning assets, the biggest driver of earning assets stability will be loan growth. And as we mentioned in our prepared comments, we expect that growth to occur in the low-single digits during this year. The specific timing of that is a little harder because we still are disposing of some of the assets, and in particular in our Investor Real Estate portfolio. But we're encouraged with our increase in production, in our loan categories. And I think that you could see a slowing of the attrition going forward on earning assets. And as we put more loans on the books, that's also going to support a higher overall net interest income. Obviously, we're still a little bit at the mercy of the interest rate environment. You've seen the 10-year jump around quite a bit in the first quarter. And so where we are from reinvesting our cash flows off of our investment portfolios is important to us. It's $500 million a month we have to put to work. And so being able to give you confidence on NII dollars is a little more difficult, but with the loan growth we expect the ability to be able to do that is enhanced.","O. B. Grayson Hall","I think that if you look again trying to say what's different this quarter from last quarter, we still see modest demand for credit. That being said, we've seen better diversity of demand. We're seeing more demand from smaller middle market businesses than we've seen previously. Again, modest but better diversity of demand. Still strong demand in the upper end of C&I, but I would tell you that the mix of demand we're getting today, we consider to be an encouraging sign.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And my second question just relates to operating leverage. We all hear your comments loud and clear about continuing to move expenses lower, and they certainly are on a great path on a year-over-year basis so far. But from an efficiency ratio perspective there's always a little bit of seasonality to think about, but how do we understand how the interplay between that cost control you mention and then the revenue growth that you expect, translate into the potential to improve the efficiency ratio?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, I'll speak and I'll let David add to that his comments. But when you think about efficiency, clearly, in a low-rate, slow growth environment, expense management just has to be foundational in the way we operate the business. And we're going to continue to focus on expenses very rigorously. But if you look at the efficiency ratio, the 2 sides of that coin, one is expense, the other is revenue. And quite frankly, when you break our numbers down more granularly, the revenue side of that equation is probably one we need to work on more. The expense side though we continue to focus on, and we still believe that, that will come down. First quarter is always a challenging quarter for a number of seasonal issues and a number of day count issues. But we still see the opportunity to improve that ratio going forward with a balanced approach on both sides of that calculation.","David J. Turner","Yes. I will tell you, Ken, that the efficiency ratio, call it, 64% change, from a seasonality standpoint, has a couple of points in there that work against us in this first quarter. Even with that, we would like to get our efficiency ratio down into the high-50s. And we think, in time, we can get there, perhaps needing a little bit of a rate pickup to get there. But while we wait for that, our focus is on improving both NII and NIR. Integrations point revenue is the biggest driver of improvement. So as you think through NII growing loans and having more of our balance sheet, more of our earning assets and loans versus security. So today, we have 25% of our earning assets that are investment securities and that number should be in the 18% range, just round numbers. So getting loan growth and repositioning there is really important to us. We continue to look on the right side of the balance sheet in terms of liability management to help us on interest expense. And then we're also looking at growing our households, and we mentioned that in our prepared comments because it's important to us to continue to add, in particular, checking account households to us because it brings us a source of non-interest revenue. And so we think we can continue to grow NIR through the development of new products and services. I mentioned the Now Banking product, where we've tripled our customers over the past year, have been a great source of non-interest revenue for us. So continuing to understand what our customers need and want, and developing products and services that meet those needs and therefore, growing our total revenue will be the key to us improving that efficiency ratio and our commitment to generating positive operating leverage. So it's not just an expense play for us, it's all about making sure that we can generate positive operating leverage in the long run.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just one clarification on the question that Ken had asked. So given the outlook for efficiency and some of the expense headwinds that you faced in the first quarter, can we expect to actually see expenses continue to fall from the current level?","David J. Turner","We end up -- our commitment has been, really, kind of year-over-year. The first quarter had some benefits in it relative to held-for-sale and OREO expenses. We had some gains in that quarter. We're continuing to work on those expenses to get them down even further from the first quarter. But right now, our guidance to you is really a year-over-year basis is as far as we've committed thus far.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just on the Investor Real Estate. I know you noted that productions improved and there is something like $800 million of derisking left versus $1 billion left, so implying that there's still some core runoff in the portfolio. I know you made some positive comments about demand potentially picking up. So is there -- are you starting to see enough demand on the other side that you could actually foresee this portfolio starting to grow at some point this year?","David J. Turner","We have -- it is very close. I don't know that we can claim victory just yet on it. We're down slightly in the first quarter about $400 million. Production is up, pipelines we're encouraged with, but we still have that $800 million. The timing of how that gets dealt with is what's harder to tell. Again, we've looked at -- in giving guidance on what the year will look like, but we are very close to where that attrition stops in Investor Real Estate. We believe you will see that in the second half of 2013.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just a very quick follow-up on the bank of that. Given where we are on the cycle right now, are you expanding your geographic reach in any of your businesses, whether it's in middle market or large corporate C&I or in the commercial real estate business?","O. B. Grayson Hall","No. We're staying -- we are trying to continue to grow our business within our footprint and within the businesses that we compete today. But we have not expanded beyond our footprint. And we have not -- we've not expanded beyond the products we offer today. We don't see doing that at the moment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Panela of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is a follow-up on your margin outlook, David. In terms of the debt management actions that you did this quarter, could you tell us what specifically they are, how much is left in terms of debt management actions and whether or not what's left is embedded in your guidance for NIM stability?","David J. Turner","Let me answer in a little different order, Erika. First, I want to be careful about making any implication of any particular debt instrument that we might deal with. So I have multiple lawyers around me to make sure we don't commit to that. But I think as you look at our balance sheet and you think about where we are from a liquidity standpoint, that doing some liability management make sense for us. We have had some of that liability management that you've seen that has been baked into our analysis of NIMs since the beginning of the year. There are additional pieces that we have not disclosed that I don't want to get in, again, to the specifics, that have not been baked in to our overall margin guidance. So there are potential opportunities to pick up some incremental lift. I would tell you it's not a tremendous amount of lift, but there is some positive upside that could be there if, in fact, we execute?","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And to follow-up, again, this is probably re-asking Ken Usdin's question. But given that outlook should -- is it fair to expect that earning asset growth will lag loan growth in the back half of the year?","David J. Turner","Earning asset growth also gets driven by how we use some of our cash and liability management. So it's harder to compare earning asset changes to loan growth. I think the better way to look at it is to think of what the composition of those earning assets will be in the back half of the year versus where they have been, which is obviously more deployment in the loan book than in the securities book, as being a big driver. As we think about overall NIM, we're sitting here at a 3.13%. I mentioned in my prepared comments that 2 of those points are related to day count, so you need to level set there. And we're telling you right now that our margin is relatively stable looking out. If, in fact, we can execute on -- and it's right to do to execute on some additional liability management initiatives, then we might have some incremental lift from there. But again, caution you on -- that wouldn't be a tremendous lift, but it would be incremental.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to just dive in a little bit more to the statement of C&I, broad across geographies and businesses, just to make sure we get a feel for what traction you're seeing in the Southeast region and where is that real strength is coming from?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, Marty, as you have -- as you're well aware, I mean, the Southeast has probably been one of the tougher markets to operate in over the last 3 or 4 years. And I would -- my comment was that what's changed over the last quarter for us is that we're seeing broader demand from a physical geography standpoint. We divide up our franchise into a number of different markets, and more of those markets are growing loans this quarter than were last quarter. In addition, we also divide our customer base up into segments. And I would tell you for the last several quarters, for example, in commercial and industrial lending, we've seen most of that demand for credit in the upper end of that market segment is purely from a segmentation standpoint. This quarter, we're seeing more demand in the lower and middle part of that segment, which is an encouraging sign of our recovery. I do think that we're seeing that broadness both on a segmentation basis and on a geography basis. Clearly, some of the strongest geographies in our business, in our footprint, have clearly been in Texas, Louisiana markets. And for a while, we're, to a large degree, limited to some of those markets, but now it's much more broad.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then, David, I want to talk a little bit more, we kind of had this conversation last year, at this time, about the seasonal impacts. There's probably $0.02 to $0.03 of giveback if you look at taxes and security gains and some of the OREO gains that you wouldn't think of as sustainable. But then there is also the FICA and option expenses, the fees on the service charges of deposits and the day count in NII. Could you look at those 2 things as being kind of, generally, evenhanded in the sense of the givebacks versus the benefit you get from the benefit you get from the seasonality?","David J. Turner","Marty, I'd tell you and staying fairly broad that we had, obviously, mentioned our income tax numbers, the $9 million and the $4 million. So you need to think about that in terms of -- and that's tax, right? So that's $0.01 there. You can look at the traction of our quarter-to-quarter in terms of payroll taxes that we would have some pickup there, but we had some favorable held-for-sale and OREO cost too. So it's harder to give you, without giving you specific guidance for the next quarter, which I'm not going to do, but we're trying to -- if you take your $0.23 and start carving out those one-offs that we mentioned, we're trying to give you some guidance as to what would not repeat in the subsequent quarters. But I think you hit the specific ones that you should look at.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","It just seemed to me that there's about as much opportunity in the seasonality as in some of the givebacks, and that's all I was trying to think of, generally, not trying to forecast the next quarter but just look at the balance between those 2 items.","David J. Turner","Good comment. Good comment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you remind us the size of the interest rate swap portfolio and the current impact of the net interest margin?","David J. Turner","Craig, I don't have that specifically. Obviously, all that's baked into the overall guidance that I gave you. But I don't have the pieces of that impact and maturities, but we can get that to you.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And when you think about that impact, how's the mix of it towards the debt side in terms of kind of protecting interest rate expense on debt and also towards kind of variable rate commercial loans?","David J. Turner","Yes. A lot of this -- we have both. Obviously, we have some pieces in debt that are swapped and some that are not. And if you look at our overall long-term debt cost we're just -- we're right at $6 billion. Slightly underneath that, that after swap impact, is just under 5%. That's the liability management initiative if you just take that globally and think about where spreads are for us today that provide us an opportunity to execute some liability management to get that cost down. We do have some swaps on our loan book. I don't recall anything large rolling off anytime in the near term that's going to negatively impact our net interest income and the resulting margin though.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just real quick on income CRE, I believe the portfolio is about $6.3 billion now. Can you help us when we think about a trough, expected  trough level for this portfolio as we think of runoff decelerating over the next few quarters here?","David J. Turner","Yes. That was a little bit of what the -- one of the questions we're trying to get as to when that starts to grow. And it's a little harder -- the kind of guidance that we're trying to give you is if you take our number today at $7.3 billion and you think of 800 of that needing -- $800 million being in a book troubled category of rolling out, our production is increasing. We're encouraged by our pipelines. And when that actually shifts and bottoms out, Craig, is a little hard. It will be in the second half of 13. I don't know that you'll see this by the end of the second quarter. I think you're into the second half before it occurs. And so that's about as good a guidance that we can give you right now.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And David, the only reason I dissected the 2 numbers, I just gave you the income CRE non-construction portion, is it looks like the construction portion has already started to grow.","David J. Turner","Yes. It's about $7.3 billion in total. You were given just the real estate mortgage number. There's another, I'll call it, $1 billion in construction. And you're right. To your point, we like the growth. It's not a lot of growth, but you can kind of see quarter-over-quarter. Starting in the middle of last year, there was slight growth throughout '13. We are seeing opportunities there, but that book is still fairly small.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just curious on the C&I growth, could you talk about maybe where you're seeing better demand in terms of industry versus weaker demand? And I'm curious about your multifamily exposure and how you're feeling about that right now given how strong it's been recently for the industry.","O. B. Grayson Hall","I'll ask John Asbury to speak to that very quickly.","John C. Asbury","So as Grayson and David indicated, I would definitely describe the demand by industry as being pretty broad-based. Energy is probably still among the best, but it's not dominating it. And there's really no clear kind of 1, 2, 3 that are driving most of the growth at this point, so it is pretty broad-based. Materials, commercial services, supplies, some retailing, very encouraging sign to see that sort of diversification by industry type. And as Grayson said, also seeing a pretty good spread geographically. In terms of multifamily, we continue to watch a lot of new construction activity within multifamily. We do believe that the fundamentals for multifamily remains strong and we think that there is room for what is going in and that's what is on the books. Having said that, we watch very carefully the markets for evidence of overbuilding, including the submarkets. One thing I will add that's also an encouraging sign is, as we look at new IRE commitments for Q1, multifamily was just about 30% of total new IRE commitments, and that's good. It used to be that most of the IRE construction we were financing -- or providing was being dominated by multifamily. So we're now seeing much more diversification by product type, which is also a healthy sign.","Barbara Godin","Jennifer, it's Barb Godin. Our actual multifamily outstandings are down on a year-over-year basis, from $2.3 billion down to $1.6 billion. So again, we're being very careful as to what we're putting in to that asset class.","John C. Asbury","There are lots of equity in those projects well underwritten.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","One question for you, Grayson. In terms of capital return, obviously you exited the CCAR process this year with a positive result, I think, in most people's minds. How should we think about 2 issues. One, moving to a dividend payout ratio that's much closer to the 30% line in the sand the regulators have provided. And the pace of your buybacks, your $300 million buyback program over the next 4 quarters. Should we just assume that's going to be even, or is there some other way you all are thinking about it?","O. B. Grayson Hall","Well, I'll tell you that we were, first of all, we were very pleased to get a favorable response to our capital plan recommendations and our -- positioning  ourselves to be able to execute those plans over the next several months. If we sort of look at the progress we've made as a company over the last couple of years and trying to put ourselves in position to be able to return more capital to our shareholders, we think we've made good progress. We have been incrementally increasing our action plans to do that. I think you should anticipate that as our company continues to incrementally improve our financial results, then we will seek opportunities to incrementally improve our return to shareholders. It is, as you know, it's a much more disciplined process today, and it's a much more regulated process, and we're working through that process and trying to demonstrate that we can effectively manage our capital position. I think what you saw this year was a very conservative first step on our part and hopefully, over time, we can deliver even better news. I do think that there's opportunities to do that, but we've got to continue to perform. And that's what we're working hard to do.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And David, a question for you. You've mentioned several times on the call your thoughts around debt management. And I certainly appreciate the power that, that can have for your net interest margin. I'd like to take that question in another direction. What thoughts do you have right now in terms of the OLA and any potential debt issuance you might need to do under that?","David J. Turner","Yes. We're continuing to evaluate what that OLA impact will be to the regional space. That's largely, if you look at some of the letters that have been sent in from Congress, in particular, are really leaning towards the bigger money center banks. That being said, we understand that we have to consider everything that's out there in the industry, including how much debt we might need to carry. We are looking for better -- clearer guidance as to what that ultimately would be. As we have deleveraged ourselves, given where our spreads had traded earlier, we thought it was a prudent thing to do for our shareholders. Our spreads have tightened up nicely. They're obviously never good enough for us, but we'd like them to be -- we're encouraged by where they have moved. And as we think about how we've capitalized the bank, and I'm talking about long-term debt and equity capital, and our goal is to make that as efficient as possible over the long haul, such that our capital structure is sustainable for any environment that we may have, whether we're in a low-rate environment or a growth environment. So we obviously think about that efficiency first, and then we think about whatever regulatory implications there might be from changes. So to the extent the rules come out and, say, we need to go on a particular direction, we will adapt and overcome and deal with it. But right now, we don't have that clear guidance as to what that means for the absolute debt levels for the regional bank space.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The question I have is regarding the loan loss reserves. You guys mentioned that you think that the reserves to total loans could fall into that 1.5% to 2% range at some point in the future. Can you share with us -- it seems to me that over the years, the regulators have focused on the reserve methodology based on classified and criticized loans rather than a GAAP accounting measure that we all look at, which is reserves to total loans. Are they still focused on driving or determining your reserve adequacy by the classified and criticized loans, or are they moving to this GAAP measure?","David J. Turner","Gerard, I'll start and Matt or Barb can jump in. I would tell you that those are elements of the same conversation. Obviously, criticized and classified, you heard on our prepared comments, we think now that that's disclosed and available to the public is an important view of what credit quality is in any financial institution. We used that, which is determined by our internal ratings as they are at every other bank, as an indicator of what embedded loss would be based on how those loans migrate through our process. I don't believe the regulators have any stipulated percentage of criticized and classifieds that may have been a way they looked at it globally in the past, but I don't think that's with what they're getting at today. I think they're looking for all of us to have a robust process that's documented and repeatable, that provides both to our shareholders and to them as our regulators, what an appropriate allowance should be. What happens is the coverage ratios, we compare those among peers, just to give us an indication as to how we shake out. But one should be very careful about comparing peer ratios, because we all have different loan books, we all are in different geographies, different loan types. And I think that what you ought to look at is how is our loan credit quality migrating from quarter-to-quarter, which will give you a better indication of what our ultimate reserving needs to be.","Barbara Godin","Well said.","O. B. Grayson Hall","Great.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then the second question has to with return on equity. I know you guys provided us with a return on tangible common equity for the period. But whether you use that ratio or a stated return on equity, which we calculated to be in the 8% range this quarter. If you had to choose 1 or 2 metrics that will drive that ratio, the return on equity numbers higher, which would then I think suggest your stock price could exceed stated book value at some point in the future. Is it your loan to deposit ratio? Is it interest rates going up 200 basis points? Is it a lower efficiency ratio, better credit quality? I know all of the above will help, but if you had to pick 1 or 2 items that really will drive that ROE higher to get the stock valuation higher, what 2 would you guys choose?","David J. Turner","I'd like to start with net income, be kind of a good one. I think that -- I think underneath that is probably what your question is and what really will drive your income higher, and I'm talking absolute dollars. And so as Grayson mentioned and I've tried to support that, for us, growing our revenue base is important. And when you are essentially a spread bank, 63% of our revenue being in NII, you think about what change is there. So you think of liability management, you think about optimizing the less side of the balance sheet, more loans versus securities, growing earning assets, in particular in loans which is what we're all about. So getting our NII up and getting our result -- resulting margin close to what it had been in the past, which was in that 3.35 range to 3.50 range. And you think of NII and what can grow that revenue, and you think of adding new customers and new products and services, so you've seen that come out of Regions quarter-after-quarter and we will continue to stay focused on that. So really, Gerard, for us, to get the kind of returns that we will all be happy with, is really about growing our revenue base. And of course, we all recognize we're challenged in a low growth environment. So while we're here, we're going to do the things I just talked about, while prudently managing our expenses, such that we generate positive operating leverage, such that we can have a reasonable return to our shareholders until 1 day that the rate environment changes.","O.

Good morning, and welcome to Regions' Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer, will review highlights of our full year financial performance; and David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the details of the fourth quarter.

These cover our presentation materials, prepared comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of today's call. ","I will now turn the call over to Grayson.","Grayson Hall","Thank you, Dana. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Let me begin by saying we're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. We successfully met our profitability targets for the year as we continued to diligently execute our strategic plan. For the full year, we reported solid earnings of $1.2 billion, up 9%, with earnings per share of $1, an increase of 15%, while producing growth in pretax pre-provision income and generating positive operating leverage of approximately 2%. Keep in mind, these results include charges associated with tax reform, which speaks to our core performance in 2017. David will cover these details in a moment. ","Looking back over the year, I'm particularly pleased with our unwavering focus on customer service and the recognition we received in that regard. This is what relationship banking is all about, and it is at the core of our needs-based, go-to-market strategy. As a result of our efforts, the American Customer Satisfaction Index recently awarded Regions with a #1 ranking. Our focus on outstanding customer service has led to year-over-year growth in checking accounts, households, credit cards, wealth management relationships, total assets under management and consumer loans, all of which are fundamental to growth and future income generation. ","As announced a few weeks ago, we have embarked on a new initiative called Simplify and Grow, which enables us to continue enhancing our ability to serve our customers as we make it easier for them to bank with Regions. The evaluation and discovery phase is well underway, and we expect to begin the execution phase in the first quarter. With respect to our financial performance, full year results continue to benefit from our asset-sensitive balance sheet and strong deposit franchise, which drove a 4% increase in adjusted net interest income and a 19 basis point increase in adjusted net interest margin. Prudent expense management remained a top priority in 2017. On an adjusted basis, total noninterest expenses increased less than 1% over the prior year, in line with expectations, reflecting disciplined expense management along with prudent investments in technology and other revenue-generating opportunities. In addition, we expect that our Simplify and Grow strategy will further enhance our efficiency efforts, which we would share with you later in the year. ","In terms of the economic backdrop, we are encouraged by improving conditions as well as customer sentiment, providing momentum as we head into 2018. As an example, loan production began to pick up in the second half of the year. For the full year, new and renewed loan production increased 8%, and total loans and leases grew approximately $600 million on a point-to-point basis in the fourth quarter. In 2017, deliberate risk management decisions regarding certain industries and asset classes within the Corporate Banking segment negatively impacted loan balances. For the most part, these efforts are now complete, and our improved credit metrics illustrate these strategies are paying off. To that end, we experienced broad-based improvements during the quarter, including a reduction in nonperforming loans, the lowest level in over 10 years. ","Regarding tax reform, we are encouraged by the legislation passed in December and believe domestic businesses will be better positioned and more competitive in the global marketplace. For Regions, tax reform provided the opportunity to make additional investments that will benefit our associates, our customers, our communities and our shareholders. We announced an increase to our minimum hourly wage, benefiting approximately 25% of our workforce. We made a $40 million contribution to our charitable foundation to support financial education, job training, economic development and affordable housing. We also disclosed our plans to invest more in our company with a significant increase in our capital expenditures budget. ","As we enter 2018, there are 4 key areas providing considerable momentum for Regions. First, is our asset sensitivity and funding advantage driven by our low-cost deposit base, which we believe provides significant franchise value and a competitive advantage in a rising rate environment. ","Second is asset quality. As reflected this quarter, we continue to report broad-based improvements in credit. Next, robust capital returns as we continue to move towards our target Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. In 2017, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, representing a $488 million or 42% increase over the prior year. ","Finally, we expect additional improvements in efficiency and core performance through our Simplify and Grow initiative. We will provide additional details of the expected financial impacts later this year. ","Before I turn it over to David to cover the details of the fourth quarter, I would like to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to our team of associates for their hard work and dedication this past year. And I'm proud of our accomplishments and results. We ended the year with good momentum and look forward to leveraging additional opportunities in 2018. David?","David Turner","Thank you, and good morning. Before we get started, let me summarize the impact tax reform had on our fourth quarter results. The company revalued its net deferred tax assets and revised its amortization associated with low-income housing investments, resulting in a combined $52 million charge for income tax expense. The company also reduced income associated with leveraged leases, resulting in a $6 million reduction to net interest income and a 2 basis point decline to net interest margin. ","As a result of anticipated future savings, the company also contributed $40 million to its charitable foundation. As it relates to regulatory capital, tax reform also had a negative impact. The revaluation of deferred tax items includes approximately $130 million included in equity as a component of other comprehensive income. Despite our prior election to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from regulatory capital, the full revaluation charge was reflected in net income, as noted above, reducing regulatory capital by approximately 10 basis points. Accounting rule-makers subsequently issued a proposed rule change to correct this issue via a reclassification between accumulated other comprehensive income and retained earnings. ","At this juncture, we expect to reclassify these components and recapture those 10 basis points in the first quarter of 2018. Further impacting 2018, the fully taxable equivalent benefit, provided primarily from tax-advantaged loans, will reset in the first quarter. We estimate the impact to be a reduction to net interest margin of approximately 4 basis points. ","Now turning back to the quarter. As Grayson mentioned, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results, which reflect improvements in several areas. Let's start with the balance sheet and look at average loans. ","In the fourth quarter, average loan balances totaled $79.5 billion, relatively stable with the prior quarter. Loans ended the year at $79.9 billion, reflecting approximately $600 million in point-to-point growth over the prior quarter. Within consumer, we continued to grow despite the negative impacts associated with our exit of a third-party relationship within the indirect vehicle portfolio. ","Average balances in the consumer lending portfolio increased $40 million in the fourth quarter. However, excluding the runoff in the indirect vehicle portfolio, average consumer loans increased $223 million. For 2017, runoff in the third-party portfolio totaled $508 million, and we expect the full year average decline in 2018 to be approximately $700 million. ","In the quarter, we experienced solid growth in residential mortgage, indirect other consumer and consumer credit card, partially offset by continued declines in home equity lending. ","Turning to the business lending portfolio. Average balances totaled $48.2 billion, reflecting a modest decline from the third quarter. However, ending balances increased by approximately $500 million. Commercial and industrial loans grew $672 million on an ending basis, led by growth in specialized lending. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans declined $94 million, reflecting a slowing pace of decline. ","Additionally, investor real estate loans declined $101 million as growth in term mortgage loans was offset by declines in construction loans. As we look to 2018, we expect full year average loans to grow in the low single digits, excluding the third-party indirect vehicle portfolio runoff. ","Let's move to deposits. We continue to execute a deliberate strategy to optimize our deposit base by focusing on valuable low-cost deposits while reducing higher-cost, brokered and collateralized deposits. Total average deposits increased modestly during the quarter as growth in low-cost deposits exceeded strategic reductions within the wealth and other segments. ","Certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits within the wealth segment, which require collateralization by securities, continued to shift out of deposits and into other fee-income-producing customer investments. Average deposits in the other segment decreased due to our strategy to reduce retail brokered sweep deposits. We reported solid consumer deposit and strong seasonal growth in corporate deposits during the quarter, consistent with our relationship banking focus. ","Looking forward, we expect 2018 full year average deposits to grow in the low single digits, excluding brokered and wealth institutional service deposits. Let's take a look at the composition of our deposit base. Fourth quarter deposit costs remain unchanged at 17 basis points, and total funding costs remained low at 38 basis points, illustrating the strength of our deposit franchise. ","As a reminder, our deposit base is more heavily weighted towards retail customers of approximately 67%, and those customers have been very loyal to Regions as more than 43% of our consumer low-cost deposits have been deposit customers for more than 10 years. Our top market share in core states positions us well for future growth, and we expect continued benefit from lower deposit betas relative to peers. For these reasons, we believe our deposit base is a key component of our franchise value and a competitive advantage in a rising rate environment. ","Now let's take a look at how this impacted our results. Adjusted net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis, which excludes the tax-related reduction associated with leveraged leases, was $930 million, representing an increase of $9 million or 1% from the prior quarter. The resulting adjusted net interest margin was 3.39%, an increase of 3 basis points. The increases to adjusted net interest income and net interest margin were driven by higher market interest rates, offset by the full impact of debt issued during the third quarter and lower credit-related interest recoveries experienced in the fourth quarter. ","With respect to the first quarter of 2018 and excluding the tax-related fully taxable equivalent adjustment of approximately 4 basis points, we expect adjusted net interest income and net interest margin to increase, reflecting the full benefit of the December rate increase and the expectation for higher short-term rates consistent with current market expectations. ","Notably, modest growth in net interest income is expected despite two fewer days in the quarter, which reduces net interest income by approximately $10 million but benefits margin by approximately four basis points. For the full year of 2018, we expect adjusted net interest income growth in the 3% to 5% range. ","Let's move on to fee revenue. We experienced strong growth in adjusted noninterest income, which increased $36 million or 7%, driven primarily by increases in capital markets, mortgage and card and ATM fees. Capital markets had a record quarter, coming in at $56 million, an increase of $21 million or 60%. The increase was driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory services, loan syndication income and fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers. ","Excluding M&A revenue, which decreased in 2017, other areas within capital markets experienced growth, increasing 28% compared to the prior year. Although timing can be difficult to project, we do expect capital markets income to be a significant contributor to adjusted noninterest income growth in 2018. ","As it relates to mortgage, production decreased seasonally 3%, while income increased $4 million or 13%. The increase was primarily due to MSR and related hedge valuation adjustments recorded in the third quarter, which did not repeat at the same level in the fourth quarter. Card and ATM fees increased $3 million or 3%, attributable to seasonally higher interchange income. ","Total consumer fee income is an important and stable component of fee revenue and is expected to continue to contribute to overall growth in 2018. Total Wealth Management income is up 2% quarter-over-quarter and 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by improvement in equity markets, growth in customers and assets under management. ","In addition, the company incurred $10 million of operating lease impairments during the third quarter that did not repeat in the fourth quarter. With respect to 2018, we expect total adjusted noninterest income growth in the 3% to 6% range. ","So let's move on to expenses. On an adjusted basis, expenses increased $21 million or 2%, attributable primarily to increases in salaries and benefits, outside services and Visa Class B shares expense. Total salaries and benefits increased $13 million or 3%, primarily due to higher production-based incentives and health insurance costs. Outside services increased $7 million or 17%, reflecting additional costs associated with the recent launch of our new Regions Wealth Platform in partnership with SEI Global Services. These cost increases will be offset by reductions in other expense categories, primarily salaries and benefits, in the future. ","The adjusted efficiency ratio improved 60 basis points to 61.1%, and the company produced solid growth in adjusted pretax pre-provision income, increasing 5% and reflecting its highest level since the third quarter of 2008. For 2018, we expect adjusted operating leverage of 3% to 5%, relatively stable adjusted expenses and an adjusted efficiency ratio of less than 60%. With respect to taxes, clearly, there were a number of moving pieces in the fourth quarter. The reported effective tax rate was 39%. Excluding the $52 million of additional income tax expense related to tax reform, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 30%. Following corporate income tax reform, our 2018 guidance for the effective tax rate is now in the 20% to 22% range. ","So let's shift to asset quality. The company reported broad-based asset quality improvement during the quarter. Nonperforming, criticized and troubled debt restructured loans all declined. Nonperforming loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased $110 million or 14% and represented 0.81% of loans outstanding, marking the lowest level in over 10 years. We also reported a 17% and 13% decline in business services criticized and total troubled debt restructured loans, respectively. ","As expected, early and late-stage delinquencies for residential mortgage loans increased within hurricane-impacted markets, and the company's $40 million hurricane-related reserve remains unchanged. Despite increase within residential mortgage, total delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, declined approximately 1%. Net charge-offs totaled $63 million or 31 basis points of average loans, a 17% decrease compared to the third quarter. For the full year, net charge-off represented 38 basis points of average loans, in line with expectations. ","Improving economic conditions drove broad-based improvements in credit metrics, particularly in risk ratings, along with payoffs and paydowns of criticized loans, resulting in a negative provision expense of $44 million for the quarter. The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased 14 basis points to 1.17%. However, the allowance, as a percent of total nonaccrual loans, increased 7 basis points to 144%. For 2018, we expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 50 basis points. And based on recent performance and current market conditions, we would expect to be at the lower end of that range. However, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to large-dollar commercial credits, fluctuating commodity prices and the impact from hurricane exposures. ","Let's move on to capital and liquidity. Similar to last quarter, we repurchased another $500 million or 31.1 million shares of common stock and declared $103 million in dividends to common shareholders. Our resulting capital ratios remained robust. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 capital ratio was estimated at 11.7%, and the fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 10.8%. Finally, our liquidity position remains solid with a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 83%. And we were fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule as of quarter-end. ","So regarding 2018 expectations, tax reform changes made it necessary to recalibrate our long-term target for adjusted return on average tangible common equity. Our 2018 adjusted return on average tangible common equity ratio is now expected to be in the 14% to 16% range. Other targets have been discussed and are summarized again on this slide for your reference. So in conclusion, our strong fourth quarter results provide a solid foundation as we head into 2018. We believe our Simplify and Grow initiative, along with other opportunities and competitive advantages, position us well for 2018 and beyond. ","With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I will now turn it back over to Dana.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, David. [Operator Instructions]. We will now open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O'Connor","You mentioned later this year that you would quantify some of the initiatives that you have underway. I guess, first, is there going to be both a revenue and expense component as we think about some of these efforts?","Grayson Hall","Yes. I mean, Matt, we've been working for a number of months now on this initiative, and it does have both expense and revenue components. But John Owen, he's with us today, and John is leading that initiative. So I'll ask John to make a few comments.","John Owen","Just a little bit of background. Simplify and Grow, as you think about it, is a multiyear strategy for the bank. We kicked off the planning process in the fourth quarter working with McKinsey. We wrapped that planning process up in early January. But let me tell you, we've now moved on to what I call execution phase of the project. There are 3 areas of focus. First is how we make banking easier for our customers. Second would be how we accelerate revenue growth. And third would be about improving efficiency and effectiveness. The timing standpoint, I will tell you many of the initiatives will go in, in the second, third quarter. Some will span into 2019 as well. But it's very early. We've got about 10 work streams kicked off very early in the process still.","Grayson Hall","And David, from a -- how we'll respond to this publicly, if you could speak to that for a moment.","David Turner","Sure, Matt. So this Simplify and Grow, as you heard from John Owen, there's a number of initiatives and how they'll affect our financial statements both from a revenue and an expense standpoint. We have elements that we've given you, our guidance for the year thus far, and we'll be going to a number of conferences. And as we get clarity on exactly what this will do and how it will impact our numbers and ratios, we'll update you. I suspect it will be first, second quarter -- end of the first, maybe second quarter, before we give you any specificity of what that would look like.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Regarding the investment program, I know you're going to give us a little bit more details later on. But in general, how are you thinking about the ultimate tax reform benefit? And how much of that gets deployed into the program? And accordingly, how much eventually falls to the bottom line?","David Turner","Yes, John. So this is David. We wanted to give you some flavor for that. If you look at our expectation for return on tangible common equity, we've moved that up 200 basis points from 12 to 14 to 14 to 16. We anticipated some tax reform coming. We believed it was appropriate at the time to increase our capital expenditures to accelerate some opportunities we think we have to better serve our customer. Those capital expenditures, they don't find their way into the income statement. They'll find themselves in the income statement over time. So we have that baked into our guidance already. And we had other initiatives where we've made contributions to our foundation and our $15 for minimum wage because we think it was important for us to continue to execute on our mission of shared value, which is taking care of customers and associates and communities as well as our shareholders.","John Pancari","Okay. So no percentage, reinvestment amount that you're willing to give?","David Turner","No, we increased our capital expenditures roughly $100 million. Right now, you can see that we're keeping our targets for common equity Tier 1 where they are. Therefore, the benefit that we see coming through from taxes will help increase our return on tangible common net 200 basis points.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. I was just getting at if there's anything else beyond the CapEx amount. Okay. And then separately, in terms of capital deployment. I just want to hop to that. I wanted to get your updated thoughts around interest in M&A as you're looking at opportunities here. How does -- can you remind us of your deployment priorities? How you're thinking about that right now? And where does M&A come into play both non-bank and bank?","David Turner","Yes. So our priorities really haven't changed, John. We focus first and foremost on organic growth. It's important for us to take the capital we generate and put it back into the growth in the business appropriately. When we have opportunities to get an appropriate risk-adjusted return from that organic growth, we've been very disciplined with regards to not just making any loan, but making loans that give our shareholders their appropriate risk-adjusted return. We will continue doing that. Second, we wanted to make sure we have a fair dividend to our shareholders. We had talked about being in the range of earnings of 30% to 40% and that we would be increasing that to 35% to 45% over time. We believe that's important. So as income increases, whether it be through tax savings or otherwise, you should expect that to find its way into that dividend calculation. Then we said we would look at opportunities to expand through non-bank acquisitions. We've had a number of [indiscernible]. BlackArch Partners are in the advisory business; First Sterling, our low-income housing tax credit syndicator business, which was basically on ice this year, but we're looking forward to that expansion this year with tax reform. So that's been important. Bank M&A, given the fact that we have excess capital, we really have to look at banks versus share buybacks. And we believe that the share buyback program that we've had going on will continue and that we will continue to work our capital ratios down to that common equity Tier 1 level of roughly 9.5%. As credit quality and derisking continues, perhaps, that number changes. Perhaps, it could even go lower. If we tag on more risk, the number will go higher. But right now, our goal is to get that to 9.5%.","Grayson Hall","And John, I think that's a great question. And we look at how our income statement is generating more capital, how do we deploy that capital most constructively and most productively? And as David said, first and foremost, it's organic. It's making sure that we can -- if we can put that capital back into our business constructively and productively, we'll do that. If we can't do that, obviously, we look at M&A. And our primary focus has been bolt-on, non-bank M&A. We continue to look at that. Secondarily, we look at bank M&A, but that -- we've had -- the economics of that make it particularly challenging at this point in time. We look at it, but our primary focus after we've gotten through the organic is -- and the bolt-on acquisitions is really to look at how do we give it back in the form of dividend and share repurchases. We want a competitive dividend, and we want share repurchases as a lever to use when we can't deploy that capital any other way. And we still -- knowing what we know today, we still think that's going to be a productive and constructive use of the capital we're generating.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Just a question on the balance sheet. Thinking through the organic growth in loans and deposits and then the lingering runoff that you articulated clearly, how do we just think about the trajectory of the balance sheet? The balance sheet is clearly becoming more efficient, but do you expect -- I guess, when -- should we see any average earning asset expansion this year? Or is it just kind of netting those -- a final kind of mix to a better place?","David Turner","Yes. So we've given you some guidance on low single digits on the balance sheet for loans and deposits. We see that continuing. We have not changed that guidance post tax reform. We'll see what demand for credit might look like. But right now, we feel pretty confident we can grow in the low single digits on both of those. We do have the headwind of our indirect auto book that will affect us about $700 million, as I previously mentioned. But we can overcome that. We continue to grow and grow the balance sheet both in dollars, but also as you mentioned it, it's far more effective and efficient in generating better returns for us.","Grayson Hall","Yes, I mean, I think -- yes, we're very pleased with sort of the progress we've made on reshifting the balance of our balance sheet and the assets we've invested in. Clearly, in 2016, 2017, we made some risk-based decisions regarding our balance sheet and reduced our risk appetite for certain asset classes, which created a headwind for us in terms of loan growth. We had very good loan production growth in 2017. That production actually strengthened in the second half of the year. We felt good about that. What we have not built into the guidance is any sort of optimism about loan growth above and beyond what we're seeing today, is if business is more certain and more confident in 2018 than they have been thus far, that's an upside opportunity. But for right now, we've built in what we know and what we see. Obviously, we'd be encouraged if it's better than that. But John Turner is with us. John, do you mind making a few comments about the potential for loan growth?","John Turner","Sure, Grayson. I'm happy to. As has been currently suggested, we're currently projecting sort of low single-digit loan growth. That is based upon our assessment of economic conditions, market conditions prior to, as has been said, any tax reform. I would say that we are largely complete with the derisking activities. We'll continue to focus on improving the quality of our portfolio and client selectivity on risk-adjusted returns in the business. And so I anticipate that we will see, just as a result of better execution, continued improvement in execution for that low single-digit growth. And if the economy does, in fact, tick up as a result of tax reform, then we should benefit from that. But in the meantime, we do believe we can deliver low single-digit growth just based upon our day-to-day activities and expectations for the business.","Kenneth Usdin","Great. Understood. And then inside that efficiency comment, can you -- is there a way you can help us separate how much of that efficiency can help the NIM itself on its own versus how much rates can help the NIM, presuming the curve and the hikes that you're expecting?","David Turner","I'm not exactly sure of your question, but let me see if I can give it a stab. So our efficiency ratio, we have a number of things we're going to have to deal with. The tax equivalent adjustment that we have does negatively impact the efficiency ratio as it does the margins. So I told you the 4 basis points in the margin. But it also negatively impact the efficiency ratio about 50 basis points.","Q - Kenneth Usdin","50 bps, right?","David Turner","50 bps. But we're still committed to having an efficiency ratio under that 60% that we mentioned. So that will come from continuing to become more efficient on expenses. We did a good job of having it less than 1% growth in expenses this year. We see renewed growth in revenue coming. We gave you the guidance of 3% to 5% on NII. We feel good about that based on balance sheet growth and even more encouraged based on what we've seen of late with the market expectations for rates. And we also are getting back on the growth side of noninterest revenue, where we were down this year, but expect 3% to 6% growth in noninterest revenue. So if you put all that together, and we'll get some incremental benefits from the Simplify and Grow strategy that we talked about, we feel pretty confident we can be under 60%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","I guess, if I look back at the 3Q presentation, you talked about additional expense reductions beyond the $400 million. Details to be provided later in the year. And we're on the 4Q call in January, and it sounds like you've announced Simplify and Grow as a main project. But in terms of getting real financial details behind that, we're going to have to wait later into 2018. Has something changed that means you're taking a deeper look or you're thinking about things in a different way than you were back in October when you put out that 3Q presentation?","Grayson Hall","No, Geoffrey. There's really been no change in our perspective as we talked about this in the third quarter, as you mentioned in your comments. We've been on a multiyear journey of really trying to manage expenses very rigorously and with a lot of discipline. And we absolutely are confident we've done a good job of that. That being said, what we announced in the third quarter is it -- we were going to bring McKinsey in to help us take an even harder look at that. And we embarked on those work streams, as John Owen spoke about a moment ago. It's been a very in-depth evaluation. It's -- we've had people across the company involved in it. And these things are best done very thoughtfully and very carefully. And we've taken our time to do that. And we're in the middle of execution at that point -- at this point in time, and there's details forthcoming. But nothing's changed from our perspective. Everything is on schedule, just as we had forecasted it would be.","Geoffrey Elliott","And I guess, the long-term ROTCE target, it sounds like that's 14% to 16% long term, but also 2018 target, if I'm reading Slide 13 right. So is this going to take another look at that based on Simplify and Grow?","David Turner","Yes. So that 14% to 16% target was a 2018 target. It was not necessarily a longer-term target. We do expect, as I mentioned before, when we were in the 12% to 14% range, that we would continue to move up -- expectations that we'd move up towards the mid-teens on return on tangible common. Since then, we've had tax reform. We've also had Simplify and Grow. So we will give you better guidance over that range of 14% to 16% as that becomes known. We will be doing another Investor Day roughly this time next year. We'll give you a new three-year set of targets. We'll show you how we compare to the original set of targets that we gave you. But no, we expect that to continue to grow past 2018's results.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust.","Jennifer Demba","Could you just talk about what you think the main drivers of your forecasted fee income growth will be this year?","David Turner","Sure. So as you look at the detail of our noninterest revenue, we got out of the box a little slower in terms of our capital markets business. It recovered quite nicely in the fourth quarter. And as we said in our prepared comments, we expect that capital markets in particular to be helpful to our 3% to 6% growth in 2018. We do have -- our service charges have been a very stable component of our noninterest revenue. We grew that about a little over 2%, almost 3% in the year. We expect that to contribute as we continue to grow core checking account households. Card and ATM fees, we'll continue to grow those both in terms of share numbers.","Our transactions are up, so that will be a piece of it. Our Wealth Management Group in particular in the investment management trust area has continued to benefit from growth in customers as well as assets under management, so that will be a piece of it. We think mortgage continue -- will rebound. We think mortgage will be up nicely from the production that we had this year. It was kind of a reset, we believe, for the industry. So you should see mortgage continuing to rebound as well. Those are kind of the bigger items that we have that should contribute to that 3% to 6% growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Moss of B. Riley FBR.","Stephen Moss","Circling back to loan growth, just wondering how we should think about it. Strength throughout the year or perhaps back-end-weighted? And then what do you think will be the primary drivers of growth? C&I and commercial real estate or consumer?","Grayson Hall","Well, I think when you look at 2018 and you think through when long demand occurs, I would tell you there's still an awful lot of liquidity in the markets. And if you look at '17 as an example, we've started off with the year in pretty good shape from a production pipeline standpoint. In the second half of the year, we wound up having an awful lot of payoffs and paydowns as people went into the public debt markets. We saw the strength of that stronger in the third than in the fourth, but still elevated. And so I do think that there's still a lot of liquidity that's out there, and so there's competition for that. Internally, we've had debates about the implications of tax reform and what that has on loan demand. We don't see that changing really what's occurring on the consumer side of the house. Consumer is a good story, and it's a steady story.","Other than the headwinds that we have from the indirect auto runoff portfolio we've got, it's a good story. Even in mortgage, '17 turned out to be a very transformational year for mortgage as that market went from a refinance market to a home purchase market. But we've always been a strong home purchase mortgage originator, and so most of the impact of that will be past us in '17 on the consumer side. The only lingering effect we got on consumer is just the indirect auto piece. On the commercial side, we put together our forecast based on what we know today. If the economy strengthens, as John Turner said earlier, if the economy strengthens, we got an upside opportunity. But knowing what we know today, we think the forecast that we've given you, the guidance we've given you, we got a fairly high degree of confidence in it. John Turner, would you like to add to that?","John Turner","Yes, I would just add. Typically, the second and fourth quarters are going to be better quarters. We begin the year with a lot of momentum coming off of a high degree of production in the fourth quarter. So pipelines are a little softer going into the year, but funding should be a little better in the first quarter given that activity in the fourth. We have confidence in our ability to deliver commercial banking and commercial lending activity this year. I think the difference is going to be that we have been shrinking, derisking our investor real estate book. And we have an opportunity to grow that business kind of with the economy, particularly as we see our term lending program begin to mature a bit as we shift our focus on a different kind of real estate customer. We're beginning to see some of that positive activity. So that will have an impact on loan growth as well in 2018.","Stephen Moss","Okay. And then on asset quality this quarter, nice improvement in the numbers. Wondering how much of that paydowns versus risk-weighted improvements. And how should we think about the loan loss reserve going forward?","Barbara Godin","Yes. This is Barb. And to answer your question directly, roughly 50% of what we saw in terms of the improvement of our business services classified loan book was payoffs or paydowns. The balance was risk weighted improvements. And it is broad-based. It wasn't just specific to just the energy sector. We certainly saw some improvement in energy, but we saw it right across the board in all the various asset classes. As it relates to the allowance, going to 1 17, again we follow a very formulaic way of doing our allowance. And you've heard me say in the past, we're not going to let it fall substantially. But at the same time, we do have to ensure that we have the right amount of allowance against the right amount of risk. So I don't have a specific number for your that we either target or aim for. We just make sure that the allowance we do have is appropriate and prudent at all times.","David Turner","I would add that we gave you some guidance on the charge-offs being in the range of 35 to 50 basis points. And based on what we know today, we think we have charge-offs closer to the lower end of that. And you should think about provisioning equal to charge-offs in that case. To the extent it's higher than that, you probably have something that happened in a hurricane or an energy-type reserve, where the reserve is already there. It doesn't have to be replaced.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.","Steven Duong","This is actually Steven Duong in for Gerard. Just circling back on your comments about capital expenditures. You said you're looking to increase CapEx, which should help you boost your ROTCE target. What are these investments exactly? And is it safe to assume that they're capitalized so they won't show in the P&L?","David Turner","Yes. So a couple of things. The CapEx, roughly $100 million, is over what we had in 2017. Those capital expenditures are really in areas that help -- make it easier for our customers to do business with us, that help us generate revenue. We don't tie that necessarily to return, at least directly. We believe there are a lot of opportunities. These capital expenditures are exactly that. They hit the balance sheet. They'll be depreciated over time. And depending on the nature of the project, they could be long-dated. They could be tied to a branch. It may be tied to digital opportunities. It may be tied to cyber-risk efforts. So those -- that number, or that increase, you should think about, again, hitting the balance sheet but not hitting the income statement, but a little bit each year. And that's after it's spent. It will this year that we spend it. So you will see hardly any of that hit income this year.","Grayson Hall","And Steven, you're seeing a lot of our customers really start to have a high utilization rate in our digital channels. And so obviously, those customers' expectations are being influenced not only by other banks they use but other providers for other services. And so we're having to compare ourselves to a larger community when you talk about digital, and so we make investments there. We also have a number of technologies that we use to help us manage risk and compliance. And so we have to continue to invest in those, continue to strengthen. And we make them better each and every year, and cyber being one of the lead candidates there. But lastly, I would tell you is, coming out of this Simplify and Grow initiative, we've identified a lot of places where technology can help us be not only more effective, but much more efficient. And so you're going to see us continue to invest in technology as we go through that initiative.","And last but certainly not least is see if you go into some of our branches, the technology we're deploying in our new branch format is entirely different than what we've had in the past. We've done a number of branches in the past in '16 and '17, but you'll see us accelerate that into '18. A huge benefit from us from a customer service perspective and a customer experience perspective when they come into one of our offices.","Steven Duong","Great. And just a follow-up question. You guys are trading at about 1.3x book, 2x tangible book. Is there a price level where the buybacks don't make as much sense relative to the other opportunities that you have?","David Turner","We continue to challenge ourselves on that very point, but we're sitting here with a pretty high Common Equity Tier 1 ratio relative to the risk that we have in the balance sheet. And so when you have excess capital, it's hard to see how the market gives you full credit for being optimized on your capital stack. And so we have to have a pretty high return hurdle for us to deviate from buying back our shares versus making some other type of investments. So when you get to the efficient frontier, having your capital amount and your capital stack optimized, then you got a different calculus. But for us, getting to that 9.5% is very important to us, and that's where we're marching.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners.","Christopher Marinac","You may have mentioned this earlier. I just missed it. Does any relief in the LCR rule get baked into your outlook for this year? Or could you describe sort of how that would benefit if it plays out in your favor?","David Turner","Yes, Chris. It's David. We do not have any relief in our -- in the numbers we just told you from LCR, to the extent that the SIFI designation was changed, and therefore, we weren't subject to LCR. There are some deposits that were fairly low-cost deposits for us that, based on the rules, the runoff assumptions caused us to price those where they weren't as favorable to us, and we let those run off. So yes, LCR certainly would be somewhat beneficial to us. It would help us more from a liquidity standpoint, where we could generate more liquidity there. But in terms of an explicit cost, we haven't quantified that at this point.","Christopher Marinac","Okay. Great. Could it also help fuel further buybacks as well?","David Turner","Not really. You're really talking about a different -- you're talking about liquidity in the bank versus liquidity at the holding company. Those are different concepts, and our -- whatever liquidity we need in the holding company to get our buybacks executed, to help us get to our target capital ratios, we'll fund by debt issuances, like we've done before.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Hall for any closing remarks.","Grayson Hall","Okay. Well, thank you. I certainly appreciate everybody's time and attendance. We think we just ended a very solid 2017 and are positioned well for a strong 2018. And I do appreciate you listening to our message this morning and our answers to your questions. So thank you. Let's have a great year. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

My name is Paula and I will be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participants online have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call there will be a question-and-answer Session. [Operator Instructions].","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Dana Nolan to begin.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, Paula. Good morning and welcome to Regions' fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Participating on the call are Grayson Hall, Chief Executive Officer and David Turner, Chief Financial Officer. Other members of senior management are also present and available to answer questions. A copy of the slide presentation referenced throughout this call as well as our earnings release and earnings supplement are available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","I would also like to caution you that we will make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risk and uncertainties and we will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations as well as GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are detailed in our SEC filings.","I will now turn the call over to Grayson.","Grayson Hall","Thank you, Dana and good morning. Thank you for joining our call today. I will review highlights of our full year financial performance and David will cover results for the fourth quarter specifically. Let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with 2016 results. We diligently executing our strategic plan and maintained our focus on our business fundamentals. Central to our success has been the continued emphasis on three strategic initiatives, growing and diversifying revenue, practicing disciplined expense management and effectively deploying our capital.","Net income available to common shareholders in 2016 was $1.1 billion, a 10% increase of 2015. Earnings per share was $0.87, representing a 16% increase over the prior year. Total taxable equivalent revenue grew 3% and reported non-interest expenses were relatively flat. And like 2015, we laid out financial targets for 2016.","Although the operating environment proved somewhat more challenging than anticipated or forecasted, we still met or exceeded most of our performance targets, for example we grew net interest income 3% versus the prior year. We also grew adjusted non-interest income 7%, driven by growth in construction relationships and new product offerings. For example, through newer enhanced products and capabilities, capital markets income increased 46% in 2016 and wealth management income increased 6%","Adjusted non-interest expenses increased just under 2%, in line with our target of flat to up modestly. Importantly, we generated positive operating leverage, which is a critical metric as part of our focus to an adjusted basis of 3% and adjusted full year efficiency ratio was 63.3%. Finally, full year net charge-offs totaled 34 basis points.","Regarding loan growth, 2016 presented some unique challenges which we tackled head-on and we were intentional and thoughtful in how we managed our portfolio. Average loans were relatively stable in fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the prior year. Notably, the overall financial health of our consumer portfolio was strong and we saw solid demand and stable loan growth in almost all consumer loan categories. Average consumer loans grew $1.2 billion or 4% from the fourth quarter of prior year.","On the other hand, average business lending balances declined 3% from the fourth quarter of prior year. This decline was driven by our continued focus and a thoughtful focus on achieving appropriate risk adjusted returns, the de-risking of certain portfolios and asset classes and the ongoing softness in demand for middle market commercial and small business loans. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by recent increases in market interest rates as well as possible benefits associated with the new administration. We remain focused on improving efficiencies. Our plan to eliminate $400 million a core expenses through 2019 remains firmly intact. This, along with our continued focus on appropriate risk adjusted returns, are fundamental to our long-term success and sustainability of our franchise value.","With respect to capital deployment, we remain committed to effectively deploying our capital through organic growth and strategic investments that increase revenue or reduced ongoing expenses, while returning an appropriate amount of capital to shareholders. In the year 2016, we returned $1.2 billion of our earnings to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, while at the same time maintaining robust and industry leading capital loans.","On a separate note, we are pleased that our satisfactory CRA rating has been reinstated. We remain committed to optimizing our branch network and we will optimistically expand and serve in select growth markets. In year 2016 we consolidated 103 branches and announced plans to consolidate another 23 offices. As presently announced, our plan is to consolidate at least 150 branch offices by the end of 2017.","In closing, I want to thank our team of 22,000 associates for their hard work and dedication in delivering solid financial results and their continued commitment to superior customer service. We are extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2016 and are well positioned to build on that momentum in 2017.","With that, I will turn it over to David to cover the specific details of the fourth quarter. David?","David Turner","Thank you Grayson and good morning everyone. Let's get started with the balance sheet and look at average loans. In the fourth quarter, average loan balances totaled $80.6billion, down 1% from the previous quarter and relatively flat with the fourth quarter of 2015. Consumer lending remains a positive story for us as we experienced another quarter of solid growth.","Average balances increased $329 million or 1% over the prior quarter and $1.2 billion or 4% over the prior year. This growth was led by mortgage lending as balances increased $236 million or 2% linked quarter and $732 million or 6% over the same quarter of the prior year.","We made the decision to sell $171 million of affordable housing residential mortgage loans to Freddie Mac during the fourth quarter and generated a gain of $5 million. Approximately $91 million of these loans included recourse and will remain in loans held for sale at year-end until the recourse expires later in 2017. Subsequent to the expiration of recourse provisions, it is expected that an additional $5 million gain will be recognized. The economics of the transaction and improved diversification drove the decision to sell.","We continued to experience success with our other indirect lending portfolio which includes point of sale initiatives. This portfolio increased $110 million or 14% linked quarter and $366 million or 70% year-over-year. Average balances in our consumer credit card portfolio increased $36 million or 3% over the prior quarter and $115 million or 11% over the fourth quarter of 2015. Penetration into our existing deposit customer base increased to 18.4%, an improvement of 110 basis points year-over-year.","Turning to the indirect auto portfolio. Average balances decreased $17 million during the quarter. As previously disclosed, we terminated a third party arrangement during the fourth quarter that historically accounted for approximately one-half of our total indirect vehicle production. As such, we expect the pace of run-off in the portfolio to exceed production generated by our preferred dealer network. Average home equity balances also decreased $64 million as the pace of run-off exceeded production.","Now turning to business lending. Average balances decreased $1 billion or 2% during the quarter and $1.4 billion or 3% year-over-year. As Grayson mentioned, the decline in business lending balances was impacted by our continued focus on achieving appropriate balance and diversity while also improving risk-adjusted returns. Importantly, balances reflect decisions and choices that we made during the year. We continued to reduce exposure due to concerns about increasing risk in certain industries and asset classes.","Average direct energy loans decreased $491 million or 19% and average multi-family loans decreased $239 million or 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Further, continued softness in demand and increasing competition for middle market small business loans has also impacted loan production. While there have been headwinds to business lending growth in 2016, we continue to expect low single digit average loan growth in 2017. Areas within business lending expected to contribute to this growth include, technology and defense, healthcare, power and utilities and asset-based lending.","We will start with deposits. Total average deposit balances increased $561 million from the previous quarter and $1 billion year-over-year. Average low cost deposits increased $503 million and $1.3 billion over the same respective periods. Deposit costs remain near historically low levels at 13 basis points and total funding costs remain low totaling 30 basis points in the quarter. Total average deposits in the consumer segment were up $452 million or 1% in the quarter and $2.7 billion or 5% year-over-year. This growth reflects the unique strength of our retail franchise, the overall health of the consumer and our ability to grow low-cost deposits.","Average corporate segment deposits increased $437 million or 2% during the quarter and $1.2 billion or 4% year-over-year as corporate customers remain focused on liquidity. Average deposits in the wealth management segment decreased $398 million or 4% during the quarter and $2.3 billion or 18% year-over-year. Certain institutional and corporate trust customer deposits which require collateralization by securities continue to shift out of deposits and into other fee income producing customer investments.","So let's look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable basis was $874 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $18 million or 2% from the third quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.1, 6%, an increase of 10 basis points. Both net interest margin and net interest income and other financing income benefited from several factors during the quarter, including higher interest rates, lower premium amortization on investment securities, a leveraged lease residual value adjustment incurred in the third quarter that did not repeat and higher security balances. These increases were partially offset by lower loan balances. Net interest margin also benefited from lower average cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.","The increase in interest rates during the quarter reduced the amount of premium amortization on mortgage-related securities to $43 million from $49 million and premium amortization is expected to decline further in the first quarter of 2017. Now, if interest rates remain at current levels or continue to rise, we would expect the benefit from marginal declines in premium amortization ultimately achieving the quarterly run rate in the low to mid $30 million range in 2017.","Non-interest income decreased 13% in the quarter primarily due to insurance proceeds related to the FHA settlement recognized in the third quarter. Non-interest income increased $8 million or 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted non-interest income decreased 6% in the quarter, but increased 2% year-over-year. Service charges increased 4% in the quarter. However, this growth was more than offset by declines in capital markets, wealth management, mortgage and other non-interest income.","Following a record third quarter, capital markets income decreased $11 million or 26% during the quarter, driven primarily by lower merger and acquisition advisory services. Capital markets income increased $3 million or 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 driven by increased debt underwriting activity. Also coming off a record third quarter, wealth management income decreased $4 million or 4% as lower insurance and investment services income were only partially offset by higher investment management trust fees. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, wealth management income increased $3 million or 3% as growth in investment management trust fees exceeded the decline in investment services while insurance income was unchanged.","Mortgage income decreased $3 million or 7% driven by a seasonally lower production, partially offset by increases in the market valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity. Within total mortgage production, 59% was related to purchase activity and 41% was related to refinancing. Mortgage income increased 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to increased gains associated with a 29% increase in production.","Also during the quarter, we completed another bulk purchase of the rights to service approximately $2.2 billion of mortgage loans. This brings our total purchases from 2016 to approximately $8.1 billion and our mortgage servicing portfolio has increased $6 billion to $45 billion. Mortgage servicing income increased $5 million or 6% in 2016 compared to 2015. We still have capacity and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to grow our servicing portfolio.","And finally, other non-interest income declined during the quarter as the company recognized a recovery during the third quarter of approximately $10 million related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, which did not repeat this quarter.","So let's talk about expenses. Total non-interest expenses decreased 4% during the quarter. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $877 million also representing a 4% decrease quarter-over-quarter reflecting the results of our efficiency initiatives. Total salaries and benefits decreased $14 million from the third quarter, primarily due to a decline in base salaries associated with one less weekday, the impact of staffing reductions and lower production base incentives related to decreased capital markets and commercial banking production. Staffing levels continued to decline during the quarter and decreased 5% or over 1,200 positions in 2016 as we execute on our efficiency initiatives.","Professional and legal expenses decreased $3 million during the quarter primarily due to lower litigation-related costs. We also recognized an $11 million linked quarter benefit associated with credit for unfunded commitments. And finally, recall there was an $11 million expense in the third quarter associated with Visa Class B shares that did not repeat in the fourth quarter.","The fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 63.2% and as Grayson mentioned we remain committed to achieving our expense elimination plans and our long-term target to an adjusted efficiency ratio below 60% by 2018.","The company's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 was 31.2% and 30.7% respectively and the effective tax rate is expected to be in the 30% to 32% range for the full year 2017.","Let's move on to asset quality. Net charge-offs totaled $83 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $29 million from the third quarter and represented 41 basis points of average loans. Charge-offs related to our direct energy portfolio totaled $14 million in the quarter. The provision for loan losses was $35 million less in net charge-offs and our allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans decreased three basis points to 1.36%. The allowance for loan and lease losses associated with the direct energy loan portfolio decreased to 7% in the fourth quarter compared to 7.9% in the third quarter, which reflects continued improvement in credit quality of the energy book and our exposure to direct energy continued to decline ending the year at 2.6% of total loans outstanding.","Total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased nine basis points to 1.24% of loans outstanding and total business services criticized loans decreased 3%. The improvement in business services criticized loans was primarily due to declines in energy and energy-related credits. The improvement in non-accrual loans was driven by declines in non-energy commercial loans. Troubled debt restructured loans increased 5% in the quarter primarily due to increases in indirect energy credits. Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non-accrual loans or coverage ratio was 110% at quarter end. Excluding energy, the coverage ratio increased from 123% to 138% in the fourth quarter. Direct energy charge-offs totaled $37 million in 2016 and are expected to be less than $40 million in 2017 given current market conditions.","Now under a stress scenario with oil averaging below $25 per barrel, incremental losses could total $100 million over the next eight quarters. We are encouraged by the performance of our energy portfolio to-date. However, we will continue to monitor and manage it closely. Given where we are in the credit cycle and considering fluctuating commodity prices, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to larger dollar commercial credits.","Let's talk about capital liquidity. As Grayson mentioned, we returned $1.2 billion of our 2016 earnings to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases. At the same time, our capital ratios remain robust. Under Basel III, the Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.9% and the common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.1%. On a fully phased-in basis, common equity Tier 1 was estimated at 11% and we were also fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule at the end of the year and our liquidity position remains solid with a historically low loan deposit ratio of 81%.","So as we look ahead in terms of 2017, the targets that we laid out are as follows. We expect full year average loans and average deposits to grow in the low single digits. Our expectation for net interest income and other financing income growth is in the 2% to 4% range. And our adjusted non-interest income is expected to grow 3% to 5%. From expense standpoint, total adjusted non-interest expenses in 2017 are expected to increase between zero and 1% and we expect to achieve a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of approximately 62% with positive adjusted operating leverage in the 2% to 4% range. From a credit standpoint, full year net charge-offs are expected to be 35 to 50 basis points.","So in closing, our solid 2016 results reflect the successful execution of our strategic plan and our commitment to our three primary strategic initiatives which are growing and diversifying our revenue streams, practicing disciplined expense management and effectively deploying our capital. We are pleased to end the year on a positive note and believe we have the right team and the right strategy to deliver and create further shareholder value in 2017.","With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning and I will turn the call back over to Dana for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Dana Nolan","Thank you, David. Before we begin the Q&A, as a courtesy to others, please limit your questions to one primary question and one follow-up. We will now open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo.","Grayson Hall","Good morning Matt","Matt Burnell","Good morning Grayson. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned a couple of times, the momentum in the commercial side of the business. And I want to focus a little bit on the small and medium size borrowers. And obviously the competition there has been very, very intense, but do you sense a greater level of optimism from your customers that might increase their desire to borrow over the next year or two presuming we get a little bit of benefit in the economy? And then I have a bigger picture question for my follow up.","Grayson Hall","Absolutely. I will make a few comments and then I will ask John Turner who manages that part of business for us to make his comments as well. Absolutely, we are seeing anecdotally in our conversations with our customers a lot more confidence and a lot more optimism about what the future would hold. And we continue to believe that at some point that turns in to more business activity than we have seen thus far.","But that being said, we are still not seeing that enthusiasm turn into actual lending activity. Line utilization is still not showing signs of that enthusiasm turning into activity nor are we seeing applications of credits do that. But having said that, I can't underscore enough the amount of optimism we hear in the voices of our customers. But I think it's going to take some time yet for that to result in a lot of economic activity.","John, if you would?","John Turner","Yes. Thanks Grayson. I just would add and reiterate, we are hearing a more positive outlook from our customers, but we are not seeing that translate into new opportunities yet. Pipelines are up a little. Line utilization is down about 90 basis points in the quarter. We are having meaningful conversations with customers, but none of that has yet resulted in their desire to increase business fixed investment, which ultimately is what we need to see growth.","Matt Burnell","That's okay. Thanks.","Grayson Hall","You have a follow-up question.","Matt Burnell","Yes. My question really relates to the deposit rates which actually went down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, which was a little bit better than we have seen at some of your competitors. Do you attribute that to just the location of your franchise? Or is there something else going on there? And then maybe an update on your thinking of deposit beta as rates rise and where you are now relative to sort of your longer-term assumptions?","Grayson Hall","Well, I think Matt, when you look at our franchise, the real competitive advantage we have is really as a deposit gathering franchise. That's where the real value of our bank is at. And if you look at our deposit portfolio, it's a very granular portfolio and about 50% of that portfolio is located in smaller community markets and if you look at our thoughts and our forecast, you see a very conservative beta forecast for interest rate increases.","Candidly, the environment we are coming from right now, we have never seen before. So this is new coming from this interest rate environment to start to increase. We are optimistic that our deposit betas will provide an advantage for us and thus far, as you mentioned, our deposit costs has remained relatively low. I think we are up one basis point quarter-over-quarter. So we think we have done a very good job actually growing deposits in the face of that activity.","David, you might ay want to add to that.","David Turner","Yes. It's a great question, Matt, because as Grayson mentioned, this is really our competitive advantage that we have been waiting to see come through in our income statement. As Grayson mentioned, the deposit make up that we have really resulted in last upcycle. We have one of the lower betas than any other peers. I think we are internally at about 54%, was our beta. Perhaps it will be higher because we are at historical lows and so we model a 60% beta as the terminal value. But we start sow in that 40% range and we think that's really going to be important.","Deposit rates, we think the faster rates increase from the Fed, the more pressure there will be. But what's happened thus far, as we haven't had nor have many in the industry had to pass much through to deposit holders because we have had increases one-off. So we are looking forward to dealing with that. We have great liquidity and a great stable funding base that we think can create value for our shareholders in 2017 and beyond.","Matt Burnell","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James.","Grayson Hall","Good morning Michael.","Michael Rose","Hi. Good morning. Maybe just a question for David on the margins. I am sorry if I missed this. But can you quantify the impact of premium amortization on the margin this quarter? And then maybe just some greater context as to what your forecast includes? Does it include a couple of rate hikes, I assume? And what would it look like if we didn't get any rate hikes? Thanks.","David Turner","Yes. So you saw our change in premium amortization early on. It was about a point difference on that in terms of margin. Clearly, the increase in rates was a big driver for us and that is not just the Fed move really LIBOR starting to move in advance of that as well as the tenure. So that's very helpful to us as our sensitivity continues to be on the longer end. Today the short end is probably 42% of our sensitivity and 58% in the middle to the back end.","So as we think about increases for this next year, we are closer to where the market is right now, which was having a rate increase sometime in the summer and maybe one towards the back end of the year. We realized what Chair Yellen said the other day with regards to supporting the dot plots and perhaps there is an incremental increase baked into that. But we don't forecast that. If we get that, then that's better for us, but our guidance that we just laid out really shows that increase sometime in the summer and then towards back end of the fourth quarter.","Michael Rose","Okay. That's helpful. Maybe as my follow-up, if you can just give some color on some of the major fee income businesses, given the guide? I know capital markets was down, I guess greater than I expected sequentially. And maybe if you can just give the outlook for some of the businesses for this year? Thanks.","David Turner","Yes. So we have a good story for non-interest income. Clearly, there's a lot of seasonality that hits that space. You can see that manifest throughout the industry. Same thing for us. In particular, we came off a lot of really strong third quarter in a number of areas, capital markets and wealth management. We believe those rebound and that's why we have our guidance for non-interest revenue growth of 3% to 5% next year. We went into this year with a 4% to 6% expectation. We ended up growing 7%. So we feel confident about our ability to grow in that 3% to 5% range. It will be a contribution from all those line items that you have seen in the past, as we continue to just grow customers and continue to build out certain of our new platforms like BlackArch Partners.","Michael Rose","That's great color. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Grayson Hall","Good morning Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. How are you?","Grayson Hall","Doing well.","Betsy Graseck","Great. I had a couple of questions. One was on the progress around the capital markets, investments that you are doing in the treasury management investments. I was wondering how you think those are going to come through as you go through 2017?","John Turner","Betsy, this is John Turner. I would say we are very pleased with the investments we have made. Capital markets revenue was up 44% last year in 2016. We did see obviously some decline in the fourth quarter, but that business is going to be uneven. The M&A advisory fee income that we enjoyed was more front end loaded into the second and third quarter. And as we look forward to 2017, we face some headwinds in a few of our newer initiatives like the low income housing tax credit platform that we acquired, CMBS platform that we have established. The conditions in the market aren't great for those today, but we think they will ultimately work themselves out. We feel very good about the initiatives and the investments and expect to continue to grow capital markets revenue and treasury management revenue in 2017 at a pretty good pace.","Betsy Graseck","I mean the rising rate environment should be good for treasury management, I would expect?","John Turner","It will be and remember that if you look at our deposit growth, we grew deposits by over $1.2 billion in the corporate bank and that's really a reflection of our focus on relationships, building broader and deeper relationships with our customers and winning more treasury management business than we have in the past. And so I think you will continue to see that growth.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks. And then just second question on the cost save initiatives that you have been very clear about, the targets. Could you give us a sense as to how the efficiency will drop to the bottom line as you go through the year? Is there any kind of trajectory that we should expect? Is there back-end loaded or what?","John Turner","Yes. I think if you look at rates, if the rate curve will hold you will start seeing even a better improvement as we get towards end of the year. We should start out having a pretty decent efficiency ratio contribution to that 62% that I talked to you about. But it gets even better at we get to the back end of the year.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.","Grayson Hall","Good morning John.","John Pancari","Good morning. Grayson, if you could just talk a little bit about the fact that you have gotten the satisfactory rating on the CRA, as you mentioned. Does that pave the way for you to consider acquisitions again? And if so, can you give us your updated appetite for whole bank deals and then non-bank deals? Thanks.","Grayson Hall","John, I mean I think, first of all, we are very pleased to get our CRA rating reinstated back to satisfactory. The team here worked very hard to accommodate that. And so it's indicative of way we do business and the way we try to help our customers and all the communities we operate in. So very encouraged by that turn of events.","What does that mean for us? We are very focused on organic growth. We are very focused on optimizing our distribution channels. You saw in 2016 that we invested in all of our channels, our online banking, our mobile banking, our contact centers, our ATMs and our branches. We had a number of consolidations in 2016 and opened relatively few branches in 2016.","You can see that, but at the same time, we invested a tremendous amount of technology into those branches and changed our delivery format in a number of those offices to be more efficient and more effective. You will see us continue to do that. We think that it's an important and critical part of our franchise value and we think all of our distribution channels are important. The branch still has an awful lot of relevance and it is still the predominant channel that customer choose to open new accounts with us.","So our primary focus is organic growth. When it comes to acquisition opportunities, we are very sensitive to what's going on in the market. We have a team inside the bank. It spends an awful lot of time monitoring markets and what's going on there. We look for opportunities to invest through acquisition. You saw last year that that was predominantly done through non-bank bolt-on acquisitions which has been predominantly our interest. We look at whole bank deals quite candidly. Where valuations are at right now, I think some of the economics of that we find challenging, but there may be opportunities for that.","We are watching but our primary focus is on growing organically. So we will watch and see where the market goes, but at this particular point in time, we saw most of our opportunities in growing organically, in growing in non-bank bolt-on acquisitions and we are monitoring whole bank acquisition opportunities. Right now that market seems to be improving, but I think it's early yet.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Thanks. And then separately, I know you have mentioned that you are focusing increasingly on risk-adjusted returns and that, to a degree, has impacted your loan growth in the quarter and possibly your outlook. So I guess if you could just talk a little bit more about identifying those exact areas, exact portfolios where you are deliberately deemphasizing production as you are focusing on the risk-adjusted returns? Thanks.","Grayson Hall","First of all, we recognize we are in a cyclical business and we have to be mindful of that as we establish our risk appetite across different lending segments and we spend an awful lot of time trying to adjust our risk appetite. It is based on where we think we are in the cycle of all of those different lending categories. We have signaled to you that we have throttled back on indirect auto. We throttled back to investor real estate construction. We have throttled back on multifamily, to a certain degree. But we are still in those businesses, still lending in those businesses and obviously the one business that we have been most cautious in is energy for apparent reasons. But we still are in all of these businesses.","We are just being more thoughtful and more careful given where we are at in the cycle of that. But we also spend an awful lot of time on both business that we win and business that we lose. We compete in a lot of different markets against very large financial institutions and small community banks as well. And there is an awful lot of competition there and we are trying to be very thoughtful about what type of transactions we will do, what kind of risk adjusted return we can achieve in those and I think in this market, we are able to grow our business in asset classes that we think make a lot of sense.","As David said, we believe for 2017, we will grow in the low single digits. But that is growing faster than that in sub-segments while constraining growth in some of the other segments. I think most of this discussion centers around some of our commercial lending activities. I will ask John Turner to make a few comments as well.","John Turner","John, I think we have talked about, as an example, our focus on risk-adjusted returns in our shared national credit book and we have spent a lot of time there this year as a result of what we will refer to as recycling activity where we have exited some relationships and entered new ones. We have seen the level of credit only shared national credits come down by about 16%. The revenues that we are generating per relationship in those newer relationships go up by 35%. They generate over 100% more non-interest revenue and the risk-adjusted returns are 220 basis points greater than those relationships that we exited.","In addition to that, I talked about deposit growth. We saw fee income growth in the business and the overall risk adjusted return on the corporate banking business here at Regions inclusive of all three businesses is up 160 basis points year-over-year. And at the same time, we think we have a better quality loan portfolio as we are de-risking the business and adding better risk and getting an appropriate return. We think that our commitment to profitable growth and appropriate returns is paying off and we will continue to see that in the coming quarters.","John Pancari","Got it. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein.","Grayson Hall","John, good morning.","John McDonald","Hi. Good morning guys. David, I wanted to follow up on the net interest income margin question. Is there a rule of thumb that we can use, in terms of as we try to model Fed hikes for you guys, how much each Fed hike of 25 basis points adds to net interest margin? Any rough rule of thumb there?","David Turner","Well, we have tried to give you the parallel shift of 100 basis points, it's about $160 million right now and then we are 42% on the short end of that. If you do some quick math, depending on beta assumption you want to use, you are talking about $15 million, maybe $20 million on an annual basis. And again deposit beta assumption makes a difference.","John McDonald","Okay. That's helpful. And then just following up on the efficiency, the target this year, the 62%, At a conference in December you guys laid out longer term kind of sub-60% and I think you said by 2018. Is that the right way to think about, that you could go from 62% to 60% by the end of 2018? Does that imply a real ramp up in the expense saves next year?","David Turner","Well, so we can get to the 60s. That's our commitment by the end of 2018, kind of on a run rate basis there. So you will see us continuing to chip away at it each and every quarter through 2018 so that by the time we get we are hitting the 60% and below target that we laid out. And then by the time we get there, we will reassess and give you our new target because over time we think we will be even south of that. But let's get to the below 60% first and we will reestablish that.","John McDonald","Okay. Fair enough.","Operator","We will proceed to the next question which comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Grayson Hall","Hello Geoffrey.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. It looks like there was quite a bit of strength in service charges this quarter. I wondered if you could elaborate on what happened there?","David Turner","Yes. I am not sure what you are looking at from a stress standpoint. Service charges continued to be fairly strong for us.","Geoffrey Elliott","No, I said strengths, not stress.","David Turner","I am sorry. We heard stress. Okay.","Geoffrey Elliott","Maybe it's the British accent or something.","David Turner","Sorry. What's really strong, we have such a strong retail network, continuing to grow customers is important and you are seeing that manifest itself in service charges. We have also had increases in customers on the commercial side as well. So if you look at year-over-year, we are kind of flat, but we were overcoming obstacles last year on posting order and we expect service charge to continue to be robust in 2017.","Grayson Hall","No. We thought we have done a really good job in our consumer bank. And if you look at growth metrics across accounts and account activity and the quality of the accounts we are placing on our books, we continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making. And as we do that, it really improve the number of revenue streams.","Geoffrey Elliott","And if the economy strengthens, how does that impact this? Do people make less use of overdraft if they are feeling better off? Or the dynamics is kind of more complex?","David Turner","From my perspective, there is certain people that's what happens and these aren't all overdrafts, by the way. These are core service charges that are monthly maintenance fees and those things. So stronger economy, we don't think would do anything but help that. It is really the customer growth that we continue to have that we think is most impactful to that line item and the more robust economy where the outreach that we want to do to continue to expand the franchise and grow relationships, we think that could be a positive for us in 2017.","Grayson Hall","Yes. And what we have seen, when you look at the consumer base, we really have started really shift in the mix of fee income in our consumer book towards more around activity based, in particular on debit cards and credit cards and less reliance on overdraft activity. And as you look at our checking account features, we have introduced a number of new products that give customers more assurance, more safety. They transact the business in the correct way and so we feel real good about our offerings. We feel good about our growth and we think 2017, you will continue to see this sort of pace and momentum that we have really started generating in 2016.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Grayson Hall","Good morning.","Ken Usdin","Dave, I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about just total balance sheet size. I think we understand the expectation for loan and deposit growth. You guys have been at a pretty comfortable level of securities and it sounded like you did a little bit more remixing. So is it fair to say that you are comfortable at kind of that this level of earning assets? Or what would drive the total size of the balance sheet from here unless you started to just take on some wholesale funding?","David Turner","Yes. It's a great question, Ken. Part of what we did this year is, we were looking at certain of our deposit products. We talked about the collateralized deposits that were in our wealth management group. Those weren't providing virtually any liquidity value for us and certain of those were more expensive. And so we decided that we would move those out of the bank. And so if you look at deposit balances, you really need to go through the supplemental page 22 and see what the make up is because we had good deposit growth in consumer and in business services over the corporate bank segment.","As we think about next year, low single digit growth relative to loans and deposits. We think earning assets can grow in that 2% range. And we know that didn't happen this year, but we think that that can happen as we go through 2017.","Ken Usdin","Okay. I have got it. And would that increment be then, but you did issue a bunch more debt in the fourth quarter, would that be also funded by more debt issuance this year?","David Turner","Yes. Those were really FHLB advances and what we are expecting our continued deposit growth to fund our activities on the left side of balance sheet.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And just one follow-up on the securities portfolio. Outside of the premium amortization help to securities yields, I am just wondering how close are you to kind of getting to that back book, front book in terms of just new yields on new purchases versus what's rolling off the book?","David Turner","Yes. So we have talked about where things settle down a little bit on premium amortization being closer to that treasury yield of 275 and that we would settle on premium amortization. Premium amortization will settle in that mid $30 million range, but going on today, it is about to 250 in terms of the mortgage backed as corporates are about a point higher than that.","And so we continue to see further benefit from rising rates on that portfolio primarily through the slowing down of premium amortization.","Ken Usdin","Okay.","David Turner","So the new securities that we are putting on are accretive to our cause.","Ken Usdin","Right. Outside of the premium benefit, they are now accretive to the underlying.","David Turner","That's right.","Ken Usdin","Okay. I got it. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Grayson Hall","Good morning Matt.","Rob Hansen","Hi guys. This is Rob from Matt's team. Just had a follow-up on your outlook for commercial loan growth. I was just curious, how much additional balance reductions we should expect in those specific commercial segments such as energy and multi-family? Or you guys just about done at this point in terms of balance reduction there?","John Turner","This is John Turner again. I would say that we expect the run-off in energy to begin to moderate. We will certainly have some continued paydowns as some of the problem credits work themselves out. But there is good stability in that marketplace. We are seeing asset sales occur. We are seeing opportunities, though limited thus far, to potentially lend into the space. And we did actually make two new E&P loans in 2016, one toward the end of the year. So I think we will see runoff moderate.","With respect to multi-family, remember we are trying to change our mix of business from being primarily construction oriented to a better mix of construction and term and we can't match the timing. And so what we are seeing is run-off in the construction book as our term lending initiative is getting some traction and so we have had more run off in that portfolio than we anticipated. At some point it will bottom out and begin to grow as the term loan initiative picks up. And again, we are projecting 2% to 4% loan growth in 2017.","We think that will come in some measure from our specialized lending groups where we can lean into the expertise that we have in technology, defense and healthcare and power and utilities as an example. And also within our Regions business capital croup, where we think we have an awfully good level of expertise and opportunity to grow our business.","Rob Hansen","Okay. Thanks. And just separately on the net interest margin. Any color on where you see the consolidated NIM coming in for 1Q? I know you have some benefit from premium AM, but any other puts and takes? Will you see additional benefit from the December rate hike this quarter as well?","David Turner","Yes. This is David. From a NIM standpoint, we still will get the benefit of lower rates now for the full quarter, which we think will be meaningful and we will pick up a couple of points with lower premium amortization as well. But don't dismiss the impact of two less days in the quarter, which actually is accretive to the NIM and that will be two to three points in and of itself. So as you think about where we might be in the first quarter, we could be up in that low to 3.20%, in the low 3.20s then and continuing to improve, if the rate environment will hold, if it were to improve from there towards the fourth quarter.","Rob Hansen","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Marsh from FBR.","Steve Marsh","Good morning. I was wondering on capital deployment here. Maybe just give us a little more color as to what you think about how aggressive you could be for your 2017 CCAR ask.","David Turner","So we go through a very deliberate thoughtful process on capital deployment. You saw that this past year where we returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders, which was more than our earnings at the end of the day. We will continue to -- it's important for us to get our capital optimized. One of our key metrics that we talk about is getting to that 12% to 14% return on tangible common equity in 2018 and to do that we have to have an optimal size of capital for the risk attendant in our balance sheet.","And so, clearly, we have had a challenge of that capital base being strong as it is where loans were this past year. So we will be evaluating that in our submission and I think we learned a few things through other submissions this past year on others that had capital returns in excess of 100% of earnings. And I think that we will make a prudent decision.","Again, our primary focus is to ensure, first and foremost, that we have the right amount of capital to run the company. And then that excess capital, we need to use that appropriately. Grayson talk about organic growth, the bolt-on acquisitions and when those don't use up the capital base, returning it to the shareholders is the right thing to do and we will continue to do that through our planning.","Grayson Hall","But again, I would just reiterate that our primary desire is to be able to use the capital we generate to grow our business and serve our customers organically and as we use our team internally to put together our capital plan this year for approval by our Board. A lot of what we decide to do will be based on our outlook that we have for potential organic growth. And if we, depending on our outlook, it will drive really what we do to deploy capital otherwise.","Steve Marsh","Okay. And then my follow-up question with regard to your loan loss reserve ratio. It's been coming down last couple of quarters. I am kind of wondering where you think you could fill out by year-end?","Barbara Godin","This is Barbara Godin. Again, as you know we go through a very thoughtful process on setting the reserve for loan losses. As we continue to see the energy portfolio improve, I would say you will also continue to see some improvement in that level of reserve. I will reiterate what I said in the past, I never see it going back down to that 1% level. At some point, it will probably bottom out somewhere in that 1.25% or so.","Steve Marsh","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Saul Martinez of UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your branch rationalization strategy, especially in the context of what is your competitive strength, your low-cost funding. It's a pretty sizable reduction and your branch footprint is probably more geared, on average, in lesser competitive markets that obviously gives you a very strong low-cost funding. But when you think about your branch rationalization strategy, where you cut, how do you think about that? What are some of the variables you look at? And how do you ensure you are not cutting into your strengths? And I guess as an adjunct to that, how should we think about the economic benefit you get from the branch closures, the 150 branches or so? Is there a way to systematically think about how that flows through to your bottom line?","Grayson Hall","Well, first, it's a very thoughtful data driven process because we are looking at all of our markets, how each branch is performing, where their transaction activity in that branch is growing or declining. You hear a lot of institutions talk about average growth rates, average decline rates of transactions. Those averages can be very deceptive, because we have branches where transactions continue to grow year-after-year. But what we have done is try to take a very facts based data driven process to determine where we have opportunities to not only consolidate offices, but to serve our customers even better.","And so we look very closely at proximity of our branch offices to where our customers live and work. We spend an awful lot of time making sure that we do this the right way. We believe the branches are still very relevant. We still believe that there is opportunities to rationalize that particular distribution channel. But we have to be careful in how it fits in with all of our other channels and make sure that at the end of the day we are still able to attract and retain and service customers with excellence.","So John, all of these branches report to you. If you would sort of speak to that?","John Turner","Sure Grayson. Just to kind of level set, if you step back for a minute, we peaked about 10 years ago in 2007 with 2,127 branches. We are down 600 branches. We are down 28%, which is really more than anybody else in the industry. A couple of drivers there. You talked about proximity and things like that. That is a big part of it.","The other part of it is, we have made a lot of investments in mobile and online banking and really driving those transactions out of the branches into what I will call service transaction. So check your balance, make a deposit, move money around, pay bills. So a lot of those things have been moved really out of the branches and moved to the mobile and online banking platform.","The other comment I would make is, we have done a lot of work around, what we call, universal banker. And universal banker really has helped us from a productivity standpoint by allowing us to have staffing at reduced levels in our branches. I would tell you, for 2016 between our 130 branch consolidations and our universal banker strategy, we reduced about 800 positions just resulting from those two items. So it really is a balance.","So we take a balanced approach around what we are doing in mobile and online, what we are doing with our DepositSmart ATM strategy, what we are doing with our virtual terminal strategy and also consolidations. I will tell you over the next, probably a year or two, you will see consolidations outpace any building. So our net branch count will go down from the 1,527 level today. We will probably be in that, I would say, 1,480 to 1,500 range. But again these branches are very important as part of our strategy.","David Turner","This is David. I will add one thing for your last part of your question is that when we look at this from an economic standpoint, we consolidate a branch, we are going to lose some revenue. So the goal is to take out more cost than any revenue that you might lose. And for us, we target about a two year payback and when we consolidate these branches thus far, the wave that we have had, the 103 this year, once last year, been slightly less than the two year payback. So we feel very good about how they are paying for themselves. And it's a part of our expense initiatives as well.","Grayson Hall","The other point I would make, even though we have less branches, our account growth is up. We are growing our account base in checking accounts in that 1.7%, 2% range. Our Now Banking growth is up in that 30% to 40% range. Credit card growth is over 10%, 11% range. So we are seeing strong growth in spite of the fact that we have less physical stores. Our revenue per branch is up also.","Saul Martinez","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And if I could just follow up on loan growth. You are assuming in your 2017 guidance 2% to 2.5% real GDP growth. How do you think about the potential upside to that number? It may not in 2017 looking, but looking out late 2017, into 2018, if we do get a bit better economic growth environment, I assume it's not a linear relationship, risk appetite might move up, animal spirits and whatnot. But how do you think about the potential upside if the environment really does improve?","Grayson Hall","Well, I mean it's hard to put a number around, right. But we are optimistic that as we look forward that there may be considerable upside to our forecast. What we are trying to do is to balance our emotions between what we know is going on today, what we know we can deliver and what we hope the future may hold for us. So there is awful lot of enthusiasm, a lot of people that are appearing to get more courage to invest, more courage to expand, but we still are trying to balance that in our markets. It's a great turn of emotions in our marketplace. We really are excited about what the potential upside might be.","That being said, at the end of the day, from a forecast standpoint, we still have got to forecast what we know we can deliver. And so we are trying to balance that as I am sure you are. I am not use there is a solid answer to your question, but I do believe that there is a potential for considerable upside.","David Turner","I think your point though, in terms of 2017, it's just probably, a lot of this has to manifest itself in 2017 for the effect to take in 2018 and 2019. So I think we have a lot to learn here over the coming months to see what the administration really does.","Grayson Hall","We think as you think about our business, the commercial and middle market, small business customer represents about 25 percent, give or take, of the bank's profitability and that customer has not been borrowing for years. And so if we began to see a little extra pickup in the economy, particularly amongst the middle market customers, by small business customers, I think there is lot of upside for our company. Absolutely.","Saul Martinez","That's good color. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.","Grayson Hall","Hi Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Good afternoon guys. Thank you. David, can we go back to the capital question? You talked about with this year's CCAR that you are always going to want to keep the right amount of capital to run your business and I think in the past you may have used a 9% number. Is that still an appropriate number for the risks on the balance sheet?","David Turner","Yes. It's a good question, Gerard. We use 9.5% common equity Tier 1 as kind of the range that we think we ought to have based on today's risk. We are obviously looking at different portfolios and we have de-risked a little bit. And as we do that, that number can go down. We also have added portfolios that have more risk to them that go the other way. But right now, we think 9.5% is probably a good target.","Gerard Cassidy","Good. And then I think you also referenced in talking about this that you are looking at what other banks have done in terms of the ask in CCAR possibly going over 100% of earnings. With the proposed change for the under $250 billion in asset banks not having to go through the qualitative portion of the exam, does that give you more confidence to ask for a bigger number in view of what some of the banks did last year, but now with this change as well?","David Turner","Well, certainly the removal of the qualitative aspect of this CCAR is incrementally helpful, but it's not a free pass. The regulatory supervisor will still engage very closely with our capital planning and governance processes. It just happens at a different time of the year. It will most likely happen in the third and fourth quarters as we prepare for an April delivery each year.","Now this year is a transition year. So we will take some time, but not having the qualitative aspects and being able to leverage the models that we have built that have been reviewed over a number of years, it's where we get our confidence. We need to run our bank with the idea of what capital we think and our Board thinks we need to have. We know we are regulated and we have to evaluate that too, but the regulators aren't looking for us to try to out-guess them.","They are trying to get us to run our bank appropriately and that's why we feel confident about being able to get our capital down to that 9.5% common equity Tier 1 over time in a prudent manner. And so we are going to march in that direction, the pace of which is going to be determined through further analysis, but that is really important for us to get to that 9.5% as we set our goal on return on tangible common of 12% to 14%. What's embedded in that is getting our capital optimized and rightsized.","Grayson Hall","But the capital planning process has made constructive progress every year and we look at how the process has changed from last year to this year and we think it's been very constructive. It gives us more certainty. It give us more confidence. And I think that we have really developed a very rigorous, very disciplined capital planning process inside our company and we have got a lot of confidence that we can do the appropriate things given the risk on our balance sheet. So we continue to build confidence around our ability to manage capital.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then just as a follow-up, you guys have done a very good job in closing down branches and in your answers today some good analysis of how you look at it. Have you taken into account for this the upcoming year in the branch closures that in a rising rate environment deposit behavior may be different? And what that affect your modeling on your payback? I think David you mentioned it's two years or less than two year. Have you factored that into the equation yet?","David Turner","Well, a couple of things on that. We have and we try to anticipate deposit behavior. A couple of things that are happening. One, we have a loan deposit ratio of 81%. So we are in pretty good position there from a liquidity standpoint in a relationship bank has mattered and will matter going forward. We also recognize the TLAC from the larger players that cause them to have a different liquidity profile than they otherwise would have had and therefore perhaps a competition regarding deposits, especially in a one low single digit, 2% to 3% loan growth mode that put as much pressure on deposits and deposit rates. The growing, making investments that we want to, John talked about the retail network strategy of getting in some of the major metros and being able to be in places where we can grow deposits is really important to us in 2017 and beyond.","Grayson Hall","But if you look at 2016 and even prior to that, our strategy has been to remix our deposit portfolio to make it more granular, to make it less interest rate sensitive and most of our growth has come in low-cost deposits and we have also reduced our dependency on higher cost deposits and also our dependency on deposits that require collateralization. When you look at where we are at today, we have ran some limited exercises to try to better understand how much we would have to move rates to attract new deposits into the company and we think we have a pretty good handle on how customers are reacting in higher markets in a higher rate environment and continue to be hopeful that our deposit betas will outperform.","David Turner","Gerard, I will add one other thing. If you look at our supplement, on page 22 you will see our deposits broken out by consumer and corporate wealth management. You will see our wealth management, year-over-year, was down $2.2 billion and that's a decision we made that we weren't getting the kind of liquidity that we wanted. If we needed to, we could change our tune on that and we might have to pay up a little bit for deposits, but we have multiple avenues of funding and our liquidity position, in particular related to our securities portfolio and other assets that we can post up as collateral for the FHLB is very strong, which I think will bode well for us not having to chase these deposits. We will be unduly restrictive on our consolidation efforts.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you for the thorough answer. I appreciate it.","A -Grayson Hall","All right. Thank you. That was our last question. We appreciate everyone's attendance today and we will stand adjourned. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Paula and I will be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines have been placed on listen-only, at the end of the call there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Mr. List Underwood to begin.","M. List Underwood","Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. We appreciate your participation this morning on our call. Our presenters today are Grayson Hall, our Chief Executive Officer; David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of management are here and available to answer questions as appropriate. Also, as part of our call today, we\u2019ll be referencing a slide presentation that is available under the Investor Relations section of regions.com.","Finally, let me remind you that in this call, and potentially in the Q&A that follows, we may make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. For further details, please reference our forward-looking statement that is located in the appendix of the presentation.","With that said, I will turn it over to Grayson.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Good morning, we appreciate your interest in Regions and participation in our first quarter 2014 earnings call. Today, we reported earnings of $311 million or $0.22 per diluted share, a solid start to 2014. During the quarter we grew loans, we grew deposits and we grew a number of quality households, all while effectively managing expenses.","On an ending basis, total loans increased $1.1 billion over the previous quarter and $1.7 billion over the first quarter of last year. Total review and reviewed loan production was up 2% year-over-year. Importantly, loan growth was more broad-based across our product lines and across our margins. Business lending momentum continue, led by growth in commercial and industrial loans. After years of deliberately derisking investor real estate portfolio, we achieved linked quarter growth.","On the consumer side, loans continue to be impacted by the residential mortgage market in the first quarter. But were somewhat offset by the growing demand for automobile loans. In light of an improving, but still challenging economic backdrop, we remained focused on things that we can control such as provide a high quality customer service. in that reward we were recently recognized by the Temkin Group, as a top rated bank in the 2014 National Customer Experience ranking, scoring 10 points ahead of the banking industry average.","Our team members work hard everyday listening to our customers, in understanding and meeting their needs, which ultimately will result in a greater customer loyalty. We divide our markets across 16 states into 19 different areas. And in this quarter, we achieved net checking account and credit card growth in all areas.","In addition, we grew quality households in all areas including consumer, business and wealth management. By adhering to our strategy reset Regions' three equity to serving our customers, we were also deepening customer relationships. We want to be the first choice in our markets when it comes to beating customers financial needs, whether through quality customer service, superior competitive products or enhanced alternative delivery channels. As part of our efforts we further improved efficiency and better serve our customers we continue to rationalize our delivery channels with recent focus on our branch channel.","As you may recall, we consolidated a number of offices in the first quarter. While at the same time we invested in new technology and new service formats. We continue to look for opportunities to improve the customer experience at our branches with innovations and technologies. By adapting our delivery channels to how our customers want to bank, we will be able to meet more their needs delivered better value and enhance loyalty.","We remained committed to continuously enhancing our risk management infrastructure. It is the important part of our culture and it is essential to the strength and stability of the organization. As such our asset quality continue to improve and our balance sheet is strengthening. Our net charge-off ratio was 0.44% the lowest level since third quarter 2007. In addition our non-performing loans continue to decline.","We\u2019ve an ongoing and robust capital planning process that is designed to ensure the efficient use of capital while maintaining a long-term approach to capital allocation in distribution. During the first quarter, we were pleased to receive no objection to our planned capital actions from the Federal Reserve.","Our top priority capital deployment continued to be reinvesting our business to achieve organic growth followed by regional dividend payout and appropriate share repurchases. At some point we may consider strategic opportunities consistent with the companies risk tolerance.","To sum up, our first quarter\u2019s results reflected a solid start to 2014. We obviously still have plenty of work to do and we continue to successfully execute our business plans to create long-term value for our shareholders.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to David to discuss first quarter results in more detail. David?","David J. Turner Jr.","Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Since Grayson already covered kind of overall earnings, I\u2019ll jump right into the details. So let\u2019s start with loans. We achieved a solid quarter of growth with loans up $1.1 billion as any balances were $76 billion. Loan growth continues to be driven by business lending, which increased 2% from the end of last quarter.","A majority of this growth was attributable to commercial and industrial loans, which increased 4%. This was led by general industry with middle-market commercial lending across many of our market areas. In addition, we also achieved growth by our specialized industry and asset-based lending teams. And, furthermore, our commercial line utilization increased 170 basis points and commitments from new loans increased 2% to $39 million.","Investor real estate loans increased $242 million from the end of the fourth quarter, which marks the first time we achieved growth in this portfolio in over four years and this portfolio has been declining as a result of our de-risking efforts. This growth was primarily attributable to an increase in new home builder and multi-family projects, providing more opportunities to lend within the parameters of our risk appetite. And we expect modest growth in this portfolio over the remainder of this year.","Indirect dollar lending achieved another solid quarter of growth as we increased the average number of loans per dealer by 13%. Production increased 4% and loans increased $178 million or 6%. We expect this portfolio to grow as the demand for automobiles continues to rise and due to our efforts to increase pull-through rates from the dealers.","As expected, credit card balances declined following a seasonally high fourth quarter.","However, we achieved the highest level of sales for new credit cards, with sales up 14% in the first quarter. Also, we\u2019ve recently expanded our offering of credit cards to non-Regions customers residing within our geographic markets.","Our home equity portfolio declined linked quarter as the pace of customer deleveraging within the home equity lines of credit was only partially offset by the new production in the home equity loan product. This fixed rate home equity loan product continues to grow and balances increased 5% over the previous quarter. Looking ahead, based on what we know today and our economic forecast, we continue to expect 2014 loan growth to be in the 3% to 5% range.","Let\u2019s take a look at deposits. Average deposits increased $874 million or 1% from the fourth quarter and deposit mix continues to improve than the first quarter as low-cost deposits increased to 90% of total average deposits. Deposit costs remain at a historical level of 12 basis points and total funding costs declined to 33 basis points in the first quarter. We continue to expect 2014 deposit growth to be in 1% to 2% range.","Let\u2019s take a look at how it\u2019s impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $831 million, a decline of $15 million or 1.8% from the previous quarter. The decline was attributable to fewer days in the quarter and the impact of the low interest rate environment on loan yields. However, the net interest margin remained steady from the previous quarter at 3.26%, largely reflecting the offsetting impacts of higher tax balances and declines in premium amortization in our investment portfolio.","We remain asset sensitive and would expect to benefit from increases to both short-term and long-term rates, primarily due to our adjustable rate loan portfolios. Further increases in long-term rates would continue to benefit the margin, but at a somewhat reduced pace given the prepayment and premium amortization have already slowed considerably.","Recently, declines in deposit costs, liability management actions and increases in long-term rates off their mid-2013 lows, have more than offset margin pressure due to a continued low rate environment. These offsets, however, will have a lessened impact going forward. That said, with rates remaining at approximately their current level and with our expectation for balance sheet growth, we expect to maintain a relatively stable margin in 2014.","Let\u2019s move onto non-interest revenue. First quarter non-interest revenue was down $88 million from the previous quarter. However, as a reminder, the fourth quarter included benefits of $56 million related to leveraged lease terminations and the sale of investments and low-income housing that were not repeated at the same magnitude in the first quarter.","Services charges were down 7% linked quarter and were driven by lower seasonal trends and continued changes in customer behavior. As expected, mortgage income was lower linked quarter as production was down 22% and the mix of new mortgages continued to be driven by new home purchases.","Capital markets income declined in the first quarter to $13 million and was primarily attributable to a slowdown in demand for customer derivatives and loan syndications, which were seasonally high in the fourth quarter.","Our Wealth Management Group delivered strong results for the quarter. Revenue was up 6% over the last quarter, led by higher investment services fees, higher insurance commissions and solid increases in investment management and trust income. We continue to add high quality wealth investors, financial consultants and insurance brokers to help, uncover and meet the needs of our clients.","Let\u2019s take a look at expenses. Adjusted non-interest expenses totaled $846 million in the first quarter, down 4% linked quarter. The fourth quarter included a $58 million regulatory charge and $5 million of expense related to branch consolidations. Additionally, as you\u2019re all aware, last quarter we transferred $686 million of primarily accruing first lien residential mortgages classified as troubled debt restructurings to held for sale. We finalized to sell these loans during the first quarter and actual expenses were $35 million less than originally estimated.","Salaries and benefits declined $9 million or 2% linked quarter. In the first quarter payroll taxes were seasonably higher, but were more than offset by lower employee benefits and headcount. Staffing levels have declined from the end of last year due to branch consolidations and other efficiency initiatives.","Additionally, legal and professional fees declined $11 million or 24% from the previous quarter. And you may remember that last quarter we announced plans to consolidate 30 branches and incurred a $5 million related charge. An additional $6 million of expense was reported this quarter with respect to that effort related primarily to lease branches.","So overall, expenses remain a constant focus and internally receive a great deal of scrutiny. As a result, we continue to expect full year 2014 adjusted expenses to be lower than 2013 adjusted expenses. Let\u2019s do on the asset quality, we continue to make good progress in the first quarter as all our credit metrics improved. Net charge-offs totaled $82 million which represents 0.44% of average loans. This is the lowest net charge-off ratio, we have experienced since the third quarter of 2007.","The provision for loan losses was $2 million or $80 million less than net charge-offs. Our non-performing loans declined 1% linked-quarter and inflows of non-performing loans remain steady. At quarter end, our loan loss allowance to non-performing loans or coverage ratio was 118%. Notably, criticized and classifieds loans continued to decline, with commercial and investor real estate criticized and classified loans down 1% from the fourth quarter.","Additionally, total delinquencies decreased 9% linked-quarter. And based on what we know today, we expect favorable asset quality trends to continue. However, at this point of the cycle, volatility in certain metrics can be expected.","Let's take a look at our capital and liquidity. Our capital position remains strong as our estimated Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter stood at 11.9%. Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.4%, an increase of 20 basis points from the fourth quarter. We estimate our fully phased-in Basel III common ratio Tier 1 ratio to be 10.8%, well above the minimum threshold.","Liquidity at both the bank and holding company remains solid with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 81%. And lastly, based on our understanding of the proposed rule, Regions remain well-positioned to be fully compliant with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio. As Grayson mentioned we were pleased with our overall CCAR results and a Federal Reserve having no objection to our plan of capital actions. So in summary, we off to a good start in 2014, and importantly our first quarter results demonstrate that our focus on identifying and meeting more customer needs is generating steady and sustainable growth overtime.","Consistent with our Regions 360 approach, we believe that if we remain focused on our customers have an engaged work force and continue to make positive impact to our communities then ultimately we will drive long-term shareholder value.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","M. List Underwood","","Thank you, David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session. In order to accommodate as many participants as possible this morning, I would ask that each caller please limit yourself to one primary question and one related follow-up question. Let\u2019s open up the line now for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) You have a question from the line of Kevin St. Pierre of Sanford C. Bernstein.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","","Good morning Kevin.","Kevin St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","","Good morning Grayson. And it would appear with your current loan growth guidance and the current dividend and the share repurchase that's been approved, that capital will continue to grow this year, beyond that 11% Basel III Tier 1 common. And it looks like your total payout ratio is going to be in the 55% to 60% range. Do you anticipate if things go as planned, that you would get more aggressive with next year's CCAR? Or how should we think about that?","","David J. Turner Jr.","","Yes, Kevin this is David. So we put together our capital plan based on what we believe to be the right thing to do. We laid down our priorities just like we\u2019ve spoken about that a number of times of first, why do we use our capital to generate organic growth and to support our businesses, we believe that\u2019s what capital was given to us for and the generation of new capital should be used for organic growth. We also then want to get our dividend up some and more consistent with the peer group and you\u2019ve seen a movement there.","Our next priority is really use the capital in the business the smartest way we can and that includes transactions like growing portfolios. So we are acquiring a credit card portfolio. We\u2019ve looked at and continue to look at acquisition opportunities whether they be banks or non-banks when the market and the environments are right for that and when that does it, we don\u2019t use our capital for those items, just to return to the shareholder. So that the capital then continue to pile up on the balance sheet.","So we continue to look at it in that order and we constantly go through capital planning. We do this every quarter. This is not a CCAR exercise. We do it once a year, we do it every quarter and we\u2019ll make adjustments that is being appropriate.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Kevin this is Grayson, I would characterize our capital plan as either aggressive or conservative. We try to put together a plan that we believe is appropriate for the opportunities we see in the market to the extent that the economy outperforms our forecast or to the extent that some of the opportunities we believe that exist don\u2019t prove that, and we accumulate more capital than we had anticipated then we\u2019ll make a different, but also still an appropriate discussion for next year\u2019s capital plan. So as the economy matures and see what happens we adjust, but we are hopeful that we have some opportunities to deploy our capital effectively this year.","Kevin St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Thanks and just a related follow-up so, assuming at some point you are going to have some reasonable buffer over 7% to one common minimum so say 8%, 8.5%. Do you anticipate a time when you are able, I don\u2019t know if this is 2015, 2016 you are able to manage your capital ratios down with either a special dividend or some sort of payment total payout in excess of 100% or is this center, are we in a situation where you are growing or have to organically grow into those new ratios?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","","No I think the capital planning process improves each and every year. We are working on our processes continuously improving the quality of our data, quality of our models, quality of our forecast and as we build confidence internally and confidence externally, I think the opportunities to deploy our capital more effectively will occur naturally. We think we\u2019ve made the appropriate call this year on our capital plan and as things mature we\u2019ll adjust that call as appropriate. And I do think that to your point that things continue along the path our own, will continue to shrink that our capital position and be afforded opportunities to consider how we deploy that.","Kevin St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR.","Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","","Yes, thank you very much. On the loan growth, can you talk about, a little bit, what are you seeing from your customers? You talk very positively about continued loan growth. But what areas are you seeing the most interest, and what are your customers telling you?","","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Paul, let me sort of describe it this way I think, what\u2019s different this quarter from last quarter is that we saw more diversity of loan demand of both from a product perspective and from a geographic perspective, I would still say that on the commercial side of our balance sheet, we are still seeing more demand in the upper-end of the middle-market and in large corporate lending. There is still more demand there than elsewhere. The lower middle market and the small business customers still to a certain extent, still recovering. And the demand there is still softer than what you would hope at this part of the cycle.","On the consumer side, the consumer has strengthened quite nicely over the last several quarters and deleveraged. We see demand there in both as we mentioned in a moment ago in credit card and indirect auto lending and increases in home purchases in mortgage. We have seen a big shift in our mortgage production, production is down. The home purchase is actually up, we are probably at a mix of about 70% purchase and 30% refinance at this junction.","We are seeing that on the indirect auto side still a good growth. We are having obviously being much more discipline from a credit perspective in that space. But still see opportunities there, the credit card we saw \u2013 we are offering a lot of new card accounts to customers, balances are seasonally a little low at this juncture, but we are pleased with the progress we are making. I think, when you look at the overall loan demand, we would still like to see the diversity of that demand improve further yet.","But I would say that it made a very strong progressive move in the past quarter. We are more pleased with how broad it is today than we were in the last time we spoke.","Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And a one quick follow-up on the auto side, you said, that you expect to increase the pull-through. Do you think that area is getting very over competitive because you hear some banks saying that it could be getting over here?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Well, I think clearly the growth in that market all of our teams and risk management when they see a particular product growing rapidly and risk management disciplines requiring to start looking at that particular product sector more closely. There is a lot of participants in the auto lending space and you are seeing growth loan demand in there, particular category.","I think you have as an individual institution, you have to decide what part of that markets you want to participate in. We have drawn some pretty bright lines about we are re-participate, we believe we can do that and still show growth. And we are still very confident in the production replacing all our balance sheet.","David J. Turner Jr.","","Paul, this is David, I will add to that. One of things, we think about indirect is who we are doing business dealership that we are doing business with. Now we have today about 2,000 dealers that we do business with, normally 8,000 that are actually in our geographic marketplace. So only about 25% of those that we are banking in today.","I think that dealership election is very important for us and we are building the relationship that we need, the speed of action that we need and we feel very good about that credit.","Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Murray of ISI.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","","Good morning, Keith.","","Keith E. Murray \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Thanks, good morning guys. Now just touching on the fee line items for a second, if you look at the service charges on deposits were down 6% year-over-year. You guys talked you had pretty good growth in checking accounts, can you just talk about the dynamic that\u2019s going on there on a year-over-year basis.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","I will make a couple of comments, then ask David to come on as well. Clearly, what we are seeing is from a service charge perspective first quarter is typically seasonally soft, and as you compare against the same time last year, this year we are softer than last year. We do believe part of that was weather related, but we also believe part of that is shifts and consumer behavior, the consumers in much better shape from a financial perspective than they were a year ago.","And we are seeing much more discipline on the part of the consumer in terms of how they manage their accounts, both from making sure they maintain balances necessary to overwrite any service charges amount that occur as well as discipline around over drawing those checking accounts. And so we\u2019re seeing a real marketed improvement in how customers are managing their checking accounts. That being said, we still \u2013 we still are encouraged by the number of new quality accounts that we are adding to our balance sheet. And believe that there is an opportunity for us to continue to grow that part of our business going forward.","David J. Turner Jr.","Yes I think Grayson is right on the growing the number of customers, I think it is going to be important to us. As we look at our customer base, really want to build deep relationships with those customers, we offer advice guidance and education to these customers to help them with all of our banking products. And we think we\u2019ve seen a change in the customer behavior not only in the industry, a service charge down in industry, but we see at Regions as well, which we think is a good thing.","We think we have a good quality customer base, and we are looking to develop those new products, that will serve our existing customer base as well as new households that we are growing, so all-in-all we have seen a decline in place like overdraft fees, but looking to gain on the different service charges and different products that we offer.","Keith E. Murray \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Thanks. I was just going to ask the follow-up along those lines on the deposit advance product, which you\u2019d be willing to give us sort of a revenue number that you might be giving up and give us more color on the traction that you have seen articles in American Banker et cetera, you guys are making progress, adding any consumers from tiered pricing et cetera. Just how much traction are you seeing there on the replacement type products?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","I think that clearly what you\u2019ve seen is that we are transitioning away from that particular product and since the first of the year, we not being adding any new customers for that particular product. And we are seeing normal customer attrition out of that product over the next couple of quarters.","We will be offering a number of different transitional alternatives to our customers. It\u2019s a little early for us to give you the benefit number on what the revenue impact will be because we need to see how some of these transition strategies how effective they are. We are hopeful that we can transition a number of these customers to more traditional credit based products, but that\u2019s yet for us to prove.","Keith E. Murray \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Hi, Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks very much. Hi, good morning. In terms of the credit experience, was there anything sort of interesting or unusual going on with respect to recoveries, particularly in the commercial space?","","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Yes, nothing unusual that we see \u2013 we went into de-risk a lot of credit during the tough times and we sold some credit too. So the recovery opportunities are still clearly are there, but we are seeing some recoveries but nothing unusual has cropped up that we are seeing.","Ellen Jones","Yes. We actually look at the \u2013 put the recoveries on a year-over-year basis. Recoveries are relatively flat on a dollar basis and given our lower non-performing loan base, on a percentage basis recoveries are actually up to be broad-based amongst all of the category particularly in commercial is what we are seeing those recoveries coming fast.","","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","But nothing unusual this quarter on recovery is tracking about as we would have expected.","Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then just my related follow-up just sort of steps back for a moment, if on a core earnings basis, we annualized the quarter to about $0.85 of earnings, but with virtually no provision presumably as that number moves back towards some sign of normalized range. What offsets the impact of the higher credit loss experience range for the P&L?","David J. Turner Jr.","Well the increases that we see coming it\u2019s a timing issue right. So we continue to have no higher reserve covers than our peers, so little more credit leverage left relative to peers. We see economic expansion coming at some point in time a higher rate environment at some time. So that overall generally increases an economic activity will lift our NII and lift our NIR and execution on our Regions 360, which is a needs based program to bring the entire bank to our customer base.","Those are the main areas we see in terms of growing our revenues streams to mitigate what a normal provision would be, the amount at which we can\u2019t tell you today because credit is going on the books today as still the most pristine credit, we looked at regions and in the industry over time. So it\u2019s really a timing issue that\u2019s hard to tell you exactly how and what dollar amount offset would be.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","So the credit quality continues to improve and continues to improve with a pace that generally outpaces our internal projections for that. So we\u2019ve been pleased by that, encouraged by that, the portfolio as David said our loan portfolio today is a much stronger, much better diversified portfolio that we\u2019ve had in the past.","To your point is that if you are showing no growth and that credit leverage goes away you got a huge \u2013 huge gap to fill, but you do have to recognize the growth on one hand we are trying to achieve and at the same time the expense management does once that we put in place to continue to try to drive towards a good earnings result as credit leverage dissipates.","Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","","Thanks very much.","Operator","","Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","","Good morning, John.","John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","","Good morning. On that three topic, can you just remind us what do you think is adequate long-term loan loss reserve ratio at Regions to the improving \u2013 much improved tech environment.","David J. Turner Jr.","Yes, John, this is David. So it\u2019s a great question, we try to \u2013 we have given a range before then we talked the reserve would be in that 1.5, 2 range clearly credit has been more pristine that are longer than we had originally anticipated when we put that out. I think we are 44 basis points worth of loss today. We see that range drifting south. It\u2019s hard to tag that is that total point on the low end.","And I think our best guidance we can give you is we have a pretty good model that we feel comfortable with, and we got to let that model work each in every quarter. And it will be what it is. With that being said, if you look at the credit metrics, we see it going south of that range. And where it ends up is your guess from there.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Only credit quality is going to drive that number and we stay focused on our methodologies, our process, modeling, credit losses, and we\u2019ve got to make sure that those processes have a lot of rigor, lot of discipline around them. Unlike David it\u2019s hard at this juncture to definitively tag where those ratios might eventually land.","John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","Okay. All right and then separately, one of you can talk a little bit about the very modest decline in loan yields that we saw in the quarter. But specifically, if you can give us some color on the new money yields, where you\u2019re booking new loans at this point versus the current portfolio yields? And then separately how that comes into play in terms of your margin outlook for relatively stable margin, is that implied, do you expect loan yields to holding in there if not hit higher yield of, thanks.","David J. Turner Jr.","Yes, John. Thanks, so as you mention we expect our margins to be relatively stable for the remainder of the year. And we define that as one or two points either side of the 326 we have today. I\u2019ll see a prolonged low interest rate environment puts more pressure on loans as old loans, higher priced or fixed rate loans mature, and new loans go on the books.","And from a pricing standpoint clearly there is pressure on pricing in the loan portfolio in particular on the commercial side. But we believe that pricing has been \u2013 we\u2019re booking relatively stable there. You saw a slight decline in loan yields for us. Mixed changes with loans can\u2019t make a difference where there is a consumer loan or commercial. And clearly we grew most of our loan growth that was in the commercial space.","But those spread have been in the 225 to 250 range. They are kind of holding in there, it\u2019s being on the credit that you\u2019re putting on the books. And so I think you should expect with the rate environment where we are right now. That you\u2019ll see some modest impression on loan yields. We have had as you know deposit and liability management strategies to help offset the funding costs. Now we are down to 33 basis points of funding. And so, all that\u2019s been taken into account on the margin guidance that we gave you.","With all that said, if the rate environment stays lower or longer than we expect we will have margin compression. Right now we still are confident enough to give you the guidance on a stable margin going forward for 2014.","John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","","Hey, Ken, good morning.","Kenneth M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC","","Hi, good morning, Grayson. Can I ask you guys a question about expenses and efficiency? This quarter was another good result for expenses that even included the FICA balance. So I\u2019m wondering if you can help us understand how much was that elevated first quarter bump. And then also, how you expect the trajectory of both dollars and\/or even the efficiency ratio, as we go through the year.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","","Ken, so if you look at our efficiency ratio, our efficiency ratio actually ticked up just a bit in the quarter. I would tell you that\u2019s more of a revenue side of the equation than the expense side, although we focus pretty intensely on expenses during the quarter. That being said, I believe that as you think about the remainder of this year on the efficiency ratio, I mentioned it last quarter. We\u2019re sticking with it.","We believe the efficiency ratio will tick down from where it is today and we think it will finish in the year in the lower 60% range. So we had a lot of pluses and minuses. We had incentives, we had pension, we had FICA. All that, Ken, is taken into account in terms of that go forward guidance, in terms of the lower 60% range for efficiency this year.","Kenneth M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay. And as my follow-up on that, then, can you help us understand then approximately like what was at least a FICA balance? I would presume that tension was a helper. So I would presume that $846 million adjusted included that seasonal spike. I\u2019m just wondering if you could help us understand how much that would have been, and do we then presume that we trail off of that from here?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","I think in total if you look at dollars, it\u2019d be in that $11 million to $12 million range for payroll.","Kenneth M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","","Okay.","Operator","","Your next question will comes from the Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Hi, good morning. Couple of questions; one on the loan growth. I know you gave the 3% to 5% guidance. And that seems like a relatively wide range as you\u2019re sitting here, given what you saw into March and what you are booking right now. Is there a reason why you can\u2019t tighten that range a little bit from what you gave previously?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","","I think as we look at it right now, we\u2019ve given guidance on the 3% to 5%. Clearly we\u2019re one quarter into the year. We think we had some encouraging group in the first quarter. Our pipelines are healthier today. We\u2019ve seen some real optimism in the last, say, six weeks or so as some of the weather-related issues have dissipated. I would say we\u2019re not at the point yet that we feel comfortable with tightening up that forecast. Clearly as the year progresses we will gain confidence in that, but at this juncture we still believe the 3% to 5% range is appropriate.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, I\u2019m just thinking about it in the context of how it impacts the NIM, in line with the prior question. As you are looking out on the NIM, you talked a bit about the loan yield impact, but what about the cost of funds? Are there things you could do incrementally on that side, as well? You've got some high-cost debt outstanding, some sub-debt. Is there anything that you could do there to lower the funding costs?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Yes, Betsy, we continue to look at for opportunities when it\u2019s economical to rationalize our funding side. You've seen the actions we\u2019ve taken up to now on repaying some of our debt. The math really has to hold up for us, so we look at it everyday. We realize we have some expenses debt out there. And so, it\u2019s on our radar screen, but we do want to make sure that it\u2019s economical when we do it and that\u2019s probably been the biggest hold up there.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And by economical, you're talking about impact of whatever swaps, hedges?","Ellen Jones","We\u2019re a reasonable payback, in terms of the cost that we\u2019re going to incur the one-time charge to capital, in income statement and capital and how quickly does \u2013 that we get payback to that.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. In other words, not refinancing it, but just taking it down?","Ellen Jones","We\u2019re refinancing it cheaper (Multiple Speaker) or taking it out completely either way.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Either way. I mean there is still \u2013the math is still the same.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Good morning, Grayson. If I can ask two unrelated questions, first is, when I look at the capital market side, it was down over 50% in the quarter. And you did call out a slowdown in syndicated loan volumes and customer derivatives, post a strong 4Q. But even beyond that, it does look like the slowdown was beyond prior quarters. So how should we think about the bounce back from here? Do you expect that we should run at a similar rate to the current quarter, or do you think we should move back towards the higher level we were running pre-4Q?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","I think at this juncture, when we look at this Ryan, we have a strong Q4 and we had a strong 4Q and then we had softness in the first quarter more softer than we had anticipated, but nice recovery in the latter part of the quarter. And we still are pretty optimistic about sort of where it goes from here.","That being said, I think, the biggest change we saw was how much broader loan demand was across markets and product. And in particular, we pivoted on investor commercial real estate, which has been a declining portfolio for a number of quarters and actually have some reasonable growth this quarter in that segment.","So I think that as you look out in upcoming quarters, we still believe that there's an opportunity for us to continue to grow our loan portfolio. Our goal is to do that in a diversified and prudent manner.","Ellen Jones","Ryan, I'll add on the, specific to the capital markets with regards to what was happening. If you go back to the fourth quarter, you\u2019ll see a very different rate environment, one where the 10-year, there was increasing people were using derivatives a lot more than they did in the first quarter. So the first quarter rates declined quite nicely and as that happened, people were not \u2013 were willing to run a little more interest rate risk than they would otherwise.","So I think all things being equal as we expect rates to continue to climb \u2013 the pace of which is uncertain that as that expectation of a rate increase is coming, you would expect clients the demand more the use of derivatives and therefore big driver of our capital market revenue, 0.4.","Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Got it. And then you did a nice job early on outlining how you think about capital allocation and capital return. But if I could just dig a little bit deeper \u2013 Grayson, can you share your philosophy or priority, in terms of how you are thinking about your risk tolerance for strategic transactions? And what, in particular, is it that you are looking for? Is it improving density across certain MSAs, building out the wealth management channel? And you guys obviously haven't done a big deal since AmSouth. Just be helpful if you could just refresh what are your parameters, in terms of return hurdles and risk parameters.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","When you look at capital allocation it sort of what we are looking at in terms of growing the company. We are looking forward to diversify our strategy, it doesn\u2019t place a huge debt on any portion of our capital, but it actually places incremental bids in different parts of our business. You\u2019ve seen us allocating not only capital, but resources to our wealth management sector to try to grow that sector out, try to create a more diversified revenue stream for the company. And but also create new revenue streams that we weren\u2019t previously enjoying.","I also think we look at that philosophically the same way we\u2019ve a number of markets that we are very dominant in, but we also have a number of markets where our franchise is limited, that we love to see overtime has garnered the ability to expand the density of our franchise in those markets. I do think we are looking for incremental opportunities that add up to be material as opposed to looking for transformational kind of opportunities.","Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Brian Foran of Autonomous Research.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","","Good morning, Brian.","Brian D Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research US LP","","Hi, good morning. I wondered if I could come back to the loan yield question, and maybe come at it from the other side, which is on \u2013 if I look back two years ago, your loan yields were materially below the industry average, about 40 bps, at least on the way I measure it. And if I look today, you are kind of in line \u2013 and especially over the past year. While there has been price compression, it's just \u2013 with every bucket except credit card, your price compression has been a lot less than the industry.","How much of that is conscious repricing efforts on your part? How much of that is the markets or the borrower mix shift? Or just why aren't you seeing the same magnitude of price compression on the lending side that\u2019s some of your peers are?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Well, I think, I\u2019ll answer in a couple of ways. Then I\u2019ll ask John Asbury, our Executive in charge of Business Services just sort of add to it. I would say when you look at our portfolio that generally going into the recession, we had more variable rate notes than we did fixed rate as relative to peers. And I also think if you look at our portfolio on the consumer side, we had an equity line portfolio that was priced materially below peer.","And so as you look at it today, you are seeing on the consumer side generally speaking loans that are going on our portfolio were priced higher and loans that are maturing off from our portfolio, on the business side we had to make some very specific decisions about in which markets and which more products that we will compete both on price and structure. We believe we\u2019ve been rigorous and disciplined in that regard. But generally speaking, corporate balance sheets are in better shape. And so, corporations that we are providing banking product today can demand appropriate pricing, given the risk characteristics of their company, which have improved dramatically.","And so, I do think we feel pricing pressure in our markets. We see that and we are trying to compete against that by competing on value of relationship as opposed to competing on price. That doesn\u2019t mean that we aren\u2019t subject to pricing price. But that does mean, and I think that going into the recession we didn\u2019t have as much discipline around pricing as we should have. We think we\u2019ve largely corrected that and we believe we\u2019re in better place today in terms of what we\u2019re adding on to our books. But I\u2019ll ask John Asbury to speak to that.","John Asbury","","Grayson, you summed up very well. First thing I\u2019d point to was your first point, which is we don\u2019t run a large fixed-rate book. We\u2019re about three-quarters variable rate. And so, we did not have to deal with run-off of higher-yielding fixed rates to the same degree as many of our peers did, we believe over the course of the past couple of years. So that will be one issue.","The second is, they\u2019re same question. I mean we put pretty powerful disciplines in place in terms of \u2013 in sending and holding bankers accountable for pricing the loans. We did not have a price-driven strategy. That is how we choose to compete. So, yes, we need to be competitive. We use third-party benchmarking services.","We have a lot of mechanisms that cause the bankers to want to make sure that we\u2019re paid appropriately for the extension of credit, and honestly I think those are the two big drivers from the business services perspective.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","I\u2019ll add two other things. If you\u2019re referring to the brand in terms of how we compare to our peers; two things, one, the use of derivative interest rate swaps to hedge that risk that John just talked about in terms of the variable. We say the price for not having those hedges in place, and that\u2019s why our margin \u2013 and I forgot which caller had referred to our margin, had been lower for some period of time. So the maturing of the swap is more prevalent at some of our peers than it is for us. And so, as that gets unwound for them, you can see the margins working towards us.","The second big thing is purchase accounting and several of the peers who also works its way through the pipeline and while there\u2019s still some more of that accretion, if you will, inuring to the benefit of the margin line for some, we didn\u2019t have that. So we had those two things, swaps and purchase accounting, are big drivers of why we don\u2019t have that downward pressure as much as our peers do.","Brian D Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you so much. That was a real thorough answer.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Good morning, Grayson. Thanks for taking my question. Just two questions on the loan portfolio. First of all, you mentioned the utilization rate was up about 170 basis points. I don\u2019t remember you saying what the ratio was at the end of the quarter. And I\u2019m curious if you would provide us sort of what you think your long-term target, or long-term average would be, and what benefit that might generate to net interest income?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Yes, we'll get you the where, what, from, to, but, historically we have been over 50% in terms of utilization. And if I recall, we\u2019re in that 45% range today in terms of utilization. So we still have room to go in terms of what it ultimately gets to. So I guess 45 minus 170 where we work, whatever that finance is.","Matthew H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Fair enough. And I guess just a bigger picture question for Grayson, I guess your consumer loans at this point are about 38% of total loans, those would come on, presuming there was normal levels of demand at higher rates than you would normally see for commercial loans. How are you thinking about the dynamic over the next couple of years of growing the consumer loans and what benefit that might have to the margin over time and sort of how the portfolio ultimately balances out between consumer and commercial.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Yes, I mean I think that David and I have publicly stated a number of times we\u2019d love to see, the mix of commercials to consumer loans more in that 50\/50 range, since we have been saying that over the last three or four years it\u2019s hardly moved.","Matthew H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Right.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Today the consumer portfolio is about 38% and that\u2019s in spite of the fact that we reentered the dealer indirect business. And we repurchased back our credit card portfolio and reentered that business. I do think we are encouraged by some of the progress we are making, quite frankly the loan demand in the consumer sector still is less than in the commercial segments. But we are still very much committed to grow on that consumer portfolio.","We think that clearly the consumer has taken a much more disciplined approach to credit today. And we think that\u2019s a good thing. So do believe we have almost 4 million consumers would bank with us. And we do believe that penetration into that book of credit products are still low relative to what we see in other peers, and we do believe over time, that we will be able to move the mix of consumer and commercial loans on our book, has just given in this market, with where loan demands at today, that\u2019s become particularly challenging.","But we do believe over time that our efforts will prove to move that number directionally towards that 50-50 basis, but that\u2019s going to take some time. And it\u2019s going to take a stronger consumer driven market to do that.","Matthew H. Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Good morning Marty.","Marty Lacey Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning. Wanted to ask you David, a little bit about the net interest margin and the two factors that we haven't talked about yet, which are the higher cash balances in liquid assets that you accumulated quietly finally over the last year, you've accumulated about $1 billion, which, in my calculation, is about 2 basis points on the margin that you kind of have in your back pocket, that you could use whenever you so deemed necessary. So, how do you think about that, and what plans do you have to deploy some of that?","David J. Turner Jr.","Marty, you are right our cash balance, average cash balance did go up during the quarter, and there is a big driver that is our continued growth in deposits which we are always out there looking for good customer deposits. We realized that we need to put that cash, to work more efficiently which we will do. We would like to be down in that, maybe just less than $2 billion range in terms of cash balances today, given that lack of a efficient functioning over night market.","So you should not see us continuing to pile up cash at the Fed and continuing to see an increase that you did this past quarter.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","And that\u2019s a positive that you didn\u2019t get this quarter that you forget in the future and the positive that you did get this quarter was the decline in premium amortization which although rates went lower, I guess cash flows and prepayments stayed low enough that you were able to reduce that amortization this quarter.","David J. Turner Jr.","Yes, that amortization was helpful to us; it was a positive in terms of our net interest margin. The benefit that we see going forward us they are slowing of premium amortization is less and less. There is still some positives there. So we just have to think efficiently how we put the cash to work, you spot on is just where do we put it, it\u2019s the most meaningful to us.","We probably have loan growth and to fund loan growth appropriately priced, appropriate risk-weighted loan growth that\u2019s what we are here for and if we can\u2019t do that we put it in the investment portfolio while we weight. I think that\u2019s the question about deleveraging, we look for opportunities there ourselves when the economics make sense. So there are a couple of different places we can use the cash. We just have to find the most efficient needs of it.","Marty Lacey Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","And, Grayson, a big-picture question. When you're looking at the risk management practices that you're investing so heavily in, there's one thing which says you have to comply with all the regulatory requirements. But what is going to make Regions different? How do you see the actual, tangible benefits of having better risk management? And all the things you're doing just being compliance, or we really making our risk management better?","","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","So, Marty it\u2019s a great question and it\u2019s one the entire industry is asking our sales, if it\u2019s compliance for compliance sake I think you miss a great opportunity. In this organization, we are trying to grow risk management all the way down to the front-line, making sure that our first line of defenses from risk standpoint are solid, our second lines are solid and third lines are solid. And we are driving a very strong cultural change to the company around risk management.","At the end of the day in investment, we are making a risk management has to make sense from a business perspective. It has to improve not only quality of our earnings, but the consistency of our earnings I think that we are trying to strike a healthy balance.","We are in the business and taking risk, but we are in the business to take improvement risk, and so I think that the question we ask ourselves everyday is not how we invest in risk, and compliance, and audit just for the sake of being in compliance, but really for how that we really change our company to make it a better company, to make it a company that is a better long-term investment to our share holders and a better long-term place for customers to bank and for our team members to be involved. And I\u2019ll just ask Matt Lusco. Matt\u2019s our Chief Risk Officer right here I think it\u2019s a great question Matt want to comment on it.","C. Matthew Lusco","Hey, Marty I\u2019ll add to that, over the last six months the loan was $59.2 billion and that\u2019s really just more fine, really don\u2019t consider operational loss and consulting costs will back our lost revenues from opportunity costs. That\u2019s an incredible number compared to net charge-offs in the industry, it\u2019s only $20.7 billion. You really do have \u2013 have to have an infrastructure to manage that.","We got an initiative and Regions if we talked a little bit about in the annual report this year called Regions ROA, which stands for Risk, Ownership, and Awareness and that really is ensuring that we are building out strong partnership between first and second line of defense. And Grayson said, not compliance for the sake of compliance is to ensure that we are getting the maximum benefit out of all of our processes. We are identifying some internal costs of non-compliance. We want to track down the information is really measured, so we figure it is really a comprehensive quality insurance initiative.","O. B.

Grayson Hall, Jr.","Good morning Sameer.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thanks, good morning. I just had a couple of questions. So the first one was, you provided some good commentary around loan growth being somewhat broad-based. And I was just curious in terms of your loan commitments, it looks like last quarter they increased by $500 million. And if I'm doing my math correctly, it looks like this quarter, loan commitments grew by $750 million to $800 million.","And I was curious if that increase in loan commitments this quarter, and indeed the loan commitment themselves \u2013$750 million to $800 million. If you could speak to the mix of those commitments, where are you seeing, perhaps, increased demand? I know you had some growth, finally, in industrial real estate. Is that a significant chunk of the loan commitments this quarter? Or any other specific areas you might point to, as far as the loan commitments go.","David J. Turner Jr.","I think as you look at \u2013 you look to loan growth this quarter, while it was the first quarter is a long time, we say a net growth on investor commercial real estate. The good news on net growth was that, while still multifamily is that largest single product out of that production, we did see strong production on the other parts or other categories of commercial real estate, which about 40% of our production is in multi-family, 60% of our production was elsewhere scattered between single family industrial office and retail. Retail still continues to be sort of a smallest part of that production but if there was more growth there than we\u2019ve seen in previous quarter.","I think when you look at the commercial industrial; we really see that growth in a lot of our specialty lending groups in particular energy and healthcare. And if you look across markets, the markets in Texas and South Louisiana are growth completely strong but also we had pretty decent growth in Georgia and in north-central Alabama. And of course Florida, while Florida, probably at the most challenging coming through the rescission. We\u2019re seeing some really positive signs coming out of certain markets in that part of our franchise. John Asbury you like to add that?","John Asbury","Again there is some more growth in commercial continues to be strong for us pretty well diversified. One thing I like to see this quarter is that kind of general industries geography based commercial effort was actually the single largest driver of commercial loan growth which is good and so we still had very good performance on the specialty lending areas but it\u2019s nice to see more of a broad based general industries, you already spoke of the geographic areas from where they came.","No question we\u2019ve been increasing commitments on the real estate side, to your point pretty well diversified, not just our product title, we are seeing, improving diversification, but also we are seeing improvement in diversification of where we are financing of this products on the real estate side as well. So that good to see that coming on line.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","","Okay, thank you. And then just here in terms of the auto business, you talked earlier about dealer penetration. And you mentioned that you are in 25% of the dealers that are really in your footprint, so there's an opportunity out there. Do you have a metric? How","high do you think that 25% could go in the next 12 months, like some sort of target?","And in terms of the average loans per dealer, I think in 2013 the average loans per dealer grew by more than 50%. And I think you referenced, in Q1, that increase was more like 13%. So is that kind of the run rate we should expect over the course of this year as well, as far as average loans per dealer? Just to get a sense for a couple of metrics there, and how you're thinking about the next 12 months. Thank you.","David J. Turner Jr.","","So as we think about indirect, you are right. With 25% of the dealers in our geography, we are looking while we have 6,000, obviously if we go at, and we really want to be particular with the dealers that we do business with. So our strategy now is less about increasing that number as it is penetration of our existing dealers. You referenced the increase in the number of deals per dealer per month increasing we have done it one.","So the average was one deal, per dealer per month, and that is up quite nicely. The reason it was only one is, remember we reentered the indirect market you have t come back and build the relationship that takes time. And as we\u2019ve proven ourselves and proven our technology and our service to our dealers, we see penetration increasing at the existing 2,000 dealers that we have today versus growing that number.","And we do that by the service and we do that by the speed of answering that we get back to the customer, which is driven by enhancements of the technology that can help us that determine an underwriting decision much quicker than manual intervention. So that\u2019s really the strategy going forward.","","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Yes, I mean our goal is not to have, we are not going to measure necessarily the numbers of dealers that we have signed up, but the quality of those relationships, and we want to sell deeper into those relationships and how more meaningful banking relationship with them. And so what you should expect to see this year is more transactions or per dealer basis and less emphasis on just rolling numbers dealing.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","","Okay, great thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Gaston Ceron of MorningStar Equity.","Gaston F. Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Hi, good morning.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","","Good morning Gaston.","Gaston F. Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Hi, just wanted to go back to expenses for a second. Just two quick things; one is on occupancy. So, with the number of branches coming down, how should we think about that line going forward?","David J. Turner Jr.","","So occupancy is one of our top three costs, that we continue to look at and you are right to point out that a lot of our occupancy cost is in our branch infrastructure. We have right at 1,700 branches. We continue to evaluate all of those we consolidated 30 auctions last quarter, equated that in this quarter. And so there are ways to tighten that up some I would not accept dramatic changes in our occupancy as a result of that, but we\u2019ll continue to chip away at that line item.","A lot of that cost of occupancy is fixed cost; depreciation on places that we have, leases or whatever. So the ability to drastically move that without exceeding leases and taking a one-time charge is less for us, but we continue to look at that closely.","Gaston F. Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Research","Okay. Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And then, lastly on expenses. You really kind of held the line here on salaries and benefits, in looking at the five-quarter trend. How should we think about that line, assuming that eventually you move into a higher revenue environment? I mean how much sort of pent-up pressure is there for increases and things like that?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Well, there are some of the salary and benefits that are tied to revenue. So as revenue increases you should except to see an increase in salary and benefits to pay for that revenue. We are down in headcount through the first quarter. Some of that is just timing related. But we focused on making sure we rationalize our total head count, which we will do over time this year.","There were some benefits that we received through our pension accounting during the year. And so, you\u2019ll see that continue to play out through 2014. Our commitment, as we stated that front, was really to ensure that we\u2019re shooting for generating positive operating leverage. And so, we are as concerned about the increases in salaries and benefits or any other expense line. As long as the revenue generation is there to take care of what ever increase that we have. So there is some variability with those expense levels tied to revenue.","Gaston F. Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Research","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.","Steven Tu Duong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. This is actually Steve Duong in for Gerard. Thanks for taking our call. Just a quick question. Regarding your loan portfolio, your commercial real estate mortgage owner-occupied, that continues to decline. Is that still part of the de-risking of your portfolio or is there more that we can take from there?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","No, that\u2019s really not part of de-risking. If you look at the owner-occupied real estate, it really performs pretty close correlation to the C&I portfolio in general. And so, it \u2013 but what you\u2019re seeing there is just a continued maturity of those notes in the pace of still what\u2019s soft demand for that particular product. I think as sort of economic courage returns on the part of some of our business customers, you\u2019ll see that improve, but right now that is still a softer part of our lending segments.","Steven Tu Duong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. So we should \u2013 as the environment improves, we should expect that to eventually reverse course, I take it?","","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","That\u2019s correct.","Steven Tu Duong \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. Well, I appreciate. That's all for us. Thank you.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Good morning.","Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Hi. Thanks. Couple of quick questions. Pardon me if I missed this one in the call. Your consumer advanced product, what is the dollar amount of outstanding in the yields on those loans?","David J. Turner Jr.","I think we haven\u2019t disclosed our total outstandings, or revenue, I should say generated from Ready Advance. And the reason for it is we\u2019re in the process transitioning out of that into different product that we are testing as we speak. And we want to make sure we give you investors the best information on what that revenue change if any will be as a result of those new products that we are transitioning into. That will take for 2014 to transition. And so if we get more clarity on that, we will be happy to share that with you.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","","And clearly there is going to be a revenue adjustment. We are working through what that means for us and what our transition plans are. We have not been adding customers to this product since the first of the year. We are seeing just normal attrition in that customer base. And within that product, our transition strategies are either yet to be proven out and as we did a little more maturity around that transition process, we will be able to give you a little more clarity on what we think the impact will be.","Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. One more question. LCR \u2013 ultimately to get to \u2013 I know you don't need to get to 100% right now, but ultimately to get to that \u2013 will you need to shift the mix of securities a little bit towards more of the level 1? Or where do you stand, especially if you bring the cash that you've got sitting at the Fed now?","","David J. Turner Jr.","We are trying to address that a little bit in the prepared comments that we relieved based on the rules today. And our interpretation of those rules, we will be compliant with LCR when it\u2019s implemented. So relative to others, we don\u2019t have a lot of changes in terms of portfolio. Changes that will affect us that being said we need to continue to see how it rules change over time. And we will make corrections. But based on what we see today you shouldn\u2019t see a big change in our portfolio later.","Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Marinac of FIG partners.","Christopher W. Marinac \u2013 FIG Partners LLC","","Thanks guys. Grayson, you'd mentioned earlier in the call about the smaller markets you have, and the interest in trying to expand over time. I was curious if any of these small markets are popping up today, as pockets of good loan growth and opportunity that in terms of what you are already realizing.","David J. Turner Jr.","We have all different kinds of markets in our 16 state to impress. Each market offers a different competitive advantage or different opportunity I should say for us. So some of the smaller markets we have products and services that should make the customer base. And many other small markets the stability of deposits is really important to go back to questions asked earlier, what happens when rates increase and economic activity starts occurring and deposit become all more important as your funding source. And perhaps today we\u2019ll count on the small markets where we have some really dense small markets that we think are really beneficial to us.","That being said we have markets where we\u2019ve tried to get that density that we need or to get our products set sold through the market. If that can\u2019t happen, then we will consolidate like you\u2019ve seen us do. And we'll look to continue to rationalize our footprint over time as a result that we can\u2019t get the revenue streams that we desire from them.","","Christopher W. Marinac \u2013 FIG Partners LLC","Great, David. Thanks for the color here.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank.","David J. Turner Jr.","Good morning.","Matt D. O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey David, it\u2019s afternoon. I realize the credit card book is only about $1 billion, but what's the thought process for offering credit card to non-customers?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","","Matt, if you recall, we \u2013 it\u2019s not been that long ago that we repurchased our credit card book and then it took a few quarters to yet that book converted over to our systems and to get processes in place. And so, we really have been focused since that time on really penetrating our book of business and today about 14% of our customers have our credit card. We\u2019d love to see that come up to more corporate level where you see some of our peer groups in the 20% to 25% range. We\u2019ve been doing that and doing that more effectively each and every quarter.","We\u2019ve seen most recently some numbers where we obviously are getting much more proficient and selling into the financial needs of our customers and offering that product. We have been also trying to determine how best to grow the number of customers that bank with regions. And so, within our footprint we elected the sort of cash to market to see if there is a way to use our credit card product offering to attract new customers into our offices.","We\u2019re already in that process. There\u2019s no intention on our part to be a heavy solicitation bank in terms of card, but very targeted, very selective in markets that we dominate where we have strong brand name recognition. We\u2019re trying to extreme it to see whether we can really drive some customer traffic into our branch offices for new accounts.","Matt D. O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Okay. That makes sense. And then just as we think out over the next few years, I want to say, at one point you thought the card portfolio could get up to a $2 billion handle. Is that correct or is that the thought process in terms of how big it could get over time?","","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Your math is just as good as mine. We\u2019re at 14% penetration. If we can get into that 20% to 25% participation rate, we ought to be able to double size that portfolio. But more importantly is that we can offer our customers a more full financial relationship, because all of our customers are going to carry one or more credit cards. We\u2019d love for one of those to be ours. And our goal is to be able to manage that customer relationship, which we think gives us a better chance of creating more customer loyalty, better retention rate long-term for that customer base.","","Matt D. O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Okay. Thank you very much.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Thank you. I think that ends our questions and we appreciate your interest and your time today on this conference call. And we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
