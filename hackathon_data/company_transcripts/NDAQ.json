[Operator Instructions]. I would now turn the call over to your host, Ed Ditmire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ed Ditmire","Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ's fourth quarter 2014 earnings results. On the line are Bob Greifeld, our CEO, Lee Shavel, CFO, our co-Presidents, Adena Friedman and Hans-Ole Jochumsen, Ed Knight, our General Counsel and other members of the Management Team. After prepared remarks we will open up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information in complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.","I would like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I now will turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Greifeld","Thank you, Ed. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ's fourth quarter 2014 results. We're pleased to deliver another strong quarter for our shareholders with record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75, up 9% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margins were 43% during the fourth quarter, a 300 basis point improvement from a year ago and at multi-year highs.","When you look back on the results this quarter and really the entire year, what emerges are new higher baselines we've established for our revenue, profitability and earnings metrics as well as an improved strategic alignment between our people, our products, our operational expertise with our customers. Our revenue, non-GAAP operating income and net income all reached record levels during the year, but fundamentally I see this as just a starting point from which we can build.","As our business continues to evolve far beyond our grounding in the equity world, the businesses we're in are more diverse than ever before and operate really as complementary ecosystems. As we review our businesses in addition to the obviously successful financial metrics, we focus on our relative competitive position in the marketplaces in which we serve. I'm happy to report that the overwhelming majority of our businesses are in a better competitive position than one year ago. This is the best compliment possible for the management team and all the employees here at NASDAQ.","The changes we made during the year to evolve our management structure and to expand our product set across all businesses reflect the evolution of our business and the market realities in front of our clients today. We're confident about the path we're on with operational efficiency continuing to be paramount and our ability to continue to serve our customers and grow this franchise.","In 2014, we saw our best year in the IPO market in over a decade. NASDAQ capitalized on this year with a 60% win rate of all IPOs in the U.S. and it was also the best year across our Stockholm and Nordic markets since the year 2000. All this helped to deliver 5% growth in our global listings base compared to the prior year. Truly, an outstanding year for IPOs and a large number of companies that selected NASDAQ certainly underscores the compelling value proposition that we offer to the companies who list here.","In addition, we're also the beneficiaries of improved volume in the markets and also made marked progress in expanding both the functionality and the product offerings in our trading business contributing to strong market share performance. As a result of executing our strategy well in an improving environment, we finished full year 2014 with net cash equity trading revenues 17% higher while strong market share has also positioned us to continue to realize the benefits if volume remains constructive in 2015.","Turning back to this quarter, we were encouraged by the upward momentum we saw in organic growth. In the fourth quarter organic growth rose to 3%, up 400 basis points from the third quarter and contributed to a year that delivered solid mid-single digit organic growth in the non-transaction businesses, in-line with our longer term outlook and the positive organic growth in the trading businesses for the first time in many years after volumes stabilized over the last few years, we saw an inflection point in 2014. So overall, we're confident we're doing the right things to grow our business in meaningful ways.","I would like to get into a little more detail on the broad highlights that help define our quarter and our year and to demonstrate the progress we're making to expand our capabilities and increase the value we deliver to our customers. As I mentioned previously, clearly one of the highlights to our year was a strong return on the IPO market. This helped drive strong performance in the listing services segment and also signaled that investor confidence is returning, something we're obviously happy to see.","We finished the year with 189 IPOs and total proceeds raised of over $22 billion. To put this in some context, this far and away eclipsed our strong 2013 IPO total of 126. We were the only exchange globally to surpass the 150 IPO listings in 2014. We have an unmatched set of product and services that truly allow our companies to be more efficient and effective in reaching their stakeholders. This is what sets us apart from our competitors.","Our market site tower in Times Squares embodies in a sense our storefront to the world and is a fantastic stage to our listed companies. This year we completed a major renovation in the market site significantly increasing our ability to serve our clients and provide them with a world class venue to mark important milestones as they grow and a home-away-from-home to reach the investment community and stakeholders.","In addition, we made significant functionality enhancements to our IPO Cross which now provides even greater levels of transparency and control when new issuers come to the market. To that point we welcomed some tremendous brands in 2014 including GoPro, TrueCar.com, Virgin America and Weibo. Just recently, Walgreens, an over $70 billion market cap company, that for over 80 years was listed on the rival exchange decided to switch to NASDAQ.","So far this year, we're encouraged by the healthy IPO pipeline we're seeing. In our market services segment we continue to focus on our customers and how we can leverage our core assets to add value across the entire offering. Our U.S. derivatives business finished the year with the leading market share in U.S. equity and ETP options for the 5th year in a row, truly remarkable considering NASDAQ has only been in the options business for about six years.","With respect to eSpeed, we've embarked upon the most significant product expansion since the platforms founding 15 years ago following the completion of important core technology enhancements earlier in 2014. New products like the Electronic Treasury Bills, are resonating with our customers and we averaged about $5 billion in notional daily volume during the fourth quarter. Just this past Monday, we did a soft launch of our new short-duration bond note product, known as short shorts for issues with 18 months or less maturity.","Throughout the remainder of 2015 we expect to be launching coupon roles and off the run securities, filling out the remainder of the Treasury Yield Curve. So we feel good about the stable of products we have in our pipeline and our ability to grow the platform. In the Nordics, clearly a milestone for us this year was the fact that we were the first clearing house to achieve EMIR compliance certification to offer true multi-asset derivatives clearing. This stamp of approval not only validates the central clearing model that our customers want but also enables us to move forward at a rapid pace with new product introductions.","Now moving on to a technology solutions segment, we made equally strong progress in further developing these businesses and aligning our strategy with our customers. As a market operator for over four decades, we built an expansive set of technology solutions and expertise that is really unmatched in the marketplace. To this end, we continue to see strong customer uptake for our products and solutions across market technology businesses.","We have the ability to enable our customers to expand their capabilities more quickly and efficiently and this was certainly a driving factor behind many of the new clients and extended partnerships we established during the year, most notably in China with the Shanghai futures exchange, the Philippines Stock Exchange and recently with JPX in Japan for development and support of a next generation derivatives trading system.","In the fourth quarter, market technologies set new highs for quarterly order intake at $193 million including record new order take at both BWise and SMARTS Broker and market technology setting new record period-end backlog at $704 million, truly impressive. The market technology segment grew 5% over the full year 2014 and 10% if you exclude the FX headwinds, so a great year. We continue to be encouraged by the growth opportunities we're seeing in this business and our ability to deliver core trading, clearance, surveillance and enterprise risk management solutions to customers all over the world.","Now turning to corporate solutions, we continued to make operational progress and enhancements to the product and service offerings to better align with our customers. There is no more clear example of our long term strategic focus than the progress we made with our IR NexGen platform. We have been presenting a beta version of this product in road shows since the fall of 2014 and the customer response has been tremendous. We believe this offering truly has the potential to set a new standard in the IR space, but even more importantly, it will provide a robust platform for new product enhancements and growth opportunities in the months and the years to come from our corporate solutions businesses. We're looking forward to getting the first version of the product in our customers' hands before the end of the second quarter this year as part of a phased 2015 rollout.","Moving on to information services, this is certainly one of the great corner stones of our business here at NASDAQ. In our index business we've grown revenue 22% during 2014, as period assets under management and licensed ETPs grew 8% and we've also substantially expanded the product set by increasing the number of products licensed to our indices by 12%. A material part of that growth story has been in the emergent dividend to achieve this franchise which has grown AUM by over 200% since we acquired it two years ago.","This experience gives us confidence to agree this month to acquire Dorsey, Wright & Associates, a provider of smart beta indices and portfolio analytics based on their thought leadership and relative strength methodologies. We see similar opportunities to accelerate product development including adding international and non-equity products as well as to broaden DWA's already strong ETP sponsorship partnerships. In addition, DWA will leverage the highly scalable NASDAQ Index Calculator and our world class data dissemination capabilities.","In data products organic growth remains steady. We saw a particular strength again in the NASDAQ BASIC offering which realized a 48% increase in subscribers year-over-year, even as the product experienced some moderate price increases. NASDAQ BASIC delivers a very effective, lower cost option to the consolidated tape and it serves our customers well, saving some of them millions of dollars per year and it has become an established industry standard in only its few short years of existence.","While 2014 set another record revenue level in information services, we certainly see substantial opportunities to grow this business. We're excited to welcome Salil Donde to NASDAQ as EVP of Information Services, reporting to Adena. Salil is an innovative entrepreneurial leader who will bring new perspective to our information service business, something we would expect will drive new opportunities for us across this important segment.","Now in addition to the progress we made across our core businesses, we're always looking for ways to increase value for our shareholders and customers by investing in new initiatives that we believe will provide growth and opportunity for us. When we run our core businesses as efficiently as we do, we're able to return significant capital to shareholders but also invest in R&D. Looking at our performance, I think that it shows we balance these quite well.","In terms of investments, NASDAQ Private Market is continuing to gain traction and client list interest. There are now more than 60 companies using NPM products today and they range from promising start ups such as Tango and Mobli to well established private companies like Motley Fool. We continue to be encouraged by the progress we're making in serving this important segment of the market and this clearly will be a growth driver for us in the years to come.","At NLX, we made significant efficiency improvements to better lever core NASDAQ assets. As a result, the EPS impact has been reduced from $0.04 to $0.05 per quarter to $0.02 per quarter. We're also excited by the progress we're making in discussions with the leading players in the industry to become true partners in the NLX venture.","Looking forward beyond NLX, we're thrilled when customers from time to time provide us with new opportunities to offer competitive alternatives that leverage our technology and help deliver increased efficiencies and business opportunities. We evaluate those opportunities and only invest when we think there is good prospect for success and attractive returns for our shareholders.","Now I would like to expand a little on some of the key opportunities in areas of focus for us in 2015. When you look across our business, we continue to see greater opportunity to serve our customers in new ways. Let me highlight just a few of them.","As I mentioned we recently announced the acquisition of Dorsey Wright in our index business. This acquisition will help drive NASDAQ's capacity to grow its index across asset classes and geographies with substantial opportunities in index licensing. The ETF market is growing at an impressive rate and the smart beta segment of that market is growing at even an higher rate and we truly believe that this is a good marriage of their products and our technology and distribution channels that will offer our customers greater choice and drive growth opportunities for us.","In addition, Dorsey Wright brings a strong set of relationships with the retail advisor community which it serves with portfolio, modeling, analytics and other products. We look forward to exploring ways of serving this retail advisor community in better and broader ways and believe there could be an attractive revenue synergies for us. As I mentioned before, eSpeed is in the early stages of what should be a very significant product menu expansion for us and help drive growth across the platforms in the quarters to come.","Corporate solutions will see the completion of a substantially revamped and upgraded product set during 2015 with the NexGen platform forming the core which along with organizational enhancements to better align with our customers will position us to grow significantly over the long term. Our listing franchise enters 2015 with a material expanded customer base as well as additional tailwinds such as certain pricing adjustments in the U.S. listings business. We also have a higher market capitalization of Nordic listings which drives revenue and a strong operational momentum as I mentioned at NASDAQ Private Market.","Our trading franchise is seeing strong market positions allowing it to capitalize from a trading environment in early 2015 which seems likely to build on 2014's positive inflection point. January month to date, the volatility numbers are up 30% higher than the 2014 average and I would remind everybody that for every 10% increase in trading revenue, we get an extra $0.20 per share in annual earnings.","In closing, it was another record quarter and another strong year for this franchise which highlights the strength of our model and the clear path we've established for growth. Perhaps even more exciting to me is that we have the management structure in place that best positions us to grow over the medium and long term. One of the great advantages we've always enjoyed at NASDAQ is the great talent and strength of our bench and we're better organized to utilize those talents and skills than ever before.","As a result of the work we've done to transform our business we have a new baseline from which to measure our performance and even more importantly, we're confident in our ability to deliver meaningful growth and return to our shareholders from these new benchmarks we've established.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Lee, who will go into the numbers in more detail.","Lee Shavel","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. The following comments will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. I want to start off by highlighting the impact the stronger dollar had on our results this quarter as it obscures in many cases, solid organic growth that we saw in the business. Revenues of 517 million were reduced by 20 million from the prior-year quarter as a result of the stronger dollar and excluding FX impact grew 3%. Operating expenses were down $11 million due to foreign exchange but even eliminating this impact we were able to reduce expenses organically by $6 million or 2% from the prior year. These combined organic results contributed to operating income growth of 5%, excluding the FX impact and would have produced $0.04 higher non-GAAP EPS.","In order to provide a greater understanding of these effects on the business units, we're providing a schedule of the FX impact on the revenues for each business unit on page 14. I'll start by reviewing our fourth quarter revenue performance relative to the prior-year quarter as shown on Page 3 of the presentation. The 1% or $3 million decline in reported revenue of 517 million consisted of organic growth in subscription and recurring revenue of 9 million or 2% from growth in the listings, data products and index licensing and services offset by 13 million due to the impact of foreign exchange for a net 4 million decrease in reported revenues. It also included organic growth in transaction driven net revenues of 8 million or 4% from significantly higher cash equity trading revenue offset by 7 million due to foreign exchange for a net 1 million increase.","And if we move to page 4 in the presentation, we show how that organic growth breaks down historically between the non-transaction, information services, technology solutions and listing services segment which had 4% organic growth this year and the volume sensitive market services segment which had 2% organic growth for the year. On the bottom of this page we reiterate our views on the medium term organic growth outlook for the non-transactional segments which we continue to be in-line with for our 2014 performance.","I'll reiterate what I've said in the past that these views were meant to reflect multi-year cross-cycle periods and actual growth in shorter periods can be above or below these ranges. I'm now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparison will be made to the prior-year period unless otherwise noted.","Turning to page 5 we have changed the business segment revenue categories, beginning this quarter to reflect changes in the way we're organized and are managing the business. Please note consolidated segment revenues are unchanged. In particular, the U.S. and European revenues have been combined in all of our businesses and in the market services segment we've moved to three categories of trading revenues as managed by Hans-Ole Jochumsen and his team.","They consist of equity derivative trading and clearing, cash equity trading and fixed income currency and commodities or FIC trading and clearing which includes our energy and other commodities business, eSpeed and European fixed income clearing operations, our NLX London futures exchange as well as revenues associated with our Nordic clearing house and finally, Access and broker services which remains unchanged. Included in our earnings press release is a table showing our revised revenue format going back the last four quarters and three years.","In information services on page 6, we saw a 6% or 6 million revenue increase with operating margins steady at 70%. Data products had a 5% or 4 million increase in revenues, due largely to growth in NASDAQ BASIC revenues due to both user growth and the impact of a 2014 pricing change partially offset by a negative 2 million impact from FX. Index licensing and services grew revenues 10% due principally to the growth in assets under management in exchange traded products licensed to NASDAQ indices which rose 8% to 99 billion at the end of the quarter.","In early January, we announced we have agreed to acquire Dorsey, Wright & Associates a leading provider of smart beta indices and portfolio analytics featuring relative strength methodologies where DWA is a longstanding thought leader. At closing which we anticipate will occur tomorrow, DWA is expected to add about 5 million in quarterly run-rate revenue split fairly evenly between our data products and index segments and 2 million to 2.5 million in quarterly expenses.","Moving to technology solutions as shown on page 7, we saw a 9% or $13 million revenue decline and the operating margin was flat at 14%. Market technology revenues fell 12% or 8 million due to negative FX impact of 7 million, the recognition of 3 million of previously deferred revenues at BWise in the fourth quarter of 2013 and lower seasonally driven change request revenues.","While the year-over-year comparison was unfavorable in the fourth quarter, full year performance was solid with 5% year-over-year revenue growth excluding the impact of the fourth quarter 2013 3 million revenue recognition discussed above and 10% excluding foreign exchange. As Bob mentioned, the new order intake was a record at $193 million in the fourth quarter and the backlog is at a record 704 million which is 7% above the same period last year, supporting continued strong growth in the years to come.","Corporate solutions revenue fell 6% or $5 million year-over-year reflecting our extension of certain subsidies to legacy Thomson Reuters Corporate Solutions customers which reduced revenue by 3 million per quarter in 2014, as well as other declines in investor relations products and 1 million in the negative FX impact partially offset by higher governance and multimedia revenues. Organic growth was material in the Directors Desk governance products where we saw 18% growth in Directors Desk users and in our Globe Newswire distribution business.","The number of press releases published grows 8%, but broadly across our offerings we continue to face competitive challenges as we advance the integration and upgrade of our key product platforms. We remain confident that as we demonstrate our new capabilities and features, especially when the phased launch of our NextGen investor relations platform is complete in late 2015, we will have a suite of solutions for corporate executives that sets a new higher bar for the industry and an organization fully aligned to support growth over the longer term.","When we announced the acquisition of the Thomson Reuters Corporate businesses, we identified 35 million in cost synergies to be realized in combining them with our legacy businesses and these cost synergies were the largest driver to bring the technology solutions segment from a high-single digit margin to a 20% operating margin goal. We're currently ahead of schedule on realizing the cost synergies and now expect to realize total cost synergies above the $35 million by the end of 2015.","However, revenues are not where we want them to be at this point due to a variety of reasons including elevated competitive pressures during this product and solution investment and transition phase as well as substantial foreign exchange headwinds which are particularly impactful on our market technology business.","With this in mind, we now expect to reach mid to high teens margin levels in the fourth quarter of 2015 recognizing that the fourth quarter tends to be our seasonal margin peak. We expect to see continued and steady progress on the technology solutions margin as we work assiduously towards achieving our 20% goal in the medium term.","In market services, on page 8, we saw a 1 million increase in net revenues as organically higher net revenues of 9 million were mostly offset by 8 million negative FX impact. Operating margin rose to 49% from 43% in the prior period due to both lower core expenses and $2 million in regulatory fines collected which are accounted for as a contra expense. Equity derivatives trading and clearing net revenues fell $1 million due to a $2 million impact of FX partially offset by higher industry volumes. Cash equities trading, net revenues rose $9 million as higher volumes, primarily due to higher industry volumes in both the U.S. and the Nordics as well as higher U.S. market share were partially offset by 2 million in foreign exchange headwinds.","Fixed income currency and commodities trading and clearing net revenues fell 7 million from the prior year with declines in most FICC product categories, about 2 million in decline due to the scheduled reduction of revenues associated with an eSpeed technology license customer and 2 million in foreign exchange headwinds. In Access and Broker Services revenues were unchanged at 64 million with organic growth offset by 1 million in FX impact.","In listing services on page 9, we saw a 5% or 3 million increase in revenues due to an increased issuer base and more new issue activity while foreign exchange impact offset higher market capitalization of issuers on the European side. Operating margin of 38% was down 2 points from the prior year due to increased compensation and other temporary expenses associated with strong growth in the issuer base in 2014.","The issuer base has 5% more U.S. companies at the end of the quarter compared to the prior-year period, while in the Nordics the count is 4% higher with an 8% higher market capitalization.","Turning to pages 11 and 17 to review the income statement and expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased by $17 million or 5% from the prior year, due to 11 million in FX impact and 6 million of operational declines including the impact of the expense reduction initiatives in earlier 2014. Organic expenses fell 2% this quarter, assuming constant currency versus the prior-year period. Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $221 million up 7% from the prior-year period. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 43%, up 3 points from the prior-year period.","Net interest expense was $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of $2 million versus the prior year due to both lower levels of debt and the impact of foreign exchange on our Euro denominated debt. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 34%, in-line with our full year figure and in the middle of our 2014 33% to 35% effective tax guidance range.","Non-GAAP net income was $129 million or $0.75 per diluted share compared to $119 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2013. The $0.06 increase in our EPS year-over-year reflects a $0.09 improvement in our core operating profitability, a $0.01 benefit from lower interest expense offset by $0.04 of a negative impact from foreign exchange.","Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, NASDAQ will report non-GAAP expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS excluding the amortization of acquired intangibles. The change is designed to make non-GAAP measures better reflect the core cash earnings of the power of the company and to reflect changes in the way the company manages itself. On page 15 in the presentation, we have included a table to show how using this methodology would have changed non-GAAP operating expenses, operating income, operating margin, net income and EPS over the past four quarters and three years.","It is important to note that while we will be excluding amortization of acquired intangibles from our non-GAAP metrics, there will be no change in our return on invested capital discipline to prioritize capital return and deployment opportunities and determine whether they are in excess of our cost of capital requirements and thus there will be no lowering of the bar in terms of the returns we expect to generate when returning or deploying capital.","If you turn to page 12, we've introduced 2015 non-GAAP operating expense guidance which excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets in-line with our reporting in 2015. Our 2015 non-GAAP operating expense guidance based on average FX rates in the first half of January is 1.120 billion to 1.150 billion which includes 30 million to 40 million in research and development costs. The midpoint of our expense guidance corresponds to a low-single digits increase from 2014 non-GAAP operating expenses excluding the amortization of acquired intangibles of holding currency rates stable and excluding the impact of the Dorsey Wright acquisition. We also expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 33% to 35% in 2015.","Moving on to the balance sheet, please turn to slide 13. Our gross debt to EBITDA leverage ratio fell to 2.3 times from 2.4 times last quarter due to a decrease in the book value of foreign denominated debt and increased trailing 12 months EBITDA. We repurchased $58 million of stock in the fourth quarter bringing our repurchases since resuming our buyback program in the second quarter of 2014 to 178 million.","Reflecting this activity, we continue to believe share repurchases generate attractive returns for our shareholders and we will continue to be opportunistic and aggressive when we see attractive buying opportunities. As always, we will continue to put capital to the work where it generates the highest returns for our shareholders.","Thanks for your time and I'll now turn it back over to Ed.","Ed Ditmire","Operator, can you please open up the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Rich Repetto Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Rich Repetto","So I guess we're limited one question this time, so my question would be on NLX, Bob because you did address it in the prepared remarks and talking about the lower EPS loss. I guess could you explain a little bit deeper what efficiencies did you do? Was it the pricing changes or headcount and we're balancing that also off with - it looks like if the numbers are correct there is a material market share decline so far in January, so the other part of the question would be outlook on NLX if our market share declined, if it's correct, it stays in place.","Bob Greifeld","So first is as I said in my prepared remarks, we definitely figured out better ways to lever our existing infrastructure within Europe and other parts of the company, so we're able to do that quite efficiently without any really lessening of customer service. With respect to the market share, we've taken a different philosophy with incentives. I think it's a better long term philosophy, short term hit but this is about really growing the core interest and what we'll call the naturals in the marketplace. So we're actually satisfied with the progress we're making under the new way we're looking at the endeavor.","That being said I think the eventual long term success of NLX requires a new set of committed partners. Again as I said in my prepared remarks, we're excited about the progress we're making with those discussions but they are at the end of the day fundamental I think to the long term success of NLX.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Mike Carrier","I guess maybe for Lee, I just want to look at the organic growth and some of the nuances that are going on and maybe the drivers going forward. So if I look at like the second half of this year it looks like the organic growth is coming in maybe around 2% - 3% versus first half it was closer to that mid-single digit of 5% - 6%. So when I think about going forward, you guys have named some initiatives that you are working on to drive that growth back to the mid-single digits. When I think about like pricing moves that you've made on the positive side versus new product launches and taking market share versus maybe the environment or competitive pressures I just want to get a sense on what you think will get us to that level, like what will be the drivers if you can break that down?","Bob Greifeld","From an organic growth standpoint, correct Michael?","Mike Carrier","Yes that's right.","Bob Greifeld","Yes, so I think when you look at each of the segments of the business, let's go kind of just through the four individually. So in listing services, clearly the strength of the new issue market which we're seeing we continue to see a strong pipeline as well as we talked about we have some pricing increases that we're implementing, I think we feel very comfortable with the organic growth drivers within that segment as we see the business right now and over the intermediate term.","And when you look then secondly at the Information Services business, there again you see both product strength in terms of NASDAQ BASIC which is a primary contributor of our organic growth as well as selected pricing improvements that we've been able to make across the business and I would say generally further innovations in finding new products and development and in particular that's where we're very excited about the fresh look that Salil will bring to the business in helping us expand that business. The index business is fundamentally driven organically by the ongoing shift from active to passive management and the growth in our assets under management drives that. So all of those under pin our organic growth confidence in Information Services.","In Technology Solutions with market technology as you can see we had particular strength in order intake in that business. I think that's indicative of continued appetite among both large players like the Japan exchange as well as Singapore to upgrade their technology which is an opportunity for us. We continue to be the leading dominant player in that space so as that trend continues, we expect that will drive our growth plus growth in BWise which had record order intake as well as in our SMARTS business is evidence of us finding effective niches of products that are demonstrating good growth in that business.","And then in Corporate Solutions, while currently we continue to face both the FX headwinds and some of the challenges as we integrate and transition that business, we still have a fundamental optimism and confidence in the quality of the product platform that we're developing for those clients over the intermediate term and that will, that appetite not only product differentiation but I think a fundamental increase in the utilization of technology to meet the needs for corporate customers on the IR side, on the governance front, on multimedia and communication tools will continue to expand and create an opportunity for us. So those are all of the non-transactional businesses and the underpinning organic growth and then within the market services business, we of course believe that maintaining our competitiveness in that sector, our ability to grow our market share across all of our trading businesses but particularly with regard to the opportunity that we see at eSpeed in expanding beyond the on the run treasury sector into the off the run space is an opportunity for us to grow that business as well as the initiatives including NLX and others which we will continue to work towards delivering organic growth beyond an overall expectation of market growth as volumes respond to higher volatility.","So sorry, it's a long answer but I wanted touch on what we think are the underlying drivers of our organic growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Chris Harris","Wonder if you guys could comment a little bit on ICE's the proposal for Cash Equities and related to that knowing the customers and regulators like you do, what do you think the chances of something like this is actually going through?","Bob Greifeld","Well I would start by saying that we certainly support an active discussion of the underpinnings of the market under Reg NMS and we recognize there needs to be an improvement there. I think I said on some prior releases, we're also now focused on the art of the possible in terms of what's achievable so while we support ICE's efforts and other comments and trying to change the structure, we do understand how the wheels of the machinery down at the commission run. So I think most interesting is what we're trying to do proactively and you see it's basically next week Tom, right, we start the pilot where we put in a fee cap which has been strongly supported by the by side and with most members of the sell-side. So that's something we could do of our own power under our own control with strong support from the customers. We're doing it as a pilot. We'll study the data to the extent that it makes sense and improves market quality then we'll move along with that.","The only other thing I'll add as I've said previously, we think the concept to make or take is not by itself bad. The concept of rewarding somebody to provide information to the rest of the marketplace by showing their cards first is fine. We think it's not fine when that reward is the reason for the activity in and of itself so certainly, our concept of make being a valid approach is there in our pilot but you would also see then a reduction in the maker fee to give somebody the essence of the reward for initiating liquidity into the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Ken Worthington","I want to follow-up on Rich's question on NLX. I'll phrase it a little differently. It looks like volume is your [inaudible] is now down to 2000 contracts a day. You've been running at 50 to 60 in November and 50 to 80 in October. So how does your approach of letting volume fall as much as it has, help NASDAQ find the partner that you're looking for and then you've announced the launch of energy future products. Why is that experience going to be different than what we've seen thus far in interest rates and I guess will it be as costly?","Bob Greifeld","Let me start with the first. So in consultation with our customers, they definitely educated us in saying that while the market share success of NLX in the beginning days was interesting and certainly served as an advertising mechanism to draw their interest and to draw them into further conversations with us, at the end of the day the question was what kind of natural flow are you bringing into the marketplace and how are you growing open interest over time? So that's been our focus and kind of a pivot point come December. The benefit there it allows us to basically reduce our burn rate in addition to other things we did to lever our infrastructure.","So that's been positively received by the customers and I would say the key point is that NLX has established credibility with the potential partners in that we're obviously up or operational. We're live. We have a broad distribution in the marketplace between all the different ISVs and number of direct connections into the marketplace.","We have a demonstrated ability when necessary to attract market share to the platform and very importantly also we're clearing through LCH and we're supporting the horizontal clearing model and as I said previously, we don't have yet to find a single customer who wants to be in a vertical monopoly. So we're addressing that need for them.","So we're basically very pleased with the reduction in the burn rate. We're pleased I think with the new strategy and we're also pleased with the discussions that are ongoing. And I'll also say with NLX, it's important to recognize based on the new approach we do have in addition to partner discussions a number of new FCMs who are in various stages of connecting to us so far so good there.","With respect to a product which we have not announced, there is a newspaper report on it but we haven't fully announced anything on it. As I\u2019ve said in my prepared remarks when customers come to us we do listen and we do understand as I said before the customers like to see some way out of a monopoly type situation. We understand that here in the U.S. as we build our futures franchise and our integration into the clearing infrastructure most notably OCC that we have abilities to do things at a relatively low cost and I would also say that anything we might contemplate with the other asset classes will definitely be well informed by our experiences with NLX and I think we would have a very focused effort if we decide to go in that direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Bedell","Let me ask a Capital Management question. I guess with some of the weaker revenue trends from the two bigger acquisitions of E-speed and Thomson Reuters versus initial expectations obviously the cost control and synergies are going to continue to be good there but does that change your view on capital allocation toward more stock buyback on a longer term basis? Maybe if you can just talk about your acquisition strategy?","Bob Greifeld","Well the first thing I would say is the eSpeed acquisition and Thomson Reuters acquisition, well with any acquisition you always - it doesn't go exactly the way you want, we feel very good about the fact that we're in a better competitive position today than we were a year ago and I think you could argue that we're in a significantly better competitive position in both of those businesses than we were one year ago.","So that always forebodes well for financial performance in the future so we're happy about that and clearly we're seeing some uptick in eSpeed and also in Corporate Solutions so trend lines are in fact positive.","Responding to your question directly, we have to look at each situation individually and make our assessments. I think your direct question would be if you look at an acquisition and you're assuming large revenue growth we clearly recognize that that increases the risk profile and it's a dramatic risk profile increase to assuming expense synergies so we do use that to guide some of our thinking. It's very hard for us to consider any acquisition where we have a hockey stick revenue growth and in the last year we have not been successful in a number of different bidding situations because of our discipline with respect to one, the return we need but two, in terms of just our clinical view of what the revenue growth opportunities are.","Brian Bedell","Okay, sounds like your greater discipline on the pricing side might skew you towards more buyback in the future again depending on how the properties are come up?","Bob Greifeld","I wouldn't want to say anything definitive. I would say we look at each situation and each particular point in time as unique opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao","So a question on Corporate Solutions, can you slice your margin expansion plan for 2015 further, specifically if you were to assume flat revenues and layer in incremental expense that you identified, where would margins be? Basically trying to just get a sense of how revenue dependent that new margin target is?","Lee Shavel","Yes, so Ashley, I think that the range that we provided for the fourth quarter I think reflects our current expectations for both the continued cost synergies as well as for revenue expectations for the business. So certainly if we're more successful on the revenue side, then I think we will be to the higher end of that range and then at the lower side if we don't have that success. I will continue to mention that 2015 will as we've discussed before continue to be an integration year as we're migrating from a larger number of platforms to a smaller number of platforms that unlocks the opportunities for us to drive further cost savings, but it also subjects us to transitions with our clients and customers that we try to manage as carefully and as effectively as possible but that takes time from the team focusing on those issues as opposed to sales efforts but we think that as we can successfully complete that process, we'll be able to move more and more focus to the sales growth side and that will translate into stronger revenue growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alex Blostein","So question on eSpeed, just when you take a step back and you think about where the market share was in the fourth quarter and I think you guys have alluded to potential pick up towards the end of the year as you move into new centers. What do you think went the other way for you guys so that you actually lost a little bit of market share and then just a follow-up, I guess on the intangible charge this quarter, the $49 million. Is that essentially eSpeed related? Or is that a related to number of intangibles?","Bob Greifeld","Let me start with the first part of your question, Lee can address the second. So when you look at our customer mix, we recognize that we're more indexed to volatility. So as volatility comes into the marketplace the predominance of our customers enjoy that and trade more actively so in periods of low volatility our markets share will skew lower than I think its baseline rate and during heightened volatility I think you'll see the opposite.","So the important point is we're in good situations with all our customer which is we could not say a year ago and certainly we see increased volatility in the fourth quarter going into the first quarter which is serving us well, so we're pleased with the positioning and as we've said before, we're somewhat uniquely able to extend the product set in that we don't have a voice brokerage component that would argue against that and we have the soft role of short shorts this week and we're looking forward to making that in full production the next couple of weeks so we're excited.","Lee Shavel","And Alex, on the asset impairment, the 49 million approximately 80% of that or 38 million was attributable to an impairment that we took on the eSpeed customer list and I think it's important to note that when we make the acquisition you apply the excess of the purchase price above the fair value to a variety of intangible assets. The smaller one of those was the customer relationships, it's more specifically related to the expected revenues from the existing customer base at that time and as a result of our deliberate pricing actions to move towards a more hybrid pricing model including more variable fees in this lower volume environment, that reduced the amount of revenue associated with that existing customer list so we took a partial impairment of that asset. We did not impair the longer term intangible of trade name for that. We continued to believe that the value of that asset is in excess of our carrying value and importantly that's not just our judgment. It's also the judgment of our external valuation experts that provide those valuations to us.","The other amount of the 49 million beyond the eSpeed customer list impairments are a variety of different technology assets that we have decided to write-off. They are no longer contributing to the business, an association of approximately 13 items that contribute to that additional 11 million in the 49 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW. Your line is open.","Niamh Alexander","Just to kind of loop back on the solid expense guidance, I want to correspond maybe some of that because the core expense guidance excluding the intangibles was better than we expected. You're kind of modeling flat year-on-year and I'm just trying to parse out maybe some of that as exchange rate related and then I guess relating back to your slide 4 on your revenue guidance, like the Information and the Technology Solutions targeting mid-single digits, if we assume I'm sure the exchange rates will change but if we assume there is no change from now so already we're kind of at a stronger dollar versus where you are a year ago, should we still be kind of modeling mid-single digits or should we be adjusting that for now adjusting it lower for a stronger dollar?","Bob Greifeld","Well our guidance is that it's longer term guidance and so it's first of all, that's organic growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. So when we provide those organic numbers in the chart on page 4 of the presentation those are at constant currency, Niamh, so that's the changes or fluctuations in foreign exchange rate won't influence the numbers that we're reporting there nor the overall guidance that we've provided.","Niamh Alexander","So for our modeling purposes we should kind of adjust now for where those exchange rates are now and maybe all else equal I guess bring that down a little bit to adjust for the lower non-dollar stuff is that fair?","Bob Greifeld","Yes, I would say it think our expectation in looking at where the analyst consensus expenses are is that they have probably have not updated for current foreign exchange rates. That's why it may look flat to lower than where we're and so when we set the 2015 guidance what we're looking at is average foreign exchange rates in January to determine that number, so I think that adjustment needs to be made and then we've also given you guidance in terms of the additional expenses from the Dorsey, Wright acquisition which would be approximately $10 million on an annual basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Stratton with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Neil Stratton","I just wanted to ask a question about the listings business. There was a price increase which would have affected 2015 and also a change to a new fee schedule which is optional but mandatory in 2018. Just wanted to get any color around what the revenue pick up could be year-over-year from that? Thanks.","Bob Greifeld","Well it's certainly coming in higher than we anticipated and Adena, what are we looking at, 5 million?","Adena Friedman","Right. So I think that if we were to look at 2015 versus 2014, just on the fee increase it's approximately 10 million.","Neil Stratton","And just along with it how do you see the sort of the all-inclusive comparing to the prior fee schedule? Is that a net benefit to NASDAQ? How do you see that shaping up?","Bob Greifeld","I think it's a win-win and it's obviously a net benefit to us but our customers also like it because they have a better ability to budget for the year, they did not like getting middle of the year listing of additional shares fees. So this is a way for them to avoid that, so it's been very, very well received. The uptake was we give them the option, the uptake was higher than we anticipated so we're happy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore. Your line is open.","Chris Allen","Most of my questions have been answered. I guess just one quick on one U.S. equity options. We\u2019ve seen some nice market share gains from [inaudible] in the Miami Exchange in recent months; it seems to be coming out of Philex and AMEX. I was just wondering if you could provide any color in terms of competitive dynamics for the industry right now what you guys are seeing.","Bob Greifeld","Yes, right now our market share lead over our nearest competitor is higher than it ever has been historically. So I think we're six points higher than number two when you put our different assets together but so between Philex and BX, were at an all-time high, so we have certainly seen market share gains from us versus some other competitors, I don't need to go into names but we're very pleased with our market share positioning.","Operator","And that concludes the Q&A session. I'll now turn the call back over to Bob Greifeld, CEO for closing remarks.","Bob Greifeld","Great. Well as I said in my prepared remarks, it was truly an outstanding quarter and outstanding year. We're happy to be delivering to our investor's record results. Our businesses are better positioned than they were before. Our management team is in place and positioned to grow this institution over time and I think we're striking the right balance between focus on core operational efficiency, investment in R&D and strategic acquisitions. So we like to stay at the - of the franchise at this point in time. We appreciate your support and look forward to getting back to you again in the next quarters to come. So thank you everybody.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and Gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect and everyone have a great day."],"15529":["Nasdaq, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ed Ditmire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Edward P. Ditmire - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's third quarter 2015 earnings results. On the line are Bob Greifeld, our CEO, Lee Shavel, CFO; our Co-Presidents, Adena Friedman and Hans-Ole Jochumsen; Ed Knight, our General Counsel; and other members of the management team.","After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.","I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I now will turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's third quarter 2015 results. I'm here today joining this call from our London office, an important and growing hub for many of our businesses. It's always a pleasure to visit this great city.","Turning to our performance in the third quarter, I am pleased to announce that this franchise delivered its best quarter ever in terms of revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, pre-tax income, net income and diluted EPS. What is even more interesting to me is that we delivered record results again for our shareholders despite significant FX headwinds, all the while we continue to heavily invest in our future.","During the quarter, we're also pleased to see accelerating organic growth, not only in our market services segment, which benefited from favorable macro factors, but also across our non-transactional segments. Positive organic revenue growth, which excludes foreign exchange and acquisition impacts, was contributed by all four business segments.","Because of our continued strong execution and the significant cash generation our model delivers, we were in a position to be able to return almost $300 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends during the period. This is certainly a prized position that all companies strive to achieve and one that Nasdaq is pleased to be able to achieve this quarter.","Today, I want to focus the bulk of my remarks again on the strength of our business model and how that is contributing not only to results we saw during this quarter, but how it is also creating additional upside opportunities across the franchise.","We talk a lot here at Nasdaq about innovation and our ambition to lead change on behalf of our clients is a core tenet of our culture. We also, however, greatly respect the value of consistency. Consistency not only in the way we run our business, effectiveness first and then efficiency, but also consistency in our approach to building a robust and resilient business model.","When you look at the results we continue to deliver quarter-after-quarter, we have the right ingredients. And the power of our model was especially evident this quarter with both the trading and non-trading business segments hitting their strides.","Our market services segments saw a very robust 12% organic growth, excluding FX, which was driven in significant part by the impact of market volatility, which it had on volumes. But this was also amplified by healthy capture rates and leading market share positions in the vast majority of the markets we compete in.","In addition, we saw a significant jump in organic growth across our non-trading segments, which combined reached 8% and was driven by double-digit performances in both listings and the information services segments, as well as improvements in technology solutions.","One of the benefits of our strategy to compete in businesses that are levered to technology as well as our disciplined approach to expenses and capital deployment is that our model affords us an ability to deliver bottom-line growth that meaningfully outpaces revenue growth.","For example, excluding the impact of FX, but including the 2% revenue impact of the Dorsey Wright acquisition, revenue increased 11% year-on-year, operating income increased 13% and EPS grew 17%, with the last four points of growth largely due to capital deployment, including repurchases and income associated with the OCC recapitalization.","To me the most attention grabbing aspect of our performance is that we're still in what I would consider a building phase. There is much more upside on our horizon, especially given the growth initiatives we have in our pipeline, including NASDAQ Private Market; a new energy derivatives market, NFX; the work we're putting into corporate solutions business; and the innovations we're implementing across many of our other products.","Now I would like to turn and highlight some of the more notable areas of our strong performance during the quarter. As I emphasized earlier in my remarks, our core businesses continue to deliver. Revenues from our foundational cash equities, trading and listing businesses combined are up over 27% year-over-year on an organic basis, excluding FX, a very strong performance.","Global cash equity trading rose 39% on an organic basis, resulting in one of our best revenue quarters in over the last seven years, truly outstanding. Our listing businesses rose 17% on an organic basis as we capitalized on the strong supply of new listings leveraging the firm's strongest competitive positioning in the company's history and higher average pricing.","Our expanding value proposition continues to attract companies as evidenced by our expanding U.S. IPO win rate, which reached 80% during the quarter, helping to bring our IPO count for the year to 111. Our total number of U.S. listings rose 4% compared to the prior year period.","NASDAQ has listed more IPOs than any other U.S. exchange this year, with combined proceeds raised of approximately $13.6 billion. The companies that continue to be drawn to the expanding portfolio of services we offer include a diverse mix of technology, consumer and energy brands. In the third quarter, we're pleased to again welcome wonderful brands to our market, including Blue Buffalo, TerraForm, MasterCraft and Sunrun, to name a few.","Equally exciting for us is the recent announcement that wireless provider, T-Mobile, a $30 billion plus market cap company, will switch its listing to Nasdaq. Our competitive spirit has never been stronger and we are pleased to welcome T-Mobile to the Nasdaq family. In our Nordic markets, we continue to see an equally robust performance. The third quarter had nine new listings and total listings are up 7% compared to the prior year.","We are excited about our prospects and our ability to continue to attract new listings as we further enhance our value proposition with more client-centric product and services. A great example of this is our new IPO indicator, which we introduced earlier this year. The indicator provides real-time transparency about a stock throughout the IPO open event and client feedback has been very, very positive.","Another area of our business that continues to contribute meaningfully to our results is the information services segment. Over the last year, we have been reshaping our strategy in this business to align more tightly with the needs of our clients in a way that leverages our core expertise in data and index benchmarking. Our acquisition of Dorsey Wright & Associates is a good example of a sound execution of that strategy.","Since announcing this acquisition at the beginning of the year, we have experienced significant growth, with AUM up nearly 70% year-to-date and revenue run rates nearly doubling. More broadly, we have about 43% of the AUM licensed to NASDAQ indices and smart beta products. And we expect continued growth in investor appetite for smart beta strategies. We're excited to be in a leading position in this segment and to bring innovative products to our clients.","In data products, we've added new talent to the team and are investing in new kinds of informational and analytical products with a goal of broadening our opportunities set, while continuing to grow the value inherent in our current product portfolio. I mentioned before the most revealing aspect of our record performance this quarter is that it was primarily driven by organic growth in our foundational businesses.","When you factor in the areas we're investing in the future, we believe there is much more growth and upside for this franchise. Let me highlight a few of them for you. A perfect example of how we tap into this potential at Nasdaq is NFX, a new global commodities venture which we launched in late July. NFX is a direct response to our customers and their desire for more efficient and competitive energy market. Now in its third month of operation, we are seeing noteworthy uptake by the trading community with over 70 firms having already executed trades on the platform and activity levels building. We set another record again yesterday.","One aspect of NFX's performance we're particularly encouraged by is the rising open interest on the platform. Yesterday, we passed 300,000 contracts, truly remarkable. This is including customer positions with durations reaching several years out on the curve, an indication of the confidence and support of end users, not just intermediaries and liquidity providers.","We also believe strong open interest trends bode well for continued ramp in transaction volumes. We're extremely encouraged by our progress in the short time we've been up and running and are excited about the opportunity to grow this venue and hit the longer term objectives we've established.","A core principle at Nasdaq is that clients come first. We have always maintained that Nasdaq was more than a listing venue. We've expanded the ecosystem of solutions we offer companies at all stages of the development and the value we provide to them. The NASDAQ Private Market or NPM is a good example of how we're filling an important need in the marketplace for private growth companies.","This business represents a sizable opportunity for us. NPM has strong demand today with 120 private companies using our platform to manage their liquidity and equity ownership needs. And there were approximately 20 additions this quarter alone, including such great companies as Legal Zoom, Mixpanel and Farfetch.","In addition, we are very pleased to announce today we have reached an agreement to acquire SecondMarket Solutions. SecondMarket is a recognized innovator in facilitating liquidity for private company securities. SecondMarket and its talented team will join the Nasdaq family and help to strengthen our offerings to clients as well as add meaningful scale to our efforts with bicoastal operations.","We are continuing to find ways to inject innovation into this business and help enhance our offerings. In fact, we plan to bringing further benefits and efficiencies to private companies through the use of blockchain technology and NPM. We will bring a distributed ledger that will bring increased security, speed, and efficiency to tracking a company's ownership. We'll have the ability to settle and clear trades in 10 minutes as compared to three days which we see in the public market. We have identified several clients who will be included in initial beta pilot expected to launch by the end of this year.","Finally, another area where our efforts are positioning us to improve growth and profitability is in our corporate solutions business. We have made strategic investments in our core platforms built for IR, PR, communication and governance professionals. In addition, we have further integrated our content, insight, and tools to further differentiate our offering as well as enhance all of our client touch points from back-office billing systems to account management.","The results of our efforts are starting to emerge. For the third quarter in a row, we're seeing positive net subscription sales, which is extremely encouraging as we work to transform the business and drive organic growth. In addition, we're on target for the launch of our fully featured version of the IR Insight platform which is expected by the end of this year.","IR Insights will provide us with a foundation to support innovative new product features and enhancements for the months and the years to come. In addition, by integrating information and technology from our broader suite of solutions in unique ways to solve our customers' challenges, we can accelerate adoption of other corporate solutions products.","Up to this point, I have highlighted the various ways our model is moving the franchise forward, delivering for clients and shareholders. Now, I want to spend a few minutes updating you on our deployment of capital. Our model generates significant cash flow and, with it, adds opportunities for us to be aggressive in how we deploy this capital.","Thus far, in 2015, through our stock buyback program and our increased dividend, we returned $418 million in capital to investors, equal to 97% of our non-GAAP net income generated in the same period. And we're very pleased we've been able to deliver these concrete awards from our success to our shareholders.","But, more importantly, our future is built on how well we will seize new opportunities. A big part of our capital allocation strategy is ensuring we're investing in our future and in the core businesses that will drive our growth and our returns.","We have the great ability to, one, return capital to our shareholders; two, invest in organic growth opportunities; and three, make informed, value creating acquisitions. We're as equally excited by our share buyback and dividend program as by our organic growth initiatives such as NPM and NFX and also by our acquisitions such as SecondMarket and DWA.","To me, it's truly ideal when you're in a position to invest at high levels for your future while still returning meaningful amounts of capital to investors. We will continue to look for opportunities to best use our capital and that will provide meaningful growth and returns to our investors.","Finally, I would like to say a few words about how we measure success here at Nasdaq, because it's particularly important in light of the results we delivered this quarter. When we look at how we're growing as a firm, we don't only look at financial metrics. We also look at how our businesses are progressing.","Our success metrics are based on how well we strengthen our competitive position. We know that when we focus on serving our clients and improving our products and solutions, financial performance will always follow. That is our mindset.","In addition, we continue to enhance and adjust our operational effectiveness and efficiency across the organization and are structuring our talent and resources so we are as effective as possible in running our business and serving our clients. This will always be a key priority for us. I have confidence in our model and the future of this franchise as we work to strengthen our competitive position to deliver results for our clients and shareholders.","Again, we're very pleased to deliver a record quarter for our shareholders. It is a visible result of good teamwork by everyone here at Nasdaq. I would like to thank our employees, our clients and our shareholders for their continued support. We are encouraged by all the positive trends across our business during the quarter. And we're confident we're on the right path to take this franchise to new levels in the quarters to come.","And, with that, I'll turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Shavel - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. The following comments will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.","I want to start off as I did the last few quarters by highlighting the impact the stronger dollar had on our results as it obscures in many cases the solid organic growth of our business. Excluding the impact of FX, our revenues would have been up $55 million or 11% from the prior year and operating income would have been up $30 million or 13%.","In order to provide a greater understanding of these effects on the business units, we continue to provide a schedule of FX impact on the revenues for each business unit on page 15 of the presentation. So let's start by reviewing third quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter as shown on page three of the presentation.","The 6% or $32 million increase in reported net revenue of $529 million consisted of organic growth in the non-trading segments' revenue of $24 million or 8% due to growth in listings, information services and market technology, plus $9 million in revenues from the Dorsey Wright acquisition, reduced by a $12 million FX impact for a net $21 million increase in reported revenues.","Organic growth in market services net revenues of $22 million or 12%, resulting principally from higher cash equity revenues, reduced by an $11 million FX impact for a net $11 million reported increase.","Moving to page four in the presentation, we show how organic growth breaks down historically between the non-transaction, information services, technology solutions, and listing services segments, which had 8% organic growth this quarter and the volume sensitive market services segment at 12% for the quarter.","Looking at our year-to-date 2015 results, we have achieved 5% organic growth for our non-transaction segments, consistent with our mid single-digit medium-term guidance, and returning to the level that we achieved in 2013. In market services, we have achieved 4% organic growth for the year-to-date 2015 period, reflecting the positive inflection we've seen over the past two quarters with increased market volatility.","On the bottom of the page, we reiterate our views on the medium-term organic growth outlook for the non-transactional segments. And, as I've said in the past, these views were meant to reflect multi-year cross-cycle periods. And actual growth in shorter periods can be above or below these ranges. Let's now go over some of the highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted.","Information services on page five saw a $12 million or 11% organic increase, plus a $9 million increase from the Dorsey Wright acquisition, reduced by a $3 million FX impact or an $18 million net increase in reported revenues, while the operating margin came in at 73%, down slightly from 74% in the prior year due to FX impact.","This consisted of market data revenues producing an $11 million or 12% organic increase, reflecting growth in tape plan and proprietary revenues, as well as index licensing and services, which saw a $1 million or 5% organic increase from higher non-QQQ licensing revenues with a 20% growth in non-QQQ assets under management and higher futures volumes reduced by a decline in QQQ assets under management and associated licensing fees.","Technology solutions, as shown on page six, saw a $2 million or 1% organic revenue increase, reduced by a $6 million FX impact, resulting in a $4 million reported decline. The operating margin was 15%, down from an exceptionally strong 17% in the prior year period. This consisted of market technology revenues which saw a $3 million or 5% organic increase due in particular to growth in our smart surveillance product revenues.","New order intake was $83 million in the third quarter and new order activity continues to be healthy with a number of significant new contracts in the traditional market tech business as well as smarts and BWise. And it's worth noting that the period end backlog finished at a record $738 million, up about 16% year-over-year.","Corporate solutions revenue saw a $1 million or 1% organic decline, in line with the prior quarter, as we continue to progress through the late stages of the integration and customer transitions from the acquisition of the Thomson Reuters corporate business. We continue to see solid momentum in the business, particularly with the third consecutive quarter of net positive subscription sales of $3 million, up from $2 million in the prior quarter and $1 million in the first quarter of 2015.","We also continue to receive very positive feedback on the new IR Insight platform to be launched on January 1, 2016, and saw particularly strong 23% new sales growth from the prior quarter in our legacy Thomson One platform in anticipation of migration to the new platform.","In listing services, on page seven, we saw a $10 million or 17% organic increase in revenues, driven by pricing changes and an increased issuer base, reduced by $3 million of FX impact, resulting in a $7 million increase in reported revenue. Operating margin of 44% was up from 42% in the prior year. The U.S. issuer base has 4% more companies at the end of the quarter compared to the prior year period while in the Nordics the count is 7% higher.","Market services, on page eight, saw a $22 million or 12% organic increase in net revenues, reduced by an $11 million FX impact resulting in an $11 million increase in reported revenue. Operating margin rose to 55% from 52% in the prior period as a result of the operating leverage implicit in that business.","Equity derivatives trading and clearing net revenues saw a 6% organic increase, primarily due to higher U.S. derivative capture and higher industry volumes, partially offset by a decline in overall market share at our three U.S. options exchanges.","Cash equities trading net revenues saw a 39% organic increase as higher cash equity average capture and increased industry volumes were partially offset by modestly lower market shares. Cash equity revenues were at our highest levels since the third quarter of 2011 and U.S. cash equity revenues were at our highest levels since the second quarter of 2010.","Fixed income, currency and commodities trading and clearing net revenues saw a 13% organic decline from the prior year with principally volume-driven declines in several important FICC product categories like U.S. fixed income and European energy, as well as the end of revenues from an eSpeed technology license which terminated as planned at the end of 2014. Access and broker services revenues saw a 5% organic revenue increase.","Turning to pages nine and 14 to review the income statement and expenses, operating expenses increased by $25 million or 9% on an organic basis, partially offset by $60 million in FX impact, resulting in a $9 million or 3% reported increase. I note here that while we saw an increase in compensation accrual in the current third quarter as a result of the strong operating performance, the prior year period conversely saw some revenue softness in both trading and non-transactional businesses that drove a release of certain accrued incentive compensation and thus the unusually high year-on-year comparison.","To minimize the volatility of the quarter-to-quarter compensation accrual variation can bring to the year-over-year expense comparisons I point to the year-to-date comparison where operating expenses are up 3% compared to the prior year period on an organic basis.","Non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter rose 13% on an organic basis but this was partially offset by foreign exchange, resulting in a 10% reported increase. And non-GAAP operating margin came in at 48%, up from 46% in the prior year period, reflecting the improvement of our trading businesses and their margins.","Net interest expense was $27 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $1 million versus the prior year, mainly due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange related to our euro-denominated debt. We also recorded non-operating income related to our equity method ownership interest in OCC.","The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 34%, at the midpoint of our 2015 33% to 35% effective tax rate guidance range for the year. Non-GAAP net income was $151 million or $0.88 per diluted share compared to $136 million or $0.78 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2014.","A $0.10 increase in our non-GAAP EPS year-over-year reflects core organic EPS growth of $0.10; an additional $0.02 due to acquisitions, principally Dorsey Wright; $0.01 due to higher other income; $0.01 higher due to lower share count; partially offset by a $0.03 impact of changes in foreign exchange rates; and a $0.01 decrease due to the higher effective tax rate.","Moving on to the balance sheet, cash flow, and capital, please turn to slides 11 and 12. Our gross debt to EBITDA leverage ratio increased to 2.3 times from 2.2 at June 30, 2015, due to a small increase in our debt level as we drew on revolver capacity to fund the stock repurchases, partially offset by increased trailing 12-month EBITDA.","I want to take a moment to discuss the material repurchases in the quarter, which were well above recent average quarterly levels. The company was in a strong position in terms of balance sheet flexibility both in terms of our leverage as well as the strong capital generation in the period. Valuation was attractive, especially relative to the valuations we were seeing for assets in the M&A market and also considering the opportunity that the more volatile market provided.","So we acted opportunistically as we have in the past to put a larger than typical amount of capital to work in the buyback program, continuing an aspect of our capital deployment discipline that has generated very high returns for Nasdaq shareholders over the years. We continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy capital across the full spectrum of internal, external and capital return alternatives and are always looking for the best returns to guide our use of capital.","Thanks for your time this morning. And I will turn it back over to Ed.","Edward P. Ditmire - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Operator, can you please open the lines for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. You may begin.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning, Bob. Good morning, Lee.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","How are you doing, Rich?","Lee Shavel - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Good morning, Rich.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I am doing fine. I appreciate you both addressed the capital return program and especially the accelerated buyback. But I guess my one question would be on the follow-up to that. So you did draw \u2013 when you look at \u2013 you did drawdown on the revolver and this just wasn't a 2x or 3x the prior quarter buyback. This was a 10x. And I am just trying to see when you look at the stock price, yeah, it broke $50 but it had broke $50 in both the other prior two quarters. So just trying to understand how you balance a little bit more and I know you addressed it, both of you, in the prepared remarks, but how you balance the three things: the cap return, acquisitions, and investment? And then what can we expect going forward? Can we see this lumpy buyback program going forward? I know shareholders like the buyback, but, anyway, your color.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","All right. So, Rich, not even a good quarter or a very good quarter? I was living through your compliment there, Rich.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Excellent quarter, Bob. You outperformed.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Thank you. Thank you. I feel better now. All right. So I think Lee touched on it, but I would say this. Probably the trigger was, as I said before, we've looked at a lot of different acquisitions during the last 12 months to 18 months. And some of the multiples that were being paid were in our mind somewhat eye-popping and somewhat representative of a little bit of an asset bubble. And we said okay. If this is the state of play and it's going to going to be this way and we have no interest in paying 18 times EBITDA, we probably have a better use for our capital. And that is to buy our own shares which obviously we're not trading at that.","So I think ourselves and management and the board reflected upon it and came to that conclusion and obviously decided it was the time to act. Now, this obviously represents a lumpiness, as you said, as nothing that we can do on a consistent basis. But you do have to recognize it over the fullness of time, as you've seen in the last three years to four years, we will be acquiring our shares when we think it represents a particular opportunity for us to create value for our shareholders.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. I know. I follow that \u2013 the acquisition sort of environment but the levering up a little bit, I guess, is something new. But, anyway, I don't want to ask any more questions. I got my one. Thanks.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Allen with Evercore. You may begin.","Christopher John Allen - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Thank you Chris.","Christopher John Allen - Evercore Group LLC","Just wanted to touch on corporate solutions. You mentioned that you're seeing positive net subscription sales for the third quarter in a row. Wondering if maybe you can give us a reference in terms of how material that is. The revenue trajectory obviously hasn't been \u2013 it hasn't been great. It sounds like a lot to do with FX. Just wondering where you stand from a competitive pressure standpoint other than issuing prior quarters. Just trying to get a better sense of when we can start to see the trajectory start to improve from here?","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Okay. So, as we said before, certainly, we will make progress with corporate solutions during this year. And I think under Adena's leadership, we've done a very good job there. But we also recognize there is certain element of a holding pattern to this year. And that we are spending a lot of time, effort and money and I think very intense engagement with our customers as we start the next-gen product. So I think this quarter represents a strong trend line which we expect to accelerate as we go into the new product cycle in 2016. Adena, would you like to add to that?","Adena T. Friedman - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Sure. So, Chris, I think that we are seeing definitely some clients very excited about the new platform. And, as Lee mentioned, we're seeing acceleration of new sales in the IR Insight business because of the new platform coming down the road. Also, Q3 does tend to represent a seasonally low quarter with regard to revenue because of the fact that some of our revenue recognition comes from using certain services in a quarter. And there are fewer press releases issued and there are fewer web conferences held during the third quarter just because of the holiday season. So that also tends to be reflected in the third quarter results for corporate solutions. But, overall, we are seeing positive momentum in the business and the competitive landscape does continue to be very competitive. But we are feeling good about the trajectory of the business in general.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","And I would tie back to the comments I made in my prepared remarks. It's definitely a hallmark of Nasdaq here that we have to first look at our competitive positioning and how we were doing in that positioning in, certainly relative to our peers. And to the extent we improve that competitive positioning, the financial results will follow. So we saw evidence of that in the third quarter. And, again, I highlight. We are spending a lot of time, effort and money for what will represent truly innovation in the IR space. And we're excited to be able to launch that product going into the first quarter of next year.","Christopher John Allen - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Rutschow with CLSA. You may begin.","Rob C. Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","How are you doing, Rob?","Rob C. Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Good. I was hoping to follow-up on Chris's question about corporate solutions. I think the product that you're rolling out is very impressive and should certainly help arrest some of the customer attrition you've had. I am hoping that you might be able to give us some metrics around what your customer attrition is in the corporate solutions business. And even if you can't give us exact numbers, kind of at least an order of magnitude that that in a new product might help address.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Yeah. So I would say, one, we don't have exact numbers. And we can certainly think of how we'd come up with them. But we are on a net basis seeing growth in our customer list right now. So we're excited about that. And, as I said, we're increasing the number of wins that we have. And this is all a prelude to major new products coming towards the end of the year. Adena, do you want to embellish that?","Adena T. Friedman - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Sure. So I think that we do, in fact, provide some information regarding our overall retention rates within the business. And we are experiencing just below 90% retention but that generally has been consistent. There are certain parts of our business that are improving in those numbers and there's also certain parts of the business that are well above that. But we do track that and we are seeing improvements in key parts of the business in the retention rate.","But that retention rate includes, well, call it, uncontrollable cancels related to mergers, acquisitions and bankruptcies, as well as other things in terms of clients having to move away from services due to budget constraints. At the same time, we also feel that we are seeing, I think, very good growth in those retention rates in some of our key products and we continue to track that very carefully.","Lee Shavel - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","And may I just add a little directional color, Rob, to Adena's response is that in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, we saw improvements in all of our products from a retention standpoint with the exception of our advisory product which has been a competitive sector for us. And the IR Desktop retention remains steady over that period. So I would say kind of broad improvement. There always are going to be one or two products where we have faced some additional pressure and in this period advisory was that one.","Rob C. Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Wondering if -","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","How are you doing, Chris?","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, doing well. Wondering if you could talk to any revenue synergies and I'm really thinking mainly here of cross-sell opportunities. You guys might be getting out of all the businesses you put together. It's kind of hard for us to see that looking from the outside. But just wondering if you can comment \u2013 if this is happening and to the extent it's happening.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Are you talking about any particular business?","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, just really across the entire franchise in the aggregate. Whether you guys are seeing opportunities to cross-sell? I know that IR, the Thomson Reuters acquisition was a new customer set relative to a lot of the existing customers at Nasdaq, more broadly.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Right. So let me start with the transaction business. When you look at the initiatives we have, whether that be the Tom initiative, NLX, NFX, things we're doing with respect to our dark pool strategy, it's all based upon us building a solid foundation of relationship with our customers. We definitely take customer input to guide how we invest in internal R&D. And we're seeing definitely the fruits of that labor here.","Obviously, on the corporate solutions side, our listing franchise, we have a deep relationship at the very highest level of those companies. And that's a natural point of leverage with us. But it's also important to recognize we have 10,000 customers. And many of them are not listed with us. And in that situation, the breadth of our product line allows us to walk the halls in a more comprehensive fashion than our competitors who tend to be point solution providers can do.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Lee Shavel - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","And I just want to add, again some directional color. One thing that we're tracking in corporate solutions is, on a quarterly basis, the average number of products per client, average revenue per client, and we have seen steady progress in both of those metrics which, I think, is a sign of continued success in working off of that existing customer base and selling additional products and generating more revenue from it. So that's something that we're watching carefully and are pleased with the specific progress that we've made over the past four quarters.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. You may begin.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","How are you doing?","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Doing well. I was curious if I now look at all the initiatives that you have right now more on the trading side, the NFX, NLX, what's the current drag on EPS from a combination of those two?","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Lee, do you have that number?","Lee Shavel - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, Ashley, first of all, both of those initiatives are within the GIFT expenses, which, in aggregate, is in the $30 million to $40 million range as we've provided from a guidance standpoint. But, as we've said previously, NLX is approximately $0.02 per quarter and NFX is below that level. So that gives you some sense of the aggregate scale of those initiatives on a quarterly basis.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And just following-up on trading, one of the initiatives that the press is reporting you're going to be launching next year is FX. I was hoping if you could just share some color on what your intentions are in that arena and how do you see yourself differentiating yourselves from your peers? Was that as \u2013 that happens to be one market where pricing definitely matters.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Yeah. So I can't speak for what you're reading in the press, but we haven't announced any FX initiatives or launching next year. I am sitting here in London with Hans-Ole. Hans-Ole, have you announced anything without telling me? So, yeah. So I don't know where you're getting that information but it's not correct.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So there is no initiative in play?","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Right.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. All right. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. You may begin.","Kyle K. Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Kyle K. Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Just turn to NLX again, I mean just given that another large exchange that's just announced the planned launch of an interest rate futures exchange in Europe, can you just talk about your commitment to NLX and how you feel that you can fare from a competitive perspective or what the value proposition will be going forward? Thanks.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Definitely, definitely. So, one, I would say is obviously that announcement was not unexpected. And I think it was expected many months before. So it was no surprise there. But clearly we're in close touch with our customers. And I would say that since that announcement, we've reconfirmed with our customers that there is no change in plans they have with respect to NLX.","I've previously stated that we needed to proceed with NLX-2 with some core support in a very meaningful way from some of the major banks. And we're continuing along that path. And, right now, we remain optimistic that we're going to get there. And I also would want to make it clear that the world that we envision in the listed futures world is not that dissimilar from what we've seen in the equity world where we expect them to have more than one trading venue clearing through a common clearinghouse.","So if we have LCH playing the essential role that the DTCC would play in the U.S. equity world, we certainly see that our customer could trade on one venue and have that then \u2013 as long as it's clearing in the same venue, then it's basically fungible. And it puts the customer in a position where the different trading venues can compete quite aggressively against each other. And you have a situation in listed futures world where the customers have smart order routers. And if they don't they are planning to have them which allow them to create essentially a virtual book between the different venues.","So that's the world we see developing. It's one we're very comfortable with. It's one we compete in our transaction businesses today. And when you see the results of our transaction businesses in this quarter, in particular, you can see that we can run in that competitive world and how efficiently rerun our business as you can still run it with a very healthy margin. So that's where we see the world developing.","Kyle K. Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right. Thanks a lot for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Hill with Barclays. You may begin.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to touch on -","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Good to see you.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. I wanted to touch on technology again but talk a little bit about the market tech side. I think one nice piece you have guys have been smart. There was some news, I think, earlier in the quarter about you guys supplying market surveillance technology for a Chinese Securities Exchange and some mainland firms. So how are you able to make inroads there in what's historically been a pretty tough place to do business? And then on a related note, you guys announced, I guess, surveillance from dark pool. How do you see those two opportunities kind of unfolding and actually adding to the revenue picture over time?","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Yeah. So I'll start and, let's say, one, obviously, SMARTS has been a very strong acquisition for us and it's kind of the model we'd like to use where as a smaller successful company we were able to lever our distribution capability and also significantly ramp up the R&D spending, where we came out with the products for the brokerage community, where at the time of acquisition it was primarily geared around exchanges and\/or regulatory bodies. And so you saw evidence of additional products set as you mentioned with the dark pool. We have more products coming.","I say, across the planet, you have increased intention and we think that will continue for surveillance. It's necessary in the markets we live in. And, clearly, whether you're in China, whether you're in Europe or the U.S. that is a common global phenomenon. And our job is to make sure we're delivering the right products and services to meet that growing and real need. And I think the team has done an exceptional job doing that. So the need for surveillance is no different in China than it is in other parts of the world. Adena, do you want to add to that?","Adena T. Friedman - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","I would just add that we've been in Hong Kong for well over a decade. We have had a good team there. And we've been working with exchanges and as well as broker-dealers in Asia for many, many years. So it is a testament to the relationships that we've been able to develop over the years to be able to find opportunities to work with exchanges as well as broker-dealers in China as well as all over Europe \u2013 I mean all over Asia. And I think the team has done a great job there.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. You may begin.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Just a question on the new initiatives in the private markets. It seems like you are increasing maybe your focus on that space. So I just want to get a sense like what's that target market? Where do you see those revenues over the near-term? Or is it more of a pipeline where you establish relationships with those firms and then obviously when they IPO, then you have them longer term as well? And then if I can do one side, just really on the market data, I just wanted to see if the audit revenues this quarter were that significant or not.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","All right. So let me start with NASDAQ Private Markets. And it's important to recognize that we seized on this opportunity based upon the passage of the JOBS Act. And the JOBS Act said that you could stay private with up to 2,000 shareholders and employees did not count. The prior rule was 500 and employees did count. So we said a company could go a long way in its evolution and stay private and we had to make sure that we provided solutions for them.","So certainly the relationships we build with these companies in the pre-IPO phase, we have a fundamental belief that they will help us with our IPO win rate. So that's an element to it. But that's a secondary benefit because we think the market by itself is quite exciting. And we certainly believe that a company similarly situated with respect to size and\/or complexity will earn for us an equal amount of revenue if not greater than it would if it was in a public company context.","But our job is to meet the customer need where companies want to stay private for a longer period of time. We actually support that notion in general. In that, you should only come public when you have a mature business model that can withstand the rigors of these quarterly calls. So we think there will be an increasing number of private companies. And we're there to meet the totality of their needs. So within NASDAQ Private Market, now obviously being combined with SecondMarket, they have a lot of needs that we have developed for a public company and we have to make sure we target that for the private company.","We think the liquidity needs of these private companies will evolve over time. We run what's known as SOPs today. We do it on an episodic basis. And we're starting to see some trend line where companies want to run these liquidity programs on a more consistent and regular basis. We also see the broadening of participation in these liquidity programs where they are today primarily employee-based. And we certainly think it will evolve to where early stage investors can use this mechanism for liquidating their position or second stage investors can use it for coming into the marketplace. So it's something that we think has tremendous potential for us. And, as I said, we think the revenue potential per company in the fullness of time is equal to a greater than the revenue potential of the company in the public market context.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Lee Shavel - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","And, Michael, on your question on audit, audit was up just slightly \u2013 is up $1 million from the prior quarter and up $2 million from the year ago quarter. So I'd say consistent with kind of the lower level of audit fees that we've had but it was a slight increase from prior periods.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, folks.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","How are you doing, Brian?","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good. Good. How are you? Congrats on a good quarter also. Just back on the corporate solutions side, given the IR products ramping up in the first quarter and attrition coming down and the headwind that you had in 2015 this year from foreign exchange transfers, should we expect \u2013 I guess, can you sort of make a statement that you think technology solutions revenue all-in, inclusive of the market technology, can actually exceed your mid single-digit growth long-term outlook in 2016? And if you maybe just talk again about the operating margin that you see in that segment with the integration going very well. Thanks.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, Brian, I do want to start by answering that question in a different way. I believe right now that the corporate solutions business has to be primarily judged by how good our products are, how good they are relative to the competition, and what momentum do we have with our customers. The financial results will follow if we do these things right in 2016. So, great credit to the team.","I think we've cleaned up, what I'll call, the operational aspects of the business over the last year or so. Our touch points with our customers have improved quite dramatically. We're seeing signs of that in the financial performance. But, more importantly, as we deal with our customers, they recognize that we are on the move. We're making progress. And you have the whole world anxiously awaiting now our next-gen product.","And, as I've said previously, we are in the unique position to take our development might and our development muscle and turn it to this sector of the marketplace. So we don't have any competitors with our kind of technology capability and we're investing in it. We're investing heavily in it. And we're excited with the progress the team is delivering on time, on schedule. Hopefully we'll finish on budget. And good things will happen from there.","The other general point, are you in a market segment? Once you are more competitive, that can grow over time. And we certainly believe that corporate solutions is really strategically placed. I mean to be running a public company today is an intense endeavor and you have an increasing need for information to help manage that and then also communicate to your shareholders and your stakeholders. And we're there positioned to meet those needs.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And just any kind of clarification on the operating margin that you are forecasting for technology solutions in 2016?","Lee Shavel - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","No. No.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","No. As I said, I will be focused on that soon enough. But right now, we're making sure the team is doing all the right things. This is a function. You do the right things, the margins will come. Now if you're expecting this business to have margins like we have in index and data then we won't get there, right? So I don't want to create any false expectations but we certainly know what a world-class software company should have as margins. And that's clearly where we're going to get to.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. You may begin.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Can you share your views on the evolution of electronic trading of fixed income? And then together, can you update us with how your eSpeed initiatives are progressing? Thanks.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Right. So I would say certainly that you will be witnessing a fundamental change in the fixed income market over time. But it's also wrong to think that it's going to look like the equity market over time. It has different dimensions to it, different complexities to it which will lead it down a different path. Clearly, we identified U.S. government treasuries as a place for us to start because that's the one area of fixed income that does look and feel like the equity market does in a fully deployed basis. So we're keenly aware of what's going to change in fixed income, in general. We have views of where it's going to end up. And then obviously we have to pay attention to where it's a proper place for us to enter that market.","With respect to eSpeed, I think I referred on prior calls to the fact there is change in the market. And you see a number of our customers have traded in the dark in an increasing basis. And I think under Hans-Ole's leadership, the team has come up with an innovative approach to that shifting market structure. We had the first launch of it just this past Monday and it's called eSpeed Elect. And it allows segmentation in the customer base, so customers can choose who they want to trade with and give the pricing that's appropriate to their customer base. And it also allows them to do some of those transactions assuming they are respecting the lit market in the dark.","And in many ways, it's a market structure we had envisioned for the U.S. equity market structure. We're able to put it into the fixed income market to the treasury market. And we're excited about the prospects. It's obviously way too early to declare anything today. This week was kind of a semi beta launch where we came out with it in a limited basis. But we'll see a full release of it as the quarter waxes on. Hans-Ole, you want to add anything to that?","Hans-Ole Jochumsen - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Just one thing that, as Bob already have expressed, we are extremely customer focused and centric. And it also means that we have a dialogue also on the European and the U.S. side with the market participants in the fixed income side about how to address the challenge in the fixed income market going forward. And, broadly speaking, part of that is increased product cost of capital coming out of regulation and the past requirements.","The other element is this new regulation like, for example, the new exchange regulation in Europe in week or two which definitely influence the fixed income market. But also in the last two days, conference organized by Fed in New York showing us that there is a high likelihood that we will see more regulation also coming into the U.S. treasury market. So we stay very close contact with our customers to make sure that we develop solutions together with them.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Greifeld for closing remarks.","Robert Greifeld - The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Great. Well, first off, thank you, everybody, for attending this call today. As I said in my prepared comments, this was truly a remarkable quarter for us. And we congratulate the team on great execution. We're seeing the power of the business model, but it's also important to highlight that this is a balanced quarter.","Our results were in no way, shape optimized for the quarter. If anything, you could say that our investments in the future increased during the quarter, which we're proud to do. But we also balance that with a very strong return of capital to our shareholders. So, in many ways, we're pleased with the quarter, but, most importantly, it gives us the platform to continue to grow and continue to provide returns to our shareholders. So thank you for your time. Look forward to talking to you in the near future.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. John Sweeney, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Sweeney","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ OMX's second quarter 2012 earnings results. With me today are Bob Greifeld, our Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Shavel, our Chief Financial Officer. Ed Knight, General Counsel, joins us as well.","Following the prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A. You can access the results, the press release and the presentation of NASDAQ OMX's Investors website, nasdaqomx.com. We intend to use our website as a means of disclosing material non-public information in complying with disclosure obligations on SEC Regulation FD, and these disclosures will be included on the Events and Presentations section of the site.","Now, before I turn the call over to Bob, I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this prepared presentation and during the Q&A period may relate to future events and expectations, and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation and Reform Act of 1995. The actual results may differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Information concerning that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and other periodic reports filed with the SEC.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld","Thank you, John. Your introduction will become longer than my comments soon enough. For the second quarter of 2012, our non-GAAP exchange revenues were $413 million, down slightly to the -- compared to the $415 million in the prior-year quarter but up 3% when you exclude the net impact of acquisitions and the foreign currency charges. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.64, up $0.02 compared to the prior-year quarter. This performance was achieved with a significant currency headwind. If exchange rates had held constant with prior-year levels, our non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher, tying our all-time record.","Given the weak trading volumes we are experiencing, this is a strong performance. We continue to see good growth on our non-transaction driven businesses, which are mainly recurring and subscription base. These revenues totaled $291 million and were up 4% compared to the second quarter of 2011. This growth was the result of 8% revenue growth in our global market data business. Access and brokerage services continue to perform well, up 12% driven by our new technology introductions. Our transaction-based businesses, equity and option trading in the U.S. and Europe, saw relatively weak volumes compounded by a weakening euro. Currency reduced our second quarter 2012 transaction revenues by $5 million year-over-year.","We did, however, continue to generate strong cash flow during the quarter. We have free cash flow of $185 million in the second quarter of 2012. We continued to be active in deploying that capital. In the second quarter, we bought back $125 million worth of shares, or 5.3 million shares, at an average price of $23.37. In addition, we paid our first dividend of $0.13 per share in June. So we continued to make good progress with capital deployment.","In the second quarter of 2012, access and broker services revenues were $66 million, up $7 million, or 12%, compared to the prior year. Our out-performance is driven by our unrelenting focus on innovation, which continues to deliver a pipeline of innovative new products, which are helping to reduce our customers' infrastructure costs and meet their performance requirements.","NASDAQ's ongoing investments in infrastructure technology have resulted in an ecosystem that attracts and retains members, brokers and participants. Recent innovations include 40G connectivity. We have a very successful rollout of this product to our customer base and are experiencing continued solid uptick. 40G client connectivity provides customers at our data center the ability to access our U.S. markets through a single, ultra-low latency connection. Network latency on 40G has been observed by our clients being reduced by an average of 2 to 7 microseconds, round-trip, compared to 10G.","Our Super Cab offering provides customers at our data center with up to 17.3 kilowatts of power to operate in cool trading equipment within a single cabinet. This has many benefits for our customers: obviously reduced cost but also reduced connectivity, latency, enhanced cooling capability and obviously has been very successful for us.","In Access Services, our pipeline is as full as it's ever been and you'll see us continue to introduce new products as we move forward. It is this focus that makes our Carteret Datacenter a must for all our customers and allowed us to grow our Access Services technology business at a double-digit rate even in this difficult market environment.","Moving onto Market Technology. This business delivers technology and services to market places, brokers and regulators throughout the world. Second quarter revenues were $44 million. Foreign currency negatively impacted the year-over-year comparison by about $5 million. During the quarter, we hosted our Technology of the Future Conference, ToF, in Stockholm in June and it was an extremely successful event. This was our largest Technology of the Future Conference ever, with attendance up over 50% compared to the last conference.","At the show, we certainly took our customers through our product roadmap and our expectations for the future. It is clear that we're seeing acceleration in our Market Technology business. We're on track for a record year of new business wins and order take. In just the first 6 months of 2012, we achieved an order intake of $132 million. To put this in perspective, in 2011, we had a total order intake of $134 million for the full year. Our backlog has moved up to $529 million from $496 million in the first quarter of 2012.","In the second quarter of 2012, we really had significant contract extensions. These included Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, which has extended the support contract for a further 5 years. In addition, Hong Kong announced it will upgrade its derivatives, trading and clearing technology to Genium INET. The Tokyo Commodities Exchange, TOCOM, also extended their contract for 5 more years. These extensions highlight how we are substantially improving our position in Japan and Asia. We also had contract extension for the Abu Dhabi and the Egyptian Exchanges among others.","In the quarter, probably most importantly, we had many exchanges that went live successfully with our technology. They included ICAP, the Kuwait Exchange and the Swiss Exchanges. During the quarter, our SMARTS risk management system continued to be in demand for both regulators and brokers. In many qualitative and quantitative ways, the past quarter was our best quarter ever. On a constant currency basis, we are on track to achieve our Market Technology revenue guidance of $190 million to $200 million in 2012.","As we move forward to our Listing business, important to note that during the second quarter, we signed 31 new listings, including 15 new initial public offerings. Of the 31, 2 were in the Nordics. In the second quarter of 2012, we welcomed several notable switches from other exchanges, including Dell, Component and Kraft; the largest exchange switch ever. Kraft became -- began trading on NASDAQ in June. We're also pleased that Western Digital will come over to list on NASDAQ. Analog Devices started trading on NASDAQ in April. 2012 to date, we have seen companies with a market cap of $122 billion switch to list with us. We're enjoying a record year for switches, and this is testimony to the strength and the attractiveness of our business model.","We are continuing to see some signs of optimism for the U.S. IPO market. Since June 27, there have been 11 IPOs in the U.S. Of those, NASDAQ has won 8. In addition, there are 8 IPOs expected this week, 5 of which are planning to come to NASDAQ. So clearly, a very dramatic increase in activity post May 18. The JOBS Act also appears to be having an impact as 50 companies have now filed with NASDAQ under this provision. That is out of a total of 79 emerging growth companies that have filed.","Our Corporate Solutions business continues to perform and grow. During the quarter, we're also happy to announce the acquisition of a 72% ownership in BWise for approximately $57 million. BWise is a leader in enterprise governance, risk management and compliance software. It will be sold through our Corporate Solutions division. With these acquisitions, we now offer companies the ability to track, measure and manage key organizational risk, including the risk of noncompliance with the industry-leading Governance Management and Compliance software and services.","I'd like to now highlight the continued and long-term success of our Global Index Group. Index licensing revenue increased by $2 million year-over-year to a record level of $15 million in the second quarter of 2012. This increase was primarily driven by increased assets under management and increased demand related to NASDAQ OMX linked products. During the quarter, we expanded into new asset class with the launch of the NASDAQ Commodity Index Family consisting of 440 new indices. In addition, CBOE launched futures base on the NASDAQ-100 Volatility Index. We anticipate continued growth for this segment, and this is a high-margin business with incremental sales falling almost directly to the bottom line.","Moving to our transaction businesses. In total, these volume-based trading and clearancing -- clearing businesses comprise 30% of our total net revenues. In U.S. cash equities, net revenues were $33 million, down from the $36 million in the second quarter of 2011. We had average daily volume of 6.8 billion shares, roughly in line with the first quarter but down from the 7.2 billion shares in the second quarter of last year. Our combined market share of 22.2% is relatively stable compared to last year, up 90 basis points versus the first quarter of '12. Revenue cash at $0.34 per 1,000 shares traded was down slightly compared to the prior year but up compared to the first quarter of 2012.","In Europe, our cash equity business declined by $4 million year-over-year to $19 million. The weakening of the Swedish kronor and the euro accounted for more than 1\/2 of the year-on-year decline. In the U.S. derivatives market, revenues of $44 million were flat to the prior year. Lower industry volume and slightly lower market share were offset by an increase in revenue capture per contract. Our revenue capture was also benefited by the lower proportion of dividend trades in the second quarter. We are seeing good progress with our BX Options launch. We initially started trading 5 names at the end of June, have an increase to include all the Penny Pilot Options or about 82% of the equity options market as of July 17.","Early results are, in fact, very encouraging. The number of market participants using BX Options is steadily increasing with several market makers providing liquidity. BX Options has gained close to 1 percentage point of market share in the brief time it has been operational. European derivatives, trading and clearing revenue of $26 million was down $5 million compared to the $31 million in the second quarter of 2011. Currency accounted for more than 1\/2 of the decline.","We recently announced our intention to partner with LCH Clearnet to launch a new London-based trading venue called NLX. NLX will offer a range of short-term interest rate and long-term interest rate euro and sterling-based listed derivatives products. We aim to enhance the competitive landscape by providing highly competitive execution and clearing fees, and most importantly, significant margin efficiencies. The platform is expected to be launched by the first quarter of 2013, obviously pending approval from the FSA.","One of the stars of our quarter was the Global Market Data. This was 22% of our non-GAAP revenue, and our profit was higher. Revenue was about $90 million for the second quarter, up $7 million, or 8%, year-over-year. Audit fees accounted for some of that growth. Now, when we look at our U.S. Tape plans, the revenue increased year-over-year and part of that was due to an increase in market share. But most importantly, our U.S. proprietary data revenue increased $6 million to $38 million. The growth came from multiple sources, including non-display TotalView. Our index data revenue also saw a great growth and NASDAQ Last Sale growth. In addition, it was important to note that NASDAQ Basic has continued to gain traction. A year ago, we had 8,900 users. At this point in time, we have 31,000. So clearly, a great success. European data revenue was flat on a reported basis but was up in fact $2 million on a constant currency basis.","Before I turn the call over to Lee, I would like to make some comments on our proposed voluntary accommodation program that we filed with the SEC for qualifying members that were disadvantaged by the system problems, arising in connection with the Facebook IPO on May 18. We have substantial legal and factual defenses to any litigation that has or could be brought in connection with this IPO. However, in recognition of the system issues, on May 18, we have filed with the SEC an amendment to our existing accommodation rule. The filing is very detailed and over 70 pages in length and certainly represents our definitive statement on the situation. The proposal establishes a priority for accommodation of firms that pass funds through to their own customers. The proposal provides that all accommodations payments will be paid in cash and adds a fourth category of orders eligible for accommodation payments. We do look forward to public comments and believe the proposal reflects the hard work that went into it. Implementation of the proposal is, of course, subject to SEC approval.","With that, I'd turn the call over to Lee, who will now review the financials.","Lee Shavel","Thanks, Bob. The following comments will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaqomx.com.","Starting with revenues, non-GAAP net exchange revenues came in at $413 million, compared to $415 million in the second quarter of 2011. We saw a continued growth in our subscription and recurring revenues, which increased $10 million, or 4%, to $291 million. Trading revenues, which represent about 30% of the total, saw a decline of $12 million year-over-year. Currency had a relatively large impact on this quarter as we saw a 10% weakening year-over-year in the Swedish krona and an 11% decline in the euro relative to the dollar. On a constant currency basis, total revenues would have been $15 million higher. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions, in other words, on an organic basis, our non-GAAP net revenues increased 3% compared to the prior year. We continued to experience relatively weak industry trading volumes in the second quarter, and these trends have continued so far into the third quarter of 2012. This is particularly relevant as we had a very strong volume in the third quarter of last year, so we will face some more challenging comparison in the third quarter of 2012. However, we do expect our recurring revenue businesses to continue to grow as we move through the remainder of 2012.","Now turning to expenses. Second quarter of 2012 non-GAAP operating expenses were $229 million, relatively flat to the first quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up $1 million year-over-year. As I mentioned, currency had a relatively large impact this quarter. Had rates remained unchanged from the second quarter of last year, our EPS would have been $0.03 higher. On Slide 13, you can see that for 2012, we are reducing our core expense guidance by $10 million to $870 million to $890 million as a result of the impact of foreign exchange and the fact that we are slightly ahead on our cost reduction plan. Adding the expected expense from our recent acquisitions of the BWise and NOS of $25 million for the year and maintaining new initiative spending of $40 million to $50 million, we expect 2012 total operating expenses to be in the range of $935 million to $965 million. Our cost reduction plan remains on track, and we continue to expect cost savings on a constant currency basis of $25 million in 2012 and anticipate that we will exit the year on-target for annualized run rate cost savings of $50 million in 2013 and beyond. This cost guidance does not include the restructuring charges associated with the cost reduction plan estimated to be $35 million, and it does not include the impact of our proposed voluntary accommodation program and related expenses.","Continuing down the income statement, our non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter of 2012 was $184 million, down $3 million over prior-year results. Excluding the impact of the weakening exchange rates, non-GAAP operating income was up $2 million. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 45%, flat compared to the prior-year period. Net interest expense was $22 million in the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of $6 million from the second quarter of 2011 due to refinancing of our credit facility in 2011, the repurchase of $335 million of the 2.5% convertible notes and debt pay-down. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 32%. We expect the tax rate to continue to be in the range of 32% to 34% in 2012. Our non-GAAP net income was $111 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to $112 million, or $0.62, in the second quarter of 2011.","I think it's important to understand that the $0.02 increase year-over-year consisted of several components. First of all, a $0.04 increase from organic growth, again, on a constant currency basis and excluding acquisitions. In addition, a $0.04 benefit from debt refinancing and repurchases offset by a $0.03 reduction from new investments in our GIP program and acquisitions and the $0.03 negative foreign currency impact that I've described before. The organic growth was driven by the strengthening of our subscription and recurring revenue businesses, which offset weakness in our trading business. In the second quarter of 2012, we recorded non-cash intangible impairment charges totaling $28 million, primarily related to technology assets in Market Technology and Market Services that have been substantially operated. We also recognized restructuring charges totaling $17 million associated with our cost reduction plan, including severance costs of $9 million related to workforce reductions and $5 million of facility-related charges.","Moving onto the balance sheet. On Slide 16, we are shelling our debt structure and our debt maturities. We extended our debt maturities when we refinanced in 2011. So now, the first sizable maturity will be in 2015. Overall, we have a manageable and well-spaced debt maturity schedule. A relatively low-leverage, strong cash flow generation and space debt maturities gives the company considerable latitude for our ongoing capital deployment initiatives.","On Slide 17, we show our track record of cash flow generation and cash flow utilization since 2009. As you can see, NASDAQ OMX has generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow, excluding Section 31 fees, from 2009 to the first quarter of this year. In the second quarter of 2012, we estimate free cash flow, excluding Section 31 fees, to be approximately up $100 million in comparison to $129 million in the first quarter of 2012, which is typically seasonally higher due to annual listing fee payments. And we have put that cash flow to good use in 4 areas. Capital return, we've allocated the largest amount of that cash flow to shareholders through repurchases of approximately $947 million of our outstanding stock.","Including second quarter purchases, since 2009, we had bought back $1.1 billion of our stock, or 49.1 million shares, at an average price of $21.85. These repurchases have collectively reduced our share base by almost 22% in the last 3.5 years alone, and we think this represents an excellent return of capital to our shareholders. We have refinanced and restructured our debt with a reduction of almost $500 million, substantially reducing our leverage and our interest burden. And we've invested over $200 million net of dispositions, acquiring a variety of attractive assets, including BWise, FTEN, SMARTS, Glide Technologies, Nord Pool and RapiData. Not included in the $200 million above is our previously mentioned acquisition of a majority stake in BWise for $57 million in the second quarter. We believe that these bolt-in acquisitions allow us to broaden our existing business and enhance our ability to grow profitably over time, and each of the acquisitions leverages our existing resources and expertise to create value and optimize returns.","And finally, the dividend, which is the newest leg to our capital deployment story, we paid our first quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share in June. This quarterly dividend currently represents a yield of 2.3%. So as you can see, we continued to have a balanced approach to capital deployment with dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and de-leveraging all playing an important role. The underpinning of our capital deployment strategy is a robust return on invested capital framework. We continue to see attractive value-creating opportunities for internal investment and acquisitions. As we demonstrated in the quarter, we can favorably adjust our share purchase efforts when we see opportunities in our valuation, and we are happy to join the club of dividend-paying stocks. But let me assure you that for each and every one of these initiatives, we need to be fully convinced that they will deliver an adequate return for our shareholders as we put that capital to work.","Thank you for your attention, and I will now turn it back over to John.","John Sweeney","All right, operator, we'll now take some questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Heinz of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You talked a little bit at the beginning about the strength you're seeing in the Market Technology backlog and in some of the new contracts that you've won this year and kind of reiterated the guidance on a constant currency basis. I think that's the first time you brought that kind of wording into the equation on Market Tech? I'm just wondering...","Robert Greifeld","You noticed that.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","How much has the currency impact been year-to-date? And I guess, I'd just like to get a better understanding of how you're framing that up versus kind of the $180 million annualized base you're running at so far this year?","Robert Greifeld","Sure. One is, I'll just start with what we see as a positive. I said it during the prepared part of the call. I mean, really, it was remarkable; one, the number of customers that went live with new software this quarter and did so quite successfully; and two, is the extension we have from some of our main customers over a 5-year period of time, which is also wonderful. The order performance in the first half of the year has been truly outstanding. That being said, we are feeling the currency impact but we also are feeling some impact from some slowdowns, some of the implementations from our customers. That was why we gave a relatively cautious outlook going forward.","Lee Shavel","And, Matt, just to address your other question, the currency impacted the year-over-year comparison by $5 million as Bob mentioned in his remarks. So that gives you some sense as to how much of that is FX. And obviously, that's for the remainder of the year unless the interest rates change. That's expected to continue to be an influence.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then just secondly, you brought down the expense mid-point on the core basis down about $10 million. It looks like you're accelerating forward some of those expense savings. I was wondering what areas you're seeing those opportunities to kind of firm out some costs?","Lee Shavel","Sure. I think that it's -- clearly, the reduction is a combination both of -- is a foreign exchange benefit that we've realized but I think we're very pleased with the level of cost reductions that we've seen across both headcount and technology and facility opportunities that we're pursuing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A few questions on the Facebook accommodation plan, if you guys can answer them. Since you've got the plan now filed with the SEC, I'm just wondering what kind of timeframe you guys are thinking about with respect to getting approval on the plan and then whether or not you have any flexibility now that the plan has actually been submitted to make alterations as necessary?","Robert Greifeld","The first thing I would say is we expected to show up in the Federal Registry within the week and that will commence a 21-day period for comments.","Lee Shavel","We expect.","Robert Greifeld","We expect a 21-day period for comments. So you're looking -- that's kind of the start of the process. And obviously, the commission will go through their machinations. With respect to the plan, as I've said in my prepared comments, it's a long explanation that we've given and we definitely direct you to that. That's our definitive word on the topic, and we've spent a long period of time in consideration of it. So I would have to say that the plan you see is the plan that we're submitted and, yes, we're comfortable with that. I'd also highlight the fact that, in the Facebook situation, it's not pleasant really for anybody involved with it. But when you see this accommodation plan that's been filed, I will definitely highlight the absence of negative comments with respect to the plan from the members who are directly impacted by it. And we don't have an expectation we're going to get a lot of positive comments on it. But the absence of negative comments, I think, is seen as a relative positive and I think us in the industry are getting ready to go forward from this issue.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Bob, you had mentioned NASDAQ having significant legal defenses in the case that there any litigation that results from this. Or -- is NASDAQ setting aside any kind of litigation reserve at this point, or do you foresee this situation really having any impact on your capital return plans? I think, based on the activity in the fourth -- first quarter, it seems like no, but maybe you could comment a little bit on that?","Robert Greifeld","Well, the answer remains no. So we're not putting apart -- aside any reserves and our capital return plan will continue unaffected by what happened on May 18.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. Then really quick on the business, I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the opportunity with NLX? I'm just wondering if you guys can maybe expand on how you plan to add value there, and how do you plan to potentially take share from some of the incumbents in London?","Robert Greifeld","Right, that's a great question. Yes, so we certainly look at it as a three-legged stool in terms of our approach. One, you start with our technology, we'll bring a different level of technology sophistication to that marketplace. Two is, we are certainly partnering with a large number of the players in that marketplace who are clamoring for some sort of alternative to the monopoly power structure that exists in the world today. And probably the third and most importantly and it ties back to the other 2, is that we are strong advocates in the NLX's effort for horizontal clearing. We're partnering with LCH. I think that has broad support from the community and will allow these members to continue with the relationships they have with LCH today and then obviously lever that through our superior technology. So I would say the reception from the community is stronger than we could have expected. And we're working hard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess the first question, not to get to the trading businesses but the RPCs in the trading business, they were mixed. U.S. was flat but the Options really increased the RPC. You talked about a little bit about that, but Europe was down, equities and derivatives. Can you talk about the trends in RPC in the business going forward?","Robert Greifeld","Well, certainly, a highlight was that our U.S. Options business, I think, one, chose their customers carefully and chose their pricing plan carefully and it shows. So we're happy about that. We're seeing relative weakness in Europe, and we don't have any optimistic forecast for the third and fourth quarter that will change in some fundamental way. So it's definitely, Rich, as you know, we're just living through these times. We're obviously proud of the diversification we put into the business and the fact that we're firing on all the cylinders and we certainly think the Nordics are a relative strength in Europe at this point in time but not immune to the greater global forces in Europe and the rest of the world.","Lee Shavel","And, Rich, just to give you some color on the revenue per contracts from a European context, in Nordic equities, our revenue capture was pretty much stable but actually improved. It was $0.11 per million traded versus $0.10 in the prior-year quarter. Now, on the commodity side, obviously, it's a mix of both equity options, energy options and fixed income. And there are elements of seasonality, particularly in the power business, that caused that to bounce around. But I would say equity options -- it was essentially flat to slightly down. A little bit of seasonal deterioration on the power side. And on the fixed-income side, the revenue per capture was down year-over-year but actually strengthened from the first quarter here. So it's a blend of a couple but I would describe the revenue capture certainly on the equities as stable and on the derivative side as stable to slightly down.","Robert Greifeld","Yes. I think when you look at the weakness, it's driven more by volume than by capture, Rich.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Understood, understood. And, Bob, you've been highlighting the growth in the non-transaction businesses and by our calculations, it grew 2.5% just quarter-to-quarter, and you talked a little bit about the margins. I guess, I don't know whether you can look at this simplified but can you give us a feel for -- if we continue to see this growth just on a non-transaction business, like what's the incremental margin on that side of the business?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I would say is, I direct you to 2 things. One is we expect our Corporate Solutions business and our Market Tech business independent of revenue achievement in the second half of the year to have expanding margins. So that will help. I think the margins you see in Access Services will hold relatively constant. And the margin in Data will also be relatively constant. So we have 2 parts of our business: you'd see expanding margins in the second half of the year, and the others should keep its -- keep their high margins but not necessarily expand them.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And then lastly, the accommodation plan, it looks -- I hear your cautious comments. It sounds like one big market maker's looks to go along. I guess, the question is, the $62 million, if it gets approved and paid out, how does that impact the cash -- or the use of the cash? And Lee did a detailed job last quarter talking about how you use cash and look at it. And I know you -- I don't believe the IDCG, LCH deal is closed. That looks like a big freeing up of capital.  Is that the way we should look at it as the timing might sort of offset each other with those 2 things?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I believe -- I'll let Lee take the first part of the question. But I believe the timing will be that IDCG will happen before the SEC makes final judgment on the accommodation policy. So soon after the Olympics but certainly not before, I believe there's a LCH board meeting where it's our expectation that it will come to a finality with IDCG. So some time in around mid-August. And with respect to the SEC and the accommodation policy, I would think it's a long shot for the third quarter. Possible, but a long shot but more likely a fourth quarter.","Lee Shavel","Yes. And, Rich, I'd say 2 things. One, when we look at our cash flow per capital deployment, we start fundamentally with what are we generating on an operating basis each quarter and that's what we utilize to support sort of the $50 million to $75 million that we anticipate utilizing for share repurchases. The -- under the accommodation plan, if that's paid out in cash, there are, I think, a number of additional cash flow drivers that have produced cash. One being potentially IDCG. But also, as we've mentioned, the release of capital through the implementation of our Nordic clearinghouse has generated some additional cash to our existing balances. So the bottom line is that the ultimate payout on the accommodation policy is not going to influence our capital return plans along the lines of what we've described to folks for expectations here.","Robert Greifeld","I'd also highlight, as you probably know, Rich, we do have the $10 million from the error account. So the net number is not $62 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander of KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Can you help me update on where we are with this potential consolidated audit trail or whatnot from the SEC to kind of try and better understand the other types? Because there were some really big numbers put out there initially that the industry would likely have to fund, but then I saw they recently licensed some pretty intense data from a third-party firm. Is that, kind of, something we should be building in, in terms of expenses to funds, or where are you with that?","Robert Greifeld","No. To us, there's 2 separate topics here. Neither one of them will have any real impact on our operation. With respect to the consolidated audit trail, which is now not going to be real-time, we'll be working with that and that will, I think, in its end, will look something like a shared data plan which is on a cost-plus type basis across recovery. So we'll give you more details but it's not going to be in any way shape or form material. Otherwise, immaterial is very overstating it. It's something that just really should be a pass-through for us.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess to go back to the Facebook issue.  We've read through the filing but help me understand, like, how do you make sure that there couldn't be -- this is -- it looks to me like this is applying to kind of have an exception to the $3 million cap that we don't initially disclose just specific to the Facebook issue, but should we think about you may be having to keep a little bit more capital if there is another? How are the rating agencies thinking about it as well? Is this something that you've discussed with them as you've submitted, are they comfortable with it that you don't need necessarily to keep more capital for future potential issues that might go beyond the $3 million next time?","Robert Greifeld","Sure. Well, Nimha, I would certainly direct you to think about it in the context over a long period of time, all right? So, yes, we've been in the technology business now for, I guess, 40 years. And in the 40 years, NASDAQ has probably had 2 to 3 issues that have arisen, kind of, in a Facebook-type scenario. So we need to get better so that it happens only once in 30 years as opposed to 2 to 3 times. And that's what we're working on. We're getting the results of the IBM study next week. And we've obviously done our own set of soul searching, and we'll change and improve certain things here as a result of what's transpired. So one, this will not happen on a regular basis and we certainly will work hard to make sure it's 20 or 30 years now before it happens again. But I definitely will direct you to the fact that this is entirely voluntary on our part. As I've said in my comments, we have our legal protections. We are on a voluntary basis. We're choosing to do this, and we don't expect and -- nor do the rating agency expect this to be part of our core business. It has not been, it will not be going forward.  And, Lee, do you...","Lee Shavel","Yes, and we have had conversations with the rating agencies, really briefing them on the situation. I would say the rating agencies, I think, fundamentally focus on the stability of our business and the strength of our cash flows as the basis for their ratings. And they understand the nature of the accommodation payment and I can't speak for them, but we've certainly are of the view that it's not a material financial impact to our business.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then if I could just a last one. On your capital usage, the purchases are a bit more than we had expected during the quarter, so a strong activity there but you're still guiding to the $50 million to $75 million run rate. Is that's fair? And then secondly, on the use of capital for that deal, how much revenue should we attach to that kind of increased initiative spend as a result of that capital spend?","Robert Greifeld","So, Nimha, on the first one, yes, we were more opportunistic given the -- where the stock price was during the quarter. But as we had indicated before, we've been giving general guidance based upon the cash flow that we're generating and we may modify that so that we have the flexibility to operate opportunistically. On your question, you're asking the question on our new initiative spending of the $40 million to $50 million that we intend to continue to reinvest in the business?","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes, please. But, Lee, could you just help me understand the revenue attached to that because you've kind of added another deal in there as well?","Lee Shavel","Well, the -- just to be clear, the BWise acquisition is not included in the new initiative spending that we present in our presentation, Niamh. That's separate. So we're -- we expect that transaction, as all of our acquisitions, to be accretive in the first 12 months. From a revenue standpoint, we've -- or we don't disclose that individually for the acquisitions.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the guidance of, what, $935 million to -- shoot, I had put the numbers in front of me but that's -- and then we add the $25 million to that as well, so $935 million to $965 million plus $25 million, is that how we should think about this?","Lee Shavel","That's right. Right, because we want everyone to focus on the management of our core expenses separate from our new initiative spending and from the acquisitions. So the $25 million reflects what we expect our 2012 expenses will be related to the BWise and the NOS acquisition.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen of Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And I guess just following up a little bit on the last question in terms of the BWise announcement, I realize you guys don't give revenues related to those deals. But on a stand-alone basis, before you purchased both of these, were they profitable businesses before you think about financing, costs and things like that?","Robert Greifeld","Yes.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just going back to the capital, if I recall it correctly, you had $150 million left from the buyback after last quarter and obviously, now you'd have $25 million. I'm not sure if these numbers are correct. If they are, any thoughts about increasing the buyback plan moving forward?","Lee Shavel","On the buyback program, based upon what we see in terms of free cash flow generation and as I've described before, we look at what opportunities we have internally to invest that capital or through acquisitions. And if we believe we can generate higher returns from those activities, then we're going to allocate capital on that direction. At this point, I would just reaffirm that we expect, on a quarterly basis, to utilize approximately $50 million to $75 million from -- on our buybacks. That will vary based upon where we see opportunities to buy back the stock. And also, in terms of cash flow that is freed up in other parts of the business. But I would, from an expectation standpoint, continue to utilize that $50 million to $75 million basis.","Robert Greifeld","And then I want to make one clarification on NOS. NOS is obviously Nordic derivatives, focusing on freight and also seafood, and they're being integrated into our Nordic operations. So them as a standalone operation, which is not how they operated from day 1 based upon the acquisition, was not profitable but it will be basically immediately accretive to our shareholders based upon the synergies.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, Bob, you've given some good color before on Market Technology. I'm just trying to think about some of the other -- the growth opportunities in other areas, I mean, like index and data services. If you could provide any catalyst and how you're thinking about these businesses moving forward would be great.","Robert Greifeld","Sure. Great, I'd love to. So just let me just go back to Market Technology for a second. Clearly, we're doing well in our core business but I do also want to highlight that with SMARTS, we went into the broker side of the equation and that's worked out very well for us. So when you look at the growth in the SMARTS business, it's been selling to broker-dealers and we expect that to continue. The index business, we have not spent that much time on it in these type of calls. They've been just a steady good performer for us at a very high margin. Going back about 18 months ago, we ramped up the investment in that business. We have seen some first early signs of the progress from those investments, and we've started to migrate to our new technology platform. That deployment will be done in and around the end of the year and that will put us in a position to be a broad-based competitor in the index world. And when you look at our history here, we really have been leveraging NASDAQ OMX to what NASDAQ OMX is to get into the index business. So this is a way for us to approach it very generically and holistically. And we're obviously very excited to have the technology platforms available. And we have a couple of different paths that will proceed once the technology is there. And what's interesting is we're bringing a higher level of performance to the world -- indexing world that's previously been available. So a couple of different ways we can go with it. You can see that we can lever that technology, get into a tick-by-tick world and introduce products associated with that. We also will have the ability to really unleash the IP capability within this organization as we come out with new products and you see some examples of that just in this quarter with the commodity index. So, yes, we're excited about that. This team has a lot of capability. We're ready to launch onto that. On the data side, you've seen us make a minor acquisition earlier this year that's getting integrated in with the machine-readable data. You've seen us make a number of different product line extensions. And this is like the index business, a very strong business, very high margin live drops to the bottom line and we're definitely hyper-focused on it. NASDAQ Basic is a wonderful success story, and the good news is we're just beginning. We expect that terminal count to increase quite dramatically. So when you look at the data business, a lot of future in front of it, and we've changed our mindset to get away from thinking about data that comes out of our licensed entities, the exchanges we own and operate and think about data on a holistic fashion and you'll see us make a number of moves in that area. So certainly, technology data and indexing will be major sources of our growth in the time to come.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier of Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Hey, maybe 3 of the items that drove the stronger revenues in the quarter. So if I look at Market Data, Access Services and then just on the U.S. derivatives, the RPC, just on -- either of those, like, is there anything like unusual this quarter that you'd say it was more of a one-time event versus we could expect that to be steady going forward? I just -- it was obviously a big revenue number and so I just want to make sure there wasn't anything that stood out.","Robert Greifeld","No. I would say when you look at the U.S. Options business, if the revenue per contract was to decline, we think it'd be associated with increased market share. There's a push and a pull there. So clearly, we optimize for the capture of this quarter. There could be other quarters where we optimize for share. So I think that comes and goes. What were the other 2 categories?","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just on the Access Services and in the Market Data.","Robert Greifeld","No, Access Services really -- the only slightly negative comment I'll make is that, obviously, with reduced volumes, our team has to get that much more creative, and the creativity has to be about, \"How can I help reduce my customers' overall cost.\" So it has a little different feel than resell -- selling cabinets because they wanted to handle increased volume. So the team has done, I think, a phenomenal job addressing customer needs in this low-volume environment. So we've been able to tack against the tide quite successfully.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's good. And then just on the expenses for the full year and focusing more on the total, so if we just take that -- the midpoint, maybe that would basically look at the next 2 quarters and you'd be around like a $245 million run rate versus a $229 million? And so I guess, when I think about that, the expense lift in the next 2 quarters, are there certain revenue lines that we would expect to see an equal increase? I know you guys give, like, the full year of new initiatives, revenue and expense. But because it's -- we're halfway in the year, it's just kind of tough to parse out what's already in the run rate versus what isn't, so any help on that front?","Lee Shavel","Michael, I guess I want to understand the question. Based upon you're saying we're focusing on the new initiative guidance and I guess, the total -- the current total expense guidance, are there going to be any associated revenue impacts associated with the expense guidance? Can I just ask you to clarify that question a bit?","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I just -- like, a lot of times when you give expense guidance, it's very easy for us to see that, meaning you give the full year, we know what it was for the first half. So it's pretty clear where the expense are going to go. On the revenue front, when there is kind of the core in terms of what we can forecast versus any of these new initiatives, which -- it's a little bit tougher to find out, like, what's already in the run rate for the year versus what potentially could come on in the third and fourth quarter. It's just a little bit tougher to gauge any of the new revenues that would be coming onboard as the expenses are moving higher. So just any color on the revenue front that would go inside with the total expense guidance, so whether it's the new initiatives, BWise? Any help there.","Lee Shavel","Okay. What I would say, Michael, is that on the new initiatives, what we focus on from -- in that $40 million to $50 million are initiatives that really are in development, and they're identified in that revenue expense line item on the page that we provide. And so there really aren't substantial revenues at this stage for those initiatives on an in-development basis as opposed to a developed and launch basis. So I wouldn't extrapolate from the expense guidance any substantial revenues at this point for the remainder of the year. Now, each of those initiatives is either originating or moving towards originating revenues, but that's typically not going to be expected until usually 12 to 18 months over the course of the development of those projects. Hopefully that addresses your question.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. And Bob, on the investor day, you guys talked about some new strategies going after -- or in trying to bring some of the dark pool volume back onto exchanges. Just any update there? I know you guys said it was most likely at back-half of this year, end of 2013 event, but just any update on that front?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, I would say, one, is on a positive note, and this is kind of unusual for me to be saying this, but now NYPC's [ph] the approval of the retail liquidity program we saw as positive. We have had, in draft, a -- what we see something as a superior offering in front of the commission. We're working with them quite intensely and I think it's a clearer path for us to get that approved now, and our technology people have been hard at work and we're planning to launch that soon after we get SEC approval. So to the extent that the commission evidences some flexibility in terms of how they approach the market, it then is up to us to figure out how to take advantage of that. So we do hope for the back half of the year to have that. The other thing that's quite innovative that we've done is the algos. I think we've talked about that before. We've filed that where we now can, again, under the general theme, that we want to do for our customers those things that do not provide for them differentiated advantage, where we can do that on a more cost-effective basis. So clearly, algos 10 years ago were quite innovative but now they're a number that are quite routine. So we filed to be able to do some of these routine algos to take the cost structure away from our customers, clearly which customers getting a relative advantage over having a VWAP engine. So in the light of the commission in approving ROPs, if they're going to approve our retail option program and our algo system, I think we'll do quite well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Freeman of Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","One on Facebook -- just two parts. One, Bob, you talked about the progress you made on the listings business with switches. I'm just curious, any change in the trajectory on switches that you were able to get even if not disclosed yet post Facebook and also on new listings, any impact that you can see from that end?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I'll say two things. One, on new listings, as I've said, since the market unfroze, I think it was June 27 was the date, we've won 8 of 11. So would we have won 9 or 10 out of 11? I don't know. It's hard to prove that, but we're certainly not dissatisfied with 8 out of 11 and as I've said, we've got a number applying this week. I think it's 8 and we're going to win 5 or 6 of them. So far so good, but it's obviously our job to be hypervigilant in the intensive conversation with our customers, so steady as she goes. On the switch side, it's been a record year so far and we're obviously in dialogue with a number of different companies about their opportunity to enjoy the benefits of listing on NASDAQ and I would say the same thing. We have seen no visible impact from May 18 on these discussions.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Just the other in -- just the other one on Facebook, I presume that for some of the firms that had some of the bigger issues that this plan -- you kind of previewed and got some sign off on it before you filed it?","Robert Greifeld","I don't want to go that far, but I would say that we certainly have been in discussion with our customers. Whoever wanted to talk to us, we're available to them, 7\/24 and the accommodation plan certainly, hopefully, reflects some of those conversations.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then separately, lastly, if I missed this, my apologies.  Can you give us an update on the benchmark order program? Was that launched in the second quarter? And so how does that...","Robert Greifeld","No, no. I'm just talking about it. We filed it and it has not yet been approved. It's been published for comment. I think they extended the comment period -- Eric is here. Until August...","Eric W. Noll","Mid-August.","Robert Greifeld","Mid-August and so we're cautiously optimistic that coming out of the summer, we'll be able to launch that program.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of the ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The -- just a follow-on, on the U.S. equities business. Some market shares are down a little bit in the first couple weeks of July. I know it's only a couple of weeks, so it's not a big data point as of yet, but I just want to be clear that a lot of the plans that Eric talked about in the investor day are yet to be implemented, and maybe just get your take on how much you think they will influence market share maybe later this quarter or in the fourth quarter?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, one is -- one of the plans we implemented was with PSX, which we believe is the right plan. It has cost us temporarily some market shares. Look at the July numbers, Brian. I think that's probably what you're seeing. So this was expected and we obviously have a different structure in place. So that has a different set of benefits too, sometimes a different set of customers. So we're working with them. So it's kind of a relaunch in a way and so, yes, we're excited about it and we're working on with it. And as we've talked in the last 2 calls, we have a, I think, quite innovative approach to retail auctions. We do want to see that approved by the commission. We're cautiously optimistic we can work through the process. So if we come out of this summer with our retail auctions approved and our algos approved and continued the hard work on PSX -- the relaunch of PSX, yes, we'll be in a very good shape.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","But in the fourth quarter likely?","Robert Greifeld","Yes.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. Right, right. Okay. Great, that's helpful. And then just a couple of smaller questions on the level of audit fees and market data that you recoup this quarter, what was that number?","Robert Greifeld","I think it was $3 million.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then the sequential driver of Access fees going from, I think, the $57 million to $66 million, what was the main driver of that?","Robert Greifeld","I just want to make sure, I want to get the audit fees right. Ron is going to check on this. We'll make sure we didn't mistake on the audit fees. That might be high of a number. Your second question though, Brian, was?","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just on the sequential driver of the Access fees, up from $57 million to $66 million.","Robert Greifeld","Right.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","What was the main driver of that?","Robert Greifeld","Well, it wasn't any one thing. It was a number of things that I've talked about during the call. Certainly, the fact we have the 40G cabinets are out is a good thing. We have the higher capacity Super Cab is we call it. So between 40G and the Super Cab, that was a big part of the drive. Eric, do you want to add to that?","Eric W. Noll","Yes, port demand was very high in order for people to get bandwidth. We have seen no diminution in cabinets sales, but what we have seen is a big pickup on the peripherals around cabinets. So lower latency connectivity, more ports, more power, cross connects to other market places and it's pretty broadly spread across all of those different kinds of initiatives.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great, great. That's helpful. And then just -- on the BWise acquisition, the NOS, are there any revenues associated in the 2Q revenue based on this acquisition?","Robert Greifeld","Yes.","Lee Shavel","Yes, there are. They're generating revenues, but we aren't breaking that out at this point.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Okay. Oh, and then just lastly on the commodity, when you -- did you break out the European derivatives? I think you've done that in a few of your other calls, what was the commodities revenue?","Lee Shavel","Yes, it's actually in the -- on the page that's in the investor presentation, Brian. It's on Page 22. We have all of the revenue detailed by quarter for each of the European derivatives components.","Robert Greifeld","And, Brian, just a follow-up, we have too much to-ing and fro-ing here and you can't see it, thank God. We stand by the $3 million number on the audit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Lee, apologies for revisiting this, but I just want to make sure I'm hearing you clearly on the buyback. I think you have $25 million left to the current program. So what's the reason why you haven't reloaded that authorization yet and is it your expectation to just renew that when you finally exhaust the $25 million?","Lee Shavel","Yes, Howard, we are -- we have an upcoming board meeting in which that the reauthorization will be evaluated. It's obviously at the board's discretion, but I can't tell you we see anything that will impair at this point our expectation to continue to buy back stock as part of our capital return plan.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. Thanks for just clarifying that. And then, Bob, I believe a financial transaction tax is slated to come into effect in France in a week and maybe in some other euro zone countries to possibly follow. I know you have little to no direct business in the country and you've clearly expressed your views on the FTT in the past, but I'm just wondering, are you hearing anything from customers ahead of that event?","Robert Greifeld","Well, what we're hearing is a lot of confusion. So I was asking simple questions, \"Well, what is it? How much is it?\" And I'm not getting the most definitive answers yet. So the devils in the details there could be de minimis where it doesn't matter so much and we have obviously a stamp-through in the U.K. and the markets to function. There could be punitive and definitely detrimental, so I don't really know. We're paying attention to it. And obviously, we have in the Nordics an experience with financial transaction tax back in the '80s and that was -- did not work so they have long memories there. So I'm not so much worried about the Nordics but we still do pay attention to it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","My first question, your Nordic derivatives business, your energy trading and clearing franchise, I guess that's the U.K. power primarily, saw a little bit of a decline in the volumes that have traded and then as well as the revenues. Can you kind of talk about the trends that you are seeing and why we should be optimistic that that can turn around going forward?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, one is I would say the U.K. is our start-up initiative, which is doing incredibly well, but it is not driving the numbers at this point in time. With respect to the Nordic power and clearing, we do have a monopoly position there. We certainly believe in the underlying drivers of that economic growth. And we have to deal with the right mix between the financial players and the natural players in the marketplace. And I would say that as we've looked at the second quarter and really for the last year or so, there has been somewhat of an upheaval there in terms of how that dynamic works. We expect that will sort itself out and it will get to a more normal growth pattern.","Lee Shavel","Yes, and I would also just add, Patrick, there -- you do have a seasonal effect where obviously your trading tends to be higher in the colder months, which influences, I think, the year-over-year -- or the results quarter to quarter based upon that.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got you. Thank you for the clarification there. And then my second question, if you can talk a little bit more about NYC's ROP program proposal -- or I guess more broadly kind of some of the issues that it brings up, I think, specifically preferential treatment for self-directed retail investors and sub pending pricing.","Robert Greifeld","Yes, I would just say that when you look at the actions of the commission right now, you'd probably say that there's more flexibility with respect to moving away from price time and put more wrinkles into the market structure. Whether we think that's a proper philosophical approach of underpinning it to the markets, at the end of the day, it don't matter and to the extent that this is where the commission wants the rule filling to go then that's where we'll go. And when you look at the different actions, we'll take [indiscernible] as a result of that, you'll see that happen. Could you have speculated in time that will be seen as a bad thing? You want to go more to a flat market structure. I wouldn't be surprised if that happens. But today, we see differentiated market structures becoming more commonplace and we will participate in that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller of BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So I noticed that your market shares in index options has been growing at [indiscernible] since the beginning of the year and you're now doing, I guess, close to 4% of the total index market versus like 1% a year ago. I'm not sure if that's like the Alpha Indexes starting to gain traction, or I think you also launched MSCI contract recently. So I'm just looking for some more color on what's driving the share gains there and whether that's something that you think can continue?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, one, I would say it's not the Alpha Index, but I would say that Eric and his team are experimenting with a number of different things. Alpha has not been as successful as we want, but he has a number of things that are being successful as small start up efforts. So, Eric, why don't you add a couple?","Eric W. Noll","We launched 2 MSCI indices this year that -- and we've -- which have been successful launches and then are -- we've seen our percentage of Russell related products grow as well. So we're...","Robert Greifeld","Why not brag about gold a little bit, Eric?","Eric W. Noll","Well, unrelated to the PHLX options business but on our NFX Options platform, we've had a successful launch of what we call our rolling Spot Gold contract, which replicates for investors the ability to hold 10 troy ounces of gold and it gives you the same financial impact. That has had an average daily volume on NFX, now approaching 2,000 contracts a day from a launch earlier this year. It's not -- certainly not accretive yet, it's certainly not financially material to the organization yet. But it does show what we see are positive signs of some innovation in the future space for us. And we expect that effort to grow as we go forward.","Robert Greifeld","So good things happening.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Talking about innovation in the future space, I know you guys have talked about launching some look-alike grade products on that NLX futures exchange or futures venue in London. But I was just wondering if you're also thinking about proprietary products or exclusively-licensed products over there and whether you have some ideas you could share with us along those lines, just what the customers may be looking for that's new and innovative?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, I would say that -- we certainly have thoughts and plans there but I think the key building blocks, I talked to you about the pillars, is we need to get into the marketplace with better technology, better engagement with our customers and then also represent a true horizontal option where they can lever their relationships with LCH. So we do those things well. There's going to be -- there will be plenty of opportunity for both proprietary and, as you call it, look-alike products. And so we're building that, we're launching first quarter, it's certainly exciting. And it represents a massive opportunity for us.","Operator","I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bob Greifeld for any closing remarks.","Robert Greifeld","Great. Well, I thank you for your time today. And I certainly appreciate your questions and staying here. Obviously, the second quarter of 2010 (sic) [ 2012 ] has the highs and lows, and we do want to leave the conversation with the highs. $0.64 in a difficult trading environment is something that we see as a strong performance, as we've said earlier, on a constant-currency basis that was equivalent to $0.67, which would equal our record for earnings. So given the times, we take that our franchises remain strong. I highlight again the switches and our IPO win rate. We're coming out of May 18, I think, as well as we could. I think we're in a position to move forward with our customers in the industry. I think this second accommodation policy would put forward. It will be the one that will allow us to move forward. So we're looking to a very strong third and fourth quarter in light of the times that we have. And we appreciate your support and look forward to dealing with you and talking to you as the quarter unfolds. So thank you for your time today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day."],"15836":["Nasdaq, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ed Ditmire, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Edward P. Ditmire - Nasdaq, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's second quarter 2018 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Michael Ptasznik, our CFO; Ed Knight, our Global Chief Legal and Policy Officer; and other members of the management team.","After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.","I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations, and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","And now, I will turn the call over to Adena.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will focus my remarks today on three important areas; our current business performance, our progress on the strategic transformation of our business, and the latest regulatory developments in the capital markets.","I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's solid financial performance for the second quarter of 2018. We delivered strong organic revenue growth of 7% during the quarter with 8% across Market Technology, Information Services, and Corporate Services segment that make up the bulk of our recurring revenues and 6% in Market Services segment where the majority of the revenue is transactional.","Undoubtedly, this organic growth reflects in part positive beta from healthy market and activity levels and the scale inherent in our business model. However, importantly, that our growth this quarter also reflects our clients' view of the Nasdaq value proposition and its ability to serve their evolving needs. We put ourselves in a position to deliver most effectively for our shareholders, when we help our clients succeed in new ways by solving new kinds of challenges they are facing. This includes our advancements and adaptations of our Market Technology offerings and our high-quality data index and analytics products.","Equally important to our success this past quarter is that our core trading and Corporate Services businesses are operating with the resiliency, efficiency and profitability we need to support our strategic direction and are maximizing the opportunity presented by the favorable trading and new listing backdrop, with a 74% U.S. IPO win rate and our improving U.S. and Nordic equity trading market share as compared to the second quarter of 2017.","Taking a step away from the second quarter result and the various factors that contributed, I would like to talk a bit about our efforts to improve and advance the positioning of the company to benefit our clients, shareholders and other stakeholders over the longer term. We're building for Nasdaq's future as we execute our strategic repositioning of the company and continue to make the investments that we believe will advance key capabilities of our business to fully realize our potential as a capital markets technology and analytics provider, while maintaining our core strength running world-leading marketplaces.","First, in terms of our strategic repositioning, a significant early step occurred in mid-April when we completed the sale of our Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses to West Corp. This enabled us to shift more resources, people and capital to areas we've identified as growth opportunities across company. It also allows us to focus our ongoing efforts within Corporate Services on the strategic C-suite solutions in the areas of Investor Relations, board collaboration and governance that are most critical to our corporate clients.","Meanwhile our late 2017 acquisition of eVestment is continuing to perform at strong levels with $24 million in second quarter revenues, excluding the non-cash temporary impact of the purchase price adjustment on deferred revenues. While still early in our plan to maximize the capabilities and synergies that led us to acquire eVestment, the team's achievement of mid-teens organic growth in the first nine months is very encouraging.","In terms of organic investment, we continue to be a leader in our industry with regard to incorporating new technologies across our businesses, driving product innovation in a variety of areas. This includes our work to develop and deploy our next generation Market Technology platform, the Nasdaq Financial Framework. Our work to enhance our SMARTS Surveillance technology for all of our clients and to extend it to new customer groups, in particular, the buy side, the expansion in the number of offerings in our analytics hub and building new data and analytics functionality into our flagship, Investor Relations platform Nasdaq IR Insight.","Let me address in more detail the investments and developments in our Market Technology business where we're investing, in particular, transformational strategies. In June, I was fortunate to address over 100 delegates from the global exchange industry at our biannual and largest ever Technology Of The Future Conference in Stockholm [Technical Difficulty] (00:05:37 \u2013 00:08:23)","Operator","You may resume your conference.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, sorry about that. So I'm going to continue. I believe that I was talking about our Technology of the Future Conference in Stockholm, so I'm going to continue our remarks from there. So in terms of the conference, the feedback from our clients and prospects coupled with our success in attracting new clients confirms our conviction that we're executing against sizable opportunities with a thoughtful and strategic approach.","From our legacy clients looking to upgrade and expand their technology, to new clients from within and outside of the traditional capital markets industry, our story, strategy, technology roadmap, and products are resonating. Second quarter new order intake was strong, contributing to a first half 2018 total of $109 million, up 18% year-over-year. 2Q wins in the second quarter were especially encouraging, one from the National Stock Exchange of India, or NSE, and the second with the Swiss Exchange.","The agreement with NSE, by far, the largest exchange in India, is one of the largest exchanges in the world by volume, is to replace its clearing and settlement solutions with architecture using the Nasdaq Financial Framework to allow clearing and settlement of all asset classes in one system, as well as a partnership to explore opportunities across several business areas between both companies. This agreement marks the first time that NSE has relied upon any technology providers outside of India to support their key business operations.","The Swiss Exchange, a long-term trading platform client and a major international market operator, has expanded their relationship with us into their post-trade business. They will leverage Nasdaq's clearing and risk management technology via the Nasdaq Financial Framework to clear pan-European equities and Nordic derivatives.","I've also talked about our efforts to bring our expertise in Market Technology to benefit enterprises outside of traditional financial markets. And while still early days, we're seeing encouraging progress. Since we went public with this strategy and what we can deliver, we have discussed opportunities with dozens of organizations and what we're learning through this process is helping us focus our efforts on industries where we believe that we will have the largest initial impact. One of these areas is the cryptocurrency space where we currently have five signed clients deploying to various degrees our transaction matching, surveillance and clearing technology.","While our new client wins across our Market Technology business will be reflected in future periods as we move forward with the implementations, the revenue dynamics in the second quarter were also encouraging. We saw strong organic revenue growth in the quarter with gains in each of the product areas, especially strong growth in our SaaS surveillance business and quarter-over-quarter improvement in our operating margin. Year-to-date organic revenue growth rose to 10% in line with our longer term outlook.","Now, let's turn to the specific highlights from our other businesses. I'm incredibly pleased to report that Nasdaq continued to deliver solid organic growth across each and every segment of our business. And I want to recognize some of the most interesting dynamics behind those results. In our Information Services segment, we delivered strong growth due to contributions from our Market Data, Index and Investment Data and Analytics businesses. I've already mentioned that eVestment continues to perform well against our expectations. But we've also seen strong growth in assets under management of ETPs licensed to Nasdaq indices with an increase of $40 billion or 24% year-over-year. Such growth goes well beyond the beta impact of higher markets, a testament to the attractive products we've worked with our partners to develop and grow over the years.","Over 40% of the AUM growth year-over-year is from inflows into a diverse set of products, including those tracking the Nasdaq 100, the Dividend Achievers suite, and Nasdaq Dorsey Wright strategies. Our mix of smart beta or outcome-oriented indices represents 42% of our AUM at June 30. And along with our flagship Nasdaq branded indexes have generated a very strong and healthy growth in assets under management.","We're also pleased to see how our newer ETPs have done to contribute to growth in the business, specifically ETPs that we've created over the last three years using Nasdaq indices now represent $30 billion in AUM, a meaningful contributor to overall AUM in the business. Our exchange data revenues also continued to grow, highlighted by strong global sales and additional usage of Nasdaq Basic and Last Sale as well as our continued work with our clients to ensure that they're properly reporting their current data usage.","Turning to our Corporate Services segment, Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs in the second quarter with a 74% win rate. Specific highlights from the second quarter include IPO wins of DocuSign, Carbon Black, GreenSky and Uxin, and exchange listing switches from New York Stock Exchange by Avnet, E.W. Scripps and Extended Stay America, representing a total of $10 billion in market cap switched in the quarter.","Meanwhile, in our Nordic markets, we continued to attract new companies and deliver strong growth in a number of listing. During the second quarter, the number of listed companies on our Nordic exchanges surpassed 1,000 for the first time and rose 7% year-over-year. A significant driver for many of our new listings is the innovation we're delivering in our Corporate Solutions products and services. They deliver critical capabilities and insights that are especially valuable as the company prepares to go public, but are also an important component of how we're serving our broader client base of corporates globally, including those already listed on the public markets as well as those that are privately held. We've delivered new modules to our IR services this year with passiveIQ, new ESG-oriented insight offerings, and other intelligence products that help companies navigate the shifting focus from investment managers.","Finally, Market Services delivered revenue growth across the segment, benefiting from improved market share in U.S. and Nordic equities, generally stable capture dynamics, and revenue benefits at NFX as we have shifted certain economics to better support improved market quality.","Lastly, I want to spend a few final minutes on the current regulatory environment. We remain very aware of our responsibility to continue thoughtful stewardship of the way our markets operate and the role they play supporting healthy economies. Thus far, in 2018, we're having a successful year in terms of U.S. IPOs, but we're still 35% below the number of publicly-listed companies we had 25 years ago. And despite markets recently setting all-time highs, the level of new listings that we've seen concurrent with that is well below what was experienced during the strongest phases of past expansions.","During the quarter, we recognized the one year anniversary of our publication of Nasdaq's blueprint for market reform, an early but very public milestone in our revitalized campaign, focusing on an holistic approach towards making the capital markets more appealing for listed companies. This blueprint included a number of suggestions for regulatory and other reforms that we felt strongly would make public markets more attractive for innovative, growth-oriented companies, create visible and accessible investment options for all investors and help ensure that the U.S. capital markets remain the deepest, most liquid markets in the world.","A year later, as I talk to you today, we see signs of progress that are very encouraging. For example, the House of Representatives passed JOBS Act 3.0 by 406 to 4 bipartisan vote that advances many aspects of the blueprints agenda. Importantly, part of this legislation allows for the SEC registration of venture exchanges that would allow many issuers to choose to trade in an environment with consolidated liquidity in order to reduce volatility and improve the overall market company trading experience. While there is significant work ahead for this legislation to clear at the Senate, we are encouraged by the strong bipartisan support in the House.","Also in the context of regulatory initiatives, we've seen the SEC affirm how important transparency is to well-functioning markets. The new transparency requirements for ATS' more closely align lit versus dark disclosure requirements. Additionally, Nasdaq applauds the SEC for hosting a roundtable on thinly-traded securities consistent with our revitalize agenda. And we appreciated the opportunity to participate and represent Nasdaq issuers. Nasdaq separately continue to discuss the need to support thinly-traded exchange traded products.","On the other hand, there is one SEC initiative that may be inconsistent with the revitalize agenda that propose access fee pilot. We have fundamental concerns about the impact the initiative could have on market quality, with particular negative impact on smaller companies where there is a broad agreement that there is a special need to improve, not hamper liquidity and where market makers today play a vital role in providing that liquidity.","Fortunately, the SEC's processes encourage feedback and debate. And, so we've weighed in on behalf of our clients including our listed companies and we have considered the long-term economic interest of the U.S. through our detailed comment letter to the SEC which we encourage you to read alongside corporates and other market participants who've voiced their concerns.","We will continue to argue vigorously for our issuers and in the best interests of investors. As I wrap up, let me summarize by saying that the second quarter produced strong results for Nasdaq, particularly regarding our organic revenue growth. We're making solid progress against our 2018 execution priorities and we look to build on that momentum going into the second half of the year as we continue working hard on behalf of our clients to make the most of the dynamic market environment. Our investments in our strategic pivot are proceeding and performing well and we look forward to keeping you apprised and how we will deliver on those large opportunities that we see ahead of us.","With that, I'll turn it over to Michael for a few to review the financial detail.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you, Adena and good morning everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. I'll start by reviewing second quarter revenue performance as shown on page 3 of the presentation and organic growth on pages 4 and 14.","The 3% or $19 million increase in reported net revenue of $650 million consisted of organic growth of $40 million including 8% organic growth in the non-trading segments and 6% organic growth in Market Services. A $6 million favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates and a net $27 million negative impact from the combination of the divestiture of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses, which had a negative $44 million impact on the GAAP revenue comparison and the inclusion of $17 million of revenues from the acquisition of eVestment. I'd note here that the eVestment revenue recognized in the quarter of $24 million was reduced by 7% million related to the purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associated with the closing of the transaction.","I will now review quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments. I will start with Information Services which is reflected on pages 5 and 14 saw a $31 million or a 22% increase in revenue, consisting of $12 million or 8% organic growth. The growth was primarily the result of index revenues which were up 16% in the second quarter of 2013, Market Data revenues which increased 9%, and the aforementioned $17 million net revenues from the acquisition of eVestment. Regarding the remaining deferred revenue adjustment, the impact should reduce to about $4 million in the third quarter of 2018 and $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Market Technology revenue, as shown on pages 6 and 14, increased $8 million or 14%. The increase primarily reflects higher delivery and support revenues and higher Software-as-a-Service revenues with the latter growing 21% year-over-year. In the second quarter, the operating income margin for Market Technology was 14%, up from an unusually low level in the first quarter of 2018 but below the 24% in the year-ago quarter. We said last year that we expect the 2018 year-to-date and eventually full-year margin to develop positively as the year progresses and we continue to expect that.","As we mentioned on the last quarterly call and during Investor Day, on a year-over-year basis we are seeing the impact of investments we are making to upgrade our technology for the next generation Nasdaq Financial Framework. Therefore, we expect lower margins in 2018 and 2019 versus the 20% to 25% level seen in 2016 to 2017. But over the medium term, we expect to unlock both higher revenue and higher margin potential in the business as we move more clients to the managed solutions model.","Turning to Corporate Services on pages 7 and 14, revenues increased $9 million or 7%. In our Listings business, revenues were up $7 million or 11% primarily due to higher U.S. Listings revenue from the all-inclusive offering becoming effective for all U.S. issuers on January 1, 2018. For the Corporate Solutions business, revenues increased $2 million or 4%, primarily due to organic growth in board and leadership product, as well as favorable change in foreign exchange rates. The Corporate Services operating margin was 28% versus 30% in the prior year period. The decrease primarily reflects the overhead costs related to the divestiture that we expect to eliminate over the 12 months from the close of the transaction.","Market Services net revenues on pages 8 and 14 saw a $15 million or 7% increase including a $13 million organic increase and a $2 million positive impact from changes in foreign exchange. Market Services operating income margin totaled 57%, up 2 percentage points from the prior year period.","Turning to pages 9 and 14 to review expenses. Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased $14 million to $325 million with a $20 million expense increase from acquisitions, a $16 million organic increase and a $4 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by a $26 million decrease due to the divestiture of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses.","Turning to the year-to-date period. Our 5% to 6% organic expense increase in the first six months of 2018 reflects increased spending on new initiatives as well as higher compensation expense. The higher compensation costs included the impact of higher incentive compensation driven by especially strong organic growth performance. To put this in perspective, our 8% year-to-date organic revenue growth reflects a 9% increase in our non-transactional segments and an 8% increase in our Market Services segment.","Turning to slide 10. We're raising the low end of our full year 2018 non-GAAP operating expense guidance by $15 million to a revised range of $1.31 billion to $1.335 billion. The increase of the bottom end of the range reflects principally the impact of the aforementioned higher variable compensation associated with the company's strong organic revenue performance. As we've indicated previously, while we expect expense growth to average about 3% over the medium term, it will vary in periods of higher or lower revenue growth.","Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income on an organic basis increased 8% year-over-year but when including the acquisition inclusive of the purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue, as well as the divestiture during the period, total operating income increased 2%. The corporate actions we undertook limited the year-over-year change and reflects the $7 million non-cash impact from the eVestment purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue and approximately $7 million to $8 million in overhead costs that have been allocated to the divested business.","As we have stated previously, the purchase-related deferred revenue adjustments will be complete by the end of the year and we have specific plans to eliminate the overhead costs over the 12-month period post divestiture or by the end of Q1 2019. The non-GAAP operating margin totaled 47%, down 1 percentage point versus the prior year period, with a 2 percentage point impact to margin from the above mentioned items.","Moving forward, both of these headwinds will be significantly behind us as we think about 2019 and beyond. Net interest expense was $35 million in the second quarter of 2018, an increase of $1 million versus the prior year period, primarily due to debt issued in connection with the eVestment acquisition. Other investment income totaled $8 million due to in part an outsized $7 million dividend received on an equity security.","The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was 26.1%. For the full year 2018 our non-GAAP tax rate guidance is a range of 24.5% to 26.5%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the second quarter of 2018 was $198 million or $1.18 per diluted share compared to $170 million or $1.01 per diluted share in the prior year period. The change in the tax rate associated with the Tax Cut and Jobs Acts drove a $0.12 increase in diluted EPS year-over-year.","Turning to capital on slide 11, debt decreased by $268 million versus Q1 2018, primarily due to $193 million net debt repayment and a $76 million decrease in Eurobond book values caused by a weaker euro. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.1 times versus 3.2 times at the first quarter of 2018. As mentioned previously, we continue to plan to delever to a mid-2 times leverage ratio by mid-2019.","Share repurchases in the second quarter totaled $241 million as we returned a significant amount of the after-tax proceeds from the divestiture in the period. Together with dividend payments we returned $476 million to shareholders through the first six months of 2018. In the first half of 2018, we executed the majority of the repurchase planned to both fulfill the ongoing commitment to offset the impact of issuances of shares for employee compensation and other purposes and in the interest of maintaining a flat share count as well as those repurchases designed to return the proceeds of our divestiture to shareholders.","As we enter Q3, we continue to have some additional authority against those two objectives, but we expect the pace of repurchases to diminish to more moderate levels in the second half of the year. We intend to continue to use our capital to optimize returns to shareholders through focused investment in organic growth and opportunities, carefully considered M&A, and continuing to grow the dividend as earnings and cash flow increase.","Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back to the operator now for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good morning, Adena. Good morning, Michael.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Rich, how are you?","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I'm doing fine. So, the first question I hate to use a question on this, but it is this $8 million of investment income that you'd talked about briefly, Michael, that did have an impact on EPS this quarter. I'm just trying to understand what was it from an equity \u2013 I didn't quite catch what it came from and I guess it's a one-time thing I assume?","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. Well, it wasn't necessarily a one-time thing but we do typically get some dividends from our equity-based investments. This was an outsized one. So, normally we get a couple of million dollars or so on an annual or a quarterly basis. But there's about $7 million I would say that was unusual for this period that was a special dividend that we received in the quarter. So, that was what that difference was.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then, I guess I'll take a step back and ask a broader question, Adena. It seems like the strategic pivot in the strategy has been well accepted by the investment community and it seems like you're certainly executing as you divest the PR and the DMS business. So, I guess the question is are there any updates on it now? Are there audibles, is it pure just executing on that plan now or after seeing what the business looks like and how it's performing and you're growing in all categories here, but are there any audibles, any updates compared to the initial plan that you announced almost a year ago?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. So it's great question. So we are definitely in execution mode right now against the strategy that we communicated back in the fall, and we kind of highlighted at Investor Day. However, we are always looking at assessing all of our businesses, making sure they're performing to the level that we would expect them to perform at, making sure that we're looking at our investments and our new initiatives, and making sure that they're also driving to the results that we ultimately expect from them.","And we will continue to reassess that on a regular basis. Now, every year we do have a strategy session with our board and we have a strategy session with management, and those are good opportunities for us to continue to refine our execution plan and continue to define our strategy. So that's a regular part of our playbook at this point, Rich. But right now, we're really focused on execution against what we communicated over the last nine months.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Thank you for the updates.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks a lot. Adena, maybe one for you, just again on the organic growth. Things are kind of coming in much better than maybe expected than the historical rates and you mentioned some of that, you get the market backdrop maybe on the transaction side. But on the non-transaction side, like where are the areas that maybe are maybe surpassing your expectations? Are you seeing better interest from the client base in terms of acceptance of some of the changes that you're putting in place?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. I think that it's really been \u2013 well, I could say there are kind of two areas where I would point to the market backdrop being a helpful tailwind in the non-transaction businesses. One is certainly in our AUM growth, although frankly a lot of our AUM growth is coming from TSO, meaning people are actually putting in flows into ETPs derived from our indexes. So it's not just market value improvement but it really is interest in investing in those strategies. But that is helpful \u2013 helped by a healthy market environment.","I think the other thing is just the IPO environment is very healthy. And obviously, our win rate is our effort. The fact that we have had more IPOs this year than we've had in prior years is a testament to also the market backdrop. So I would say both of those things have been really positive for us and it's really a combination of our efforts and the positive environment and taking advantage of that positive environment.","I think in the Market Technology business, to be honest with you, I have to be very blunt, I'm not surprised by our success, but I'm extremely pleased with our success. I think that we work incredibly hard for our customers. These two deals that we announced this quarter, in particular, were years in the making, right? So they're based on the back of longstanding relationships, based on the back of a lot of work that our team has done to prove ourselves as the right partner, and really based on the past that we have a technology today that will carry our clients into the future. So I'm not surprised by it, but I'm extremely pleased to see how many of our clients and new clients coming on to the platform as we continue to build out the Nasdaq Financial Framework.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks. And, Michael, just real quick on the margin. So I know you're in this transition phase and you pointed out some of the items that I think you said weighed on the margin by 2%. So as we get into 2019, should we see like all else equal that lift or are there kind of the investments in the technology business that will continue to maybe mute that? I'm just trying to understand sort of that transition versus the investments when you're talking about mid-term margins versus short term.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. So, the two key things that are weighing in the margin that reflects that 2% is the eVestment deferred revenue write down and the second piece is the overhead costs related to the sale of the business. And so, that's really where that's driving that 2%. We will continue to invest in the business and we did talk about that with respect to the Market Tech business. That is a multi-year program that we are investing in in the Nasdaq Financial Framework and some of the other areas that we're looking to build that out.","But that the 2% was really related to those specific items. Obviously, the intention is that as we look to continue to grow the revenue towards the medium term targets that we've identified and if we continue to see good volume in the transactional side of the business, then we should see that revenue growth exceed the expense growth and we talked about that during Investor Day. So, that would generate additional margin. And again, there's maybe certain segments where the margin is more muted as we did in some of that investment period. But over the medium term, we do look to continue to grow the margin of the business depending on the mix of business.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Herbert with Citi. Your line is open.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Just wanted to follow up on the Market Tech side and the investment cycle. I guess looking into 2019 we kind of expect a low to mid 20s margin as the ceiling there. But as you look beyond that into 2020, can we expect to see the bulk of that investment phase behind us and margin uptake there?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. So, we've said in the past we did try to communicate this at Investor Day too that we do have this year \u2013 a couple of years of significant investment in the business. And we do expect that. On the back of that, we will \u2013 and based on the growth rate in that business that we hope to sustain over the long-term that we should start to show the ability for that business to scale over time.","Now, we're not giving guidance or outlook related to specific segment margins because we are one business and we want to make sure we're investing appropriately across the business. But we do anticipate and we did communicate at Investor Day that the scalability of that business should improve as we get through an investment phase that's relatively significant.","At the same time, we'll always be looking to make sure we're making enhancements and we're serving our customers. And we have deliveries and other things that have some temporary impacts on margins. But we definitely think that the scalability should improve as we get past this particular investment period.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And then maybe just a quick follow-up would be on eVestment and could you talk about some of the cross-sell and is that driving a lot of the success there either, and then also cross-sell into the prior existing eVestment customer base?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Well, I think that we're very early days on the cross-selling. So the main impact of the business so far has really just been the growth and expansion of the business as we bought it. So it's been \u2013 it's a great company. The products that they offer their clients are very high value. The clients are continuing to buy more from the company. They're expanding into Europe and Asia and that's having success as well.","And so really just the business itself is a high growth business, which is of course why it was very attractive to us to begin with. The cross-selling though is starting to happen but its early days, where the sales teams have gotten together, they've been looking at their joint pipeline. We've been looking at and we've had some very specific wins there but it's not a huge contributor to the revenue growth at this stage. That's definitely longer and coming.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to start on the index business. Adena, you highlighted the strong growth and big portion of smart beta here a couple of times I think in your prepared remarks. Just wondering on that business, in particular, I think that's a premium business for you in terms of pricing but there seems to be increased debate about smart beta pricing, in general, as that gets more, I guess, commoditized, if that's the right word to use. So maybe just a little bit of a highlight what you're seeing out there, if there's pricing pressure potentially coming or why that business differentiates itself to other smart beta offerings.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Well, the first thing I would say is, as you know, the way that the contract work is you enter into an agreement with an ETP provider and you establish what the share of the revenue is going to be based on a certain fee per basis point, and that then sustains itself through the life of that partnership and the life of the product.","But as we look at launching new product and we've gone out and worked with our clients to make sure that we're finding things that are interesting and unique in the marketplace, we continue to find our ability to charge appropriate rates. I wouldn't say that I don't consider them premium rates, but appropriate rates for the products that we're launching. And we're mindful of making sure that we are coming up with strategies that are different and differentiated so that we can get an appropriate benefit from that.","So, we have not seen very significant compression. But it doesn't mean that we're also getting the rates that we got 10 years ago. I think that it's an evolving industry and we are very mindful and thoughtful on how we partner with our clients.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. Helpful. And then just secondly real quick, with the CME NEX acquisition now a few months \u2013 well, still pending, but the announcement a few months behind us now. Just curious if on your Fixed Income business, you've had increased discussions with clients that you could share anything about. I think they are a little bit muted on their end because of takeover laws. But just wondering if you're having increased discussions with your clients of how this could benefit or work against you and how this is really being received.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Well, the majority of the conversations we've been having with our clients in the Treasury business so far has really been about our re-platforming and the work we're doing to get them ready for the new platform, which obviously we believe will accrue to their benefit and ours because of the performance of the platform. So really we've been focused on that.","But to the extent that the conversations turned to the overall landscape, I would say that they see that there's a lot of dynamic \u2013 there are dynamic moves going on. I think that they don't really have a lot of clarity as to what it's going to mean for them in terms of that particular merger. And our job is really to make sure that we make the most of the transition and the potential disruption to make it, so that we have \u2013 we put ourselves in the best competitive position possible. So that tends to be what we focus on.","Part of that strategy is the announcements that we're launching the Treasury Futures later in the quarter because of the fact that we think that we have great pricing coming off of our Fixed Income platform that we can use as a benchmark. And we have real interest coming from the clients in a futures instrument and they really are excited about having that through an alternative. So we are looking forward to having that as part of what we offer in the Fixed Income space going forward.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Very good. Thank you.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much. Adena, maybe just to focus back on some of your comments earlier on the progress in the Market Technology wins in the nonfinancial client areas. So, maybe just to go a little bit deeper in that, you gave us an example of the crypto clients I think that's relatively new since Investor Day. And then, also you mentioned the two agreements with India and the Swiss Exchange, maybe if you can talk about. I know those are futuristic, but if they're sizeable enough to create a material uplift in revenue versus sort of what we all have in our models?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, I would say that they support the growth rate that we anticipated and we provided to you at Investor Day. So, that's kind of part of an example of why this is a higher growth part of our business is because we do see these types of opportunities clear and present and before us over the next several years as well. And I think \u2013 so you've kind of cut across three different things. One is having the National Stock Exchange of India, which I know all of you know is the largest exchange in India, they've never worked with a provider outside of India before. And so, that is a brand new client for us and I would say that's a good example where even in our core business we still have an opportunity to grow and expand our client base.","The second one with the Swiss Exchange is kind of a good example of what I call the land and expand strategy where we develop a great partnership in one area and we're able to expand it to others. And those are \u2013 both of them are sizeable agreements. They'll take some time to implement but we now get to capture some of the revenue associated with that implementation as opposed to waiting until it's fully implemented. And we are excited about the fact that they support our growth. When you look into the non-financial markets or the non-traditional markets, the cryptocurrency space those are smaller opportunities because that space is still nascent and that exchanges aren't nearly as large as the ones I just mentioned but there are more of them, and there's more opportunity for us to demonstrate our capabilities across a broader range of exchanges there.","And then, as we are just starting down the journey of saying, well, how is our technology relevant outside of the traditional markets. We are gaining a lot more intelligence on that as we've been engaging with in a lot of different industries. But there, I would say, it's still too early to be able to demonstrate or talk about a TAM or anything like that.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. Sounds consistent with the organic growth that you've telegraphed and then, if we just look at the near term, it sounds like the Swiss Exchange has a more near-term revenue benefit in maybe 2018, but India is more like a 2019.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, they all will \u2013 both of the projects will kick off in 2018, but they'll take a little time for the revenue to start to demonstrate itself, and then recognize that during the delivery period the margins are lower because we've got the cost of delivery associated with the revenue, whereas once its live then you'll have basically \u2013 you don't have as much cost associated with that revenue. So that's kind of how the \u2013 so the profit off those deals will be more backdated.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just going back the access fee pilot with the debate, just maybe your view of the timing of that as the SEC gathers all of the industry comments. If you have a view sort of when they may still kick this off or what do you think the odds if they still do it as initially proposed?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","So, we don't have any insight into either one of those questions. I think that they are \u2013 the comment period is kind of coming to a close and here is the initial comment period. They may choose to \u2013 they'll have to respond to the comments and understand how the access fee pilot operates within the construct of the comments. They may choose to amend it. They may choose to defer it. We don't really have any special insight into that right now.","Obviously, we think that they \u2013 well, we obviously don't support the pilot in general. But were they to choose to address the comments into the construct of the pilot, we would say that it requires very material changes for it to be something that we believe is in the good, the best interest of issuers and investors. So we'll have to see. But we don't have any special insights into how they're going about their process there.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. No. Fair enough. Thank you.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Maybe I'll just try one more on that transaction fee pilot and then move to something else. But just in terms of just the potential impact to your business if it does goes through as currently proposed, I know you've argued and others in the industry have argued for many changes to that, so we'll see what happens. But if it does go through as proposed, I guess are you focusing on the potential for more volume shifting towards off-exchange trading as a potential risk, or is there something else that you're focused on as a business impact from the implementation of the pilot?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. I would say that the first thing to mention just in general is if the rebate shifts down and the fee shifts down, then it usually goes in unison, so our net capture is likely not to be materially changed. But it does then have an impact of general liquidity in the markets across all venues, and the motivation that market makers have to commit their capital into the market. But then, also, the fact that the pilot as currently constructed only affects exchanges and doesn't affect ATS', which kind of creates this strange two-tiered system that would then have the potential to drive some of the flow off exchange. And so, I think that is probably the more material concern. But it is not something that we look at as being an overall material change to our revenue base. It's just that's the one area that we would say could have an impact and we've seen some of that in that Tick Pilot.","So, you can see the Tick Pilot has had some impact in one of the tiers of moving some of the volume off exchange and again, it has not had a material impact on our financials. But it does impact price discovery and price formation and the things that we think are really important for the health of the markets and the ability for particularly small companies. And that's where we do think that the most impact will occur is in the small companies, not so much in the larger ones.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. That's really helpful, thank you. And then just a follow-up I guess for Michael on the CapEx. Looks like you've been running the past few years I think in the $130 million to $145 million range and you did $45 million in the first half. And I know that ramped a bit from 1Q to 2Q, but just wondering if you expect some elevated spend in the back half of the year just to get closer to that historical range? Thanks.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. That's correct, Kyle. We will be having increased spending in the back half of the year. Part of it on some of our real estate moves that we announced a while ago where we're moving to Times Square so there'll be some of that expense and some of the other capital investment behind our initiatives will also be occurring in the back half of the year. So, we expect to be closer to the range where we've historically been in that $130 million, $145 million range that you talked about.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Good morning.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Hey, Alex.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. A question for you guys. Just wondered if you could give an update on what's going on in the Corporate Solutions business. Revenues have been a little soft in the last couple of quarters after seeing I guess a little bit of recovery last year. So maybe just an update of kind of what's been driving the near-term decline over the last two quarters and what sort of the drivers you expect to see in this business from here?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Well, the businesses that we've retained are growing, but it's a relatively low growth rate. I think that what we had told the investors at Investor Day is we would expect kind of a mid-single digits growth rate across our Corporate Solutions business. And I think that we're kind of at the lower end of that mid-single digit, so it's definitely showing some level of growth, but we definitely want to see it grow faster.","So what are we doing to make sure that we are tuning our products and tuning our client relationships towards growth are a couple of things. One is concentrating the team, right? So having our ability to concentrate on those strategic products that we really believe are fundamental to the ability for companies to navigate the capital markets successfully has been the big focus and that has to do with the divestiture of the two businesses that went to West. And that allows the senior team as well as the sales team and everyone else to really just focus on what we're really good at. So that's going to take a little time to show through in terms of ability for us to ramp the growth.","The second thing is making sure that our products are really addressing the clients' needs and that's why we've been launching new products into the IR Insight suite. So we have the passiveIQ which really helps companies understand and navigate their passive investors. We have something related to ESG investments. We have something related to activist investors, et cetera. So we're kind of growing the cadre of what we can offer to catalyze growth within IR.","And then in the board and leadership tools, there we've been doing more work to segment our clients and make sure that we're starting to add content into those products in addition to workflows, so that it could become more relevant for specific client segments. And that's a little bit of product work that we need to do. But we believe that that will continue to catalyze growth. And that has been a grower for us all along. But we definitely want to see more growth in that business. We think there's a lot of greenfield opportunity there. So those are the things that we're focused on to catalyze more growth in the Corporate Solutions business.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, Michael just a clean-up question for you. I think I heard you talk about overhead expenses still kind of running through the P&L and I think you mentioned they're going to phase out in Q1 of 2019. I'm just wondering how much of a drag has it sort of created on a quarterly run rate basis today, and when do you guys expect for that to phase out, sort of what would be the benefit?","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. So we had talked about there being about $40 million on an annual basis, $10 million a quarter roughly that's attributed to the Corporate Solutions business that will need to be eliminated over that period of time. And so, we talked this quarter there because it was a partial quarter, there was about $8 million or so. And so that's the amount that we'll need to continue to eliminate through next year.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","And we're seeing most of that show up in the Corporate Services P&L. Not all of it most of it though shows up in the Corporate Services P&L.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. And that's why you can see there was growth overall in the Corporate Services earnings. There was about $9 million of growth but the bottom line didn't grow as much and that's because of that. Most of that is due to that overhead allocation now going back to the remaining businesses.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got you. Yeah. And that's fully out by the end of 2019, right?","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. Should be out by the end of Q1 of 2019.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Q1. Got it. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. Your line is open.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. Just on index revenues, it looks like it was flat on last quarter and yet I think AUM increased 8%, is that because derivatives revenues were lower?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","That's a great point. Yes, the derivatives revenue was lower in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter because derivatives revenue was significantly \u2013 as we mentioned, was elevated in the first quarter. And generally, I think that \u2013 but generally speaking, I think that's also the average AUM versus quarter-end AUM is also a little bit different. So the average came up year-over-year. It was a little bit better quarter-over-quarter but the quarter-end AUM was quite elevated, and I think we mentioned it on in the prepared remarks. But I also think that it's \u2013 but I do think that the volume-driven revenue in the index business is probably the primary cause of it, not quarter \u2013 like Q1 to Q2 not having as much of an impact.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Got it. And on Market Data and Trade Management Services there's like a small $2 million sequential decline in both. Is that just driven by small lumpy items like lower audit collections?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. On Market Data that that is definitely the impact actually, in particular. And then on the TMS business it has to do with the fact that in the first quarter you also had elevated volumes in the Trade Reporting Facility, but more volumes there than in the Q2. And then there also was some work that we did with MiFID. So a lot of clients were using our testing facility in the Nordics to support their MiFID testing and so that also is not recurring. So that they pay for that time but they don't \u2013 that wasn't recurring. So those two things have the exact impact that you just mentioned on the Trade Management solutions quarter-over-quarter change.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Adena Friedman for closing remarks.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you very much. Thanks very much for your time today. We're pleased to see all of our businesses delivering strong top-line growth in the quarter and we intend to continue to be disciplined in how we manage our expenses while also capturing opportunity to drive, to sustain the long-term growth across our strategic areas.","We are very pleased to see that our clients are reacting well to our value proposition as a premier U.S. Listings market, our ongoing commitment to our U.S. and Nordic markets through functionality to bring benefits to institutional buyside customers, our investments in the Nasdaq Financial Framework and our SMARTS Surveillance platform, in our Index franchise, and in our acquisition of eVestment.

First, we will review the company's second quarter 2019 results; second, we will review the segment level trends and update you on our important initiatives and recent acquisitions; and lastly, I will review some organizational changes and touch upon an early initiatives related to total markets, our comprehensive market structure blueprint before turning it over to Michael to review the financials.","Turning to our results, I'm pleased to report Nasdaq's solid financial performance for the second quarter of 2019. We delivered net revenues of $623 million including 4% organic revenue growth. After taking into consideration the net impact of the divestitures and recent acquisitions as well as an unfavorable change in the FX rates, our total net revenue grew 1% for the quarter. Our achievements in the period were driven by 10% overall revenue increase in the non-trading segments with 8% organic growth driven by our Market Technology, Index, and Investment Data & Analytics businesses.","Our foundational marketplace businesses, Market Services and Corporate Services delivered a steady quarter in aggregate as we maintained a strong competitive position in our largest U.S. and European market and the forward businesses delivered moderate organic growth. Notably in both the second quarter of 2019, and in the first six months of 2019, the organic revenue growth rate in our non-trading segments remains consistent with our longer term expectations of 5% to 7%.","Turning to the segment specific highlights from the second quarter, our Market Technology segment delivered strong growth in the second quarter with net revenue of $79 million, a 20% increase in the same period in 2018 including both organic expansion and the impact of the Cinnober acquisition. Results reflected an increase in both the size and the number of software delivery projects as well as continued strong growth in our SaaS surveillance solution.","New order intake during the quarter was $46 million including new customers like Caja de Valores Argentina's Central Securities Depository as well as signing significant new enterprise contracts with the Tier 1 Investment Bank for Trade surveillance.","Along with continued momentum in these more established areas serving the market infrastructure, operators, and sell-side surveillance clients where we lead, we also saw important progress in some of our newer products and client verticals.","Earlier this week, we announced a partnership with Football Index, a UK based sports marketplace to deploy our cloud-based matching engine, an exciting milestone for our markets everywhere strategy.","Additionally after the quarter closed, we signed a fourth U.S. broker dealer to implement our trading platform as a hosted solution.","This quarter, we began disclosing a new metric for market technology, Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR intended to help the investing community better understand the growth of the recurring software support, licensing, and SaaS to subscription revenues which make up the majority of the market tech revenue.","In the second quarter of 2019, Market Technologies ARR rose 16% compared to the prior year.","Our Information Services segment delivered growth across all of its businesses with revenue of $194 million, up $19 million or 11% from the same period in 2018. Market data growth reflected higher U.S. case revenues due to equity market share gains and also benefited from partnership wins with Microsoft, Yahoo Finance, and Robinhood announced during the quarter.","With Microsoft, they now rely on Nasdaq last sale to provide real time market data across all of their online platforms as well as embedded within Excel making our real time equity -- U.S. equity market pricing available to millions of users worldwide.","Yahoo Finance launched a new premium offering with access to original and in-depth market information such as a supply chain data set from our alternative data platform to help MainStreet better identify investment opportunities.","And with Robinhood their focus is to increase informed investing across their client base with more in-depth data and they now offer Nasdaq's full depth of books data to all Robinhood Gold clients. All of these positive developments in the distribution of our market data and the new unique data sets are making the U.S. markets more accessible to millions of MainStreet investors in the United States and worldwide. We're very proud of the partnership approach we take with our media and online broker clients.","Revenue in our Index business set a new quarterly record driven by licensing revenues from our futures trading linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index and EPP AUM the latter of which increased 9% year-over-year to $203 billion as of the end of the second quarter while our Investment Data & Analytics business continues to deliver against this double-digit organic revenue growth expectation.","Moving to our foundational businesses, our Market Services segment delivered $227 million in revenue in the quarter, a moderate decline of 4% from the same period in 2018. In our U.S. equities and options markets as well as our European equities and equity derivatives markets, we continue to maintain a strong competitive position in share and capture. Our U.S. and Nordic equity marketplaces each delivered quarterly market share figures that were near the top of the recent multi-year highs, while pricing trends remain within our typical quarterly variation.","Our U.S. equity options are complex due to stable share and pricing and continues our established leadership in multi-listed contracts. While we are pleased with the competitive position of our larger equity and equity derivatives marketplaces, we continue to have more to do with our fixed products to get them to be where we want them to be. We saw revenue declines in both of our larger fixed revenue contributors which are our Nasdaq U.S. Fixed Income Treasuries platform and our Nordics commodities platform. While each market and their respective ecosystems is relatively distinct and face their own set of specific challenges, our focus and our efforts to address them share some common themes. In both, we have more closely engaged with our clients about ways to enhance the product offerings to better meet their needs and we are exploring with them the most promising avenues to bring additional participants and to deepen liquidity. We are committed to keeping you updated appropriately as we work to stabilize and ultimately return these businesses to growth.","Turning to our Corporate Services segment, our listings franchise remains the leader for IPOs with a win rate of 80% year-to-date buoyed by strong demand from BC backed private companies from a diverse range of industries including technology, healthcare, and consumer. This strong pace is reflective of the powerful value proposition that we offer our listed clients as we constantly enhance our listing services. Specifically in the second quarter, we continue to lead the U.S. market for IPOs with a 75% win rate extending our IPO leadership to 22 consecutive quarters and helping companies raise a combined $11.4 billion in total proceeds.","Of the 81 new listings that we welcome to the Nasdaq stock market during the quarter, 60 were IPOs led by Tradeweb Markets, Zoom Video Communications, Change Healthcare, Beyond Meat, and CrowdStrike. Meanwhile, our Nordic and Baltic exchanges added 19 new listings for the quarter and our total Nordic listed issue account rose 2% from the prior year. We continue to see a robust new issue environment as we progress through 2019.","Additionally, during the first half of 2019 the Nasdaq private market facilitated 35 private companies sponsored secondary transactions, a new record high for the period, with total transaction value of $2.3 billion.","And lastly, regarding Corporate Services and in line with our renewed strategic focus on the products and services most critical to the C-Suite and to the board to public and private companies we continue to work to unlock more potential from our IR Intelligence and Governance Solutions businesses.","We have added more research and insights for our users via the launch of the Nasdaq Center for Corporate Governance. While in IR, we're seeing increased demand resulting from our ESG admitted two specific products including our recently announced Connect IR Tool that helps corporate customers engage more effectively with the buy-side.","In summary, the collective organic revenue growth across our non-trading segments continues to serve as a positive data point that when we create sustainable value for our clients, we can continue to drive accelerated growth for the company and its shareholders.","Let me now highlight the focus areas of our new organic business investment and provide a brief update on recent acquisitions. With our renewed strategic direction as our guide, we have been consistently focused on expanding our services to our core clients by leveraging the rapid technological changes that are bringing new potential benefits to the industry. After all, our mission is to reimagine markets to realize the potential of tomorrow.","In that regard, we continue to make targeted investments and strong long-term organic opportunities including the Nasdaq financial framework buildout and deployment, the expansion of our market infrastructure technology into our sell-side clients, our buy-side smart surveillance solution, the Nasdaq private market, and new alternative investment data products. Our goal with these investments is to advance our leadership position in the evolving capital markets as a trusted technology and analytics partner as our clients seek new ways to manage their liquidity and make ever smarter trading and investment decisions.","We're also seeing encouraging progress in early results from our acquisitions of eVestment, Quandl, and Cinnober. eVestment has continued to delivering on the double-digit organic revenue growth opportunity we envisioned when we acquired them in late 2017 through both expanded use from existing clients in particularly United States as well as seeing continuous progress in international adoption of the platform.","Quandl has now been fully integrated with Nasdaq's organic alternative data initiative, the analytics hub, and both and eVestment have begun to benefit from sales opportunities open through other Nasdaq relationships. Yahoo's agreement to deliver analytics for its premium offering is one such example.","With the Cinnober acquisition, we've brought together our business and technology teams into common locations and we're working well together to win new client mandates and to begin the technology integration.","I'd like to talk now about some changes in the management team and structure. In June, Tom Wittman who has led our Market Services division for the past three years announced his decision to retire. Over the course of his remarkable career, Tom has made considerable contributions that have benefited both Nasdaq and the industry as a whole. Tom joined Nasdaq through our acquisition of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in 2008. I speak for everyone at Nasdaq. When I say that we view Tom's leadership as instrumental in building the U.S.'s leading equities options complex at Nasdaq, enhancing the effectiveness of our U.S. equities markets, helping us expand into Canadian equities and meticulously integrating both TSX Canada and the International Securities Exchange. His stewardship and track record in the options and equities markets are known throughout the industry. Tom will continue to oversee our U.S. Treasuries business as well as have a more broadly contribute as an executive advisor until the end of the year. We extend our sincere gratitude for his numerous contributions to our success.","We also announced a new management structure for Market Services with distinct responsibilities for each of the North American and the European marketplaces. Specifically, Bjorn Sibbern has been appointed Executive Vice President of European Market Services where he'll be responsible for all of our European marketplaces as well as associated market data and connectivity.","And Tal Cohen has been elevated to Executive Vice President of North American Market Services and will be responsible for driving the strategy and success of our trading businesses across all of equities, equity option, commodities, and trade management services in the U.S. and Canada and will add U.S. Treasuries to his responsibilities at the start of 2020. This is an exciting evolution for how we manage Nasdaq's marketplace core and I'm excited to have Bjorn and Tal in place to drive these foundational markets forward.","To round out our management changes, in June, we were thrilled to welcome Lauren Dillard to the executive team as Executive Vice President of Global Information Services. We're especially excited about how she will leverage her extensive experience on the buy-side coming from the Carlyle Group as we continue our strategy of delivering an expanded set of solutions to the investment and management industry during a period of profound change.","Before I conclude, I want to spend a moment on a new regulatory initiative. At Nasdaq we strongly believe that we differentiate ourselves by our expertise and ideas on market structure and other public policy issues. Our total markets blueprint which we launched during the second quarter outlines the steps regulators and exchanges together with the broader investing community should take to modernize market structure.","As a very first step of the total markets initiative, this quarter we announced a detailed proposal to reform the professional and non-professional data user definition. We're starting with public outreach including an appeal for public comment. Our top priority with this proposal is to ensure that individuals investing their hard earned money for long-term wealth creation are not paying data fees that are meant for market professionals.","Taken together, our total markets and revitalized campaigns provide a comprehensive framework of reform that will improve the market experience for investors, corporate, and critical market intermediaries.","Many of the priorities that we have set for the U.S. markets have been embraced by the legislative and regulatory communities as we remain focused on ensuring our markets continue to drive economic growth, job creation, and wealth creation for all.","As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that second quarter results served as further evidence and encouragement that we can deliver for both clients and shareholders are still early but now well-established strategic direction.","We want to continue to executing on our key priorities and are focused on building our momentum going into the second half of the year. I look forward to keeping you updated in the coming months and quarters.","And with that, I will turn it over to Michael to review the second quarter financial details.","Michael Ptasznik","Thank you, Adena. Good morning everyone.","My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be for the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.","I will start by reviewing second quarter revenue performance as shown on Page 3 of the presentation and organic revenue growth on Pages 4 and 14. The $8 million increase in reported net revenue of $623 million was a net result of organic growth of $24 million or 4% including 8% organic growth in the non-trading segments and an $11 million positive impact from the inclusion of revenues from the acquisitions of Cinnober and Quandl. This is partially offset by $70 million negative impact from the April 2018 divestiture of the public relations solutions and media -- digital media services businesses and the divestiture of BWise in March of 2019 and a $10 billion unfavorable impact from the changes in foreign exchange rates.","I will now review quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments. I'll start with Information Services which as reflected on Page 5 and 14 saw a $19 million or 11% increase in revenue. This was driven by $19 million or 11% organic growth, $7 million of which was the result of investments purchase price adjustment on deferred revenues in Q2 2018. Excluding this adjustment, organic growth would have been $12 million or 7% primarily due to continued organic development of Investment Data & Analytics as well as Index revenues.","The operating margin was down one point year-over-year at 63% due to certain product and operational investments that we've made to support future growth.","Market Technology revenue as shown on Pages 6 and 14 increased $13 million or 20% including organic growth of $6 million or 9%. Organic growth during the period reflects an increase in the size and number of software delivery projects as well as continued strength in our SaaS Surveillance Solutions. As Adena mentioned, we introduced a new market technology metric called ARR which is total annualized revenue of active software supported SaaS subscription contracts representing the vast majority of segment revenues. Please see Slide 19 of the presentation for historical ARR figures.","In the second quarter, the operating margin for Market Technology was 10% versus 14% in the year-ago quarter. However if you look past some of the quarter-to-quarter variation in this business in the first six months of 2019, operating margin for Market Technology was 10% versus 9% in the first half of 2018. As we have communicated in prior quarterly calls, investment spend in the Market Technology segment remains elevated in 2019 as we continue to invest in a number of growth initiatives including most notably our multi-year implementation of the Nasdaq Financial Framework.","We do continue to expect margin expansion in 2020 and beyond as we progress the NFF deployment and customer adoption of the more scalable service model as well as benefit from the scale and synergies of a more fully integrated Cinnober.","Turning to Corporate Services on Pages 7 and 14, revenues increased $3 million or 3%, organic revenue growth was $5 million or 4% increase with contribution from both the Listing Services and Corporate Solutions businesses. Listing Services organic revenue growth was primarily due to an increase in the number of listed companies partially offset by the runoff of previously deferred revenue recognized from LAS or listing of additional share fees.","Corporate Services organic growth was primarily due to an increase in revenues from Governance Solutions. The operating margin improved to 36% versus 28% in the prior year period.","Market Services net revenues on Pages 8 and 14 saw a $10 million or 4% decrease. Organic revenues declined $6 million or 3% and we experienced the negative impact from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange of $4 million.","Our larger U.S. and European cash equities and equity options businesses are relatively stable year-on-year organic trends, while our smaller fixed franchises that Adena mentioned earlier saw organic declines in the period. The operating margin in Market Services was resilient in the period; it declined only one point to 56% compared to the prior year period despite the year-over-year revenue contraction.","Turning to Pages 9 and 14 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased $3 million to $322 million. The change reflects a $7 million or 2% organic increase more than offset by an $8 million favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates and a $2 million decrease from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures.","Turning to Slide 10, we're updating our 2019 non-GAAP operating expense guidance range from $1.295 billion to $1.32 billion. Embedded in the updated 2019 expense guidance is a moderate pickup in expenses in the second half of 2019. While last quarter we suggested quarterly expenses would likely see a sequential step-up beginning in the second quarter, the combination of FX impacts, earlier realization of acquisition synergies, and timing of recognition of certain expenses temporarily offset the expected increase and resulted in second quarter expenses coming in line with the first quarter.","As exhibited by the midpoint of our revised expense guidance range, we now expect to see a sequential pickup in each of the remaining two quarters of 2019 expanding on several products and operational initiatives ramp-up as well as certain other factors.","I would also note that while historically expenses typically exhibited seasonal lows in the third quarter of each year due in part to non U.S. vacation accruals, we've now changed our accounting methodology around these accruals to eliminate seasonality in our vacation expense recognition timing.","Moving to operating profit and margin, non-GAAP operating income increased $11 million in the second quarter of 2019; a 4% increase from the second quarter of 2018 and the non-GAAP operating margin was 48%, up one percentage point from the prior year period.","Net interest expense was $28 million in the second quarter of 2019, a decrease of $7 million versus the prior year period due to lower debt balances and refinancing the 5.55% $600 million U.S. denominated bond with a new 1.75% \u20ac600 million bonds.","The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter 2019 was 26% and for 2019 the non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be between 26% and 27%.","Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the second quarter of 2019 was $203 million or $1.22 per diluted share compared to $194 million or $1.16 per diluted share in the prior year period representing a 5% increase.","Turning to capital on Slide 11, debt decreased by $78 million versus Q1 2019 primarily due to paying down commercial paper, net issuances, and payment on debt obligations partially offset by an increase in Eurobond book values caused by changes in FX rates. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.7 times down from 2.8 times in the first quarter of 2019 fulfilling our capital plans objectives to delever to the mid two times leverage ratio by mid 2019.","During the second quarter of 2019, the company returned $50 million to shareholders through a share repurchase program and paid a dividend in the aggregate amount of $77 million. In the first six months of 2019, we returned $200 million to shareholders through dividends and our share repurchase program.","And with that, I'll turn back to the operator for the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question comes from Richard Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Richard Repetto","Yes, hi Adena, hi Michael. I guess first one quick thing just wanted to shout out to Tom Wittman. You forgot to mention Adena besides being a skilled practitioner, market practitioner he was a straight shooter as well. So we'll miss Tom.","Adena Friedman","And he is here, so he got to listen to that, so I will pass to him, thank you.","Tom Wittman","Thank you.","Richard Repetto","I'm sure he has a smile on his face.","Adena Friedman","He does.","Richard Repetto","Anyway, so first question on this ARR the new metric for Market Technology. So if it's $247 million and it covers the vast majority, I think you said the vast majority of the revenue then like the $240 million, if you look at most estimates though the $320 million expectations for this year and higher than that for next year. So what's the gap between the $247 million recurring revenue ARR and sort of whatever $320 million to $350 million estimates annualized for the next couple of years?","Michael Ptasznik","Yes, so the 70% -- it represents about 78% of the Market Technology revenues in the second quarter. The differences will be things like change requests and implementation or delivery of new build-outs. So really what this is it becomes the service revenue, the maintenance fees, and also the SaaS revenue that received from the smart business is another example.","Adena Friedman","In our ongoing licensees.","Michael Ptasznik","In the ongoing licensees, yes.","Adena Friedman","So in a build period, Rich, we have certain delivery fees that we charge but that also of course have cost associated with it. So those fees are not -- those fees are not included. And then the change request fees which are kind of shorter-term changes that we make to the software to support our clients. Those are not -- those are not included but 78% of -- as you said --","Michael Ptasznik","Vast majority, yes.","Adena Friedman","We would say vast majority, yes.","Richard Repetto","Okay, that helps. Thank you. And my follow-up, semi related. It's a regulatory question and we appreciate, I think the market appreciates the total Markets Initiative. But I was just trying to see if you can give us like at least your status update, now looks like things are quiet and we're given a lot of attention to U.S. equities but it look like Chairman Clayton offered a pretty balanced statement in regards to sort of the fee guidance that the trading and markets division and it seems like the access fee pilot and the -- sort of the litigation things have everything on pause. Has there been any movement or would you say that the relationship say with the SEC in the trading and market side is been more open recently or how would you characterize the status, I guess?","Adena Friedman","Sure. I think overall, I think it is important to recognize that I think we've said this before that we have a very good and comprehensive relationship with the SEC. We submit 100s of rule filings every year to them and they approve 100s of rule filings every year. And we work with almost every division within the SEC on a regular basis. I think that we do however as we all know have certain areas of debate with the SEC around market structure. And I would say, Rich, that there has been a lot of dialogue with the SEC both at the commissioner level and at the staff level and we have been expressing our views and also making sure that they have data to support our views.","They have been asking a lot of really good questions. I think that the total market roadmap or blueprint does help frame out some of the larger market structure issues that we are hopeful that the SEC will start to tackle. And it also I think put some of the initiatives that they've been seeking to do into a broader context.","And then we've also been engaging very extensively with our customers and with the industry in general to understand their point of view around some of the key elements of market structure that we outlined in total market. So the dialogue has definitely picked up. I think that there has been much more of a back and forth in terms of really trying to understand each other. But at the same time, we will continue to manage these debates as we see fit in terms of making sure that the markets are as accessible and successful as possible for investors and that's our number one goal.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Michael Carrier","You guys have made good progress in certain areas like the Market Tech, the Index and Analytics, there's obviously some areas that you guys mentioned like fixed income that's been a bit more challenging. I guess just looking at the $85 million to $95 million in the R&D spend, can you maybe provide like an update on what's in there maybe some of the details which ones you've seen some revenue traction associated with the initiatives which ones are still at losses. Maybe like an average time of the initiatives that have been in place, just kind of an update on some of the new things that are taking place?","Adena Friedman","Sure, yes. So it is a combination of things and I kind of rattled them off quickly in my script. So you've got the investment we're making in the Nasdaq financial framework included in there that's both -- that's at least the amounts as expense.","And then the other that you have in there is Nasdaq private market, as we mentioned we're continuing to see a pickup in activity there and we have new initiatives to go into the private equity space, private equity funds. And so we continue to see very, very big opportunity in the Nasdaq private markets and good growth in that business. But that does continue to be an investment area for us.","And then additionally the banks and brokers strategy that we have with applying some of our market technology beyond surveillance but applying trading technology, post rate technology into the banks and brokers, we now just signed our fourth client to provide them a host of trading solutions, so that's picking up steam but that area of investment is also in there.","The fourth sorry the fourth area is in the buy-side surveillance. So that one is in very early days. We did do a very small acquisition to supplement that and that also was included in the ongoing costs now in that area and we definitely see very good momentum but it is a very small -- kind of a small and upstart type of model of upstarting with essentially four clients and moving into a much bigger space and we have good sales in that area to continue to develop.","And then another area is Quandl and the whole analytics hub integration, the alternative data space that is also early days as we have said that in terms of really frankly understanding the overall demand for alternative data, continuing to find new supply and then finding demand for that data across the industry. The Yahoo Finance implementation of some of the supply chain data does come out of Quandl and we have continued growth in some of the other data streams that they've created. So we feel good about the growth but in all of those areas remain investment areas as they graduate, they graduate out of that program once they become kind of self-sufficient at least break-even to profitable endeavors. And so that's why we will always give you that R&D number, so that you kind of know which areas are our major areas of investment for us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ken Worthington","Hi good morning. Proceeding the receipt approval for non-transparent ETF Fidelity and T. Rowe have refiled their offerings for active funds. Can you talk about how you feel you're positioned versus Arca and Bats to sort of win listings in trading of new ETFs as they're launched? And are you taking any special steps to cater to these firms that are listing these new products?","Adena Friedman","Sure, no problem. So we actually have -- we have been a leader from the very beginning as these new what I would call actively managed ETFs are being formed. We partnered with a firm several years ago to develop a program to support these non-transparent ETFs. And so we do understand them well, we understand that they do require some specific market maker support and we do believe our market is well-positioned to lift those types of ETF.","We continue to have very good growth overall in our ETF listings and we're very proud of the fact that we have well over 300 ETFs, I think it's at least probably in the high 300s listed on Nasdaq today. And so we do feel Ken that we're really well-positioned competitively to be able to bring those types of ETFs to Nasdaq.","Ken Worthington","Okay. And are you doing anything special on the non-transparent side versus the transparent side.","Adena Friedman","As I mentioned several years ago, we actually worked with a firm that was developing a new construct for non-transparent ETFs and we did work with them specifically to build-out a market maker sponsorship program to support them, so yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Herbert with Citi. Your line is now open.","Ben Herbert","Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to get additional thoughts on the pipeline into the sell-side on Market Tech, you mentioned I think the surveillance win this last quarter and the recent fourth broker dealer. But just how is that pipeline shaping up and kind of where you feel penetration is at this point? Thanks.","Adena Friedman","Sure. So well the first thing to mention is that in our surveillance business that's -- we've done I think a great job of working with broker\/dealers to expand that product to be able to support all asset classes as well as both exchanges OCX and OTC, and so that's been a great area of expansion for us as we've gone from firm to firm to take them from maybe -- maybe they only use that for equities and then they move to fixed income and then they move to commodities et cetera.","We also have global penetration in that -- in that business and we have a global sales force that supports it. So we continue to see very strong demand characteristics. But we have over 150 clients who use that service today.","In terms of the matching technology, post stream technology that we're at the very beginning of that strategy and that's why that that effort fits within our R&D initiatives because we've built out sales organization and we've continued to adapt our technology as well as kind of doing it on a hosted basis. So we -- in some instances, we also bring in market surveillance expertise to support them.","And so we continue to make sure that we have a good pipeline of opportunity there. As I've mentioned on the last call, it does take time to get some of these contracts signed. The banks definitely go through very thorough contracting process as you probably know but we are very, very excited about the level of opportunity and demand that we see. It's just a matter of making sure we systematically get our clients from interest to signing a contract. And as I mentioned we do have a fourth client that just signed up.","Ben Herbert","Great, thanks. And then maybe just one quick follow-up would be on Slide 19, we can see the dollar amount on the ARR but would you be able to provide maybe last four quarters of the growth rate?","Adena Friedman","Sure. I think that we know that year-over-year, it was at a growth rate of year-over-year, second quarter our growth rate of 16%. But we're happy to make sure we provide you more information on the growth rate.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.","Alex Kramm","Hey good morning everyone. Just actually following-up on this ARR number for a second. You just mentioned the 16% again but I think that's not on organic number, so maybe you can give me an organic number if you have it handy? And then related to that, if you look at the year-over-year and maybe just splitting hairs a little bit but the percentage of recurring is actually down year-over-year which doesn't seem consistent with the story, you want to be telling in terms of more SaaS based growth. So maybe you could just flush it out, a little bit I know the numbers are small but if you think about it over time, do you think this recurring percentage is going to be approaching 90, 95 or is this kind of the range it's going to be in?","Michael Ptasznik","So I think the number is going to fluctuate and it's going to depend on the types of installations that we have in any specific quarter, the change requests et cetera. So there you will see fluctuations. Over longer period of time as we continue to build that more of a SaaS platform and a platform as a service with NFF, the intention of the idea would be that more of the business would continue to become part of the annualized recurring revenue base. So over a longer period, you will see that, you won't necessarily see that next quarter or the quarter thereafter, it depends on the specific fluctuations of those individual quarters.","With respect to the organic growth rate, we're not going to break out the organic growth rate. The focus of this measure really is to try and provide some information that we've been -- that people have asked us with respect to what is that recurring revenue base of the business going forward and to say and what percentage of the business is reflective of recurring revenue as opposed to these more one-offs or change request type revenue. So I think this is the new measure for us that we've been, we just launched today, we'll continue to take a look at it. We think it sends some good positive information because it does talk about the fact that the recurring revenue in the business does continue to grow and as our model continues to change more towards a platform as a service or a SaaS type model. And the fact that it doesn't represent as we've mentioned earlier 78% or 80% of the revenue is, I think the key metrics that we want to focus on for now.","Alex Kramm","Okay, fair enough. Thank you. And then secondly obviously a few weeks ago a decline Deutsche Bank announced some restructuring. So just wondering how you view that as a as a service provider, I think historically you have said on the market data side that banks are actually the largest payer of market data and related services. Also you struck a deal with them; I think it was on March on some outsourcing of some trading solutions. So maybe a little bit too specific. But just wondering how you view that as clearly not a good sign for the industry as a service provider for yourself?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well I do think that the first thing I would say is it's pretty early days in understanding the impact that the changes in Deutsche Bank is going to have in general within the U.S. In terms of the way that they trade, they tend to trade on behalf of customers, so that trading will either be transferred to another firm, if there is ultimately an acquisition of the business from Deutsche Bank or probably move over to other clients, I mean other service providers.","I think in terms of some of the recurring revenues or kind of the other parts of our business, we're still working actually pretty closely with Deutsche Bank to understand, how they're going to continue to take certain services, how they might transition their services to other service providers. And so it's very early days for us but we are working very closely with them to understand the overall impact.","I also would say we have as you know hundreds of clients that we serve with our trading, thousands of clients we serve with our data and connectivity services. So we don't feel this is going to have an outsized impact. It's just something that we're managing through.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Good morning. I know you talked about the multi-year change in the Tech margin or the Market Tech margin. I guess given you do have an acquisition and maybe some synergies coming out, can you talk maybe near-term about if we've seen the bottom and we should kind of be building from here or any kind of path towards we no longer term higher. But I guess any kind of roadblocks or any kind of milestones as we think about more in the intermediate time period?","Adena Friedman","Well I think that we are trying to give you some view into our overall long-term view of the business. And I think we also are trying to give you a little bit more transparency into some of the drivers of our business but they are I also as Michael has been saying, we have a period of investment, we want to make sure we're investing in our future. It's not just the investment in the Nasdaq financial framework itself but it's also investing in some new verticals like the new markets like I mentioned with getting into new, new industries with our technology as well as into the broker\/dealers as well as into the buy-side for surveillance.","So there are investment areas that are ongoing. I also believe that we see very good demand characteristics across the business and we do see scalability in what we're creating. And so over time those things should generate the benefits for shareholders as we've been mentioning. But it is an evolution and it's not something that is going to be a step function from one quarter to the next, it's going to be over time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alex Blostein","Hi, good morning everyone. So thanks for additional disclosure on ARR, another couple of follow-ups here. But I promise they're all related, I guess how should we think about the organic growth going forward. I know you don't want to get into the specifics so it's kind of what's organic versus non-organic but on a forward basis as we think about this call it, 80-ish percent of Market Tech revenues, should we think of that growth being at the upper end of the kind of 8% to 11% target that you set out for the segment overall. And then maybe if you guys could help us understand the underlying customer base of that bucket today by revenue contribution maybe between like buy-side, sell-side and market operator. So kind of like other changes that would be helpful just to provide some more context behind it? Thanks.","Michael Ptasznik","So I think the way to think about the overall revenue growth, it's -- the overall revenue growth for the businesses in that 8% to 11% target for the three to five year period and that's the way to think about it. And as I said the mix should change over time or more of that will be coming from Annualized Recurring Revenue as we continue to convert the platform over which built into this now with respect to what's driving it relative to the overall mix of the business because it's typically in our market infrastructure operator business or the core exchange and clearinghouses et cetera, that's where we will have more of that change requests or delivery type contracts. We'll see more of those fluctuations which wouldn't be necessarily Annualized Recurring Revenue.","So if you look at the overall mix of the business relative to the mix of the ARR revenue, more of that will be coming from our smarts business which is more of -- which is a SaaS business. And so from a relationship standpoint, more of that -- less of that will be coming from the MIOs and more of it will be coming from the SaaS when you compare it to the overall mix of the total business which I think we provided in another slide. Does that help answer the question?","Alex Blostein","Yes, it does. And just like the contributions by bucket -- or now, what that looks like today buy-side, sell-side exchange operators?","Adena Friedman","So we are not giving that level of granularity to that figure. I think that we're looking at how we can grow across all of our clients. And so we do see this as kind of a broader metric to help you just understand overall how we are bringing the business forward. But we're not -- we don't provide that level of disclosure.","Michael Ptasznik","And let's remember the part of this is the change from what we used to have which was that backlog which at one point of time when the business is all about the market infrastructure operators and building out that client base which was these large contracts as we moved the business that backlog was less of a relevant factor and we felt that this is more reflective of the type and nature of the business going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is now open.","Chris Allen","Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you can give a little bit more color just on the impact on the change in accounting for vacation accrual just how much that's been historically and just from an R&D perspective, it sounds like the pace of investment has been pretty steady across a couple of things. Is there any specific areas going to be ramping up as we look into the back half of next year or into 2020?","Michael Ptasznik","So on the first question, the first part of the question I'd say approximately $3 million or so in for Q3 would have been the impact.","Adena Friedman","And then on the second question, Chris, I say we've been operating under a relatively steady, steady level of investment and we try to make sure we review those investments every six months in a very deep dive and we continue to look at how we're going to essentially ramp up certain areas or moderate certain areas to try to make sure that we stay relatively consistent but we do want to give ourselves the flexibility, if we see a great opportunity to continue to invest and grow certain investments if we need to.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Hill with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is now open.","Ken Hill","Hey good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about the listing services business, I know during the quarter we saw the MIC make some changes in some of the smaller companies particularly like the biotech stocks where you guys did pretty well. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the overall environment here in the U.S. and from a competitive standpoint but also how you -- what you're hearing from companies today in the market?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well I think that we are extremely pleased that about 97% of all new healthcare companies do list on Nasdaq and that continued, if you look at the first half of the year that number is consistent. I think that as a result we're always, we are very competitive and we are always looking for ways that we can compete better and listings that are maybe traditionally going to the other guys and they are obviously always looking at ways they can compete as well. We do feel like we provide a pretty unique value proposition for healthcare companies in particular because of the Nasdaq biotech index in addition to some very deep, IR intelligence capabilities we have to support that segment. And those types of things in addition to the great marketing and the great market itself are the reasons why we think that we will continue to be the home to the vast, vast majority of healthcare companies.","In general the listing environment continues to be very robust as we look at the pipeline of companies that have filed S-1s as well as our success in attracting those pipeline of companies to Nasdaq. And we definitely see a pretty I mean at least it's always subject to market conditions things could change. But at least as of right now, I would say we see a very robust calendar going through the fall.","Ken Hill","Okay. On a related basis I think yesterday you guys had an announcement out of record first half for Nasdaq private market, so I was hoping I think we are kind of six years in now on that one. So maybe talk a little bit about how you're monetizing those efforts maybe a little bit more and maybe what services you might expect to kind of grow from those companies using Nasdaq private markets going forward?","Adena Friedman","Great, thank you. So with private market, it has been I would say an evolution not a revolution. And so, it is several years in and we are continuing to see a real evolution of how companies are managing their liquidity in the private markets.","So when we first launched, we only today -- we only cover company-sponsored tenders. So the job of NPM is to make sure we partner with the company to understand how they want to manage their liquidity. There is liquidity that occurs outside the confines of a company-sponsored tender and that's not the area that we've historically played in. So when we look at company-sponsored tenders historically they also really, they usually set the price found the investors and then just asked us essentially to facilitate that transfer of ownership and electronic mechanism as opposed to spending a lot of dollars on lawyers and a lot more time trying to get paperwork to be signed and pushed across.","So we have electronified that that transfer process. We've electronified the data room, made more information available et cetera. However what we're seeing today is some continued evolution. Number one, we've been launching some auction price discovery events and processes with some of our clients today. So they actually are using the platform to find the right price for that private -- that private company transaction. And that's a new, new phenomenon that we're starting to see pickup in the market.","The second is they're starting to use us to help them find investors. And that's also a new phenomenon.","And then the third is to understand that companies over time maybe want to have a more, I would say a high integrity way to allow their investors to transact with each other. And that's another opportunity that we're considering. So there are ways that we can evolve that.","I think the other area that's also been kind of a long investment and it will have a long tail to it though is the development of liquidity in private equity funds. And we announced our partnership with iCapital a few months ago to allow for broker\/dealer distributors of private equity funds to use our platform to facilitate secondary transactions there. And we have also been working with GPs to start to think about using our platform for GP sponsored secondaries as well. So there are some really interesting developments there. But it's long-term play which is why it is in our R&D bucket.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Your line is now open.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Good morning maybe that the Oslo deals behind you, just wondering if we have an update on the M&A environment in the public markets we're seeing continued increase in asset valuations within the sector. Just wondering if you're seeing similarly frothy valuations in the private markets. And then, if you can just give us an update on M&A more broadly, do you think there's other scale deals like Oslo out there or is likely the near-term focus going to be on Market Tech and data?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Yes, so I think we were disappointed that we didn't win the Oslo deal to be honest I think that it was a very logical expansion of our Nordic business. And I think we would have been able to provide enormous amount of benefit to our clients in the Nordics. So for that reason we were disappointed. I think that however it does. There are always opportunities out there. We are very focused on organic growth as a primary driver of growth in our business. And I think you can hear that in all of the conversations we're having. But we do look at ways that we can either catalyze growth in those businesses like a Cinnober deal or expand our capabilities in certain areas where we have strategic focus and that would be something like Quandl or eVestment. And so we will continue to evaluate those types of opportunities.","In terms of you said scale opportunities, I think that we just like with Oslo there are always going to be things like that where there might be an opportunity for us to drive scale through a big synergy type deal. But we again are really not -- we're not hunting for those, we're finding those occasionally as we manage through an organic strategy.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Chris Harris","Thanks. So you guys are now at your leverage target. So should we just be assuming now that your debt balances remain flattish from here and related to that, all of a sudden the 3.9% Eurobond seems expensive given where interest rates are in Europe? So are there additional opportunities for you to potentially refinance debt early given how low interest rates are?","Michael Ptasznik","So we're pleased that we've hit our target that we had set a while ago. And it does show the cash flow that this business can generate and we can leverage up for deals and then within a fairly short period of time, we are able to pay down that leverage. And so our intention is to maintain our investment grade status and continue with the other elements of our capital plan including increasing the dividend as earnings grow over time and using our buybacks primarily to offset in dilution that we have from any of our equity programs.","So that's the way we plan on the debt. And the debt will fluctuate depending on the situations that we're looking at with respect to investment opportunities et cetera. But the investment grade status will be sort of the guiding factor that that sets that.","With respect to other opportunities, so we are pleased that we are able to take advantage of the lower interest rates. We also have our -- have our commercial paper program which has provided us with some benefits as well. And we'll continue to take a look at our debt going forward. We have -- we feel pretty good about the maturity curve that we have right now in front of us as we get -- as we start to think about our 2021 and the other opportunities we'll assess those in future periods but there's no immediate plans I can talk of or mention right now.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Hey good morning. So fixed income is obviously a really interesting area right now. I think particularly when you look at the PE multiples of trading platforms that specialize in that area, what do you see as obstacles for Nasdaq to turn its fixed income franchise?","Adena Friedman","So we are looking at that very closely, Patrick. And I think that there are a couple things. We are sitting in a business in the U.S. Treasuries at least that has been subject to a lot of competition over many years. Whereas if you look at some of the other asset classes in fixed income, they're hitting -- they're facing the idea of electronification for the first time or they're starting to see an evolution into electronic, more electronic trading. And there are fewer platforms out there that really serve that function.","In the U.S. Treasuries business, it's been a highly competitive highly electronic trading environment for a long time. And so I think that it's really for us it's a matter of how do we make sure that we are evolving our platform to meet the evolving needs of the broker\/dealer community because right now we sit as a broker\/dealer, dealer-to-dealer platform. And what we're seeing is more the broker\/dealers wanting to have more control over how orders get routed or where they get routed as opposed to an anonymous central them in order book. And so we are looking at how we continue to partner with them to find ways to leverage our platform for more. I would say targeted liquidity. ","And I think that's something that we have to understand what are all the moving pieces around that because there are certain clients who really like to use the Cloud and they want to maintain an egalitarian type of model and there are others that want to have more control over routing. So that's an area that we're really focused on. And I do think that with our new technology platform, we have a lot more flexibility to be able to understand how to meet their evolving needs.","I think in the commodities business in the Nordics, we actually capture from a competitive perspective, we capture the business in the Nordics. I think that it has much more to do with the overall macro trends in trading commodity -- in trading Nordic Power frankly weather trends can impact a quarter like they did this quarter. I think there is a predominant thought on this quarter is just that it was a very low volatility quarter because the weather was cool and wet and doesn't carry a lot of fluctuation in the need for power. But I also think that in general, we obviously are working through the aftermath of the clearing issue we had last year and we're working very, very closely with all of our clients to understand how they want to leverage the Nordics commodities business going forward for both trading and clearing needs and how we might be able to branch out into more parts of Europe with our power, our power business going forward.","So it is definitely an area of real focus for us, Patrick, but we don't have short-term -- we don't have immediate things that we think will suddenly turn things around. It's a longer term partnership with our clients.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Adena Friedman for any further remarks.","Adena Friedman","Great, thank you. In closing, we are very encouraged by our solid second quarter and how it serves to reinforce that both the logic underlying our strategic pivot and our ability to execute on our new direction are becoming more and more clear. And we do also remain very focused on delivering against our priorities and in particular helping our clients reimagine markets to realize the potential of tomorrow.","So thank you very much for your time today and we look forward to continuing the conversation in the coming months. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program and you may all disconnect.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now turn the call over to your host Ed Ditmire, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Edward P. Ditmire - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's second quarter 2015 earnings results.","On the line are Bob Greifeld, our CEO; Lee Shavel, our CFO; our Co-Presidents, Adena Friedman and Hans-Ole Jochumsen; Ed Knight, our General Counsel; and other members of the management team.","After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A.

Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I now will turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you Ed and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's second quarter 2015 results.","We are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter and with the continued strong momentum being generated across all our businesses. We again delivered record results for our shareholders in terms of non-GAAP operating profit, pre-tax income, net income and EPS.","Non-GAAP revenue was $518 million, with improving organic growth and a continuation of especially strong performance across our foundational businesses, Listing Services and Cash Equity.","In addition to our solid organic growth performance, we also maintained our focus on running this business as effectively and efficiently as possible, which as you've heard me say before, will always be a hallmark of this organization.","As such, we continued to see operating margins move in a positive direction, up year-over-year and remaining at multi-year highs. This is indeed encouraging and indicative of the team's focus and strong execution. Lee will go into greater detail on the numbers in a few minutes.","When I look across our franchise today, there are a multitude of positive developments including strong performance in our core business, marked progress with acquisitions and a number of important product launches and initiatives we have in our pipeline.","I would like to highlight a few areas where our intense customer focus continues to be the fuel that drives this organization forward and enables us to consistently perform at a very high level. Let me provide you with a few examples.","One of the more important undertakings for Nasdaq and our customers is our new energy's futures market, Nasdaq Futures Exchange, NFX. NFX will begin trading tomorrow. We started this based upon a strong dialogue with our customers and our customers' desire for more efficient and cost effective alternative that has been the driving force behind the design and execution of our solution.","As a result of the work we have done, we have a broad coalition of partners who have become members and connected to the service and includes 16 FCMs. We also have a large number of market makers over a dozen. And we have a half dozen ISVs which will provide the front-end trading software support. Because of our efficient model and our ability to lever our technology, pricing will be a clear differentiator. In some cases, we will be less than half of what our competitors charge.","Horizontal clearing will be the other key differentiator. We are partnering with OCC and this will allow our customers to have greater control and choice in their clearing operations.","NFX is a clear continuation of our strategy to expand our capabilities in core businesses that do more for our customers and will drive new growth opportunities. I look forward to reporting to you more about the progress with NFX in the quarters to come.","Another good example of where our strong commitment to our clients has enabled us to drive new opportunities is Nasdaq Private Market. While we continue to experience one of the most robust IPO and listings environments in recent memory and we are the leading venue for IPOs with a 70% win rate, we also in addition to our continued strong progress in Nasdaq Private Market during the quarter, we added 25 companies to NPM in the second quarter expanding the user base by one-third. NPM now has over 100 customers worldwide, including leading companies such as Pinterest, DocuSign and Business Insider to name a few. And it is still very early days.","Through the NPM platform, we enable companies to meet their liquidity, capital table management and other corporate needs. We're looking to further enhance our platform through new and innovative ways by piloting a blockchain technology initiative, partnering with Chain, for the clearance and settlement of these transactions.","Equally important, NPM enables us to cultivate relationships with these early-stage growth companies and their investors much earlier in their life cycle and will open doors to other opportunities in our Listings and Corporate Solutions businesses.","Acquisitions have been strategically important to expanding our portfolio and improving our ability to serve clients. Let me provide you with a few highlights. Our index business, part of our Information Services segment, has really been one of the foundational businesses for Nasdaq over the years and has been a growth driver as we have expanded our indices beyond Nasdaq listed benchmark products.","In particular, Nasdaq has spent the past five years working with our ETF sponsor partners and with investors to develop and launch outcome-oriented Smart Beta Index products. Most notably, our Dividend Achiever ETFs, Buyback ETFs and our BulletShares ETFs. In response to ever-growing investor interest in the Smart Beta investment strategies, in January, we added to our businesses Dorsey, Wright. I am happy to report that this business was immediately accretive to our earnings and more importantly continues to outperform our growth and return expectations, contributing meaningfully to our Information Services segment record revenues during the quarter.","Assets under management in DWA license exchange-traded products have risen over 75% since our late January closing of the acquisition. Around that time on the fourth quarter 2014 earnings call, we said we expected $5 million per quarter in incremental revenue from DWA, but growth has since driven that second quarter contribution to north of $8 million in the quarter. We are also working on multiple fronts to accelerate this already strong growth in this business by increasing our investment in new product development and sales capability.","Another key area of our business where our intense focus on our clients' needs is beginning to bear fruit is Corporate Solutions. We prefer to compete in spaces where our investments and expertise in technology can be levered for superior client solutions and clear competitive advantages. Over the past year, we've invested heavily in new product development and today, our Nasdaq IR Insights next-gen IR desktop product, a centerpiece of the corporate product suite, will enable us to transform the space and deliver a significantly enhanced experience for our clients.","We have been showing this product to customers, most recently at the Annual NIRI Conference in Chicago and testing it in the field with a growing list of some of our most important clients and the response has been overwhelmingly positive.","We are also releasing for the first time the market peer insight version of IR Insights this month, a product with a subset of functionality of the full IR platform. While this product satisfies the needs of a certain segment of the customer base, it will also allow many customers' end prospects to experience most of the commonly used functionalities and see our new user interface. As we move through the beta versions and into production launches, I'm excited at the prospect of more people getting more exposure to these compelling solutions.","More broadly, the work we are doing internally with Corporate Solutions to improve and expand our processes for how we interact with our customers through our service excellent initiatives and back-office improvements in billing are starting to resonate and should further help us drive growth with encouraging trends in terms of improving retention rates and new sales leads.","So if you look at our progress in the path we are on in Corporate Solutions, is a great example of our intense focus to understand our customer needs and then apply that with technology and expertise to introduce products that exceed our customers' expectations.","eSpeed is another business where we have made significant progress to improve our product menu and capabilities to expand the opportunities for our customers. We are in the process of expanding the offering to cover the Treasury bond market over a security's complete life cycle from the when-issued market that precedes the primary issuance to the on-the-run market to the roll products that help users move from one on-the-run issue to the next to the off-the-run market and finally the short-short markets with bonds less than 18 months from expiration will trade like bills.","In all cases, we believe electronic trading of these product classes will enhance transparency, provide reliability and resiliency and dovetail with regulator and customer priorities in terms of regulation and clearing.","As we progress along with this menu expansion phase, we're also positioning ourselves to take advantage of the potentially significant volume upticks as the Fed signals a rate-tightening cycle.","Finally, I want to talk a little about our blockchain initiative, which is another example of our maniacal focus on how to lever new and innovative technologies to develop efficient and effective client-centered solutions.","As a technology company and the inventor of electronic trading, Nasdaq is in the business of innovating, developing and adapting new technologies with the goal of delivering global capital market efficiency. We believe that blockchain technology holds great promise in allowing capital markets to operate more efficiently, while simultaneously providing greater transparency and security, all of which are fundamental to the public interest.","We are currently exploring the use of blockchain technology in Nasdaq Private Markets. We're targeting initial release of this technology in the fourth quarter of 2015. We also plan to announce further blockchain initiatives in the future. The application of blockchain technology within Nasdaq's Private Markets aims to modernize, streamline and really secure a cumbersome administrative functions and simplify the overwhelming challenges private companies face with manual ledger record-keeping.","We see many applications beyond Private Markets. It is early days but we see blockchain technology as holding great potential to provide increased efficiencies to the broad financial sector and all its members. We are taking a significant, but measured steps so that we are certainly positioned to be a central part of this disruptive technology.","In closing, the results we delivered this quarter, as well as those examples that I outlined here today, illustrate our strong client-centric focus, our ability to execute and to run this business both efficiently and effectively. They are the essential elements that drive our performance and the results we deliver.","We are very pleased with our performance this quarter and it's certainly an exciting time to be here at Nasdaq with NFX, Nasdaq's IR Insights, Dorsey, Wright and all the other products and initiatives we have in our pipeline. We are poised to continue to grow this franchise for months and quarters to come.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","Thanks Bob. The following comments will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.","I want to start off as I did the last few quarters, by highlighting the impact that stronger dollar had on our results, as it obscures in many cases, solid organic growth that we saw in the business. Revenues of $518 million were reduced by $29 million from the prior-year quarter as a result of the stronger dollar. And excluding foreign exchange and acquisition impacts, revenues were up $16 million or 3%, with 3% organic growth both across the non-trading segments as well as in Market Services. Operating income growth was 6% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","In order to provide greater understanding of these effects on the business units, we continue to provide a schedule of the FX impact on the revenues for each business unit on page 15 of the presentation.","I'll start by reviewing second quarter revenue performance relative to the prior-year quarter as shown on page three of the presentation. The 1% or $5 million decline in reported net revenue of $518 million consisted of organic growth in the non-trading segments of $10 million or 3% from growth in Listings, Information Services and Market Technology and $8 million in revenues from the DWA acquisition, partially offset by a $15 million impact of FX for a net $3 million increase in reported revenues and organic growth in Market Services.","Net revenues of $6 million or 3%, the result of higher Cash Equity revenues, partially offset by lower Equity Derivative and FICC trading revenue, coupled with a $14 million FX headwind for a net $8 million reported decline.","And if we move to page four in the presentation, we show how organic growth breaks down historically between the non-transaction, Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Services segments, which had 3% organic growth this quarter, steady with the prior quarter and the volume-sensitive Market Services segment at 3% organic growth for the quarter.","On the bottom of this page, we reiterate our views on the medium-term organic growth outlook for the non-transactional segments. As I've said in the past, these views were meant to reflect multi-year cross-cycle periods and actual growth in shorter periods can be above or below these ranges.","I'm now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be made to the prior-year period unless otherwise noted. Information Services on page five saw $1 million or 1% operational gain and $8 million increase from the DWA acquisition, partially offset by $4 million of FX headwinds for a $5 million net increase in reported revenues, while the operating margin came in at 70%.","Data Products revenues saw a 2% operational increase as growth in tape plans and proprietary revenues and the inclusion of DWA more than offset a $6 million decline in audit collections.","Index Licensing & Services saw a 32% increase due principally to the inclusion of DWA revenues and secondarily, to the higher revenues from exchange-traded products licensed to Nasdaq indexes on higher assets under management.","Assets under management in exchange-traded products licensed to Nasdaq indexes rose 13% to $108 billion at the end of the quarter due to both organic growth and acquired DWA assets under management.","Technology Solutions as shown on page six, saw unchanged revenues operationally which compounded with $8 million in FX headwinds resulted in an $8 million reported decline, so the operating margin rose to 14% from 11% in the prior-year period and operating income rose 19%.","Market Technology revenues saw a 2% operational increase due in particular to growth in SMARTS surveillance product revenues and new order intake was $31 million in the second quarter. New order activity continues to be healthy with many new contracts in SMARTS and BWise and several advanced discussions in the more binary large deal segment. The period ended backlog finished at $707 million, up about 7% year-over-year.","Corporate Solutions revenues saw a narrowing 1% operational decline as we continue progress through the late stages of the integration and customer transitions from the acquisition of the Thomson Reuters Corporate businesses.","We are seeing stabilizing revenues as we continue to complete the migrations and integrations through year-end with clear signs of progress in terms of positive net subscription sales in the first two quarters of 2015, positive market reaction to the next-gen IR Insights platform and margin improvement year-over-year. But we continue to experience competitive pressures in select products. Overall, we continue to be optimistic on the intermediate growth opportunity for the business.","As I previously noted, the segment operating margin of 14% was a material improvement compared to the prior-year period's 11% helping drive 19% growth in operating income year-over-year.","Looking forward, we see ourselves as remaining on track to deliver significant year-over-year improvement in the Technology Solutions' margin in 2015, exit the year in the mid- to high-teens level and continue working to realize our higher medium-term profitability goals.","Listing Services on page seven saw a $9 million or 15% operational increase in revenues, driven by pricing changes and an increased issuer base, partially offset by $3 million of FX headwinds resulting in a 10% reported increase in revenues.","Operating margin of 44% was up from 42% in the prior year. The U.S. issuer base has 4% more companies at the end of the quarter compared with the prior-year period while in the Nordics, the account is 7% higher with a 14% higher local currency market capitalization.","Market Services on page eight saw a $6 million or 3% operational increase in net revenues, which more than \u2013 which was more than offset by $14 million negative FX impact, resulting in a reported revenue decline of 4%.","Operating margin, however, rose to 53% from 51% in the prior-year period. Equity Derivatives Trading and Clearing net revenues saw a 6% operational decrease due to lower U.S. equity options market share partially offset by organic growth in Nordic equity derivatives revenues.","Cash Equities Trading net revenues saw a 20% operational increase as higher U.S. cash equity average capture and increased U.S. and Nordic industry volumes were partially offset by lower market share.","Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Trading and Clearing net revenues saw a 13% operational decline from the prior year with principally volume-driven declines in most fixed product categories and the scheduled end of revenues associated with an eSpeed technology license customer. And Access & Broker Services saw a 3% operational increase.","Turning to pages nine and 14 to review the income statement and expenses. Operating expenses increased by $9 million or 3% on an operational basis, more than offset by an $18 million in FX impact, resulting in a $9 million or 3% reported decline.","Included in the second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were over $5 million related to discrete legal expenses as well as some startup costs for the Nasdaq's Entrepreneurial Center in San Francisco. In the first half of 2015, operating expenses have seen zero organic growth compared to the first half of last year, due in large part to the restructuring actions we detailed in the first quarter of 2015.","Non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter of 2015 rose 6% on an operational basis, but this was partially offset by foreign exchange resulting in a 2% reported increase. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 46%, up from 45% in the prior period.","Net interest expense was $26 million in the second quarter of 2015, a decrease of $3 million versus the prior year, mainly due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange related to our euro-denominated debt. We also recorded non-operating income related to our equity-method ownership interest in OCC.","The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 33% at the lower end of our 2015 33% to 35% effective tax rate guidance range for the year, which we still think is the best projection for our full-year 2015 effective tax rate.","Non-GAAP net income was $143 million or $0.83 per diluted share compared to $131 million or $0.76 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2014.","The $0.07 increase in our non-GAAP EPS represents core organic EPS growth of $0.04 \u2013 $0.04 due to lower taxes, $0.02 due to acquisitions and $0.01 due to non-operating expenses, partially offset by $0.04 impact of changes in the foreign exchange rates.","Moving on to the balance sheet, cash flow and capital, please turn to slides 11 and 12. Our gross debt to EBITDA leverage ratio declined to 2.2 times from 2.3 times in the first quarter of 2015, due to both a slight decline in our debt level and increased trailing 12-month EBITDA.","I'd like to take a moment to review the second quarter highlights in our evolving capital deployment. On capital return in April, we announced a 67% increase in the quarterly dividend and $25 million in share buybacks, bringing the total shareholder return payout ratio to 47% of non-GAAP net income. The Dorsey, Wright acquisition is performing above expectations with a healthy return on investment and significant accretion. And we continue to invest steadily in promising organic initiatives like NFX within the context of a $30 million to $40 million projected research and development budget for 2015.","So we're pleased to be finding attractive capital deployment and return opportunities across a variety of channels and we'll continue to look to put capital we generate to work wherever we see the highest returns to shareholders.","Thanks for your time and I will now turn it back to Ed.","Edward P. Ditmire - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, can we open the line up to Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good morning Bob. Good morning Lee.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","How are you doing Rich?","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Doing good, Bob. The one question if I got the one, but you had a significant increase in the \u2013 with your equity, U.S. equity revenue capture. I know it was lower volume and mix shift, but you also did some pricing tweaks. And I guess I'm just trying to balance, but that's positive, the market share is down to about 18.5%. I guess in the past you've talked about maintaining market share because of the overall enterprise importance of having significant share. So how do you balance off again market share \u2013 you're doing well with the revenue capture, if it can stay that high \u2013 but is there some market share that you're going to have to defend and that that you will need to adjust the revenue capture down?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right so, let me say two things. One we always seek to balance share versus capture. And I'd make the general statement that our capture rate is probably at the high end of our expectations and our share is slightly below our expectations. So you probably see us have a little redress of the balancing. But overall, I'd say we're pleased with the balance that we have today.","With respect to the second part of your question, it's important to recognize that with Tape C, we are by far and away, the largest trading venue in those stocks and that's what we pay particular attention to.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Rutschow with CLSA. Your line is open.","Rob C. Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi, good morning. Just a question on the Corporate Solutions business. It looks like you had pretty good incremental margins, I'm wondering if you can update us on how much of the projected cost savings you've got in there, and if you can give us a little bit more color on what drove the sequential increase in revenues, if there are any puts and takes there.","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","Yeah. So in terms of where we stand on projected cost savings, I would describe it as we are ahead of plan as we've said in the past in achieving the cost savings in the overall business. But we still have yet to complete the full transition. And so are still bearing some duplicative costs on multiple platforms.","In terms of the improvement this quarter, I think we've continued to see the benefit of some revenue momentum within the business as well as the cost savings that we've been able to achieve as a function of just ongoing integration, some of the restructuring efforts that we've taken in the past quarter and then some also business mix shifts in the quarter relative to the prior year that generated higher margins. So I think it's a combination of all of the above that have driven us to that improvement.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I would say that while we're on track for our cost savings, it's important to recognize that we still have been focused on effectiveness first with this business and I think Adena and team are doing a great job to get us to that effective stage. And then there would be more of a maniacal focus on cost efficiency.","But right now, we're making sure that we're delivering the best product to our customer as possible in the best possible way and obviously focused on spending a lot of time, effort and money with our next-gen platform, which I said in my prepared remarks, we're happy that's really moving from the beta stage to a production stage for a limited set of our customers.","Rob C. Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore. Your line is open.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore ISI","Good morning guys.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","How are you doing?","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore ISI","Good. Just within the Technology Solutions segment, I'm just wondering maybe if you could give us a little bit more color just in terms of how to think about the trajectory of revenue going forward, maybe within Corporate Solutions, like how long is the sales cycle for the next-generation IR platform. And within Market Technology the order backlog looks good. The big chunk of that is Borsa Istanbul. I was just wondering when exactly it will be coming online.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So one, I say the important thing is that we see increasing acceptance from the customers of the product set. As I said in my prepared comments, the response has been overwhelming and that will always proceed in increasing revenues. So we're doing all the right things.","Adena T. Friedman - President, Global Capital Access, Technology & Insights","So in terms of the sales cycle for an IR client, it can honestly be as short as a month or as long as four months. I think that it just depends on how ready they are to make a decision and whether or not they do a very thorough analysis or whether they understand that we have the best solution right off the bat. And so it really depends. We will be spending most of 2016 making sure we upgrade our clients to the new platform in addition to selling new clients with the new platforms, so that will be a transition period for us.","In terms of Market Technology, the Borsa Istanbul project is on track. But we will not be completing that project until the second half of next year. So that's when you will start to see the revenue come online.","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","Yeah, Chris this is Lee. Just to add to that, from an accounting standpoint, there are some changes in revenue recognition rules that are coming into play that we expect under the current accounting rules we may begin to recognize some of that revenue in 2017. But I want to make it clear, look, apart from how \u2013 what happens from an accounting standpoint, this is very substantial from a cash flow standpoint for us. There is really value that may not be fully reflected in the GAAP results. And we're happy to kind of talk more about the significance; it is one of the largest market technology contracts that we've signed in the business. So it has a meaningful effect.","And then in terms of ongoing growth across Technology Solutions, we continue to support the mid-single digits growth across Technology Solutions as a whole. I think it's important to recognize that for the remainder of 2015, as we finalize the integration of Corporate Solutions that we are expecting stable, but not a significant growth in revenues within that business recognizing that we're, as Bob said, focused on effectiveness first within that business, but longer-term, we continue to be very optimistic about the achievement of those growth targets in that business.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ashley N. Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","How are you doing?","Ashley N. Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Doing well. Just wondering, I heard you comment on capital management, but how are you thinking about doing smaller deals out there similar to a Dorsey or (32:04) that you had a lot of success with?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great question. So one is we continue to see a deal market where the valuations are frothy. Some could argue are irrational, so we're not going to participate at that level. But there is a lot of deals that we do look at. We have a firm discipline in place in terms of how we evaluate these transactions.","To the extent there is better value on the smaller end where we can lever our branding and our distribution capability, those are particularly attractive to us. So the answer is yes, we'd like to do more of those type deals, but the pricing has to be right and the situation really has to represent in many ways a perfect storm of opportunity with the core value being that we're leveraging our mother ship in some fundamental way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning folks.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","How are we doing?","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Bob, maybe can you talk a little bit more about the NFX game plan that's starting up tomorrow. Maybe some goals in terms of market share intermediate to longer-term revenue contribution and again some maybe just highlight some differences versus the NLX initiative and whether you may retool the NLX initiative based on what you might be seeing at NFX in the future?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Great question. So let me start by saying that NLX I think had a strong quarter. Not visible obviously in the financials of the market share. But with respect to engagement with our customers we had one of the large banks come live for the first time on NLX just last week and on discussions with the proposed members of NLX 2.0 continues and we're also happy to have come to a successful conclusion with our partners on NLX 1.0. So that's there. We're still excited by their prospects.","With respect to NFX, I think a key differentiator is you have a broad base of support and I have to say the support has gone somewhat viral from the natural providers of liquidity to the major banks to the FCMs, to the market-making firms. You name it, they all seem to be wanting to be involved with this initiative.","So that's been, I think, relatively easier than NLX straightforward. As I said, we certainly were the spark, the catalyst, but we were touching a nerve that obviously the customers wanted us to and they are anxious to have some competition in this space. And you know in our options business we have a revenue per contract in the teens call it $0.16 or $0.18. We see in this world that the revenue per contract is about $1.38 to $1.42. We could come in at half that price and obviously be quite happy with the margin we'll get.","And as important as that is the fact that OCC represent horizontal clearing alternative similar to NLX with LCH. And when we talk to our customers, there is not one customer we run into that says, boy, I really like being in a vertical monopoly. So we're trying to address the customer need there. So we're enjoying broad customer support. It's also important to recognize that the structure of NFX strongly encourages people to be active participants I think in a more fulsome way than we had with the original NLX. So we think that will yield a positive outcome. So we're all excited here about day one. We want to start slow and then build from there.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's helpful. Do you have a sense of what kind of market share you would try to be achieving to get scale to build the liquidity in the product?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think our traditional measure is you need about 10% market share to have a reasonable depth in liquidity in your book and so that's our target over the next 18 months to get to the 10% number.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hans-Ole, do want to add anything to that?","Hans-Ole Jochumsen - President-Global Trading & Market Services","No, within 18 to 24 months, we...","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I said 18 not 24 months.","Hans-Ole Jochumsen - President-Global Trading & Market Services","(36:42).","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Hans-Ole Jochumsen - President-Global Trading & Market Services","Yeah. But if I should add one thing, we have already (36:47) seen the last couple of weeks that even the utilities in this market have also been very keen to be connected to the market. So it's not only the usual market participants, it is also utilities, the big utilities in U.S. who want to be part of this new venture.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It definitely has a viral aspect to it.","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","As good as our sales pitch is, there is definitely a viral aspect to this effort.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much for that color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.","Kyle K. Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess, if I can turn to Listings business, it looks like you're experiencing really solid growth there with revenue up about 15% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. I guess, can you just give us some more info as to what exactly you're changing on the pricing side. Is it tweaking both the initial and annual listing fees? I guess, I'm just trying to better understand the sustainability of the revenue growth here as we're looking out over the next couple of years. Thanks.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So I'll say a couple of things and then turn it over to Adena. So one is, I would also highlight on the Listings side the strong performance in the Nordics and that gets overlooked a little bit I think too much. And it really has been a remarkable the success we've had there.","With respect to the U.S., we are here at the market site today and it's been a wonderful week. We had the PayPal spinout happen and then yesterday Blue Buffalo had obviously a very successful IPO. And we're also very happy to win Pure Storage a week or so ago and as we said before, we have a 70% win rate. So we have a high degree of issuance. We have an increased win rate and that certainly is contributing to our performance.","Adena T. Friedman - President, Global Capital Access, Technology & Insights","So in terms of the pricing change, we announced the pricing change in the fall and it was primarily related to the annual listing fees. And we also announced the potential impact of that as we went into the fourth quarter earnings. And we are experiencing the benefit of that pricing change.","The most notable change really is at the top end of our fees, where we are now allowing issuers to opt into an all-inclusive fee, which means that they will no longer be subject to any listing of additional shares fees or any other administrative fees and there is a maximum charge for a listing based on their shares outstanding is $155,000 a year.","And we did see significant opt-in to that pricing level and we'll continue to offer that option over the next few years. So we've just seen a lot of success in the adoption of the fees that we've put out for the firm. And frankly a lot of support for that all-in all-inclusive fee.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Chris, how are you today?","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, doing well, Bob. Follow-up on Corporate Solutions. Thanks for the detail on the sales cycle for next-gen IR. Just wondering if you guys can clarify when exactly you are planning to launch that. Is that still, I think, I remember it being Q4. And along with that when you guys do launch, are you anticipating making any pricing changes, given the positive feedback you've been getting from potential customers?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I would say one, we have a version of the product coming out in the July-August timeframe, which will address in a comprehensive way a very small subset of the users. So that's a good experience for us and a good ramp in terms of we get to test the underlying technology, get some user response. Meantime, we'll be working on the full production release and your data is correct. So we expect to have a product in place that should address 85% of the market by the end of this year. So we're excited about that.","In the beginning, the pricing is not our focus, it's to make sure it's the best product, but we certainly think we have upside to both the revenue side and probably as importantly I think with the new product deployment, once we get beyond the dual cost structure, we'll have a simpler way to deploy this product which should represent improved margins over time.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks guys. Just a question on the Information Services segment. I guess like two parts. Just on the Index Licensing and Services, obviously you've seen some good traction there. Just wanted to get the outlook, particularly, with DWA, given that business in terms of what you see or where you see the growth coming from. And then, Lee, maybe just on the data part of the business, given that we do have some of the audit adjustment each quarter, just wanted to get an outlook for the second half of the year there.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. So I'll start with the broad strategic direction we have. So we certainly believe that passive investing, represented by indexing, will continue to grow as a percent of assets under management. But then we also think within that category Smart Beta will grow even faster. And that we recognize that passive investing has somewhat of a natural ceiling because you are bound by a set of predetermined rules. So Smart Beta allows you to put some more intelligence into the passive space and witness not just the DWA acquisition, but obviously Dividend Achievers and some internal products that we're developing. So that certainly represents \u2013 I'm looking at Adena and put some pressure on her a double-digit growth opportunity over time, right Adena?","Adena T. Friedman - President, Global Capital Access, Technology & Insights","I would agree based on the overall growth of Smart Beta.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Go ahead Lee.","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","Yeah, so Michael, I'm glad you asked the question. Just a kind of \u2013 there were a lot of moving pieces in the Information Services business. And so as you noted, there was a $6 million change in the overall audit revenues year-over-year, that audit revenues were down $6 million in this quarter. And I think it's important to understand, if you want to try to get to kind of a clear organic growth for the quarter year-over-year and you take the operating impact that is ex-FX increase of $9 million and you take out the DWA impact of $8 million for the quarter, but then also keep audit flat from the year-over-year period, our Information Services revenue would have been up $7 million or 6%, which is very consistent with the revenue growth guidance that we have given for that segment. And I think that's a reasonable basis as we look out over the longer-term for that.","I do think that from an audit revenue standpoint, we're seeing kind of a stabilization in that revenue and so we may have from quarter-to-quarter some upside or downside, but I think the level that we're at right now is a good baseline to use.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi good morning. On Nasdaq Private Market, are there metrics that you are seeing that show that the 100 or so companies that are signed up are utilizing the services offered? So either metrics on kind of, secondary transactions or capital raise or something on access to liquidity. And then what are the next steps for NPM?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Great question. So I would say, one, let's start with the initial focus and that's cap table management. So we have clear metrics on how many customers are using that and how sophisticated their use is of cap table. And that's kind of our first foray into the customers.","Then the second stage, we run liquidity programs for them and we track one, the size of the liquidity program and then two, how often they're running it. And then as we evolve overtime, it's going to be how broad the participation is in those liquidity programs. Typically they are employee programs today but we certainly see the ability to evolve to a credit investors or early-stage VC firms participating in some of those liquidity programs.","So we definitely are one excited about the progress in a short period of time. Definitely see this market evolving. And we definitely pay very close attention to what I call the non-financial metrics, which you are looking at now this \u2013 kind of, referencing now, which will really gauge our progress in the medium-term.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Bob Greifeld for closing remarks.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Another great quarter for Nasdaq. Record earnings on a number of different measurements, so we're proud of that. But I also say, we're most proud of the fact that we are again well-positioned in each of our businesses and I think are taking the lead in innovating in a number of those businesses in our pipeline and our new products coming are I think incredibly strong, so we are fundamentally excited about our prospects going forward.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Vincent Palmiere, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Vince Palmiere","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ OMX's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Results. Joining me are Bob Greifeld, our Chief Executive Officer; Lee Shavel, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ed Knight, our General Counsel.","Following our prepared remarks, we'll open up the line to Q&A. You can access the results press release and presentation on NASDAQ OMX's Investor Relations' website at www.nasdaqomx.com. We intend to use our website as a means of disclosing material nonpublic information and for complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD, and these disclosures will be included under the Events and Presentations section of the site.","Now before I turn the call over to Bob, I'd like to remind you that certain statements in the prepared presentation and during the subsequent Q&A period may relate to future events and expectations and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and other periodic reports filed with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld","Thank you, Vince, and thanks, everybody, for joining the call this morning. I will begin by spending a few minutes highlighting our results and then update you on our plans going forward. Lee will then walk you through the detailed financials. ","For the fourth quarter, we delivered solid results as we grew net revenues, income and earnings per share from prior year levels despite the backdrop of a challenging volume environment. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.63 for the quarter, up 15% from the $0.55 in the fourth quarter of 2010. ","For the full year 2011, results were truly outstanding as we set new records across the board. Net revenue and non-GAAP net income grew 11% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share grew 27% to $2.53. This is a remarkable achievement that caps a 4-year run as we -- in which we have grown our earnings per share by an average of 14% per year and highlights the success of our strategic plan as it was delivered during a period in which we operated in an ultra-competitive environment with weakening, macroeconomic drivers.","During this time, we saw equity trading volumes decline, industry employment levels retrieved and fewer companies going public. When viewed through the harsh reality of this operating environment, our results over the last 4 years reflect truly exceptional performance. ","Our ability to grow the business has been achieved by focusing on 3 key elements of our strategic plan: first, investing in new organic growth initiatives; second, making sound acquisition decisions; and three, managing our capital efficiently. The execution of this plan has resulted in the diversification of our business and a broadening of our product offering. This past year was the second consecutive year in which derivatives trading revenue exceeded those of cash equities as revenues grew 18% from 2010 and then as average growth of approximately 15% annually over the past 4 years. ","Other areas in which we've chosen to diversify have also grown. In Access Services, revenue grew by an astounding 29% in 2011 and have grown by an average of 24% annually since 2007. Corporate Solutions has a 4-year compounded average growth rate of 14%; Market Technology has a full year CAGR of 12%; and U.S. market data revenues have grown an average of 10% annually. ","The chart on Slide 5 of our presentation does a good job of highlighting the success of our diversification strategy. Today, 14% of our revenues come from trading cash equities, down from 23% in 2007, and 2\/3 of that revenue is generated from products and services that are recurring in nature. It is this solid base of recurring revenues that provides the foundation for our strong cash flow model, a model that has allowed us to invest in new initiatives and make strategic bolt-on acquisitions while also returning capital to shareholders. ","While revenues have grown, it's important to note that we've been able to deliver this growth while maintaining strong operating margins. In 2011, our non-GAAP operating margins came in at 46%, on par with the full year of 2010, but up significantly from a 38% margin we achieved in 2007.","Now turning to the details of the quarter. Within our Market Services business segment, despite a slight decline in industry volumes, we managed to grow our U.S. equity matched volumes by 7% from prior year levels as market share improved. ","In the quarter, our total share was 21.3%, up from 19.6% in the fourth quarter of 2010, due primarily to the success of our Investors Support Program known as ISP. This program is designed to attract retail and institutional order flows while rewarding firms that exceeds certain liquidity provision and execution requirements. We're encouraged by the progress of this program and remain confident about its continued success. ","Within U.S. options, we witnessed growth in the number of market makers of the NASDAQ Options Market, which we attribute to the migration of NOM to the PHLX technology architecture during the third quarter. We also saw growth in new members of PHLX from those looking to trade in our open outcry market and with our new, improved complex order functionality.","In the Nordics, N2EX continues to grow at an impressive rate. And they ended the year with 34 members and 15 companies trading U.K. power futures. Scottish Power became the third of the 6 large U.K. utilities to commit to bidding arrangements in N2EX's day-ahead auction. This follows earlier commitments from E.ON and SSE. Just last week, Drax Power, the largest independent power producer became the most recent member of N2EX. ","During the fourth quarter of 2011, total cleared volume was 20.3 terawatt hours, up from 9.7 terawatt hours in the prior quarter, over 100% growth quarter-on-quarter. Truly impressive. ","In Nordic equities, we now intentions to introduce competitive central counter-party clearing in cooperation with EMCF, EuroCCP and SIX x-clear. Interoperability will allow members to choose between multiple clearing houses to clear and settle trades. We expect this initiative to be implemented by the end of April subject to the necessary regulatory consent or approvals.","In the fourth quarter, we also launched Genium Risk, a new risk management platform for the Nordic clearinghouse. This is a state-of-the-art system that provides a clearinghouse with real-time risk management solutions, including tools for improved risk monitoring and handling of incidents for derivatives clearing, and plans for our member default fund for our clearinghouse are on target for the end of the first quarter. Establishing a member default fund should free up approximately $100 million, $100 million USD in capital once it has been established. ","Within Access Services, revenue grew 17% over the fourth quarter of 2010, driven by the addition of FTEN and increased demand for services. During the quarter, we continue to invest in our beyond-the-mat strategy, which is being developed to help our broker-dealer customers across the globe meet their changing business needs and evolving regulatory requirements. We'll share more with you about these exciting new developments within the strategy as the year progresses.","In Market Data, we diversified into new content with the acquisition of a business that provides machine-readable economic news. This business called, Event Driven Analytics delivers U.S. government and other economic indicators to a variety of participants.","Moving onto our Issuer Services business segment. Revenues grew for the fourth quarter of 2010 on the strength and demand for our Corporate Solutions. We continue to expand our product offering in Corporate Solutions through the acquisition of Glide Technology, a leading software and service provider specializing in corporate communications and reputation management solutions. By integrating Glide into our corporate solutions platform, we are able to create the first and only fully integrated workflow solution for investor relations and public relations professionals. ","During the quarter, we are happy to welcome 52 -- 56 new listings and 16 IPOs, including Groupon, Ubiquiti Networks, Zynga and Jive Software. On the IPO front, things appear to be improving as our pipeline continues to grow providing us with the largest IPO pipeline in more than 10 years. And we were very successful in attracting companies to switch their listings to NASDAQ. And all companies representing over $80 billion in market capitalization have switched to NASDAQ. This list includes blue chip companies, such as Texas Instruments and Viacom and also contains companies from diverse industries, such as Icon Enterprises, Sallie Mae, Frontier Communication and Wendy's. This was all accomplished in the fourth quarter of 2011. ","In Market Technology, the SMARTS broker compliance business continued to grow during the quarter, winning contracts with 2 global brokerage firms, each operating in 28 markets. In parallel with Chi-X Australia commencing operations, SMARTS launched our broker compliance in support of the new market, while also securing nearly a dozen new clients for the service. ","Also during the quarter, Market Technology signed a strategic alliance with the Chilean Stock Exchange, and we will provide them with extreme trading and advisory services for product development and global visibility. Overall, SMARTS revenue grew more than 25% when compared to the year ago period. On the whole, we've made tremendous progress on many fronts during the quarter.","As we look towards 2012, there are some signs that the market is improving. However, challenges remain, and this type of environment creates uncertainty for market volumes. Clearly, the year has started slow, but we've faced similar challenges in the past and we have found ways to grow. As Lee will discuss in his remarks, the first leg of our strategic plan is yielding results as our investments in organic initiatives have flourished and efforts to redefine the markets in which we operate are delivering growth. Not only are we looking to expand our addressable market, we're also working to ensure that our products and services continue to evolve through innovation and provide increasing value to customers. This type of entrepreneurial spirit has driven us in the past and will carry us in 2012 and beyond. ","We also believe the opportunities before us, not just internally, but externally as well, are now better than ever. As we've done in the past, we'll continue to pursue a sound acquisition strategy, one that ensures transactions exceed the criteria of our thorough evaluation and approval process.","Finally, we'll continue to make sound capital management decisions. While our strong cash flow model supports all 3 legs of our strategic plan, we have been particularly aggressive with plans to return capital to shareholders. Since announcing our most recent share repurchase plan in September, we purchased 4 million shares with the book value of over -- aggregate value of over $100 million. And from the time we first started our buyback program in March 2010, we have purchased 42 million shares or nearly 20% of our outstanding shares at an average price of $21.47 and compounded value of around $900 million. Our plans for 2012 are to complete the existing repurchase plan and prepare for the next steps of our capital return policy, which will include the consideration of a dividend. ","I'll close my prepared remarks by emphasizing the fact that in 2011, our strategic decision making continue to pay off as we achieved double-digit growth in revenues and earnings. Investments in new initiatives, contributions from acquisitions and capital deployment decisions all contributed to our success despite the backdrop of a difficult macroeconomic environment. As we entered 2012, we remain committed to our strategic plan to ensure that we are well positioned for growth. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Shavel","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Our GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $82 million or $0.45 per diluted share. Results this quarter include $44 million of pretax expenses associated with our debt refinancing, the impairment of an available-for-sale investment security and mergers and strategic initiatives. When excluding the impact of these items, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.63, an increase of 15% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.","Net income reported on a non-GAAP basis was $113 million, an increase of $3 million, or 3%, when compared to the prior year quarter. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at  ir.nasdaqomx.com.","Turning to our fourth quarter operating results. Net exchange revenues came in at $422 million, representing an increase of $22 million, or 6%, when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Within Market Services, revenues for the quarter were $281 million, an increase of $16 million over prior year results. ","Cash equity revenues were $59 million, down $1 million as value traded in the Nordics declined. Net derivative trading and clearing revenues were $73 million, down slightly when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, due primarily to lower volumes within our PHLX option market. And in Nordic derivatives, revenues were flat when compared to the prior year as increases in index derivative volumes were offset by volume declines in equity derivatives. ","In the fourth quarter, revenues within Nordic derivatives were comprised of $13 million from energy and carbon products, $13 million from stock and index derivatives, $5 million from fixed income products and approximately $1 million from other revenues and fees. ","In Access Services, revenues were $56 million for the quarter, an increase of $8 million, or 17%, from last year, due to the inclusion of results from FTEN, which was acquired at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010 and to continue growth in our core services. ","Market Data revenues were $87 million in the quarter, up $8 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, driven by increased demand for products, modified fees for European products and higher audit-related revenues. And in Issuer Services, revenues were $93 million for the quarter, up $4 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Driving this growth was increased demand from listed companies for our Corporate Solutions, higher revenues from European listing fees and an increase in Global Index Group revenues.","Turning to Market Technology. Revenue was $48 million for the quarter, up from $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, due primarily to fees generated from recently delivered projects. Looking forward for the first quarter of 2012, we expect Market Technology revenues to be in the range of $44 million to $46 million.","Now turning to expenses. On Slide 9, you can see that our total non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $235 million, representing an increase of $19 million or 9% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in expenses is primarily driven by the inclusion of results from FTEN and Zoomvision, which were acquired in December of 2010. Expenses associated with these acquisitions contributed an incremental $8 million for the quarter. Also contributing to the increase in expenses was the impact of changes in exchange rates of various currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar, which had the effect of increasing expenses by $1 million. So when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange and costs associated with these new acquisitions, our core expenses increased to $10 million, or 5%, when compared to the fourth quarter of last year.","As I've discussed with many of you, in 2012, we are implementing bifurcated expense guidance between core expenses and incremental new initiative spending. The purpose of this improved transparency is to ensure that you have a clear view of our expense management discipline around core expenses, as well as an understanding of where we are making additional investments in new initiatives that we believe have strong growth and return potential.","On Slide 11, you can see that for 2012, we expect core operating expenses to be in the range of $915 million to $935 million. Plus an additional $40 million to $50 million for incremental new initiative spending resulting in total operating expenses in the range of $955 million to $985 million. Also included in the 2012 guidance are approximately $14 million of incremental expenses associated with the recent acquisitions of Glide Technologies, RapiData and the Lithuanian CSD. ","On the surface, this guidance reflects an increase in total expenses of about 5% when compared to 2011. However, if you exclude expenses for new initiatives and adjust to include the full year impact in 2011 of expenses from recent acquisitions of $14 million, you see that costs for our core operations are estimated to be up only 1% in 2012 from 2011 levels. This reflects our continuing commitment to controlling expenses and maintaining the operational efficiency that investors have come to expect from us while balancing the need to invest in promising growth initiatives with strong growth and return potential. ","While providing guidance for new initiative spending is not entirely new for us, I do want to take a minute to walk you through how we're approaching it for 2012. First of all, the funds that we've earmarked for new initiatives are not fully committed at this point. Many of the projects have to complete the comprehensive approval process we use to ensure that they exceed return on capital and profitability thresholds that we evaluate when approving new initiatives. As such, it is possible that the amounts we approve this year may vary from the $40 million to $50 million range. However, based on discussions we've had to this point, we believe it prudent to provide you with some estimate for 2012 investments. ","We do expect new initiative spending to grow gradually as we move throughout the year with approximately $10 million of spending to be incurred in the first quarter of 2012. As a result, expenses for the first quarter are expected to be approximately $230 million to $240 million within the range of expenses incurred in the preceding 2 quarters. Investing in new initiatives have always provided organic growth opportunities for NASDAQ OMX, and in turn, enabled us to provide superior returns for investors.","Slide 12 of our presentation highlights the revenue and expense of investments we've made over the years. You can see that in 2012, initiatives that are fully deployed are expected to have margins of more than 50%. Our commitment going forward is to apply the same return on investment discipline that has driven us in the past to the new initiatives we plan to launch this year.","Now continuing down the income statement. Our non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2011 was $187 million, an increase of $3 million over prior year results as operating margins came in at 44%. And net interest expense was $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, a decrease of $1 million from the fourth quarter of 2010, but a decline of $4 million when compared to the third quarter of 2011. Driving the material decline when compared to the third quarter is the recent refinancing of our credit facility and the repurchase of $335 million of the 2.5% convertible notes that we completed in October. ","Finally, on the income statement. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 32%. We expect the tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 34% in 2012.","Before I get to the balance sheet, I want to provide some detail on the $44 million of pretax expenses that we incurred this quarter and that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. These expenses include $25 million in pretax charges, of which $24 million is noncash, following our tender offer to purchase the 2.5% convertible notes. Included were $22 million of an acceleration of unamortized debt discount, $2 million of debt issuance costs and $1 million of other expenses. ","Secondly, a noncash other-than-temporary charge of $18 million related to an available-for-sale investment security in Dubai financial market. As of December 31, 2011, the cost basis of this investment security was $36 million and the fair value was $18 million. We determined that the decline in value of the security below its carrying amount was other than temporary. And finally, $1 million in expenses related to merger and strategic initiatives.","Moving onto the balance sheet on Slide 13. Cash and cash equivalents and financial instruments at the quarter end were approximately $933 million. Of this amount, approximately $504 million is reserved for regulatory requirements and other restricted purposes. During the quarter, we used $37 million for capital spending purposes bringing our total capital spending for the year to $88 million. And on Slide 14, you can see that we ended the period with $2.1 billion in debt obligations, down from $2.3 billion at the end of 2010. Our total debt to EBITDA is now at 2.4x, down from 2.9x at the end of last year. ","And finally, as Bob mentioned earlier, under our authorized share repurchase program, we repurchased 3.98 million shares at an average price of $25.10 with an aggregate value of $100 million. This leaves an additional $200 million available under the authorized plan.","Before we open up the line to questions, let me say that we're very happy with the results for the fourth quarter and particularly for the full year as 2011 was a success across the board. Not only did we grow earnings to record amounts, we also increased cash reserves, reduced outstanding debt obligations, lowered our borrowing costs and continued to return capital to shareholders. In the coming year, we plan to leverage our diversified business model and the strong cash flow it generates to invest in growth opportunities while continuing to generate strong returns for shareholders. ","Thank you for your attention, and I will now turn it back over to Vince.","Vince Palmiere","Thank you, Lee. Operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first on the line, we have Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Maybe first question is just on the expenses. Just given the environment thus far, when we think about the core expenses, I think that the flat or up 1% makes sense. On the new initiatives, I guess you guys gave the chart, and it looks like maybe $29 million of revenues coming in, in 2012. I guess in terms of timing of that versus the incoming expenses, how should we think about that? And then just when you look at the bars that you have on that Slide 12, if you can explain sort of the deployed versus in development just because it looks like that expense level in 2012 in terms of in development is a bit higher?","Lee Shavel","Sure. So I think the important thing to start off with is that in defining the deployed versus the in development, the deployed projects represent initiatives that really have been effectively launched to the marketplace and have achieved in our view, kind of core momentum within the business. They're generating revenues consistent with our expectations and have been established. The in development represent businesses or new initiatives that are currently still establishing their product and distribution. They're characterized by higher-level investment upfront in the businesses in which we expect to generate stronger revenue growth in the years ahead. Now as we look forward, what were our expectations are, are that for the new initiatives spending of $45 million, it consists of a portfolio of new initiatives that have a varying degree of revenue growth across the next 3 to 5 years. We look at them primarily from a return on capital standpoint to make certain that they are generating good returns, as well as generating strong revenue growth, and ultimately, operating profit growth. We show everything on Page 12 in terms of what we've made in investments to make certain that everyone appreciates the fact this is not a new activity for us. That we've been able to generate exceptionally strong revenue growth relative to expenses across that -- across the past 4 years in each of these. And as you can see at the bottom, a number of these initiatives that we've identified that are all in the deployed category.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, Bob, just a follow-up. Given what just kind of transpired throughout last year and then more recently on the M&A front and when you're thinking about capital deployment, the opportunities where there's buyback, dividends, and what you guys have been fairly good at is the bolt-on acquisitions. Just how do you prioritize, or how do you think that plays out in 2012 and '13?","Robert Greifeld","Well, the first thing I would say is take a little issue. I think we've been very good at the bolt-on acquisitions, not pretty good. And that they've worked incredibly well for us. I think we have the great benefit of being able to execute successfully on all 3 areas. So we talked about organic growth initiatives, which you just questioned Lee on. Clearly, we'll do some other acquisitions, and we'll also do capital returns. So our business model allows us to really do all 3, I think, well. And so we don't really see a bottleneck or contention in those objectives.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just in terms of the new initiatives, can you help us maybe think about the buckets whether it's by market services or issuer and services market tech beyond the matched? How much of it is that? And then also, you kind of talked about, I guess, expanding this year with a 3- to 5-year time horizon. What is the track record that you show on Slide 1 going back to 2009 show with respect to the average payback derivatives?","Robert Greifeld","So in terms of the distribution of the initiative dollars, you'd have to say that the larger percentage of the dollars are going into our transaction businesses at this point in time. So whether that be in derivatives, in equities, in commodities, they're consuming the single largest amount of dollars.","Lee Shavel","And I would say on the payback period, if you look at the chart on Page 12, you can see that in 2009 obviously, expenses were higher than revenues. But by 2010 in those deployed expenses, we had really achieved operating profit among those -- on those established ventures. It obviously varies project by project. But I would say on average, we generally are reaching our payback period within 1 to 2 years on these deployed projects.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess on capital return, you mentioned that dividend maybe in the offing. What timeframe do you have in terms of deciding sort of the mix of buybacks versus dividends?","Robert Greifeld","Sure, good question. What I've said before, Roger, is that the dividend question is not if, but when. And clearly, we're focused on the buyback. And I think the dividend will become more real as we get towards the end of the buyback program. And again, these discussions are all subject to the Board voting on whether or not they want to do a dividend. My comment.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And then just lastly, on the $100 million capital that -- when we free up and in the Nordic clearinghouse. Can you remind us what restrictions there are in terms of moving that around or being able to redeploy that?","Robert Greifeld","Sure, on the $100 million from the Nordic clearinghouse, that will be capital that is in Europe and in order to -- we would plan on utilizing that capital within the European venue. If we needed to, we could bring that back to the U.S., although we would have to pay taxes in order to bring that back. We don't see any need for that given the strong cash flow and cash levels that we have within the U.S., but that is a restriction that we would face in repatriating that cash out of Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess first just a follow-up on the buyback. You bought back 4 million shares. The diluted share count didn't drop by 1, I think, basic drop by 2. So could you just talk about, were there options granted to increase the diluted share count? And just to clarify the previous question, the $100 million then from clearing in Europe, that's really -- you don't really use that in the calculations of, well at least, 50% to 75% of net income or cash available?","Robert Greifeld","So Rich, on the first question the reason that you don't see as big an impact in the fourth quarter is that we received authorization for that relatively late in the quarter, and we're subject to our blackout period. And so it had a relatively limited impact in the fourth quarter. You'll see the full effect in the first quarter. And with regard to the second question, the $100 million freed up, I think you're correct that I'm not -- we wouldn't characterize that as available to supplement the share repurchase program. But that is capital that will be utilized within the European business, but we continue to stand by our guidance from ongoing share repurchases.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then I guess just an adamant question, but the tax guidance, $32 million to $34 million. Is there a reason -- I believe the old guidance was $31 million, but $33 million. Is there -- have I got that right, or is there an increase here?","Lee Shavel","Yes, that's correct. Obviously, it varies by business mix between our U.S. and international jurisdictions. I would say that within the U.S., what we are experiencing are some increasing tax rates, particularly at the state level that is influencing that upwards.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, and then, Bob, my last question. The media reported that you might be viewed as a candidate for the chairmanship at NASDAQ. Just trying to see whether you can provide any color on that. How would your -- view corporate governance if you were to sort of hold both positions. Would that be -- do you think that's reasonable arrangement at NASDAQ? And I just -- overall color behind what was released by the media.","Robert Greifeld","Well, I think it was a single person, Rich, who ran a story that was obviously not picked by anybody else. And so it was just one story, and we're not really going to comment beyond that.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","But would you say he's had --  that one person's had a reasonable track record in the past?","Robert Greifeld","I think the track record's been unbelievably bad in terms of information, but that's our opinion. So it was one story that was written from there. Obviously, any Board deliberations are Board deliberations -- and right now, we have a long-standing chairman, who done a wonderful job for NASDAQ OMX.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Well, maybe the fair question then, would you be interested in the chairmanship?","Robert Greifeld","I serve at the pleasure of the Board. And right now, I'm having a great time being the CEO of NASDAQ OMX, and hopefully, investors think that I'm doing a reasonably good job with it. And that's what we're focused on.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And you have, you had a solid year in 2011.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just another follow-up on the buyback. The pace of the share repurchases was much more aggressive than we anticipated this quarter. Was there anything you would say unique to the environment of the stock price that got you to that $100 million? So I guess to put it another way, do you see that as a sustainable level?","Lee Shavel","No, there was nothing unique about the environment. I would say that the share repurchase levels in the fourth quarter reflected the fact that we had really built up some excess capital from not being able to repurchase shares early in the year. And so to a certain extent, the $100 million level was a bit of a catch-up with some of the excess capital that we had generated. And I think in some of my remarks earlier, we had signaled that we may exceed the $50 million to $75 million levels from time to time depending upon on how we gauge our overall capital levels and our needs within the business. I would continue to point folks towards the $50 million to $75 billion per quarter going forward, absent any unexpected changes in capital availability as well as our internal uses of capital.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then, Bob, you've been successful in diversifying the franchise away from transaction-related revenues. We're still hoping for your outlook on broader market volumes as you've been a good predictor in the past.","Robert Greifeld","I don't know if I have been that good. But I would say -- what I do say is obviously, over the medium to long-term volumes will follow GDP growth. To the extent you have increased GDP activity, you've got disposable income. People will take that and tend to invest it in equities. Certainly, when we look at the volume over the last 2 years, we had 1 good month of volume in 2011, that was August. In 2010, we had really May and part of June. So we have built this business right now to certainly enjoy when we have good volumes, but what we can produce I think adequate performance, adequate to good performance in a bad volume environment. So when I look at a given year, I think it's reasonable for us to expect that we would have 1 to 2 good months. January is certainly not that. But with what's going on in the world and what's going to happen in the American election cycle, we sit here in January thinking that there'll be several months during the year that we'll enjoy higher volume volatility. So that's our kind of 2012 outlook. It's in our plans. I would say the volume outlook though for '12 is still below what we presented during our Investor Day. So we're not seeing getting back to that level, but we're reasonably comfortable.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then finally, I wanted to get your thoughts on the decision by the European Commission regarding NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse. In hindsight, you were really accurate in your assessment of the complexity, the time for that deal to close. But I guess at this point, what do you see as potential implication to that ruling on the future of European regulation and your business?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, well, I'll answer this question. I'll do is answer this question as comprehensively as I can, and then hopefully, that will be the last question on the topic. The first thing you have to say with respect to the failed transaction is that we here at NASDAQ OMX is certainly empathetic to the feelings of the management team of both Deutsche and NYSE. It wasn't too long ago that Jeff Sprecher, myself and the management teams from ICE and NASDAQ, obviously, failed. And we had to go through really a painful moments full of frustration and a dominant feeling of not having your arguments understood. Now we recovered, ICE has recovered. And I'm sure that Reto and Duncan and their teams are formidable competitors and will recover from this setback. Now when you look at this any time you're trying to complete a merger where the number of competitors is low or the market share is high, your successful hinge on whether you can broaden the definition of the market. In our situation, we attempted to define capital raising and the public listing market in global terms. And during the brief period of time, we're involved with the DOJ process name brand companies, such as Samsonite, Prada and Glencore chose to list outside their home markets. We also witnessed billion-dollar capital raises occurring outside of public markets. But we obviously didn't carry the day with the winning market definition. Our deal was turned down similarly you see that this deal was turned down because they were not able to successfully redefine what the market is. Now we do not believe that this ruling will preclude other large exchange deals from happening. Our rejection by the DOJ and today's rejection by the EU Competition Committee certainly sent a clear message that if a transaction results in over 90% market share in a predefined market is highly suspect. But there is a compelling industrial logic of combining operations and technology of nonoverlapping exchanges, and that will happen in the future. Now with respect to NASDAQ OMX, as we've said now several times during this call, we're focused on our strategy of organic growth, amplified through bolt-on acquisitions while providing a capital return to shareholders. And this plan was developed independent of the Deutsche Boerse acquisition of NYSE and is obviously not affected by today's decision.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of data questions, I guess, for Lee here. In terms of market data and extra services, can you talk a little bit about the sequential change? I think in market data, you had an acquisition in there, but it seemed to be pretty decent pick-up. And then on access services, a little surprised to see the drop there, so curious where that's coming from. I thought that was still a pretty decent growth area for you guys.","Lee Shavel","Yes, so an access services, let me address that one first. In access services in the third quarter, we had an exceptionally elevated level in the third quarter due to an audit that generated some one-time revenues. So the decline sequentially third quarter to fourth quarter I think just reflects a reversion back to our normalized growth rate. So that really explains that difference. From a global data product standpoint, the growth in revenues from the third quarter of about 5%, as well as the 10% growth from the fourth quarter is a reflection of a larger number of TotalView pro users, as well as some increased audit revenues over that period. And we think it's particularly strong results given naturally, the relatively weak environment from a Street and broker-dealer standpoint. But those are the primary contributors to the growth in the Data Services business.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just actually picking up on your last comment there. I think I asked something similar to this already a quarter ago. But given the weak environment and that obviously, some larger firms and smaller firms, pulling back a little bit from the markets in terms of employment and so forth, are you seeing weakness in certain areas? I mean I see the pipeline in market technology has declined year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter. Are there certain areas where you definitely see people not renewing licenses or turning -- or actually, it takes longer to get people over the hump to kind of sign the line? Or do you think you have a pretty solid pipeline you have of yourself in terms of your businesses?","Robert Greifeld","I would say this, first, with respect to our internal organic growth initiatives, we are what we call a high-watermark with respect to the opportunities available to us. And we obviously are committed to funding those opportunities to invest in our future. Likewise, in the spear of acquisitions under the broad category of bolt on, we see more opportunities coming our way then we've had in the last several years. Obviously, there's always a stand-off with respect to valuation, and we've sit down on a number in the last 18 months based upon that. But I think things are getting closer together on the bid offer spread. In our core businesses, as I said in my prepared comments, we obviously have started the year slow with respect to volume. As we look at our businesses, which have now diversified away from being so volume dependent, we certainly think that as we look at the numbers we want to achieve in 2012, we need 1 to 2 quarters -- 1 to 2 months of good volumes to hit our numbers. And I think that's a reasonable expectation that will happen based upon the geopolitical situation that we live in and plus the basic economy in the U.S. starting to heal. And we certainly see a broad pipeline of IPOs. As I said again in my prepared comments, we have a higher level of IPO applications than in the last 10 years, which is kind of shocking when I saw that stat a couple of weeks ago, there. With respect to market technology, in general as we've articulated before, we are on a mission to broaden the scope. We crossed the Rubicon when we made the SMARTS acquisition where we're defining our markets to be not just exchanges and regulators, but brokers, so we see a tremendous growth opportunity in that in the time to come. And again in my prepared comments, it says that SMARTS year-on-year grew I think 25%. So it's been an impressive performance. In market tech in particular, there is some lumpiness represented in numbers between the breakdown between, we'll call it, large-scale projects and short term, what we call CRs, customers change request. So that will kind of skew back and forth depending upon what's going on. But clearly, the market tech franchise is at, I think, a high-watermark with respect to its strength.","Lee Shavel","I will just add. I think you also asked about market data. And there, I think, the observation is correct. Obviously, there are some headwinds from an industry standpoint. But clearly, where we have seen opportunities to grow as been developing new products in our Proprietary Data Products business as well as a number of our recent acquisitions, like Rapid Data and the machine-readable news service where we're able to find new markets, new appetite for products that have allowed us to continue to generate growth despite a more challenging market environment for some of the traditional products.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Very good. Just one quick one here, on the expense side, I think you might have addressed this, but given Bob that you said we're off to a slow start and you're expecting 1 to 2 months of strength, which I would actually agree with. But if that doesn't materialize and we've stayed this kind of lackluster environment, do you think on the expense side -- on the core expense side, there -- there's room to maybe pare back a little bit. I think you are running a pretty lean ship already, but is there any -- are there any areas that you could pull back?","Robert Greifeld","Definitely. And certainly the first and foremost is our incentive pay, which is tied to a certain level of performance. But I want to say very clearly that how we're managing NASDAQ OMX today is on 2 different tracks. So on the core track, which you asked a question on, we will manage the business climate and clearly, if we think the revenue forecast we have for that core business is no longer valid, then we'll make the appropriate responses from a management point of view, as we have done in the past. So I think I've demonstrated a good track record of doing that. The second side of our core initiatives, we have dramatically increased our ways to execute those initiatives and to weigh, measure and count and to track them quite efficiently. So they go to a separate set of dynamics, some of the dynamics are actually nonfinancial milestones that these things -- these initiatives have to hit to the extent they don't, that we have a discipline to say, \"Okay, whatever we assumed in the beginning is not quite working and then make whatever clinical decisions we have to after that.\" So the core is certainly responsive to the particular environments for the year, investments are really responsive to the state of the opportunity and how we're executing there.","Operator","And next on the line, we have Niamh Alexander with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Lee, if I could just on the expenses, just ask a question maybe another way. Every business has to invest in its initiatives and to kind of reinvent itself is what you're focusing on. And here, I guess you're really giving us the numbers and showing us, we have been doing this for quite some time and this is a revenue we're kicking in as well. So going forward, I think I'd be inclined to kind of build in these initiative expenses into kind of the estimates and the core model because they are part of your everyday business. But is this something like we should think about also for -- maybe the bolt-on acquisition is that -- you seem to be -- I'm getting the signal that you're seeing a lot more attractive opportunities now. Should we be expecting kind of 1 clean number going forward because you have done quite a few, and it looks like you'll do this going forward? Or could we get like the smaller M&A and the bolt-on deals will get kind of a separate level of disclosure for those, as well as the initiatives, as well as the core?","Robert Greifeld","Niamh, what I would say is that acquisitions are kind of a different game. And what we want to isolate here are in our specific organic investments within the business. Obviously, our acquisitions are subject to exactly the same disciplines from a return on capital and from a profitability standpoint. I think we want to particularly focus on those internal projects because we want to provide some separation between where we're maintaining expense discipline on the core business and then where we're investing for growth on the internal side.","Robert Greifeld","And the important thing to recognize, Niamh, was acquisitions. We're looking always looking to do a transaction. What we'd call, one bowling pin left or right, which is leveraging some assets of the mother ship. And what that means in so many words is these acquisitions quickly gets subsumed within the mother ship, and it's hard then to track them independently in a quite rapid period of time. And we try to do that for as long as we can. But for example, when we buy a company, such as FTEN or SMARTS, then the operations aspect of the company goes into our corporate operations area. The development people go in a different direction, the salespeople go here. So we tend to subsume things in. We don't have companies that are left to stand-alone portfolio plays.","Lee Shavel","And I think putting it into scale, clearly a couple, even small bolt-on acquisitions could, I think, overwhelm kind of the data related to this initiative. We want to keep the focus on this and we'll obviously, it will give you updates in terms of how the acquisitions are going from an integration and from a returns standpoint. And obviously, that will be embedded in our overall numbers. But I don't want folks to have the expectation that this breakout of spending is going to encompass all of our independent deployment of capital and acquisitions. It's really just focused on the new initiatives.","Robert Greifeld","Yes, really we should not call them bolt on. They're bolt-in acquisitions is the way to look at it.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And then if I could get back to kind of the core business, where there is still quite a lot of leverage. The options business, especially where it's now much bigger than the equities. You've had some great growth there. The price compression is not nearly been as aggressive as we've expected. How do you feel about that business going into this year? Do you see maybe more opportunities to take market share or is it getting a little bit more difficult from here? How do you feel about the pricing environment?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I think the options business is a very competitive business, and in certain dimensions, it's as or not more competitive than the equities business. Now we have obviously, a very capable management team led by Eric Noll and as Tom Wittman  and we've taken a lot of proper steps in the marketplace. We certainly see that we're setting the tone. Competitors are responding to us, and it is a chess game that we play quite aggressively. So one is we think the core options franchises a strong franchise. We think as an asset class is still continuing to be accepted by a greater number of market participants so that will help us there. And as we mentioned with our complex order flow and other initiatives we have, we feel very comfortable that we have a good path to success there.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So you guys have said that the conversations with the major dealers regarding IDC or -- IDCG is ongoing and the decision whether or not to \tcontinue funding the venture could be made relatively soon may be in the next month. I just want to get an update on those discussions. And if you could remind us just how much capital is going to be freed up if you do you shut out IDCG?","Robert Greifeld","Good question. And I've said before that we expect to have a resolution of IDCG by the end of February, and I believe I said it back in November. I think that is still a very good date. I don't think it will be February 1, it might be February 31, if such a date exists, but it's good. It's moving along, we feel comfortable with it. We have currently $75 million of capital tied up at IDCG, so we expect with any resolution that, that capital will be available for general use.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And that capital, unlike the Nordic clearing capital, is kind of based in the U.S. and would be potentially available for capital returns through buybacks?","Lee Shavel","That's correct.","Robert Greifeld","That's correct.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then on then on the colo, I was just wondering how your payment contracts work, whether they're like long-term leases for the space or if it's more of a flexible pace, so that, that might be more impacted by changes in outlook for trading activity?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, I would say this, and Eric's here if I can't answer the question properly. It's generally flexible in terms of how people approach it and that's obviously worked out well for us. But I'd also want to make it very clear that the infrastructure that's built up, while our terms are flexible is somewhat inflexible from the customers' point of view. So we find that there's great retention for that, and it really stays there, independent of volume.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So over the last year, we've seen a bit of a divergence between growth in Nordic equities as opposed to Nordic derivatives. And I assume some of that is related to higher market maker activity on the equity side. Where are you guys with respect to getting more market makers and derivatives? And is there a specific volume threshold that we should look for that could potentially be a catalyst for more activity in that market?","Robert Greifeld","Well, one is we've seen the increased activity in derivatives market. As you know, we have converted just recently most of that activity to Genium INET. The next major evolution is to move to the member guarantee fund. And then we'll have, I think, a European class competitor in the marketplace. We are in the process of moving more computer-based trading into our data center. So it's moving along basically the same track as the equity plan just at a little different phasing of the timing.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then on the regulatory front, just whole idea of a transaction's tax in Europe just obviously, does not want to go away here. Bob, I'd love to get your perspective on how you think this develops. Where do you think a tax might be implemented? Is it pretty much a done deal at this point? And then how it might affect your Nordic markets whether positively or negatively?","Robert Greifeld","All right, so this is, I've said before, it is really right out of a bad horror movie in that the monster gets killed. But then next scene, they come back to life somehow. And we're going to live through that with the transaction tax discussion both here in the U.S. and Europe. Europe obviously, has more publicity at this particular point in time. It's important to note that Sweden tried a transaction tax to disastrous effect and that is in the psyche of everybody from a political and a regulatory perspective. And they, in many of the other countries in the Nordics are, in fact, dead set against that transaction tax. So as you know, Sweden and Denmark normally don't trade on the euros. So they said they put a transaction tax in on the Europe countries, we will only be affected in Finland, which is one of our smaller markets. So one, if we're to predict anything right now, we don't see our Nordic countries supporting it. We don't see it applying to them to the extent it applies to the eurozone. And then it would probably represent some of level of opportunity for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess speaking with the regulatory front here domestically, on the high frequency trading or any other issues that you are being discussed out there. I guess how do you kind of envision 2012 unfolding from kind of regulatory topics here in the U.S.?.","Robert Greifeld","I would say this that we think that the opportunity in the regulatory side is not in enactment of the concept release. We believe that will continue together, dust on the shelf. But we are witnessing an increased receptivity by the commission to entertain different type of market structures and certainly  market structures that have some advantage to naturals, whether that would be institutional and\/or retail providers. So it'd be our job to understand that and then respond to that opportunity. So I think that's probably more of a focus than anything else right now.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, Lee, as we think about 2012, I mean based on -- we got your expense guidance and looking everything else, so basically the GAAP and the non-GAAP basically converge as you think about what's on the table for next year?","Lee Shavel","Yes, Dan. I think that it is -- we can't anticipate what may generate a non-GAAP expense going forward to 2012. Obviously, there were some exceptional expenses related to the refinancing and the joint bid for the NYSE that drove the bulk of that difference that we experienced, as well as the write-off that we talked about earlier. So we don't -- there isn't anything on the horizon that we would identify as a substantial non-GAAP element. And certainly, our hope is that there wouldn't be as significant a difference going forward. But that could change depending upon what happens.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Matthew Heinz with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","In some of your previous presentations, you guys talked a bit about the anticipated return on invested capital of some of your new initiatives. And I'd just like to know kind of how you think about that metric internally as a driver of the multiple on your stock? And I think by my calculations, it's -- you're roughly kind of in line to slightly below, may be your blended cost of capital. How do you think about that metric internally? And how do you manage the thing about capital management as it relates to your returns?","Robert Greifeld","The first is I will say is in the future, we're going to try to provide more details on the financial success of these initiatives over time. Certainly, on what is it Page 11, 12? Page 12 today, you can see that we've done well with it, but there's other timebase metrics that we'll provide to you in the future. But certainly, with respect to how we are deploying our capital, this one of the things that drive us here at NASDAQ OMX.","Lee Shavel","And I would add that we look at the amount of capital that we're generating. And as I talked in the past, on a GAAP basis, we've generated between $100 million and $125 million in earnings each quarter. And we think about the returns that we can get from investing that within the business in these types of new initiatives in the core businesses, through acquisitions. And we subject all of those deployment decisions to an evaluation of whether we're going to generate an adequate return on our capital consistent with our cost of equity. And if we don't think we can utilize that capital within the business then we're going to return that capital through share repurchases or eventually through dividends. And that's the discipline that guides all of our capital deployment decisions and one that we certainly believe investors should value us for, and hopefully will become kind of a factor of what they view as the total return potential on the stock.","Robert Greifeld","Right. And we obviously balance that against our need to have a strong balance sheet.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then Lee, on your break-out of your European derivatives revenue, I think you said that energy and carbon was now at $13 million this quarter. That's up pretty substantially, I think, from the $10 million run rate you guys were at just a few quarters ago, and now it looks like it's probably one of the biggest businesses within that Nordic franchise. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving the growth there, and whether it's something that we can expect to continue?","Robert Greifeld","You've got 2 things. This is Bob. One is the Nordic power certainly started to improve its core performance as the year waxed on. It was, overall, not a good year for Nordic Power, but we saw an improvement, especially as we got into December and that's carried into January. And the second, as I referenced in my comments, N2EX, essentially quarter-on-quarter, doubled their terawatt hours that we traded on, on the market. So we have a corresponding increase in revenue. So that's certainly one of our new initiatives, which is moving beyond the funding stage. And it was starting to contribute in a very positive way for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just, Bob, question on the European transaction strategy. Can you just elaborate a little bit about where you sit right now in terms of developing the high-frequency trading market in the Nordic cash business and whether you think that has a lot more runway for growth over 2012 that could help you offset any kind of your macro volume-related headwinds? And then same for the derivatives, in terms of your long-term strategy there. Let's say the next 1 to 2 years, do you intend to be much more aggressively, and through the year broader European derivative marketplace with your initiatives?","Robert Greifeld","Yes Brian. One is we have been pursuing a strategy to make our markets in the Nordic more attractive to Europe and the global -- European and global players. And obviously, part and parcel of that is to make sure that we have the technology and the colocation services that are acceptable in that defined set of circumstances. So the equity market had a very successful year with colocation business and we see that, that's increasing its penetration, quite dramatically. And we would say that the trading volume has not gone up as quickly as the colo business would suggest, but we think that's just a matter of time and circumstances. The derivatives market is the same, same drill, same marching plan, I think the equity market's somewhat ahead of the derivatives market, but you expect that, that won't narrow as we march forward in 2012.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Because there's much more upside on the derivative side over the next say, 12 to 18 months, relatively?","Lee Shavel","Yes. And there's upside in a couple of different ways, not just the introduction of high frequency trading, but as I said as we become a recognized clearinghouse, we think we have the ability to innovate in the product area, and we'll be focused on that.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then just on the -- just one more on the buybacks. So you got $200 million left in the authorization. We should assume that, that essentially gets executed this year. And you can do the bolt-in acquisitions over and above that, is that a correct assessment?","Lee Shavel","Yes, that's correct.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Okay. And then once you're done with the $200 you'll consider the dividends? So that could be at some point later this year?","Lee Shavel","Yes.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. Okay. And then just lastly, housekeeping, the $230 million to $240 million 1Q expense guidance includes the initiatives spend of $10 million, is that correct?","Lee Shavel","That is correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Casteleyn with Susquehanna.","Jonathan E. Casteleyn - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I believe some naked access spam has finally went through the U.S. cash equity markets at the end of last year. Any understanding of its current impact on volumes as we're negative comping here in January to start the quarter?","Lee Shavel","Zero impact on volumes, and it's important to recognize with our FTEN acquisition, we are well positioned to be the supplier of the tools necessary to ensure you're meeting the extra standards.","Jonathan E. Casteleyn - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So you believe no impact on U.S. cash equity volumes that actually grow trajectory on the access part of the business?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, the selling of software solutions to help meet those roles.","Jonathan E. Casteleyn - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Right. And then Lee, you talked about some flexibility in the core expenses, I believe, in incentive compensation. But on the growth initiatives, the $40 million to $50 million, is that tried and true throughout the year? I mean if the environment really worsen from here, will you really spend that $40 million to $50 million?","Lee Shavel","I think there's 2 dimensions that I would just discuss on that. First is and probably most importantly is that the $40 million to $50 million assumes that the projects that are currently in the queue that we're considering, get through that approval process, they need to return hurdles, the growth hurdles that we have. And so it's going to vary as we go through that process. I think that's our best estimate based upon what we see at this point. And then obviously, these initiatives our developing businesses and so the amount of capital they may need may vary from point-to-point. And then thirdly, we are tracking each of these investments very carefully to make certain that they're meeting their milestones. And to the extent that an initiative has clearly fallen off of its milestones, then we'll terminate that investment, thus freeing up capital. And so there are number of variables that are going to influence that number. This is our best guess of what we expect to spend in 2012.","Robert Greifeld","It's important to recognize that the core business will be influenced by the economic forces of the year, but the initiatives will not be influenced so much by that, but really the microenvironment in terms of how they're trying to compete and also by the particulars of that competitive dynamic in that microenvironment.","Jonathan E. Casteleyn - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, great. And then lastly, any Boerse, Dubai update you can give us? They still own 16% of the stock. Any understanding of their intention with their holding? And then do you believe over the long term, is there another chance to buy back stock from them?","Robert Greifeld","Well, one, is you obviously want to talk to them. I don't want to speak for them. I would say that they certainly have evidence in every way, shape or form that they are a very long-term holder of NASDAQ OMX. They represent our Board and are a strong contributor to our board discussions. So I think we're, I think, in a very good place with the relationship, and we don't anticipate any opportunity to buy back any of their shares.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Rutschow with CLSA.","Rob Rutschow - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just a point of clarification on the investment spending. Is all of that revenue generating or is some of that spending for, say, improved security and technology spend there?","Robert Greifeld","No -- yes, we're absolutely clear that these are separate in the Street investment projects. We're not moving investments in infrastructure or security or anything related to the business into this. These all have to have, have an independent business model that demonstrates revenue production in order for us to make the investment.","Rob Rutschow - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And how would we think about the return on investment, if you will, for the new initiatives?","Robert Greifeld","Sure, we -- the return on investment for each of these individual projects is really calibrated based upon -- starting with what we think our cost of equity is. And as we've said in the past, we view this currently the 10% to 11% range. And then what we'd do is we'll apply some risk-adjusted premium that we think is appropriate for the risk of that individual investment so that we're comfortable that the project is expected to generate some significant return in excess of our core cost of equity.","Robert Greifeld","It's important to recognize and I think with the businesses that we're in, we only invest in, what I'll call, scalable businesses that have high leverage returns to us. And as we look at these initiatives as a, I think, the fundamental grounding of it is somewhat binary. In that if they work, we'll do very well. We're not in a low-margin, business-type environment. And obviously, if they don't work, then it's time for us to move upon. But we have as an operating entree to only invest in technology-based businesses that are fundamentally scalable.","Rob Rutschow - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, second sort of related question, a lot of the large investment banks are scaling back in several areas. So I'm wondering if you can talk about how your attempts to cross sell, if you will, are going with that particular client base, and I don't know if you can answer this, but is it possible to give us an idea of how much, say the 5 or 10 biggest investment banks represent to you in terms of revenue or earnings?","Lee Shavel","Yes, the first thing is we have a tremendous opportunity, and our opportunity is to redefine the markets that we're in. And with respect to the transaction business, we have coined a phrase called, beyond the matched. So it's our job to go to these investment banks to all our customers. It's okay. We're providing matching services for you. You'll love the technology, you'll love the speed, everything we do there, and we understand your explicit price per transaction is declined quite dramatically. But in the prestructured fragmented world of REG and MS, your infrastructure costs has exploded. And you see that, that infrastructure cost is no longer in any way, shape or form a relative competitive advantage. It just represents a cause. What can we do essentially to allow you to be in the equity game without such a high step-up costs? So when you see the great growth we've had in our equity businesses in a very tepid transaction environment, we've done that by understanding what our customers are about and then offering products and services that release infrastructure costs. And clearly, we've made certain acquisitions, such as SMARTS and FTEN to do that. But we've also developed our colocation services or access services. So we're on that mission. It's part of obviously, our long-term strategic direction. And it's a little counterintuitive, but to the extent our customers get more focused on their cost of being in the business that represents fundamental opportunities.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So according to our calculations, it looked like in January percentage of U.S. equities volume trading that took place off exchange, was at a new high, or at least, close to previous record high. So if you look at the U.S. equities business, Bob, what sort of conversations are you having with the regulators or what sort of efforts do you think exchanges can do to ensure do to ensure that liquidity does stay on exchange?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, the first thing is when you have low volatility, which we experienced so far, we experienced in January then you tend to see internalization going higher. As I said previously, we do not expect the regulators to move upon the concept at least, and it's not our focus at this particular point in time. But we do see opportunities for us to further segment our market and product offerings, which will represent some -- we think some fundamental opportunity for us. So that's what we're focused on. How do we segment our customers? How do we make sure we're delivering the right price, right service and right kind of market structure for each of these customers at the appropriate point in time.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And then my follow-up question in the U.S. options business, still access market share has trailed down a little bit the last couple of months and you've kind of addressed this earlier. But what sort of things specifically can you guys do to shore up your U.S. options market share?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, there's probably 3 or 4 things we're focused on. Some of them I referred to in the past, but clearly when we're talking about complex orders, we're working to improve both our functionality and our distribution on that, and we think we're making some headway in that regard. And then the options pricing is orders of magnitude, more complicated and more segmented than the equity world. And it's really a question of which part, which dollar you spend to attract certain business from certain customers. And we continue to refine that, that witch's brew.","Operator","At this time, I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I'd now like to turn it over to our speakers for any closing remarks.","Robert Greifeld","So we're certainly very proud of our success in 2011, and when you look at our last 4 years, as I said in my opening comments, with declining macro economic forces, we've been able to continue to execute quite successfully. We start with an engaged -- in 2012, with an engaged management team has a clear sense of direction and we will continue to execute as we've done over the past number of years. So I appreciate your time and your support. Looking forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

I want to start by saying we are very pleased to announce record fourth quarter 2013 results. It truly caps another exceptional year for our franchise. While the quarter featured record revenues, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS perhaps what is most noteworthy for us is that we achieved this while also making significant strategic investments in our future.","The progress and strong performance across our core businesses provides us the flexibility that allows us to make critical investments in our future such as NLX, our interest rate derivatives exchange in London, NASDAQ private markets are offering to help private companies manage their interactions with investors and our lead to cash initiative which we expect to make our back office interactions with our Corporate Solution customers more efficient while also delivering outstanding results.","When we look at the underlying reasons for our performance in 2013, and in particular the fourth quarter, it is impressive to recognize the progress across all our business segments, clearly highlighting the soundness of our strategy and approach. Let me highlight some of the major factors contributing to the $1.9 billion record revenue we achieved during the year. We saw a strong performance in Technology Solutions, in particular the doubling of our revenue Corporate Solutions to $230 million.","We also grew our Market Technology business, which achieved record revenue of $219 million, up 12% year-on-year. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we saw organic growth across all our non-transaction business segments, including Information Services Technology Solutions and Listing Services, leading to a 5% overall organic revenue growth in the period.","One of the standout performers in particular was our Index Licensing and Services group. In 2013, revenue grew to a record $74 million, up 17% year-on-year. We made significant progress diversifying and expanding our product offerings by launching 22,000 new indices. We are now one of the only providers that have licensed products covering every major asset class. Clearly, our diverse high-quality revenue mix with 73% coming from recurring and subscription sources and over 60% of our trading revenues coming from the derivatives and fixed income categories has been a core driver in the returns we deliver to our shareholders.","Looking at the bottom line, on a non-GAAP basis fourth quarter 2013 EPS of $0.69 was up 8% versus the prior year quarter of $0.64, but the non-GAAP operating income, up 11% year-over-year. More important than the numbers for this quarter and the year 2013 is the fact that our customers, partners and stakeholders fundamentally recognized the substantial and unique value that NASDAQ OMX provides.","As I mentioned on this call before, our objective is to become a well-established provider of a diversified portfolio of services to the financial and corporate community. Given the strength of our competitive position, with 96% of our revenue is generated from businesses where were either number one or number two, we are executing on that strategy quite well.","Now, I want to turn to some of broad business highlights that define our quarter and the results we delivered, but more importantly how we expanded our capabilities and delivered more value to our customers and also to our shareholders. When we think about the journey this organization has been on since beginning. Over 40 years ago, our technology and expertise in technology have been the drivers behind the value we deliver in the marketplace. As proof of that, as previously mentioned, our Technology Solutions segment had a truly outstanding quarter, with record revenues driven by all-time highs in both, the Market Tech and Corporate Solutions businesses.","Our Market Technology business was clearly the beneficiary of increased demand for proven trading, clearing and risk and compliance solutions. In just the fourth quarter, we saw a 22% growth driven by demand for our advisory services, SMARTS Broker and BWise.","Order intake grew to a record $138 million for the quarter. The new partnerships we forge with exchanges during the quarter and during the year, includes, Tadawul, the Saudi Stock Exchange, the largest exchange in the Arab world, Borse [Dubai], most recently [Borse]. There is no doubt; we have solidified our competitive position. The record backlog of $655 million shows this progress very clearly, truly a remarkable performance and one which underscores the great confidence our customers and partners have in our technology and expertise.","In our Corporate Solutions businesses, we set a new quarterly revenue high, an increase from the prior quarter, which is our first full quarter since we integrated the Thomson Reuters, IR, PR and Multimedia businesses. Additionally, we are seeing very strong year-on-year growth in products like Directors Desk or corporate Board Portal, BWise are highly regarded GRC solutions.","In our view, we've only begun to scratch the surface on the exceptional cross-selling opportunities presented by this business, and we expect these opportunities, coupled with the product enhancements we have in the pipeline to increase the value we deliver to our customers, further driving the performance of this business.","As you know, at NASDAQ OMEX, we're all about seeking ways we can deliver technology, partnerships and our expertise to do more for capital markets and help our customers succeed. One of the areas that have [panelized] that approach during the quarter and in 2013, as previously mentioned was the Index Licensing and Services. We ended the fourth quarter with $92 billion in assets under management. That's truly remarkable, up 44% year-on-year and driving a 25% revenue growth.","More firms are recognizing the compelling value of our multi-asset offering. Our goal is to enhance our position as a premier index provider and we intend to continue expanding partnerships with exchange traded products launches worldwide to license more of our indices and drive assets under management or AUM, well above the highs we have set recently.","We also expect to continue expanding the product menu and capabilities above Global Index Calculator, moving to 28,000 indices at the end of the fourth quarter 2013, and early in the first quarter '14, we added 13,000 new which brings our total to 41,000 indices, more to come.","All of our European markets experienced a strong fourth quarter. It is important to note that equity trading stood out among all those strong performances at 22% year-on-year growth, a combination of significantly improved industry volumes, steady market share and improved revenue capture.","We are continuing to enhance our offerings in the Nordic derivatives clearing, and in particular this quarter, we have expanded on our interest rate swap clearing to help customers navigate the new regulatory environment and further decrease risk. Our first buy-side clear transactions were in fact announced this quarter.","Clearly, one of the more visible ways our value proposition comes to life is through our Listings business. In 2013, the IPO market rebounded to levels not seen since 2007 and we saw our 126th IPOs come to NASDAQ. Our win rate was 52% in the U.S., and in totaled NASDAQ had 239 new listings, up over 50% from the prior year. Truly a strong performance.","We also continued to enjoy a dominant share of biotech with a 98% win rate. Interestingly, NASDAQ also hosted 57% of the best-performing IPOs in 2013. The value we offer resonated with a number of high profile brands, including IPOs of Sprouts Farmers Market, Norwegian Cruise Line and zulily to name a few.","Notable switches just from the fourth quarter include Marriott and VimpelCom. Additionally, American Airlines chose to list on NASDAQ after the merger of the previous [NYSE] listed American Airlines and U.S. Airways. Continuing this momentum, 2014 is off to a very strong start, with 24 new U.S. listings in January, actually double the number we had in January 2013, including 10 IPOs versus 6 in the prior year period.","As pleased as we are with the performance and the progress of our core businesses, we are never satisfied and are always looking at ways to increase the value we offer to the investment community, our customers and partners and drive further growth.","I want to take a minute to cover some exciting areas we are working on right now. First, on our two material acquisitions which have already become accretive in the first quarters of ownership even though the vast majority of the synergy and value creation opportunity is still ahead of us.","Since completing our acquisition of eSpeed, we have been pleased with our progress as we made steady improvements with the platform and our drive to deliver industry-best responsiveness. We have implemented a number of system upgrades which have reduced our average latency by about 35% and reduced our tail events by over 80%.","As we plan the migration of the eSpeed matching engine and customers into a world-class Carteret data center near the end of the first quarter 2014, we will complete a fairly significant technology overhaul that puts eSpeed on great footing to be more competitive and do more in the coming periods.","Moving past the technology overhaul and onto our planned product menu expansion, we recently launched our first new products since acquiring eSpeed. U.S. Treasury floating rate notes and we have several other products in the on-deck circle for the first quarter and the first half of 2014. These products include coupon rolls when issues and then tips and bills.","In Corporate Solutions, we continued to progress on bringing our legacy Corporate Solutions businesses in line with the acquired Thomson Reuters' variety of businesses to create a stronger industry leader. To-date, we have meaningfully reduced our reliance on the transition services agreement with Thomson Reuters. We are consolidating the real estate footprint and we are making steady progress on the lead to cash billing solution.","Our sales and development teams have been integrated, increasing our ability to cross-sell effectively even as we invest heavily in our next-generation products suite. As I have said in the past, we are focused, first, on the effectiveness with the acquisition, something I am increasingly confident that we are achieving, and beginning later in 2014, we expect investors to see more and more of the efficiency opportunities are leading scale can deliver as part of our move to Technology Solutions segment, the segment margins to be higher.","Now moving to our organic efforts, one of the growth initiatives which shows increasing progress is NLX, our European interest rate derivatives market in London.","In fourth quarter 2013, NLX set new market highs both, overall with a 2.4% share as well as in certain products that are seeing dramatically higher uptake, like your LIBOR futures we saw our March share greater than 5% and had several days above 20%. Our market share has been building steadily since we launched in May of 2013, but more importantly we continue to add new users which increased by 11 in the second half of 2013 to 27 and we expect that number to grow in 2014.","We are also very encouraged by the development in European regulation, in particular Method 2, which is designed to create more competition in listed derivatives' trading, something which will be as pervasive a change as Reg NMS was in the U.S. equity markets.","We have always believed the competition is the life for a lot of capital markets and the monopolies are natural creations in the capitalist society, and that over time competition will always seek the surface. I believe that this latest regulatory development certainly validate. With NLX as well as our Nordic derivatives platforms and clearinghouses, we believe we are very well positioned for increasingly competitive European directives landscape in the years to come.","Moving onto the Listings business, we are extremely excited about NASDAQ private market or NPM, which is designed to help companies that aren't public, but have many needs, so much of public issuers. Recent regulatory changes in particular the JOBS Act allow companies to have more investors while still remaining private and create new opportunities for us to help them take advantage of this new flexibility.","While our offering will be multifaceted, it includes a new kind of marketplace that not only brings liquidity for their shareholders, but allows them to manage important aspects of how their investors interact. NPM recently received broker-dealer approval from FINRA and has filed with the SEC for registration to begin operation as an [AGS], which will allow us to launch NPM before the end of the first quarter 2014.","We have been encourage and excited by the response from the market and we look forward to providing a venue for a greater number of companies to have a more efficient access to capital and for investors to have a path for access to entrepreneurial companies.","For 2014, we are optimistic that our business model is well positioned for any potential improvements to the global business environment while the diversity of our offerings provides opportunity to more broadly service our customers across the investment community. For our part, we will continue to focus on strong execution and efficiency while serving the needs of our customers.","In closing, I would like to say this quarter in many ways highlights a year that I would describe as transformational for this organization on a number of levels. We are well-positioned in our core business. Our core businesses have diversified and now provide an optimal mix between recurring and transactional revenue and our strong performance had allowed us to significantly invest in our future while delivering record earnings. We at NASDAQ OMX are very proud of these accomplishments.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Shavel","Thanks Bob. The following comments will focus on our non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to GAAP and to non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaqomex.com.","I'll start by reviewing our fourth quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter. Net revenues increased $98 million to a record $520 million. Contributing to this increase, was an $80 million or 27% increase in subscription and recurring revenue, primarily from acquisitions but also from material organic growth.","Subscription and recurring revenue represent 73% of total revenues, up from 71%. Transaction-driven revenues rose $18 million, mostly due to the inclusion of transaction revenue related to the eSpeed acquisition, but also due to the higher European cash equities revenues, which rose $4 million, partially offset by lower net U.S. derivatives revenues. On an organic basis, assuming constant currency and excluding acquisitions, total company net revenues rose 5%.","I am now going to go over some of the highlights with each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior year unless otherwise noted. Information Services, which includes our Market Data and Index businesses increased revenues 10% and operating profit by 6%. Operating margin was down marginally, but remained at very high level at 69%. Market Data had a 7% increase in revenues on growth in new product sales, in particular NASDAQ Basic, select pricing actions such as an increased from Level 2 quotes and mutual fund services and the inclusion of eSpeed market data, partially offset by lower audit collections which were 2 million lower than the prior year period.","Index Licensing and Services grew revenues 25%, including the impact of the merchant indexes acquisition with a number of licensed ETP, up 31% to 148, and assets under management, up 44% to 92 billion.","In Technology Solutions, which includes Corporate Solutions and Market Technology, they increased revenues by $70 million or 89%, mostly due to the impact of the Thomson Reuters and BWise acquisitions, but also due to organic growth at both, the legacy corporate solutions businesses and the end market technology. Operating profit tripled to $21 million, due primarily to the inclusion of Thomson Reuters and secondarily to the organic growth and recognition of certain previously deferred revenues.","Corporate Solutions revenue of course shows a large step up in scale due to the mid-year Thomson Reuters' acquisition more than tripling compared to the prior year period, but it is important to note that we are still seeing solid organic growth here as well, in particular Directors Desk, where we saw clients increased by 27% versus the prior year.","Market Technology revenues grew 22% and set a new quarterly revenue record of $66 million, and perhaps more importantly as we think about future periods, it's set record highs for quarterly and annual order intake at $138 million and $322 million, respectively, establishing a new record backlog at $655 million.","Growth was broad-based and included contributions from both, BWise and SMARTS Broker. Please note that in the fourth quarter we recognized $3 million of revenues that were previously deferred at BWise. A note here on our Technology Solutions operating margins. We saw significant increase in the fourth quarter to 14% from 9% in the prior year period and 7% in the third quarter of 2013.","While we are excited about the great result, we note that the fourth quarter was subject to the seasonal fourth quarter peak in change request revenues and that the $3 million of revenue recognized from previously deferred BWise revenues also added a couple of percentage points.","As we think about the next few quarters, please bear in mind that we will still be in the relatively early stages of the Thomson Reuters integration with elevated investment and modest cost synergies expected to be realized and the most significant progress for the 20% Technology Solutions segment target will happen in 2015, when we expect to realize the majority of the $35 million in targeted cost synergies. Consequently, we don't expect the fourth quarter '13 margin level to continue in the first quarter, but we do expect to show steady year-over-year improvement in 2014.","Moving to Market Services, which includes are derivative, equities and fixed income businesses as well, as our associated Access and Broker Services, we saw a 9% increase in revenues, due primarily to the inclusion of transaction and hosting revenues of the acquired eSpeed business and growth in European equities trading, partially offset by modest decline in net U.S. derivatives.","Operating profit increased 7% and operating margin of 43% was down modestly from 44% in the prior year period. In net derivatives and trading and clearing, European revenues were unchanged, but net U.S. derivatives saw a moderate decline due to modest declines in average capture market share. Though I would note, we were proud to finish our fourth straight year as the sheer leader in U.S. equity options trading.","At equity trading, revenues rose 9% as European equity revenue grew 22%, [mainly] of higher industry volume coupled with flat net U.S. equities revenue and basically unchanged industry volumes, share and average capture.","I would note that while European equities obviously has had strong increases over the last few years, we are seeing encouraging signs in U.S. equities, where we had three consecutive quarters of rising average capture and modest improvement in market share and that positive share momentum has continued into the first quarter 2014.","Net fixed income trading revenues fell $1 million from the third quarter due to lower industry volumes, which impacted us a little more as we worked to shift our pricing mix to include a higher variable component, something we expect to pay significant dividends when volumes begin to increase.","In Access and Broker Services, revenues fell $1 million or 2% to $64 million, due largely to muted demand for ports and co-location, partially offset by the addition of eSpeed hosting revenues and growth in newer products like microwave.","Listing Services, which include U.S. and European listings saw a $1 million or 1% increase in revenues, principally on higher European listing fees, which reflect higher market capitalization there. In the U.S. listing fees results reflect as higher listing fee revenue was offset by lower revenues associated with events at the market site facility which is undergoing a renovation.","Operating profit decreased $3 million or 12% to $23 million in operating margin of 40%, was down six percentage points versus the prior year period, principally on marketing commitments and expenses related to the NASDAQ private market initiative.","U.S. new listings in the quarter doubled 80 from 40 in the prior year and our IPO win rate was around 44%, down from 48% in the prior year period and below our 52% full year results, due mainly to an unusually high number of spinoff of NYSE-listed companies and REITs during the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding these two categories, our win rate would have been 54%. In addition to having a productive quarter in terms of new issue activity, we gained 18 switches from NYSE, including as Bob noted earlier Marriott International and American Airlines only software departures.","Non-GAAP operating expenses increased by $77 million from the prior year with the vast majority of the increase coming from the two acquisitions. Organic expenses excluding acquisitions and assuming constant currency rose 6% this quarter, including GIFT spending above our normal organic expense growth rates, due to higher incentive compensation costs as well as the initial temporary investments spend we are making into our acquisitions. Full year organic expense growth was 3%, about 1% of which is the impact of the higher GIFT budget.","Moving onto our 2014 expense guidance on Slide 20 of the presentation, we are initiating 2014 expense guidance at $1,250 billion $1,285 billion, including $35 million to $50 in GIFT expenses. The higher end of our core expense range of $1,215 billion to $1,235 billion on the core expenses will be most likely 2014 future significant improvements in the underlying industry conditions and activity levels.","Understanding that are significant mid-2013 acquisitions make comparisons to our new guidance challenging, I would note that taking our fourth quarter 2013 non-GAAP operating expenses of $313 million and annualizing them gets you to $1,252 billion and our 2014 guidance of $1,215 billion to 1,285 and about 1% to 3% growth.","Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2013 was $207 million, up $21 million or 11% from $186 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 40%, down from 44% in the prior year period, primarily the result of a larger contribution of the lower margin Technology Solutions business due to the Thomson Reuters acquisition. As we achieved cost synergies related to this transaction, we expect to see Technology Solutions and overall margins increase.","Net interest expense was $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, an increase of $6 million versus the prior year, due to increased borrowings associated with our acquisitions. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 34% at the low end of our 34% to 36% guidance range. Going forward, we expect that our tax rate for 2014 to be in the range of 33% to 35% a ranges that is 1% lower than our prior guidance.","Non-GAAP net income was $119 million, $0.69 per diluted share compared to $108 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012. The $0.05 increase in our EPS reflects a $0.04 improvement in our core operating profitability, a $0.04 benefit from the acquisitions net of financing costs, $0.01 benefit from a lower effective tax rate partially offset by $0.02 of increased spending on our GIFT initiatives and $0.02 higher fully diluted share count.","Fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 excludes the impact of several items, including a $30 million realized gain on the sale of an investment security, $18 million in reserve releases related to the execution of the voluntary accommodation program and $11 million in gains related to merger activity and strategic initiatives as the primary components. GAAP EPS was $0.81 in the fourth quarter.","Moving onto the balance sheet, on Slide 22, we are showing our debt structure and debt maturities. Our higher debt and leverage versus the prior year reflects the completion of our acquisitions of Thomson Reuters at the end of May, and eSpeed at the end of June, financed largely with debt while both our debt and leverage declined versus the second and third quarters of 2013, reflecting debt pay down in the quarters since those acquisitions were funded as well as improved EBITDA.","In the fourth quarter, the company paid down $98 million in debt, including $87 million in repayment on the revolver and $11 million on our term loan, but changes in foreign exchange led to a $14 million increase in the U.S. dollar amount of foreign denominated debt on the balance sheet, netting to an $84 million decline in total debt compared to the third quarter of 2013.","Our gross debt to EBITDA leverage fell to 2.8 times from 2.9 times last quarter and a peak of three times at the closing of our acquisitions in the second quarter of 2013. The deleveraging process is consistent with our original expectations and we continue to expect leverage to return to the new 2s range by the end of the second quarter in 2014.","Cash and cash equivalents and certain liquid investments, net of our regulatory and restricted cash were $255 million at the end of the fourth quarter.","Thank you for your attention. With that, I will now turn it back over to Ed.","Ed Ditmire","Operator, please open up the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now opened.","Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","Good morning, Bob. Good morning, Lee. Congrats on a strong quarter here.","Bob Greifeld","Thank you.","Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","My questions is information services and more specifically Market Data, because you are looking good year-over-year, but there were some sequential quarterly declines and I am trying to see does it have anything to do with the restructuring of eSpeed market that or our agreements. Just explain the quarter-over-quarter changes in our market data and information services.","Bob Greifeld","Sure. Rich, the reason that you are seeing a decline from the from the third quarter really is principally due audit revenues, so as you know we are engaged in the process of evaluating the utilization by our clients of the market data services we will undertake audits of those clients and occasionally recognize that the clients are under reporting or under calculating the amount of revenue.","In the third quarter, we had a particularly strong level of audit revenue. As a consequence, the fourth a particularly strong on level of a quiet revenue and as a consequence, the fourth quarter comparison was lower because we simply had lower right lower audit revenues on than in the third quarter. I wouldn't say that it represented that any fundamental change in the business and it was not infected by its eSpeed, so third quarter was high, fourth quarter low, first quarter be more in line.","Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","Sort of like if you look at the of the two rather than\u2026","Bob Greifeld","\u2026way to do it.","Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","Okay. Then my follow-up is eSpeed, you have a plan, Bob, and there has been stuff flow there about market share changes. I just want to see whether you could sort of point us in the right direction of, you know, how you feel about the market share in eSpeed and that the offering going forward doesn't conflict with your clients' interest.","Bob Greifeld","I would say quite the opposite, so one of the things I am happy about the progress we made with the relationship with our customers and I think we had to do some level of repair work there, but what's interesting to me is, we are to come to new contractual relationships with them in a lot of shorter period of time than one had thought.","I think, with a core bank customer base, we are in a better position now than we were six months ago. We also have made progress with introducing new customers into the marketplace and probably just as important is where the final stages of having trading technologies being certified on a platform and that's been really holding back some of the progress.","I think, one, the market share is work-in-progress. It's essentially what it was when we did the acquisition. We clearly want to improve it and we have made major technology changes and that information is filtering into communities, filtering into the technology folks who support these platforms and we are building the data to show in times of stress our platform is certainly remarkably strong and dramatically better than what it was six months ago, so work-in-progress. We are happy that were taking all the right actions and we expect that in the not too distant future that will show up in our results.","Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","Understood. Thanks and congrats on a strong quarter.","Bob Greifeld","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kenneth Hill of Barclays. Your line is now opened.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays","Good morning, Bob and Lee.","Bob Greifeld","How are doing.","Lee Shavel","Morning.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays","Doing good. I wanted to start on NASDAQ private market. I think that's an interesting - am not sure you guys have and you are working to get the approvals in place shortly. Just kind of wondering and I am sure ahead of those approvals, you have been talking to a lot of customers. How are you thinking about the revenue outlook for those businesses, what kind of services customers are looking at?","Bob Greifeld","Yes. I would look at the three revenue drivers for this marketplace. One is, a subset of our corporate solutions products is certainly applicable to this marketplace. Just because you are private, doesn't mean you don't want to send press releases out in the order you want. You still need some marketing surveillance. Clearly, your directors want to have automated board tools, numbers of different products we will be selling to them, so we are finalizing that offering now.","The second is, and in many ways is important in the beginning is, to have control of your shareholder register, so we want to provide product and services to allow them to do that, you know, who owns the shares and who can sell under what conditions. The third is, you have to provide liquidity programs to these issuers. It's not going to look like NASDAQ public market. It will be some type of auction that will be based on the issuers' desire to have it once-a-year, once-a-quarter, once-a-month. We certainly believe that over time our liquidity is seductive to people and they have more rather than less of these liquidity auctions, but I think it could be quite small in the beginning, so three drivers there.","What's important to recognize is, when we look at embed that capital markets to public market which is fundamentally different than the private market is, we probably have more revenue opportunity NPM than we do in public market context and the public market companies do not trade that often. So in a real sense, liquidity programs could be that much more attractive to us and to them.","We are obviously trying to get a sense of the scope of the market, but there hundreds of companies that are a natural first target for us. I would say that we are going to make sure that we keep the quality of the companies very high to come to market here and we are definitely going to look to do a controlled launch in March and I think quite respective in number of companies that use a platform in the beginning, but the demand is certainly there and the excitement is building.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays","Okay. My follow-up I guess is on the other side of that equation, on the expense side. I was just wondering I think you mentioned that Lee, in the comments, there's a somewhat of a drag on margin for the quarter. Just wondering how much might be on the new initiative spend, is that 35 to 50 and maybe what it could grow to over time?","Lee Shavel","Well, in terms of the interest the overall expense growth, as I mentioned, we had a 6% organic growth in operating expenses and that reflected a higher level of investment in the two acquisitions as we described initially, particular with Thomson Reuters there is an initial investment base, and as Bob mentioned, a number of the technology investments that we are making in eSpeed are contributing to that, but we view those as temporary influences on that.","Once those investments are made, I think, we expect the margins to improve in those businesses. As it relates to GIFT spending, the guidance that we provided reflects our expectations for the portfolio of projects that we have principally in there it is our NLX initiative, but we have other portfolio investment opportunities that we see there and I think that the overall level that you see for the 2014 guidance is down slightly from where we were in 2013.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays","Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","","Good morning. I guess if you could talk to us about the second quarter when you get your deleveraging targets and think about capital priorities and looking at buybacks, dividends and potential acquisitions and kind of update us on those thoughts and what potential areas of new businesses you might be looking at if any.","Bob Greifeld","I would say one is, we want to get the second quarter, and the way to do that successfully is to focus on one of the first and the second quarter execution, so with respect to capital return, I would say that the board will contemplate that probably sometime after the second quarter, assuming we achieve what we think will, we all are confident we will in the first two quarters - not the time and the place, but it will come.","The second part of your question was about acquisitions?","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","","Correct.","Bob Greifeld","Well, I mean, what we have said before is, we have, I think, a very capable corporate development department and we literally look at probably a hundred different opportunities in any given year. We obviously don't participate in the vast majority of them and I would say that it's just the normal course of business, but there is certainly no higher or lower activity than we normally see in that as -in terms of thinking about things.","As I said before, it's our job to know every asset in every corner of the world across all different asset classes. To the extent you have really a template of where the world is and where the world might go then you have a pretty clear view of how that will play and help or hurt strategically where you want to go.","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","","Great. Thank you. Then I guess, Lee, just on the GIFT spend, you know, NLX last year was a big component. Is that a smaller component in 2014, and one of the other programs and development you listed is now increasing as a percentage?","Lee Shavel","I would say that with both, regard to NLX, it continues to be the most significant element of the overall GIFT spending budget, and depending upon how NLX continues to progress, it could be an increasing amount or a decreasing amount, but it's really too early to say. As Bob indicated, we are extremely pleased with the progress that we have seen on the market share front and we have to allow that the continued time as we indicated through 2014 for us to come to our conclusion, but certainly our expectation is that we will continue to generate momentum at clients. As a consequence, be a less significant expenditure within the GIFT budget.","I certainly NLX had a very exciting fourth quarter. As we said, we had 20% market share in certain days and certain hours of your LIBOR. That was not unnoticed by the community. More importantly as a result of that, we do see a strong series of inbound calls and a strong number of new participants and some very large participants in the marketplace now working very hard to hook up to NLX, and obviously that will be the determinant of our long-term success, so very successful fourth quarter and very strong progress so far in the first quarter 2014.","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","","Thanks for taking my questions.","Lee Shavel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jillian Miller of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now opened.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks, guys. I am just following upon that last kind of question. Given the strength that you have seen in NLX and all the success you have had in the fourth quarter, I am just wondering when do you plan to roll back some of those incentives for people that trade to see what's fixed versus what might be just kind of temporarily to be around for this rebate?","Bob Greifeld","Good question. I think it ties back what I just said. Right now, we do have a queue of people wanting to hook up and I think hopefully there is more coming and that's a process. To the extent we are through that queue, and we know that we have a really steady-state number of participants that would be the time that we would start thinking about it.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Got it. Then there was a news article few weeks back that had some commentaries some guy suggesting you might potentially be interested in acquiring an index properties going forward and I know (Inaudible) during that platform, but buying some more IP to run on it, so I just want to get your thoughts on that specifically, what would be attractive to you guys those businesses, how do you think about valuation just because maybe they tend to be relatively high multiple businesses.","Bob Greifeld","A good question. One is, we have said publicly before that we love our positioning in the index business. We undertook through a GIFT initiative development of our index platform to basically be on par from a breadth with any of the platform out there and we think from a technology point of view, we are representing a step function.","If you equate the Index business to the Transaction business, you see that now that we have the planned incremental business, incremental revenue tends to drop to the bottom line, so the plant is built no different than when we looked at the Transactions business back 10 years ago, so we want to put good volume to it.","We have made one small very successful acquisitions in the Index business called Mergent, and that was a dividend achievers. We have done incredibly well with that. To the extent that other Mergent-type opportunities become available, we clearly would be interested in that, but I would also say that our primary focus is about organic development. We've increased the sales outreach, we are making, I think, very strong incremental progress in that effort and we have more prospects lined up than we ever had before, so we are going to look at both weapons. We have the plant, we have the capability, we have the scalable platform and we are going to look at both, organic and inorganic growth in this space.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz of Citi. Your line is now opened.","Bill Katz - Citi","","Thank you very much for taking my questions. First question is just coming back to the expense guidance try maybe frame the operating leverage underneath that. What kind of revenue backdrop are you considering? Then to the extent that we either had a fair than expected or worse than expected operating leverage. CapEx is at range of expenses.","Lee Shavel","Well, I would say, Bill, and that revenue outlook that we are looking for the expense range is, as I indicated in the comments, if it revenues remain - the environment remains as it was in the second half of 2013, then I think our expectation is that we would be towards the lower end of the expense guidance range that's set out, the 1,250 billion.","To the extent that we see an improvement across our businesses and activity in terms of trading activity or pickups in our technology businesses, then we expect we would be towards the higher end of that range. Is that the guidance that you are looking for?","Bill Katz - Citi","","Yes. Thank you. I apologize if I missed your prepared remarks. Second question I have is just, you mentioned that your synergies and transaction times when we are back into 2015, which seems reasonable [versus]previous, can you give us an update on where you stand maybe even qualitatively? What you are hearing from clients as it relates to the possible for cross-sell, or revenue synergies as you are now another quarter into the transaction?","Bob Greifeld","Yes. I would say this. One is, we like to break things down into manageable pieces, so cross-sell is a big overarching theme that we will execute upon obviously in the quarters and the years to come. In 2013, now going to 2014, we more narrowly defined it, so when you look at a product that old NASDAQ had that old Thompson did not have, which has high growth and high margins that was Directors Desk, so clearly that was the number one thing that we want to do in cross-sell, so we want to give that to the sales force to do and in a very manageable way.","Then when you look at what old Thompson had, and clearly NASDAQ, always wish they had that was first call and content products such as StreetEvents, so that was our focus, so that will be the mission for the next number of months and then we will expand upon that as we go along, so great opportunities with those two. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, Directors Desk had an outstanding year and quarter, and clearly a lot of that was related to cross-selling that we were able to do.","Bill Katz - Citi","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Your line is now opened.","Ken Worthington - JPMorgan","Thank you very much. First I wanted to ask on the SIP, what are your intentions with the SIP? I think you gave notice to give up responsibility, so maybe what are the advantages of controlling the SIP and if you continue to manage it, what kind of investments may be needed to improve the technology there?","Bob Greifeld","Yes. All right, so a couple comments with the SIP. One is, we have made a recommendation to strip to many 10 things that needed to be done and we spoke to the committee about that verbally, obviously post 822 and then put it formally in front of them in November.","We have not seen progress on those 10 items. We have progress on two items. It's basically wholly unacceptable to us. If this is under our control, and we lived through, what happened then 822 and 823, we would be working hard around the clock to remediate the system which had been obviously sitting there, somewhat neglected over the last decade. So, it obviously is a source of frustration to us and we have to communicate that.","We sent determination and that it's not tolerable for us to work in this environment with a known system with no deficiencies and the committee is not stepping up to their responsibilities to authorize us to fix that, so it's the is a frustration right now and like you said, we have no intention to want to continue on this environment and we are going to communicate that pretty loudly and clearly.","Ken Worthington - JPMorgan","I am sorry. What are the advantages of actually controlling the SIP? How is this a strategic\u2026","Bob Greifeld","It's not. It sits at infinite risk. At this point, no reward.","Ken Worthington - JPMorgan","Okay. Great. Then maybe for the follow-up, can you give us an update on the pursuit to replace Eric Noll.","Bob Greifeld","Yes. As I commented before, we are going to look to do that in and around the end of the first quarter, so that's in process.","Ken Worthington - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Bob Greifeld","Meantime, I am having some fun running the U.S. transaction business, which had a strong fourth quarter in [Italy].","Ken Worthington - JPMorgan","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now opened.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks, guys. First question relates to Method. It sounds like your commentary, you are positive or constructive about what that might do, but correct me if I am wrong, but it seems like it would open up your Nordics business to a little bit more competition, so wondering net that whether you guys view this as a really good opportunity for NASDAQ or potential threat at the same time.","Bob Greifeld","I think it's an unbelievable opportunity for NASDAQ. As I said in my prepared comments, it definitely sounds to me, it feels to me like the days before Reg NMS was implemented and you had a number of deniers out there in terms of what that would mean to the marketplace, so I don't know the precise numbers.","The way I look at this right now with respect to European clearing, we might have the 5% market share, so I have 5% market share to think about for that 95% market share to go compete for us, so I like that ratio, so it is a fundamental and basic opportunity for us. There will be heightened competition in the trading of these instruments and it's something we do well.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. That makes sense. Then the follow-up question, the numbers question maybe for Lee. You guys did have a nice pick up in the Tech Solutions revenues and you did walk through a few of those line items. Just wondering though, you how, much of the revenue bump was driven by seasonality? It seems like a few of the line items might be part of the more recurring bucket you have, so just trying to as we think about this revenue line item going forward, in which we expect over the next couple of quarters.","Lee Shavel","I can't predict what our expectations are for the quarter ahead. I think the things that I would point out is that we tend to see and I think you can look at this on a quarterly basis, we tend to see strong growth in the change and request revenue, or a sub-revenue line item in the fourth quarter and so if you are trying to get a sense as to what the seasonality impact, I think you can look at that number to get a feel for it.","Then there are also some impacts in the corporate solutions business, but it's very difficult I think to identify specific products or give you a sense of the percentage. The other element that I think you should just be aware of is, as I noted there were approximately $3 million of revenues associated with BWise that was a acceleration of revenue recognition due to an accounting change that we made that influenced the fourth quarter numbers. Those revenues in subsequent quarters will also be increased, but we probably had an un-repeating, non-recurring element about $3 million in the fourth quarter, so I think those are the elements that would address your question.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo Securities","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Well, our next question comes from Rob Rutschow of CLSA. Your line is now opened.","Bob Greifeld","How are you doing, Rob?","Rob Rutschow - CLSA","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on eSpeed client base and how many of those clients you have been able to renegotiate into longer contracts?","One is, we have a one-year contract and we continued with that and we finished that renegotiation I think somewhat early in the fourth quarter and it's sometime in the fourth quarter, so as I said before that happened sooner or quicker than I would guess and I think there was generally positive experience for both sides.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA","Okay. Then just a numbers question, follow-up - I appreciate the disclosure on foreign currency. I was just curious as to why there was sort of a big swing in the Swedish Kroner expenses from quarter-to-quarter.","Bob Greifeld","Rob, I don't think we have an answer at our fingertips for that question, but we will follow up with you afterwards and take a look at that.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier. Your line is now opened.","Bob Greifeld","How are you doing, Mike? I guess, he is not doing that well.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now opened.","Bob Greifeld","How are you doing, Mike?","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Good. Just a question first on the technology business, I think you even excluding that adjustment of $3 million, still strong quarterly. If we look the pipeline, the backlog, everything you looks positive going forward. I guess just the two questions there, even axe that $3 million, is there still some seasonality in terms of revenue recognition in the fourth quarter?","Then we think about going forward and you think about the opportunity that you guys see whether it's with exchanges, the buy-side clients, sell-side client, just where are you in terms of going after that opportunity, meaning, how much market share, what else exist, because there's only so many exchanges out there that you can have relationships with.","Lee Shavel","I'll let Bob handle the outlook, but just to confirm. You mean to suggest that $3 million was the only impact in the quarter as I discussed the change in request revenue line separate from the other revenues has a seasonal impact in the fourth quarter as people are generally rushing to get the final changes in before yet year end, so that's influencing it, but you are right. I mean, what's primarily driving the quarter is just the very order intake that we saw from Market Technology.","Bob Greifeld","Let me get you your other question, so one there does seem to be more and more exchanges available for us to sell to, so I kind of have shared your thought three years ago, but I would say the number of new name exchanges that we are talking to now is greater than it's been in the past. In addition to that in terms of driving our growth, we have gone in a very significant way in declaring systems, post-trade and so you see what is turbulence of our the new deals and it's not just the trading systems, they are looking to us for clearing systems, post-trade processing. In addition to that with our SMARTS acquisition, we have certainly made a major splash in risk management and SMARTS tie together with BWise truly will give us a leading position there.","We have an increasing number of customers we are talking to and we are talking to customers at multiple levels right now, really pre-trade, risk management, trading and post-trade, so our opportunity set is quite large.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Okay. That's helpful. Then just follow-up, the U.S. auction business, it looks like market share has trended in the right direction. Pricing look like it ticked down. I think, you guys have a new proposal in terms of the new pricing mechanism, so just any comments on the outlook of the auctions business and from a strategy standpoint, you now, what you guys are trying to achieve?","Bob Greifeld","I would say the auctions business is certainly multidimensional chess that we play and we play it basically on a month-by-month basis. Our team is incredibly well led and we tend to think in the right ways, and by that I mean really acting in concert with what our customers require, so I think it's a tough competitive environment and we continue to do well and we certainly are very excited about the new plans we are putting in place, but we also recognize that two to three months, after that we will be doing further refinements to those plans.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Bob Greifeld","Okay. So, one, we want to thank you for attending on this snowy day. Two, is I want to just repeat what we said earlier. We are certainly proud of the fact that we had record revenues, but probably more importantly than that, we had in certain ways record investments in our future and certainly some most GIFT initiatives showing some real signs of life, so it's a great thing to be able to, one, deliver record revenues, invest in our future and obviously delivery to our investors, so we are proud of the quarter, we are excited about what 2014 will represent and we certainly appreciate your support and look forward to talking to you in the future, so thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ed Ditmire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Edward P. Ditmire - Nasdaq, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's third quarter 2018 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Michael Ptasznik, our CFO; John Zecca, General Counsel-North America and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material nonpublic information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC regulation update.","I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","And now, I will turn the call over to Adena.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will focus my remarks today on Nasdaq's business performance and how that tracks to the progress we're making across on our execution goals for the year. Before I detail our strong results for the quarter, I want to take a few minutes to discuss how Nasdaq is addressing two important issues, the Nordic commodity clearing default event and the SEC regulatory developments largely focused on U.S. equity market data.","Turning first to the clearing event, on September 10, the markets in the German and Nordic Power experienced an extreme spread movement 17 times larger than the normal change in spread measured since 2011. As a result of the extreme price movement, a clearing member of our Nordic Commodities market incurred significant losses and failed to fully cover an intraday margin call within the prescribed time limit. Therefore, the member was declared in default. The default resulted in the loss to the clearinghouse net of the default member's collateral of \u20ac114 million. This loss was covered by the default waterfall, including \u20ac7 million from Nasdaq's Junior Capital or which is the first loss layer, and the remaining \u20ac107 million from the member default fund.","By September 17, the member default fund was 100% replenished and Nasdaq implemented temporary Junior Capital, a first loss layer, of an additional \u20ac19 million on a 90-day basis. Nasdaq also announced that this time, a comprehensive examination of the event, which includes a review of its causes, the membership requirements, margin requirements, risk management procedures, collateral management, and default management procedures in an effort to learn everything we can to ensure that we are best positioned to avoid this type of situations from occurring again.","This review has been conducted by a third party, Oliver Wyman, a global management consulting firm, with the support of our internal audit to ensure that we learn as much as possible with transparency and credibility. Once their review is complete, we plan to communicate our summary findings and recommended changes to the affected constituents.","Our objective is to find the best model that balances the need to facilitate a robust market while, at the same time, providing members with assuredness that they can securely commit capital. At the same time, we're also working with our members on recovering a portion of the losses they incurred from the defaulting member, including liquidating the defaulting member's assets.","We are grateful for the professional and constructive manner in which the market participants have worked with us throughout this difficult process and realize we have much to do to ensure their support going forward. We look forward to continuing to update everyone on a clear and timely basis as we work to reduce the financial impact of the default event on our members and enhance how the clearinghouse reduces risks in the future.","Now, I'd like to turn to the regulatory developments regarding our SEC-regulated businesses which are largely focused on U.S. equity data products. First, I want to make clear that the debate, discussion, and developments in this area are part of what has been an almost 20-year story with regard to the data business in the context of the broader U.S. equity market structure. Today, I'll discuss the latest turns that have been a winding and largely court-litigated debate on the dynamics of a U.S. equity data product landscape which we feel is an important contributor to how U.S. stock markets deliver the highest levels of global standards in terms of efficiency, transparency and resiliency. We expect that this debate and related litigation will continue for many years to come.","Let me talk first about last week's SEC actions and then discuss what we're doing to address them going forward and then how we're engaging with the industry as participants in the SEC market data and access roundtable later this week. Last Tuesday evening, the SEC rejected a 2016 decision by its own Chief Administrative Law Judge. The judge's original decision came after a one-week public administrative trial at the SEC. The administrative law judge ruled at the end of that trial that the price of exchange-created depth-of-book data is constrained by competition.","However, last week, the SEC found, despite the significant evidence to the contrary submitted at trial, that Nasdaq and New York had not met their burden of proof that the Nasdaq Level 2 distributor fee and the NYSE ArcaBook fees, respectively, at issue in the case were fair and reasonable. The impact of the decision on Nasdaq is limited to prospective application of its Level 2 distributor fee, which generates approximately $1 million per year. In their decision, the SEC made it clear that it is \"not finding that the market is not competitive.\" Its focus was solely on the level of proof presented, which we of course dispute.","Two Republican commissioners underscored in a separate statement that they did not intend last week's decision to replace the SEC's market-based approach with cost-based rate-making and they suggested approaches that might meet the exchanges' burden of proof. Regardless, we have already appealed the SEC's decision to the federal court.","Separately in the decision last week, the SEC also asked the exchanges to create a process to consider 400 other rule filings that were approved by the SEC but then have been challenged by SIFMA and Bloomberg since 2013 and to consider the impact of those filings. Of the 400 rule filings remanded to the exchanges, approximately 130 relate to Nasdaq's markets with a few additional filings related to the shared tape plan fees.","These challenged filings and the associated fees will remain in place during any review process. This remand order was adopted by the SEC without the benefit of any briefing or argument by the parties and is contrary to the Exchange Act and the Administrative Procedures Act. We will seek reconsideration of this remand order by the SEC prior to any appeal or other proceedings.","The result of any process for reviewing these filings should be subject to further review by the commission \u2013 or would be subject to further review by the commission and thereafter subject to appeal at the federal court. In some, the SEC's decisions to establish an unworkable and unnecessary regulatory regime already in a competitive market is inconsistent with our operations and our expectations. We have confidence in the legal arguments of our appeal. Ultimately, the federal courts will decide on the validity of the SEC's unprecedented orders.","The list of 130 filings was clearly not reviewed by the SEC and represents an indiscriminate use of an objection procedure by the opposing parties. The disputed filings include fee decreases such as an enterprise license that allows our larger customers to reduce their fees by buying multiple products for a fixed price. They even include a filing where Nasdaq sets a fee for certain ports on its ISE market at zero. The filings covered by the objections also include the initial pricing rule for Nasdaq Basic, a last sale and top of book product that has reduced costs for our customers by over $200 million since its inception.","We are confident in the merits of our appeal, and in the meantime, we will continue to run our market data business as we always have with integrity and a relentless focus on our clients. At this time, we do not expect this decision to have a material impact on our growth outlook for the Information Services business.","As we discussed at our Investor Day, our growth plans are focused on our indexed and analytics businesses with the relatively modest growth expectations from our exchange data products across our U.S. and Nordic equities, options and fixed income businesses, deriving primarily from geographic expansion of our client base.","Let me turn to the SEC's roundtable discussions on U.S. equity data and access topic, which is taking place Thursday and Friday of this week. In contrast to the SEC's actions last week, which largely relate to U.S. equity proprietary data and connectivity offerings, the roundtable is also focused on the public data feeds also called the shared tape plans, which will be the subject of five of the seven roundtable sessions.","Issues core to the discussion of these industry utility products where the usage is, in some cases, mandated by regulation, are represented in sessions focused on governance, pricing, technology, and operational transparency. On governance, we've offered proposed reforms to include more of a voice and voting power on the operating committees of the SIP to users and customers. We look forward to working with other stockholders to evolve the governance in a more inclusive way.","On pricing, we've asked the SEC to clarify the Vendor Display Rule, which could give customers more comfort in using lower cost alternatives, such as Nasdaq Basic, in certain use cases where the consolidated tape's benefits are not critical. I mentioned earlier that Nasdaq Basic has saved the industry over $200 million since its inception nine years ago, and we'd like to do everything possible to expand adoption of lower cost alternative while reserving the SIP's comprehensive data for the most appropriate transactional use cases.","On technology and operational transparency relating to the performance of the SIP and the cost and investment to obtain that performance, I think there's a strong story to tell, and I'm disappointed when we see it mischaracterized. Let's focus on the UTP SIP, which is the consolidated tape for Nasdaq-listed securities, which we administer on behalf of the industry after winning a competitive selection process.","In contrast to uninformed and inflammatory allegations by some critics that the performance suffers compared to proprietary data products, the UTP SIP delivers data with only 16 microseconds of latency, putting it at the same world-class performance as our fastest data feeds. At the same time, we've also invested to increase capacity and bolster resiliency. And note just last week, on October 11, the SIP processed a record of nearly 500 million messages without any degradation of latency performance. Of course, the upgrades required substantial direct investment and also benefit from Nasdaq's broader technology investments over many years, which we're happy to discuss at the roundtable.","We also believe that the roundtables provide an opportunity to highlight some other important misperceptions. Exchanges including Nasdaq have been integral to the automation of trading over the last 20 years. This has contributed to spreads falling by approximately 90% over this period, leading to cost reductions for all investors and better market liquidity for our issuers. In fact, the brokerage industry's own research shows that U.S. equities markets are the deepest and least expensive to trade on in the world.","The reality is that most main street investors pay nothing for quote and trade data, while the cost of retail commissions have been falling. According to a recent paper by Professor Jim Angel of Georgetown University, large online brokerages pay about $0.17 per month per customer for the cost of real-time nonprofessional market data. As an example of the falling costs of retail trading to customers, the base equity commission rate at one of the leading online brokers is approximately $5 today, a 75% reduction from the $20 pricing when it first was introduced in late 2004.","Thus, the debate is really a commercial dispute between exchanges and their large bank and HFT clients and competitors. According to an October 22 Financial Times article citing Autonomous Research, the five largest U.S. banks together generated over $25 billion in equity trading revenue through the first three quarters of this year. We estimate Nasdaq's data and connectivity sales to these customers would only sum to well under 0.5% of that figure.","Let me preview some of the messages we'll be communicating to the industry stakeholders at the roundtable later this week and beyond. First, we remain committed to a client-centric approach to innovating for the benefit of our clients, market participants and the broader investing public. Second, we are extremely supportive of the roundtables as there's always room for improvement as we outlined in the three reforms that Nasdaq recently proposed.","Third, the U.S. equity capital markets are the envy of the world with competition and innovation creating a world-class client experience and powering a vast array of investment products and services for the investing public. And fourth, therefore, the SEC should take a very careful and deliberate approach to considering the consequences of changing the structure that exists today and that clearly benefits millions of investors.","Okay. So now let's turn to focus on our business performance in the period. In the third quarter of 2018, we delivered solid organic growth of 5% across our businesses versus the prior year period. This was driven by a 6% organic revenue increase across our non-trading segments, in line with our long-term outlook, specifically Market Technology, Information Services, and Corporate Services, as well as a 3% organic revenue increase in Market Services versus the prior year period. Year-to-date, the company has delivered organic growth of 7% driven relatively equally from the combination of non-trading and trading segments.","Equally important, our results from this last quarter continue to track positively to the tactical execution priorities we laid out at the start of the year, which are to complete the initial actions of our strategic pivot, to develop and deploy our marketplace economy technology strategy, and to continue advancing our competitive position in our core businesses.","This is particularly evident in the areas where we've shifted more of our resources, particularly \u2013 specifically in technology, index, and analytics. We're seeing strong growth in these businesses, which reaffirms our new strategic direction. In addition, our core trading and Corporate Services businesses are operating consistently to support our vision as we continue to demonstrate our competitive position in both segments, resulting from consistently strong market share in U.S. equities and our 76% U.S. IPO win rate during the quarter.","I'm incredibly pleased to report that Nasdaq continues to deliver strong, solid organic revenue growth across each and every segment of our business. So, let's drill down into some of the factors underpinning that success. Our Market Technology segment continued to meet our long-term expectations and lead on organic revenue growth at 13% in the period and 11% year-to-date. Order intake in our Market Technology segment totaled $149 million during the first nine months of 2018, which matches the multiyear high set in the same period in 2017.","New deals signed during the period include providing Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited with their real-time risk solution across its cash and derivatives markets via the Nasdaq Financial Framework and a new SMARTS agreement with the London Metals Exchange for market surveillance.","We also continued to see strong growth in our SMARTS surveillance business, which increased 20% in the third quarter versus the prior year period. This continued momentum brought in new surveillance customers across a variety of customer classes including regulators, exchanges, broker-dealers and asset managers.","We were also excited to announce a public offer to the shareholders and warrant holders of Cinnober, a Swedish financial technology provider to brokers, exchanges and clearinghouses worldwide. This proposed transaction is intended to accelerate how we can grow as a technology provider, unlock significant synergies and advance our progress towards the long-term potential for the Nasdaq Financial Framework, our next-generation technology platform. Cinnober would bring to Nasdaq respected technology and talent, complementary offerings to ours in the banks and brokers and insurance customer segments, and a quality client base, some of which we don't already serve.","Moving to our Information Services segment, we delivered strong revenue growth in large part due to a year-over-year increase of 21% in index revenues as well as strong contributions in our Investment Data and Analytics business. We achieved another record quarter of assets under management licensed to Nasdaq indexes, up 34% year-over-year, moving above the $200 billion mark for the first time. Elsewhere in index licensing, we're building upon a very strong year for Nasdaq-licensed index derivative volumes by signing an extension of the exclusive Nasdaq-100 futures and options on futures partnership with CME lasting through 2029.","In Investment Data and Analytics, our eVestment business continues to deliver on our high expectations. September marked one year since we first announced our agreement to acquire eVestment. We remain encouraged by the team's progress and results to date. Adjusting for the temporary impact of the purchase price adjustment on deferred revenues, eVestment revenues surpassed the $100 million annualized run rate for the first time in the third quarter, up from $81 million in the trailing 12-month period when we announced the transaction a little more than a year ago.","Turning to our Corporate Services segment, Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs in the third quarter with a 76% win rate and a 71% win rate year-to-date. Specific listings highlights for the quarter include the successful IPO launches of Focus Financial, Pinduoduo, Sonos, and SurveyMonkey. Additionally, so far this year, approximately $70 billion in market cap has switched to Nasdaq from the New York Stock Exchange via exchange listing transfers. In the quarter, we welcomed three new corporate switches including United Continental Holdings and Intrexon.","Rounding out our Corporate Services' highlights, our Nasdaq Private Market completed its 200th secondary tender transaction during the quarter. This milestone represents $18.5 billion in total company-sponsored liquidity programs completed on our platform since it's launched in 2013. Nasdaq Private Market has supported over 160 private companies, including 63 unicorns, and remains committed to enabling a new era of private market standards and liquidity solutions.","And finally, our Market Services business delivered revenue growth in our equity derivative trading and clearing and cash equities trading businesses, reflecting in part higher industry trading volumes in both categories, as well as higher U.S. equities market share.","As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that while we have important issues that we're working to address with regard to the CCP default event as well as our efforts to engage effectively in the U.S. equity data debate and discussion, we continue to deliver strong results in the third quarter with particular focus on our organic revenue growth. Going forward, we remain relentlessly focused on our strategic realignment to maximize opportunities as a technology and analytics provider and continue our mission of achieving the highest possible effectiveness in our foundational marketplace businesses.","With that, I'll turn it over to Michael to review the financial details.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing third quarter revenue performance as shown on page 3 of the presentation and organic growth on pages 4 and 14.","The $3 million decrease in reported net revenue of $600 million consisted of: organic growth of $28 million, including 6% organic growth in the non-trading segments, and 3% organic growth in Market Services; a $22 million positive impact from the inclusion of revenues from the acquisition of eVestment; a $46 million negative impact from the divestiture of Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses; and a $7 million unfavorable impact from the changes in foreign exchange rates.","I will now review quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments. I will start with Information Services, which is, as reflected on pages 5 and 14, saw a $29 million or a 19% increase in revenue consisting of $7 million or 5% organic growth. Index revenues were up 21% in the third quarter of 2018, primarily due to higher assets under management and exchange traded products linked to Nasdaq indexes. Market data revenues decreased 2% primarily due to lower collections related to previously underreported usage.","Investment Data and Analytics revenues increased due to the inclusion of $22 million revenues from our acquisition of eVestment, which is net of a $4 million negative impact from the deferred revenue purchase price adjustment. This impact will be reduced to $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, the last period in which it impacts.","Market Technology revenue as shown on pages 6 and 14 increased $6 million or 10% consisting of $8 million or 13% organic growth. The increase primarily reflects higher delivery and support revenues and higher software as a service revenues, partially offset by lower change requests and advisory revenues.","In the third quarter, the operating income margin for Market Technology was 13% versus 23% in the year ago quarter. As we said over the last two quarterly calls and during Investor Day, on a year-over-year basis, we are seeing the impact of the investments we are making to upgrade our technology for the next-generation Nasdaq Financial Framework as well as increased customer deliveries.","We continue to expect the technology investments to depress margins in 2018 and 2019 versus the mid- to high-20s levels seen in 2016 and 2017. However, over the medium- to longer-term, we expect to unlock both higher revenue and higher margin potential in the business as we move clients to a managed solutions model.","Turning to Corporate Services on pages 7 and 14, revenues increased $5 million or 4%. The increase was in our listing segment where revenues were up $5 million or 7%, primarily due to higher U.S. listings revenue from the all-inclusive offering becoming effective for all U.S. issuers on January 1, 2018, and increase in the number and size of IPOs partially offset by the run-off of revenue recognized from previously deferred listings of additional share fees.","Market Services' net revenues on pages 8 and 14 saw a $3 million or 1% increase including a $7 million or 3% organic increase and a $4 million negative impact from changes in foreign exchange. The organic increase was due to higher revenues in U.S. options and U.S. equities, partially offset by a decline in trade management services and fixed income and commodities trading and clearing.","Turning to pages 9 and 14 to review expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased $4 million to $311 million with a $19 million expense increase from acquisitions, a $15 million organic increase partially offset by a $32 million decrease due to the divestiture of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses and a $6 million favorable impact from the changes in foreign exchange rates. On an organic basis, expenses increased 5%, approximately in line with increases in each of the first three quarters of 2018. As a reminder, we expect that during periods of higher revenue growth, such as the 7% organic revenue growth we've experienced year-to-date 2018, the company's organic expense growth will likely be above our longer term 3% (00:25:03) expectation in those periods.","Turning to slide 10, we are lowering the high end of our 2018 non-GAAP operating expense guidance by $10 million for revised range up $1,310 million to $1,325 million. Embedded in the updated 2018 expense guidance is a sequential pickup in expenses in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. The sequential increase reflects approximately $8 million in anticipated increases due to the impact of recent hires and promotions, seasonal compensation and higher fourth quarter marketing spend. In addition, typically higher fourth quarter revenue seasonality is likely to impact other variable expenses above 3Q levels.","Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased $1 million in the third quarter of 2018 and the non-GAAP operating margin totaled 48%, unchanged versus the prior year period. The current period operating income and operating margin reflect the $4 million noncash impact from the eVestment purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue as well as certain residual expenses from the divestiture, both of which will be behind us in the 2019 and beyond.","Net interest expense was $35 million in the third quarter of 2018, an increase of $3 million versus the prior year period, primarily due to debt issued in connection with the eVestment acquisition. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 26%. For the full year 2018, our non-GAAP tax rate guidance is a range of 24.5% to 26.5%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the third quarter of 2018 was $193 million or $1.15 per diluted share compared to $172 million or $1.01 per diluted share in the prior year period.","Turning to capital on slide 11, debt increased by $33 million versus Q2 2018 primarily due to $40 million increase in outstanding commercial paper partially offset by an $8 million decreased in Eurobond book values caused by a weaker euro. Share repurchases in the third quarter totaled $54 million, as you return the final amount of the after-tax proceeds from the divestiture. Together with dividend payments, we returned $602 million to shareholders through the first nine months of 2018. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio ended the period at an unchanged 3.1 times. As mentioned previously, we continue to plan to delever to a mid-two times leverage ratio by mid-2019.","Subsequent to the third quarter, in October, Nasdaq announced an agreement to sell our 5% equity stake in LCH Group Holdings Limited for approximately \u20ac150 million, with the proceeds expected to be used to partially fund our public tender offer to the shareholders of Cinnober, a good example of our efforts to free up capital from less core areas to allocate it, to more deliberately, to further our strategic direction.","Thank you for your time and I'll turn it back to the operator for the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good morning, Adena. Good morning, Michael. I guess the first question on Market Technology and we've seen the lower margin. And as you've taken Cinnober, I guess the question would be, where would the margins go because that looks breakeven? And how quickly can you take out expenses there because the guidance is accretion in the first non-GAAP accretion in the first 12 months?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Hey, Rich. Thanks very much for the question. So we are in the middle of a tender offer for Cinnober. So at this point, what we can tell you is that we do anticipate that we will achieve synergies within the combination, the combined group. I think that we also are excited to have the team within Cinnober be part of our technology team so that we can actually catalyze even more growth within the business. But in terms of very specific plans on the timing of those synergies, I think we'll have to wait until we see the outcome of the tender offer before we can provide a lot of specifics just based on the way that the process works in Sweden.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thanks on that.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. And actually, I would just say one other thing. So we are \u2013 the one thing we haven't been able to communicate is that we anticipate that this acquisition obviously will be accretive to us but also that it will meet our 10% hurdle that we've established for ourselves in terms of a three- to five-year timeframe for return on invested capital. And so that is something that we've been very, very clear about in terms of the benefit of this deal to our shareholders.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Thank you. And then my \"related\" question is on market data and the follow-up and that would \u2013 I guess the question is on the 130 remanded reviews. I guess can you give us the exposure of revenue on that? And then I know there's been issues on, I guess, maybe that's just the best question. I know you've asked that the Division of Trading and Markets recluse himself or recuse himself from some of the issues here. I'm just trying to see whether there was any progress on that.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","So with regard to the 130 filings, I think it's important to note that, first of all as I mentioned before, that it was kind of an indiscriminate use of an objection proceeding. So each one of those filings is going to be individually reviewed, and there's going to be a process around that that's established, that it's going to take a long time to establish. And every single one of those filings, each and every one of them will be reviewed individually to identify the justification for the fees and kind of what they do to support and the value they create to the marketplace.","We feel highly confident in our ability to justify the fees that we've charged over the years. We feel that, in fact, every single one of those filings was already reviewed and approved by the SEC. So therefore, we will be, I would say, objecting to this entire procedure. But we feel that it's just a matter of making sure that the documentation supports the marketplace that we already are supporting.","And I would point out that this market is incredibly competitive, that the pricing for these services is based on these competitive pressures, that it is \u2013 we look at these on the basis of the value they provide to the industry, and including something like Nasdaq Basic which has saved the industry a lot of money over the years, even that's subject to this review. So it is going to be a very long process of reviewing 130 filings with the opportunity to appeal any decision on each and every one of them. So you can imagine it will take a very long time.","So, therefore, it's not really a matter of exposure because we feel entirely confident that we have put our fees together and based our fees on a competitive environment that we operate in and that we'll continue to be able to charge them. So, I would say that's kind of how we're taking a look at it at this point, Rich, and how we're approaching it.","I can't answer the question or respond to your question regarding the recusal. That's something that we specifically put in writing and we submitted to the SEC, and we'll have to determine how that's being handled as we go forward.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I'm just reading though on that I thought there was a year deadline for the 130 rule challenges.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","So the SEC has proposed something without talking to a single individual in the industry. In terms of the process, we will obviously be \u2013 we will be objecting to what they suggested and going back and asking for a further review. I think that in terms of establishing a process, that's potentially something that \u2013 establishing a process is one thing, reviewing 400 individual filings, having it be discussed and debated amongst the participants and with the SEC, then going back to the SEC for a decision and then going for an appeal on any decision that we don't agree with, I think it's going to take a lot longer than a year.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Understood. Thanks, Adena. That's helpful.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thanks a lot. Adena, thanks for all the color upfront on both the clearing and the market data. I guess just one question on the clearing side. In the whole scheme of things for you guys, the business is relatively small. So I guess in terms of like the \u2013 when I think about downside or like what the risk is, just wanted to get some sense. Do you guys have any insurance in place when you have operational issues like this? That whatever the outcome ends up being, is there anything that can potentially offset any of the related costs?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. So I'd say certainly, we have insurance, absolutely. But I would say also that, at this stage, there are a couple of things to note. You are right that this is a relatively small business within Nasdaq. It generates in the range of $30 million to $35 million of revenue and its margin is actually below the average for the company. So it is a small business.","I think that in terms of the activity levels and the way that the members have been working with us through the situation, it's actually been quite productive and constructive. The activity levels in the market remain pretty much on average of what we've been seeing. And the members have been very constructive and productive in working with us to try to make sure that we work with them on how we can continue to improve the operation, but also in terms of getting recovery from the defaulting member on the loss.","So I think that, at this stage, we feel that that has been a collaborative and cooperative process. But, of course, as we look at ways that we can improve the market, we might have to incur some costs associated with just making sure that we make the improvements that we're going to be recommending. I'd say \u2013 but definitely, to the extent that there's any sort of downside risk that you're mentioning, we most certainly have insurance.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe on the core business, two areas, on the analytics with eVestment, just wanted to get a sense over the past year, how has the traction been with that business maybe relative to expectations? And then a smaller area, but on the index side, obviously, you're seeing great growth, but just wanted to get some context when you get market volatility and a little weakness like we're seeing now, how much of it is on the AUM versus any other types of fees in that line?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. With eVestment, it actually has been tracking very well and as we mentioned, on a run rate basis in the quarter, we've gotten to the point where we're at $100 million of revenue. So it's definitely showing significant growth over prior year period. I think that we also \u2013 they just launched a new product within their franchise, and it's very exciting to see continued innovation and offering additional services to the asset managers and asset owners that will make it so that we can continue to grow that business in a significant way. So, we're extremely pleased with how that business is going and tracking.","I think within the index business, as we've mentioned before, there is certainly is a beta component to the index business related to AUM. So AUM is a combination, of course, market performance and the number of, what we say, kind of the number of shares outstanding within the index products that are created. So our view right now is that there is some beta dependency and the growth has been a combination of more investors coming in and taking advantage of the products we have in addition to the market performance against those products. But I think that, as you said, there is some beta dependency within that business.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Following up on default fund, there is rule creation that's in progress in the EU with regard to CCPs and it's expected to conclude next year. Maybe what are your thoughts on how the default fund breach could influence European regulation? I think when the Korean CCP was breached we saw an increase in calls for skin in the game. So, I guess what do you expect here? And then I guess, as the related follow-up, what is your assessment of the reputational damage done to Nasdaq and are there any implications or consequences that you think result?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","So I think with regards to the EU, I think that we really can't comment specifically on the impact of this event on any sort of upcoming potential EU regulation. I think we're focused very specifically, Ken, on managing through this issue with our clients and on our own regulators. And so I would say that we don't have any sort of opinion about how this might impact other things that might be going on in the regulatory space.","I would say that with regard to our business, I mean this is a major event that's occurred within our clearinghouse. We have been doing, as I said, a deep dive across the operation. I would also say that this was an event that was not, to be very honest, a 17 times increase in the average daily spread and that all happened in one day, and it was many times \u2013 multiple times larger than any event that the clearinghouse has ever experienced. So it was in fact a very onetime, very extreme event. And so what you have to look at is not only what can you do to prevent it but as you're going through the process of managing through it, how do we make sure that we just are robust across the whole thing.","I think that at this point, it really has been a very productive process. I think that Oliver Wyman's done great work and we will continue to find ways to improve. We do believe that we've been operating appropriately within the guidelines that we've set for ourselves and the regulators have set for us. But at the same time, there's always ways to improve.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is now open.","Chris Allen - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC","Good morning, everyone. Just want to touch again on market data. I think most people assume now that the hurdle for any further pricing increases has clearly gone up, not just from a data perspective but also from an access connectivity perspective. So I'm just wondering if you can maybe remind us the magnitude of revenues that fall into these buckets related to U.S. equities and what growth, if any, is kind of embedded in your organic growth potentially moving forward?","And then also related, what do you think that the SEC will focus, assuming on this issue moving forward, a more holistic review of overall equity market structure? Thank you.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","So within the market data and connectivity business, both of those businesses, we've been pretty clear, are low single-digit growers. And I would say, first of all, within the market data business, it's not just U.S. equities data. We have U.S. equities data, options data, futures data, fixed income data, Canadian data, Nordic equities options and futures data. So we've got a plethora of products that fit within our market data business. But we've also been very clear that we have not been and don't expect to be dependent on fee increases to be a major driver of revenue increase there.","In fact, the significant driver of revenue increase so far has actually been new client acquisition, finding new clients in new geographies and finding new clients here in the U.S. We continue to find demand and new pockets of demand for our products here in the U.S. as well. So it is not \u2013 we're not dependent on kind of price increases.","And same with the connectivity business, again, it's a low single-digit grower. We're not anticipating that to be a big driver of growth within the business and we've been managing it very, very \u2013 I think we've done frankly a great job of managing the businesses in the interest of our clients. We're extremely disclosive when we do things in those businesses that impact customers, and we do them in connection with enhancements and changes we're making to the product. So, again, Chris, this is not \u2013 we don't anticipate this being a driver of growth and we've been pretty disclosive about that.","So our growth is going to come from our index businesses, our Investment Data and Analytics businesses, our Market Tech businesses, our other products, our Corporate Services businesses, those are kind of the areas that you're seeing consistent growth and driving the 5% that we achieved for the quarter in addition to the 7% we've achieved for the year.","With regard to a holistic regulatory review, we've been encouraging the SEC, if they're going to look at one piece of market structure, they really ought to look at every piece of market structure. Market data is a product of the market structure that's been created. The competitive dynamic that we operate in for listings and trading and market data is all the product of Reg NMS. So if they're going to tease apart one element of it, they really ought to look at the entire market structure that they've created with Reg NMS, and we've been encouraging them to do that for years. We will continue to encourage them to do that. If they want improvements, they've got to look at the interrelation across everything that we do here.","Chris Allen - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC","Thanks. That's it.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. I'll follow up on the Nordic clearing issue and you talked about hiring Oliver Wyman and what you're doing. I guess can you talk about your regulators and their response and how you're working with them and what we should expect in terms of the next steps that we should hear from the regulators?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","So we have been highly engaged with our regulators throughout the entire event so during the event and after and we have continued to work with them to give them as much information that they've asked for. And we continue to have a live dialogue with them. I think that at this stage, we're in the process of working with our regulators, working with our clients, and doing our own internal assessment. And all of that I think will come together to looking at some improvements and changes we'll be making to the clearinghouse going forward.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Sorry to stay on the market data topic. But I know you gave a lot of detail already and really appreciate it. But I think there's still a lot of confusion so I just hope that you can actually dumb down the debate for a second here. Because when you look at your stock and some of your peer stock performance, I think there's this view in the marketplace that people ask about exposures and there's like hundreds of millions of dollars that the SEC on the fly will decide will just go to zero or close to zero.","So maybe you can just contrast for a second that this is regulated market that that's just not something that procedurally can happen here. And I know you talked a lot about like this will drag out over years. But maybe you can just \u2013 any incremental stuff that you can give us to help us just clear up the debate like this is not about a revenue reduction coming next quarter and the long term coming.","And then sorry, just related real quick, you mentioned that some of the growth in the last two years, yes, there's been pricing but there's also been price reductions. So if you can give us just a net number in terms of what pricing on those 130 products has contributed over the last two years, it would be really helpful. Thank you.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","So, with regard to the market data issue, it's a great point, Alex. So I think it's really important to read the statements from the Chairman and from the Republican commissioners. I think the first thing to note is that they're not saying that necessarily that our fees are not reasonable. I mean it's kind of a double negative. But they are saying that they would like more evidence to support the fees that we have delivered.","What's frustrating to us is that every single one of those fees is approved by the SEC, and so, they've all been reviewed. At no point did they ask for further information before granting us the approval. So, now they're coming back and saying we want more information. And we have to understand that in terms of what they want.","It's also very clear that the Republican commissioners have said they're not looking to rate make, they're not looking for cost-plus (00:46:22) model. They're just looking for further justification in the context of it being a competitive market, having competition around the market data and each and every single one of those filings has its own situation, so how do we look at maybe delivering more value to our clients in connection with the fee change; or if it's a new product, what value are we delivering to our client as we're launching this new product.","I would say that, obviously, we are objecting to the fact that they're doing a retroactive review of every single thing that they've already given us approval for over the years. But at the same time, it is very clear to me that they're not looking for these fees to go to zero. The exposure is not our data revenue. The exposure is how do we justify and make sure that we're demonstrating that we're acting appropriately in the context of a competitive marketplace.","And we feel confident that we will be able to do that quite successfully. So that's not a situation where you have this immediate exposure that you're talking about. I totally agree with you. And even over the long term, we believe in the years to come as we're working through this process, we will demonstrate that we've acted very, very well on behalf of our clients to support our data business. And so that, I think, is the way to look at it, Alex, but it is important to recognize looking at the words of the release, that they're not making an arbitrary decision to change things. They're just saying let's go through kind of a deeper dive on the evidence to support what we do.","In terms of the revenue and the growth and the net, that's something actually we're still going through ourselves. But I would say it's really kind of a \u2013 it's really a mix and match. So we aren't currently providing any sort of specific disclosures because it's such a broad base of filings and each and every one of them will be reviewed individually.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Adena, thanks for the color on the SEC market data issue and probably getting your view out there is probably a good thing since it's been mostly a one-sided conversation to date so far. But as we look ahead to the roundtable over the next couple days, do you guys expect this to be more of like an airing of grievances or is there something that we should be looking for that you think could be kind of a realistic and definitively positive or negative kind of either outcome or progression?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","I think that we have to look at this as just one event in a 20-year discussion and debate on this topic. So we can expect it to be definitively \u2013 that there's any definitive decisions or changes or anything that will come out of it other than a discussion.","The good news is two things. They are allowing us to submit a written statement, which we will do. So it allows us to put out all of our arguments in a way that's very coherent and very easy to read and hopefully provides great support because I agree with you, it has been a one-sided discussion so far and it's time for us to have an opportunity to be proud of what we've done and proud of what we've created for the industry and to remind people that our markets are the best markets in the world. They're incredibly resilient.","In fact, on October 11, we processed 28 billion messages in our systems across our equities and options market and with no real degradation of service. It was an \u2013 I mean we're great at what we do and we provide a great service to our clients and to investors. We have millions of investors who rely on us for market data. The average price that a retail broker pays for per client is like $0.17 per month. So we believe that we have a great story to tell so we are excited to do it.","I think that in terms of the outcome, I think you're going to find that it's a pretty \u2013 we are going to have an opportunity to speak on five of the seven panels and so will other exchanges. So I do actually believe it will be a balanced discussion, and we will understand even further what the debate really is and recognizing that it really is a debate amongst the exchanges and the large banks. I mean that's really what it's going to come down to.","Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Another question on the SEC roundtable. We would expect some market participants to suggest changes to the consolidated tape such as making providers rebate all revenues in excess of actual expenses or incorporating depth-of-book data in the SIP feed, which would presumably devalue your proprietary data feeds. Can you give us an early preview of your take on that particular debate?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","I would just let you know that that debate again has been going on for 20 years. The first time that those two suggestions were brought up was in 1999 and in 2003. And the SEC in both cases rejected the notion that there should be a cost-plus-type-based model supporting this type of business. And they looked at it in the context of the overall regulations they had established through Reg NMS. The fact that these are \u2013 the SIP in particular, the highly regulated utility, it has participation across the exchanges.","I would point out that the revenue generated by the SIP does support the new entrance of new exchanges, and that's one of the things the SEC specifically wants is to have more exchange competition and the revenue that comes out of the SIP does allow for new entrants to come in and become sustainable pretty quickly. So I would have to say I think that that runs counter \u2013 those arguments run counter to everything that the SEC has tried to create over the last 15 years, and they have been debated and rejected multiple times through the process of discussion and debate. So I don't think those are arguments that you will find have a lot of support across the broad spectrum of clients.","Obviously, we know that those are going to be brought up because they always are and they're discussed, but if you want innovation, you want competition, you want us to make sure that we can, in fact, be resilient and have the opportunity to offer our clients choice across the spectrum of market data and trading platforms, then at the end of the day, you have to allow for there to be a value-based review of these types of products.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Just I guess one more on that topic. Appreciate your comments, Adena, on reviewing the whole market structure and, obviously, the SEC has been doing this a long time, putting out a concept release in 2010 on market structure, which really never ended up getting addressed. But, I guess, within the market data between the SIP and proprietary, do you envision an avenue for restructuring the SIP somehow in the Consolidated Tape Association and how that revenue model could actually change and then to leave obviously the proprietary data intact? Or do you think it really can't be addressed unless you address everything else within the market structure and this debate gets basically kicked down the road for a long time?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, I do think you have to \u2013 I mean, your question is a good one because it recognizes the fact that everything's in an interrelated ecosystem, right? So, if you think about it, the rules that established kind of order protection and all of these things that go along with how orders get routed from one exchange to another, the interconnectedness of all of the exchanges, the resiliency that that's created across the ecosystem within the U.S. exchanges, the competition that exists amongst the exchanges and other broker-dealers, all of that is a creation that allows us then to look at, okay, what are the data products that are absolutely required for making a trading decision.","And the SEC has been entirely clear on that that they expect that, at the point of trade, that they would expect that you would have access to consolidated best bid and offer and last sale information at the point of trade. But, in every other part of the market, you should have the freedom to take the data that you think best meets your trading strategies and best meets your needs for information. And they've given a wide range of optionality to the exchanges and to the broker-dealers to be able to provide that. And that is a fundamental tenet of Reg NMS. So, you can't look at that issue separately from looking at the overall landscape that they've created, the Order Protection Rule and other things related to the market structure.","So, one of the things you can look at though is, is the SIP \u2013 is the governance of these utilities, is it really proper? So, does it have enough of an opinion being brought into the room? Do you have proper participation across the industry in looking at and examining how this SIP works? And I think that's where we've actually made some proposed changes already ahead of the roundtables to the SIP in terms of governance, in terms of including more industry participants, potentially having some voting participants coming from the industry as well as really clarifying the Vendor Display Rule, so that it's very clear at what point is a consolidated tape necessary versus when it's not.","Right now, there's some ambiguity and it's actually creating confusion. So, clarifying that it's necessary at the point of trade and allowing choice that has saved the industry $200 million so far is probably the right way for the SEC to look at how they can create more choice and save the industry a lot of money. So, I think those are the types of things that we want to see change. So there's always improvements you can make. But I don't think that you're going to see a fundamental kind of \u2013 I would say that, right now, I think that everything works together very, very well to create a very resilient and functioning market. And we should remember that before we try to make changes.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So you think there wouldn't be a major change in the revenue component on the SIP and how that's divided up between the exchanges or the participants in the industry even if you can change that without changing props?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, I would like to point out that we already share a lot of the tape revenue with the industry when they have internalized, so they don't trade on exchange and they internalize those prints and they report those prints to the Nasdaq Trade Reporting Facility, we share the vast majority of that data revenue with them. So they already receive a lot of revenue coming off the SIP, the market participants do, through a sharing plan that we have.","So I would say that we do not anticipate that \u2013 I mean we certainly don't support any sort of fundamental changes in the revenue construct. We do though support changes in governance and changes in clarifying the Vendor Display Rule to give clients more choice, which would then save them a lot of money.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. That's great color. Thank you.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So, maybe just shifting gears a little bit to the core business, just wanted to hit on Market Tech. So, I guess if we look at the new order intake, it's been trending down here for the last several quarters. I understand it could be pretty lumpy, but anything in particular that's kind of driven the slowdown this quarter? And I know revenues are not obviously perfectly correlated here, but how do you guys expect sort of revenue growth to progress here over the next few quarters given sort of the dynamic you're seeing in the order intake?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. No. Thank you. And thank you for going back to our core business, I appreciate it. Okay. So, with Market Tech, I would say that, as you said, order intake is quite lumpy. And so we had \u2013 as I mentioned before, so far this year, we're matching our record from last year. So we're pretty pleased with that. The fourth quarter tends to be a high quarter in general. I mean, it's a seasonal thing. So you would anticipate that there would be some ramp there.","I think that also recognizing that revenue growth, as you said, is not a direct correlation to order intake. These order intakes can be over \u2013 the amount of money that we're talking about into order intake could cover three years, five years, seven years, so it doesn't necessarily directly correlate to revenue growth. And when we see revenue growth, I would say that we have signed on some very significant clients with very significant new contracts related to clearing that we announced earlier this year in terms of the National Stock Exchange of India as well as the Swiss Exchange and other implementations that we're working on.","During the implementation period, we do recognize revenue now, which we didn't before, but we also recognize a lot of the cost of implementation. So the margin on that is going to be much lower. Once they deploy and they're in the market, then the revenue and the margin will continue. The revenue will continue and could grow as well as the margin becoming much more attractive. So, that's actually frankly a big part of the story is looking at the time that we will have to implement and then have these go live and these are large implementations, so there will be some delay on that.","So, I think, Alex, another thing to point out is SMARTS. We did have 20% increase in the SMARTS revenue. That's just \u2013 we are just seeing that be a very, very great growth engine for us and continued demand across the entire ecosystem for our services, and we're also seeing some real pickup on the asset management side as well. So we are very, very confident in the long-term outlook we have for the Technology business of 8% to 11% growth. We definitely see continued demand and certainly the drivers are underpinning that 8% to 11% number.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Herbert with Citi. Your line is open.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Maybe just on how you're thinking about M&A going forward specifically in Market Technology either strategically or just seeing a lot of ability to consolidate and drive synergies throughout the space. Thank you.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. I would say that we always look at opportunities for us to catalyze growth in our businesses and we are, as we mentioned before, particularly focused in those areas that are growth drivers, growth businesses for us and how we may be able to either expand these businesses or accelerate the growth in these businesses.","So whether it's Market Tech or the Information Services business, I think those are two areas where we definitely are evaluating a lot of, I would call them bolt-on type of opportunities and that tends to be where we're focused right now. But we would say that we have a great organic growth strategy across everything that we do. We're very pleased with how we can grow organically. But if we do see an acquisition that could catalyze growth or expand our presence with our clients that is also accretive and provides a return to the shareholders, we will continue to consider those, just as we have with Cinnober. I think that's a good example of a good bolt-on acquisition that will really help our business.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Thank you. In cases that have been appealed to federal court in the past, how long is that process typically? And I just want to verify, are any at-risk revenues intact until that appeal process is over?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. So, basically, there's \u2013 our understanding of the process is there's no change in the way our revenues at all (01:01:57), while this entire process is under way, right? Every process that we just talked about, everything stays intact other than the $1 million.","Now, we will be appealing that or we've already appealed it. So that $1 million, we'll have to make sure that we go through an appeal process around. But I would say that everything stays intact until the process is complete, including the appeals. Appeals and I'm looking at John generally take?","John A. Zecca - Nasdaq, Inc.","A year to 18 months.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. A year to 18 months.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call maybe recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Ed Ditmire, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Edward P. Ditmire","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ's fourth quarter 2015 earnings results. On the line are Bob Greifeld, our CEO, Lee Shavel, CFO; our Chief Operating Officer and President, Adena Friedman; President, Hans-Ole Jochumsen; Ed Knight, our General Counsel; and other members of the management team.","After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our Web site. We intend to use the Web site as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.","I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I now will turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld","Thank you, Ed. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ's fourth quarter 2015 and full-year results. I will set a quick agenda for today\u2019s call. I want to first review our strong fourth quarter results, then provide more color around how we will deliver for our customers and shareholders in the periods to come. And lastly, our esteemed CFO has decided to retire and we will discuss this more at the end of the prepared remarks before opening up to Q&A.","Turning back now to our results. We are extremely pleased to deliver another record setting quarter and full-year 2015 results for our shareholders. This is highlighted by record net revenues and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.","Fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 10% year-over-year, despite a 4% FX headwind. The positive organic growth in net revenues, 5% year-over-year for the quarter and 4% for the year generated across this entire franchise suggests that we\u2019re on the right path in terms of running our business well and delivering for our clients.","Even more impressive was that our non-trading segments grew 8% for the quarter and 6% for the year. At the same time in 2015, we invested over $400 million in R&D initiatives, capital expenditures, and bolt-on acquisitions to support our future growth, but also returning a very significant amount of capital to our shareholders.","But what is important to me is I believe this quarter really echoes our laser focus on our customers. And as I assess the competitive positioning of each of our businesses in the very diverse markets in which we compete, I\u2019m again most proud that the vast majority of our businesses improved their competitive positioning during the quarter and the year, relative to their competitors and most importantly in meeting and anticipating our customers needs.","Let me now give you a few highlights on the year and continued advancements of our strategic plan. Our foundational businesses, our cash equities and listing services on both sides of the Atlantic continued to perform at the highest levels. Combined revenues of $134 million this quarter were the highest since the first quarter of 2010 and saw a combined organic growth of 16% versus the prior year.","While we continue to benefit today from the contributions of these businesses, I\u2019m especially encouraged about how our broader portfolio which leverages these -- this foundation will benefit us in the periods to come.","In our listing services segment, we continue to provide companies with an outstanding platform to access capital by leveraging our DNA as a financial technology provider. Let me give you a few examples. During the quarter, listing services achieved a 15% organic growth and record quarterly revenues, tapping a record setting year.","We continue to demonstrate strong competitive leadership in the IPO market where we won an astounding 78% of all IPOs in the quarter and 73% for the full-year. Our proposition more and more is echoing favorably with companies who want to access the broad spectrum of solutions we offer and benefit from the visibility of our vibrant brand.","To further underscore this, during the quarter we were the beneficiaries of several significant switches to our equity markets, including TD Ameritrade, T-Mobile and CSX. All in all we welcomed 27 switches during the year from our competitors with a combined market cap of around $90 billion.","Our Nordic markets were also leading choice for IPOs in 2015 with 91 listing, raising over SEK54 billion. It was truly an outstanding performance, and as a result we had one of the strongest IPO markets, that\u2019s certainly I can remember or in that regions history.","Our product set, as you know is not limited to public companies. We\u2019ve made considerable investments in developing our market for private companies. These companies are the very foundation of an echo system of innovation and economic growth.","During the quarter, we continue to expand and develop our platform for private companies with strong organic growth in our customer base and we announced and closed the acquisition of SecondMarket. This further establishes NASDAQ private market as the leading provider of innovative, technology driven, efficient solutions for a secondary liquidity and equity management services and we\u2019re thrilled to have added significant talent in quality customers that can benefit from our expanded offerings.","NPM is a true innovation in a private company solution, and in the quarter we innovated upon that innovation with the deployment of blockchain technology. As compared to three day settlement in the public market, we settled, cleared, and moved the money in minutes in the private market.","In technology circles, you frequently attempt to have your first release of a product be minimally viable. It is extraordinary that our first release of blockchain settlement in clearing is so substantially superior to what is been represented in the public market for over 50 years.","In our market services segment, we\u2019re creating more efficient trading opportunities where our clients needed most. In addition to relatively strong average capture, and healthy activity levels we saw during the fourth quarter, we also announced our agreement to acquire Chi-X Canada.","Chi-X Canada is an ATS. It\u2019s the number two player in the Canadian equity space, has exhibited strong trends in share and revenue growth, and has healthy profitability with margins broadly comparable to our business in the U.S. This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of this year and we\u2019re looking forward to working with Chi-X management team to integrate our organizations systems and offerings to further expand on their compelling offering to the Canadian market.","Moving beyond our foundational equity trading and listings business, we saw encouraging performance across other businesses, including information services which grew 7% year-over-year on an organic basis. Further highlighting the tremendous value and in-depth intelligence these solutions provide our clients. On the index side, we saw a growth in both the Dorsey Wright SMART beta franchise, as well as our legacy index properties.","Now moving to technology solution segment, we made equally strong progress to lever the power of the innovative technology we develop, use ourselves and make it available to clients.","Market technology grew 16% year-on-year on an organic basis in part due to an exceptionally strong period for change request, while operationally achieving important milestone. The completion of a successful Phase 1 implementation of Borsa Istanbul, which included the launch of a new equity trading platform settlement in clearing solutions. This was one of the most complex and ambitious product deliveries by any exchange. It represents a great effort by both the team at NASDAQ and at Borsa Istanbul.","We look forward to continuing to work towards the Phase 2 delivery milestone, including the launch of their new derivatives trading platform in the periods to come. We also experienced an exceptional quarter in terms of total order value, one of the highest ever, including new contracts for Genium INET Trading System for the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, Genium INET for the Australian Exchange, and one of our larger order intakes ever for the SMARTS Trade Surveillance and several significant BUYs contracts.","Our ambition is to do more for our clients in anticipating their needs, also continues to drive how we evaluate and invest and execute in new opportunities. In 2015, we made significant progress on this front and I want to highlight a few examples for you today.","I mentioned NASDAQ private market in our continued progress. In 2015, we invested significantly in this platform both through internal initiatives and obviously the SecondMarket acquisition. Our secondary market transactions hit record levels in 2015. NASDAQ platforms facilitated over a 40 transactions worth over $1.6 billion. This represents a 33% increase from the previous year.","As a result, NPM including the partial quarter impact of SecondMarket served over 107 private companies, up from 61 in 2014, a very strong performance. It is our job to make sure we push the limits of where our systems and technology can accomplish and as I mentioned leveraging our core DNA as the financial technology provider is fundamental to us.","We see blockchain technology is having great potential to enable markets to operate more efficiently and is why we continue to explore ways we can harness its capabilities to benefit our clients. We -- in November, we announced that we\u2019re exploring the application of blockchain technology to proxy voting in Estonia, and then application is currently in development, but we also expect to initiative more used cases in the short-term. We feel good about our position to lead new market innovation in this space and you will certainly hear more from us about our efforts in the months to come.","Another significant investment we made during the year that highlights our commitment to our corporate clients was NASDAQ IR Insight. Here we\u2019re advancing a technology platform created from the ground up to reshape the workflow and the productivity of our corporate offices. The full version of IR Insight was launched unscheduled and made available to our customers just a few weeks ago.","Early feedback from new users has been very encouraging, citing its clear and easy to use interface. It\u2019s a huge step forward in terms of productivity and how well it stacks up to competing offerings. Already in the first few weeks we\u2019ve seen incremental sales wins across all three global regions, including first time customer wins, some from competitors as well as existing customers adding new users.","Some new sales have also come bundled with wins in other corporate solution products, affirming how IR Insight can accelerate growth into other products, because its core architecture was designed to support cross product functionality. Early days, but very encouraging.","We\u2019ve made other key investments in the last year in our other core franchises as well, including our information services segment. We accelerated our path to become one of the leading SMART beta index providers through the acquisition and integration of Dorsey Wright at the beginning of the year and our partnership with First Trust opened the door for the AlphaDEX family of indexes to switch to NASDAQ.","In addition, we launched 56 new exchange traded products linked to NASDAQ indices which along with growth in our existing product, helped AUM grow in products tracking our indices by 15% in 2015. We will never stop seeking ways where we can bring efficiency, scale and benefits for our training customers.","In 2015, we launched NFX, a bold execution of this strategy. We had begun laying the ground work for this over two years ago, inspired by our desire to provide market participants with a more efficient and cost effective solution in the energy derivative space.","Now in its six month of operation, a wide section of the trading community is using our platform with over 90 firms executing transactions on it thus far. Just last week we hit the six month anniversary. We\u2019ve traded 4.3 million contracts over that time and we achieved a new milestone with open interest, crossing 500,000 contracts for the first time just this week.","We are encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making in the energy and commodity space, while broadening our product offerings in ways that lever our core technology assets and deep customer relationships.","So far I\u2019ve highlighted the various ways our core businesses are growing through our client focus, ability to execute and the investments we\u2019re making in our future. When we look at the prongs of our strategy and ability to execute well, our disciplined used of capital plays a significant role in our ability to deliver strong returns to our shareholders.","As I\u2019ve highlighted throughout my remarks, however, we believe our future is determined in our ability to challenge the status quo and making sure the investments we make are not only strategic, but also yield attractive return.","I am pleased to report that in 2015 we have invested a number of R&D initiatives like NFX, complimentary acquisitions like Dorsey Wright & Associates, and SecondMarket, as well as the pending closer of acquisition of Chi-X Canada.","In combination with our second highest CapEx total in history, a total of over $400 investment was made for our future, while still returning a very material amount of capital to our shareholders.","Now, I\u2019d like to spend a little bit on some of the key opportunities in areas of focus for us in 2016. At NASDAQ we\u2019re never afraid to look inward of how -- inward at how we do things to make sure we\u2019re organized, and structured in a way that enables us to lever all our assets to deliver for our clients. I think the creation of the role of a COO and appointment of Adena Friedman to this position which we announced in the fourth quarter, certainly is at the heart of this philosophy and we're looking forward to her contributions.","We believe the underlying economic trends in the geographies where we operate are healthy, but we also realize the world is more globally interconnected than ever before. Our model and business mix provides us with a number of ways to not only respond to these trends, but to develop new opportunities in lockstep with our clients. At the same time, our model ensures we see direct and immediate revenue benefit and operating leverage from elevated volumes.","In closing, this year really points to the fact that our business model is incredibly sound. We are anticipating the needs of our clients better than ever, which is really driving our ability to deliver meaningful long-term growth across this franchise. It was a great quarter and a great year. I would like to thank again the NASDAQ team and I look forward to working with them to take our business even further in the months ahead.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Shavel","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. My commentary will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our Web site at ir.nasdaq.com.","I want to start off as I did the last few quarters by highlighting the impact the stronger dollar had on our year-over-year results. Excluding the impact of FX, our net revenues would have been up $37 million or 7% from the prior year and operating income would have been up $21 million or 9%.","I'll start by reviewing fourth quarter revenue performance related to the prior year quarter as shown on Page 3 of the presentation. The 4% or $19 million increase in reported revenue of $536 million consisted of organic growth in the non-trading segments revenue of $26 million or 8% due to growth in listings, information services and market technology, plus $9 million in revenues from the DWA acquisition reduced by a $10 million FX impact.","Organic growth in market services net revenues of $2 million or 1%, resulting principally from higher cash equity revenues, reduced by an $8 million FX impact. And if we move to Page 4 in the presentation, we show how organic growth breaks down historically between the non-trading information services, technology solutions, and listing services segments, which collectively had 8% organic growth this quarter and the volume sensitive market services segment at 1% for the quarter.","Looking at our full-year 2015 results, we\u2019ve achieved 6% organic growth for our non-trading segments, around the upper end of our mid single-digit medium term guidance. And in market services we achieved 3% organic growth for the full-year 2015 continuing positive organic growth for the second straight year.","I\u2019m now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted.","Information services on Page 5 saw an $8 million or 7% organic increase, plus a $9 million increase from the DWA acquisition, reduced by a $3 million FX impact. Market data revenues saw a $7 million or 8% organic increase reflecting growth in tape plan and proprietary revenues. Index licensing and services saw a $1 million or 5% organic increase from higher listing revenue from asset-based fees, partially offset by volume declines in revenues tied to certain licensed derivative products.","Technology solutions, as shown on Page 6, saw a $9 million or 6% organic revenue increase, reduced by a $5 million FX impact. The operating margin was 21%, up from 16% in the prior year period. For the full-year, technology solutions operating margin totaled 15%, a 200 basis point improvement year-over-year. We continue to have confidence in reaching our medium term objective and expect further progress as we move through 2016.","Market technology revenue saw a $10 million or 16% organic increase due to organic growth in surveillance products and increases in change requests. New order intake was $116 million in the fourth quarter, our strongest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2014. And the period end backlog finished at an all-time record $788 million, up 10% year-over-year.","Corporate solutions revenue saw a $1 million or 1% organic decline, as we continue to progress through the late stages of the integration and customer transitions from the acquisition of the Thomson Reuters corporate businesses.","We continue to see improving momentum in the business, particularly with the fourth consecutive quarter of net positive subscription sales, which totaled $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, and the positive catalyst of the full IR Insight launched in 2016.","Listing services, on Page 7, saw a $9 million or 15% organic increase in revenues, driven by pricing changes and an increase in the issuer base, reduced by $2 million of an FX impact.","Operating margin of 41% was up from 38% in the prior year quarter. I note here that looking forward we expect a return to low single-digits listing revenue growth consistent with our medium term outlook as the impact of the January 2015 pricing changes is fully in the run rate.","Market services, on Page 8, saw a $2 million or 1% organic increase in net revenues, reduced by an $8 million FX impact. Operating margin declined to 53% from 55% in the prior year period.","Equity derivatives trading and clearing net revenues saw a 6% organic decline, primarily due to lower industry trading volumes, followed by lower U.S market share. Cash equities trading net revenues saw a 17% organic increase as higher cash equity net capture and increased industry volumes were partially offset by modestly lower market shares.","Fixed income, currency and commodities trading and clearing net revenues saw a 24% organic decline from the prior year, principally due to volume-driven declines in U.S. fixed income followed by European energy. Access and broker services revenues saw a 3% organic revenue increase.","Turning to Pages 9 and 14 to review the income statement and expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses increased $12 million on an organic basis or a 4% increase, and $4 million primarily due to the Dorsey Wright acquisition, partially offset by a $11 million in FX impact. The $285 million in fourth quarter of 2015 expenses put us at a full-year total of $1.114 billion, up 3% on an organic basis.","Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter rose 7% on an organic basis versus a 6% reported increase. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 47%, up from 46% in the prior year period, reflecting the margin improvement of our listings and technology solutions business.","Net interest expense was $27 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $1 million versus prior year, mainly due to higher net debt. And the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 33% and the full-year 2015 figure was 33.4% at the low end of our 33% to 35% tax rate guidance.","Non-GAAP net income was $150 million or $0.89 per diluted share compared to $139 million or $0.81 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $0.08 increase in our non-GAAP EPS represents core organic EPS growth of 6%, $0.02 of growth due to acquisitions, $0.02 due to a lower share count and a $0.01 increase due to a lower effective tax rate in the quarter, partially offset by $0.03 impact -- negative $0.03 impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.","Our 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance is $1.110 billion to $1.160 billion and the midpoint of our expense guidance corresponds to a 2% increase from 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses.","The expense guidance does not yet include the impact of our acquisition of Chi-X Canada which we expect to close later in the first quarter of 2015. We also continue to expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 33% to 35% in 2016.","Moving on to the balance sheet, cash flow, and capital, please turn to Slides 11 and 12. We repurchased 67 million in stock during the fourth quarter and through dividends and repurchases returned $526 million in capital to shareholders in 2015, accounting for more than 90% of non-GAAP net income.","Now on to the last thing I wanted to cover in my prepared remarks today. After nearly five years here at NASDAQ and many more serving as an advisor to the Company and to the industry, I\u2019ve decided to retire from my CFO position to accept an invitation to join the Board of a public company which will be announced later today. This is an opportunity for me to bring my experience to the Board level and develop another set of skills.","I\u2019m very grateful to NASDAQ and to both Bob and Adena, in particular, to have the opportunity to serve as its CFO and be a part of its leadership team. And I\u2019m proud of what the Company has accomplished during my time here. I\u2019ve learned a tremendous amount in the role and I\u2019m grateful to all of my colleagues for their support and friendship.","When I arrived I saw an opportunity to build on NASDAQ\u2019s expense discipline with a complimentary capital discipline that has been critical to allocating the substantial cash flow we generate as effectively as possible. This discipline also supported our decision to initiate a regular dividend and significantly grow our payout ratio.","We also streamlined our business line reporting, introduced segment profitability disclosure and initiated an organic growth outlook for our non-transactional segments, underscoring the Company\u2019s confidence and the sustainable growth prospects of these businesses. I believe strongly all of these serve to make clear the quality of NASDAQ\u2019s diverse portfolio.","I feel emphatically that my departure comes at a time when NASDAQ\u2019s financial position and accounting are in outstanding health, in step with the operations of a strong business portfolio. And I\u2019m also confident that strong capital discipline has become embedded at NASDAQ and will be continued to be applied in all uses of capital. And if it isn\u2019t I will be front and center at the next shareholders meeting to hold management accountable.","Ron Hassen, NASDAQ\u2019s Controller for the past 14 years will step into the role of CFO on an interim basis for the second time in his career and I will stay at the Company in March to support Ron and to insure a seamless transition of responsibilities. The Company has commenced a search for a permanent CFO replacement.","I\u2019d also like to say it\u2019s been a truly rewarding experience getting to know the investors and analysts that covered, invested in and followed NASDAQ during my time here. I\u2019ve learned an extraordinary amount from your diverse perspectives, tried to apply it where possible, and look forward to continuing our interaction during my remaining time here. So please don\u2019t take this call as a final good bye.","Thank you for your time and I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld","Thank you, Lee. And I like to say two things. One, professionally the facts speak for themselves. Our stock was at $24.24 when Lee joined here and he has been a key part of the team to get us to where we\u2019re today. So, us and the rest of NASDAQ and the investors on this call, we\u2019re grateful for that service.","And probably more importantly I would like to speak personally for one second and I think Rich Repetto and other analysts might remember back to the [technical difficulty] days, but I first met Lee when he was representing [indiscernible] and I was representing Brut [ph], I think we were both a lot younger back then, Lee. And then certainly when I came to NASDAQ Lee was our trusted advisor and he was the architect of the plan for us to separate from the NASD and become public and start the company we\u2019re today. And all through that time, Lee has a certain unique can-do attitude about himself and its been that spirit that\u2019s made it very enjoyable for us to work with him and certainly his contributions to our firm are permanent, and also the personal relationships we built with him will be something we enjoy for the rest of our days. So Lee, thank you for your service and let\u2019s give him a round of applause.","With that, we will take some very nice questions, right.","Edward P. Ditmire","Operator, if you would please open-up the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Richard Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Richard Repetto","Yes, good morning, Bob. Good morning, Lee and Adena.","Robert Greifeld","How are you doing, Rich?","Richard Repetto","Good, good. First, I do remember, Lee, prior -- even prior to his CFO position. It\u2019s amazing the development and to watch him do the job that he has done. The multiple expansion and stark performance speak for itself. So, congrats, Lee. Anyway, so my first question has to do with the tech solutions, and Lee\u2019s amended pre-tax margin there reached 21%. So I\u2019m trying to see what\u2019s sustainable and trying to maybe get a feel for the contribution that you think might be coming from NASDAQ IR Insight. It seems like you made progress there, but I just want to decipher what\u2019s audit fees and what could be more sustainable?","Robert Greifeld","That\u2019s a detailed question. So Adena once you start, then Lee you can cover some of the details behind those.","Adena Friedman","Sure. So, I think the first thing to recognize, Rick, as you know, is that the technology solutions business has some seasonality to it. So the fourth quarter is always has been and probably will always be the strongest quarter in the year. In the quarter, we did have very strong revenue from our change requests and our technology services business, as well as some new license sales and continued growth in SMART. And now on the corporate solutions side, we continue to have very good cost discipline and we had nice sales as well as people using our services in the fourth quarter where we can recognize revenues. So we definitely did have a strong underlying quarter. But on a full-year basis, you can see that we believe that our margins for that business in 2015 were 16% and we continue to make progress against that the 20% goal for full-year margin. But we still have some work to do and as we go into 2016, we see a few things of particular strength. Number one, we still have not yet recognized revenue from the Borsa Istanbul contract. So that will start to -- we will start to be able to recognize that as we continue to deliver on that contract. We also have continued growth in SMARTS, which will continue to drive on both top line revenue and margin expansion. And then in corporate solutions, the IR Insight rollout have just begun. We launched it two weeks ago. We already have about a 100 clients using the new product. We\u2019ve clients calling us, asking us when they can get it migrated or rolled out. And we\u2019ve a very full schedule in the months to come as we continue to roll out that new service. So we feel very good going into 2016 around the progress there. But we still have work to do to get to that full-year 20% margin goal.","Lee Shavel","And so Rich, first of all thanks for your comment. I don\u2019t really have anything to add to Adena\u2019s comment on the margin. You did ask a question about audit revenue in the period, which relates not to technology solutions, but to the information services business. As we\u2019ve typically disclosed, the audit revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.6 million and that compares to a year-ago where we had a reversal of about $300,000 of audit revenue. So there -- they contributed on a year-over-year basis as you know that audit revenue can be volatile quarter to -- what quarter-to-quarter or so that will give you some basis for comparison. And then on the technology solutions margin, as Adena indicated, I think we\u2019re excited about two things. One, with the IR Insight launch, that clearly enables us to reach the final phase for us in limiting some of the expenses. You\u2019re seeing some of the impact of the investment that we\u2019ve made in the IR Insight platform in our depreciation and amortization. But to the upside will also be driven by success and revenue growth and as I indicted in the comments the net subscription sales and overall new sales of products in the corporate solution sector as a leading indicator and has been very positive and gives us confidence about making that continued progress against the goal in 2016.","Richard Repetto","Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks to the correction there on the audit. I guess, the one follow-up would be for Bob, and on the Chi-X Canada acquisition. I think you said in the past that Canada was somewhat smaller market, its good to hear that the margins are so good at Chi-X Canada. But I\u2019m just trying to see to get a little bit more color on the -- the revenue opportunity and so to the strategy there, Bob. I\u2019d think is it more revenue than say expense story and just a little bit more behind the Chi-X.","Robert Greifeld","Sure. Well, one it\u2019s a classical play in the transaction business where there is an expense story in that there are two platforms, they both have common heritage I have to say. But there are two platforms that now will be consolidated down to one platform. So you\u2019ve benefits there. We certainly also think that the Canadian market has opportunity in equity trading for us to grow both share and I think the market itself has some volume upside to it from where it is today. And we also see opportunities to broaden our franchise in Canada over time. So we start as an equity play, but we certainly will take a long march to broaden that into more of a full exchange type offering.","Richard Repetto","Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, guys. I just had two questions just on the non-transaction parts of the business. I think one is, just on the corporate solutions. It seems like \u201915 was a year of repositioning, it sounds like the platform is in place. We just wanted to get a sense on, what you\u2019re seeing maybe year-over-year on the customer demand on the platform, any other pricing issues. Just trying to get a sense when you think about \u201916, \u201917, where that business is headed?","Bob Greifeld","Yes, I\u2019ll let Adena, answer that question, but let me just start by saying, its exciting with IR Insight, and you have to realize that we started from a clean sheet of paper, and it\u2019s the first time that that\u2019s ever been done. When you look at the current competitors in the space, they have taken other products and repositioned it. So you see a dramatic improvement in the workflow and capabilities that we\u2019re delivering to IR. So proud of the team for having conceived of and developed this thing on schedule, on budget and that was great to have it live. And Adena, will give you some feedback on that.","Adena Friedman","Sure. Mike, in terms of looking at \u201916 and \u201917, I think the fact that we do feel some momentum both in sales and retention coming out of 2015 is a good indicator, so I look at it as the leading indicators into the forward quarters. And also the fact that we have been making investments not only in our IR Insight platform, but also in our PR platforms. So we continue to find opportunities for us to generate more sales opportunities for clients in both of those areas. The other, I think advancement we\u2019re going to make as we go through \u201916 and certainly into \u201917 is starting to integrate our platforms together, in terms of capabilities to our clients. The IR Insight architecture is very flexible and allows us to basically share content across products and start to create more of an integrated experience for our clients. So we do think that, that will continue to drive demand for the services and also the potential for us to up-sell our clients and offering new content and services. So this is the start of, I see it as positive momentum in the business and in terms of having a really flexible and exciting new architecture as well as new capabilities to our customers. So that\u2019s how I would look at 2016 and \u201917, Mike.","Michael Carrier","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just quick follow-up on the index side. It seems like there\u2019s been a lot of growth and I think just even for the overall industry a lot of demand for those types of products. Just when you think about pricing and how that business works; how should we think about like the underlying growth versus weaker markets maybe having a negative impact just because the assets are down. So, I know that\u2019s a bit tough. But just in terms of how the pricing works for that business on the outlook?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well, generally the pricing for an index is contractual. And so when you establish the index ETF, with an ETF provider, you establish what the fee -- what fee the index provider is going to get from that product and that\u2019s generally contractual over several years. So we don\u2019t really have the ability to kind of fluctuate pricing year-over-year, and therefore there is a fair amount of beta that does start to occur once you launch an ETF in terms of the AUM growth, and sometimes some declines based on market performance. Generally speaking what we look at is, obviously we look at AUM, but we also look at TSO which is the total shares outstanding and that\u2019s more an indication or core indication of the demand for the products from investors. So right now we\u2019re seeing our TSO is holding steady as we\u2019ve been dealing with the volatility in the markets. And so for us that means the underlying demand for the products is strong, and its just a matter of riding through some of these beta wins that come when we have market volatility. But the pricing, it tends to be fixed upon launching the product, Mike.","Michael Carrier","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Christopher Harris","Thanks a lot. Your business has clearly changed quite a lot over the last 5 to 10 years, and we actually look back at the prior recession we had here in the U.S. And during that period of time, your non-trading revenues held up remarkably well, but again that business has changed quite a bit. I\u2019m wondering, if you can give us some perspective on, if we go into a pretty severe or a recession scenario in the U.S. how would you expect those businesses to respond?","Robert Greifeld","The first thing I want to say is, on the trading business, its important to recognize and we saw some of this in the fourth quarter and we are experiencing it in the first quarter, our business does well in volatile times. So, when you think about the trading businesses and people are worried about the fact you paid per transaction, it\u2019s a remarkable resilient model. In normal times we do well and in difficult times we tend to do even better, and we experienced that in the first quarter. And as you correctly pointed out, we have 75% of the businesses recurring, and that recurring business tends to hold very steady through thick and thin. Obviously if you get into a prolonged recession then people have a longer time to rethink where they are. But there\u2019s such a big shock absorber in the recurring businesses that we have. Adena, do you want to add to that?","Adena Friedman","No, I think that we -- I think one of the great things about the NASDAQ portfolio of services is that, they -- we have resiliency built into the model. So, we do have the strength of volumes that can come in during volatile times, but of course there\u2019s some little offset in terms of capital raising activity and the fact that we -- probably we will see a slower start to the year, for instance in IPOs. But, so we have kind of these nice resiliency measures in terms of looking at volatility. In terms of our prolonged recession and some of the new businesses, I think that in a prolonged recession we do work with our corporate solutions clients to makes sure we retail them and we may end up having some shorter term discussions with them on pricing, but then longer term we maintain them and they become very, very loyal clients to us. And then on the side of the market technology businesses or long-term contracts, generally fixed price, and we find that that is very resilient through all economic cycles.","Robert Greifeld","We also disagree with the premise that a recession is coming. We think the economy will do just quite well.","Adena Friedman","Yes.","Christopher Harris","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Cram of UBS. Your line is now open.","Alex Cram","Hi, good morning everyone. Good to be back.","Robert Greifeld","Good to have you back.","Lee Shavel","It\u2019s good to have you, Alex.","Alex Cram","I hope lease retirement is not related to me covering the stock?","Robert Greifeld","Lee came in and says Alex is back, I\u2019m out.","Alex Cram","Anyway, I actually just wanted to follow-up on Chris\u2019s question from just now and in terms of the resiliency. So I guess the one question, the first of it is, are you actually, when you have discussion with your clients right now in market -- in the corporate solutions side also in market services, are you feeling any sort of push back, as people saying, like oh, this is crazy right now, leave me alone, I don\u2019t have the sales discussion right now. And then secondly, what areas would you actually -- you mentioned corporate solutions Adena, in terms of pricing, but in terms of your financial services trading customers, do you feel any sort of potential for a slowdown?","Robert Greifeld","But let me give the broad theme here. One, we identify ourselves as a technology company. We have development muscle that many if not all of our competitors cannot match. And we\u2019re in the business of coming up with innovative product. Innovative product tends to be relatively immune to what we\u2019re getting at with cycles, up or down. And Adena, referenced that in her comments where people are calling us up wanting to get on the delivery queue for the new product. So we certainly operate here saying, if we come up with an exciting product for our customers that they need that we\u2019ll do well independent of a given cycle at a point in time.","Adena Friedman","I also would point out, Alex we have almost 10,000 corporate clients worldwide. So it\u2019s a very global business, and so every different sector that we represent it goes through cycles. But the fact of the matter is, it\u2019s an incredibly broad base of clients and there are always clients who are growing, always. And so I think that, I think that we find that with a really great product set and a great set of capabilities, coupled with our team of experts in the advisory business and the ability for us to truly partner with them, we find that we do quite well across the business and we feel very good about it. I think that with market tech, I think that it\u2019s again a partnership -- it\u2019s a partnership construct honestly with all of our clients, and they continue to have needs to manage their volumes and to deal with new regulatory changes and to deal with new opportunities in their markets. And for those reasons we continue to do quite well in having very strong conversations with our clients.","Robert Greifeld","And I\u2019d just add something briefly here, Alex, its something that we experienced, particularly in the corporate solutions products, as technology products they help us operate more efficiently and that type of leverage when a company is under pressure from an expense standpoint is very valuable. And so we think that\u2019s part of what contributes to the resilience of that particular revenue stream.","Adena Friedman","I totally agree.","Alex Cram","Great. Thank you. And then, just secondly, just quickly on capital returns, I don\u2019t think that was brought up yet. But last year, I think you were opportunistic in the third quarter buying back a lot. So far this year\u2019s markets have been choppy, but your stock has actually been a big out-performer. So just wondering, if you think about 2016, is a steady buyback expected or do you think there is opportunities to be a little bit more opportunistic here and there?","Robert Greifeld","I would say this, we are certainly opportunistic, but that\u2019s on a foundation of being steady, if that makes any sense to you. So we have a desire to be steady, but we\u2019ll certainly lighten up when we think marketing additions warranted and get aggressive when it\u2019s favorable.","Alex Cram","All right. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alex Blostein","Hi, guys, good morning.","Robert Greifeld","How are you doing, Alex?","Alex Blostein","Very good, thanks. So a question for you on NFX. You highlighted pretty robust momentum out of the gate. Just curious if you can give us any break down between sell-side participation versus buy-side participation, any revenue figures you guys can point to and, I guess, more importantly, how much either in revenue or volumes you guys expect to do there to break profitability?","Robert Greifeld","Yes. So I would say, first thing is we always judge our effectiveness first before we get to efficiency. So what that means here is we are certainly looking at non-financial metrics, and I think you got touched on a few of them. So I pay paid close attention to the number of participants that come in on a daily basis. So we were in the 20s through most of last year getting to the high 20s, now we\u2019re getting to the high 30s of number of daily participants, that\u2019s good. So we\u2019re spreading through the community. We look for our progress in particular instruments. We look obviously at the overall scheme but we\u2019re trying to focus on a couple of different instruments most notably nat gas options and to have double digit market share in that space, so we focused on that. We also look at the total number of contracts we trade. We look at the breakdown between trade reporting and central limit order book trading that\u2019s done. And then last and probably most important is the open interest as I referred to, in my comment we had over half a million contracts of open interest which is well beyond what we thought we\u2019d be at, at this stage of time. So increasing engagement from the community, increasing participation and we\u2019re hitting all the metrics we need. With respect to a direct answer to your question, I think the financial metrics come to play in and around mid year going to the second half of this year, but right now we\u2019d like to get to a higher average daily contract rate and obviously increase our market share in certain targeted products, but so far so good.","Alex Blostein","Got it. And just a follow-up question for you guys around corporate solutions and that segment as a whole. The path to 20% that Adena and Lee, you guys mentioned, is that going to be a function at least in 2016 of expectation for revenue growth or some of the expenses kind of falling off as you migrate people from one platform to another, just kind of trying to think through the moving pieces of getting to that 20%?","Lee Shavel","Alex, it\u2019s really both. I think that, what we see -- we see margin upside both from continued elimination of some redundant expenses as well as revenue growth in the business as a whole with higher margin. So we\u2019ll take it any which way we can, but I think both will be contributors here.","Alex Blostein","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Hill of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Kenneth Hill","Hi, good morning everyone.","Robert Greifeld","How are doing, Ken?","Kenneth Hill","Doing really well. Thanks. I had a question on SMARTS, so that continues to be a nice business for you guys and it seems like you can grow that business from a few different angles. So I know you mentioned, you\u2019ve got some new customers signing up like the Nigerian stock exchange, you\u2019ve got some opportunity in China. And then I think also at the end of the year you had exchanges like the Abu Dhabi exchange which upgraded their technology. So as you kind of look at the different pieces there between new customers and customers who are going to potentially upgrade. Could you maybe size those type of markets and maybe talk about maybe what inning you\u2019re in for each one?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Thanks for the question. So the first thing I would say is SMARTS has really three different markets that we\u2019re trying to serve at this point. We have the exchanges which was the original business for SMARTS, and it\u2019s the longest standing business. It\u2019s a deployed solution out to the clients. We have been selling to exchanges for many years as well as to regulators. I should say exchanges and regulators. And that continues as you can tell to grow in terms of new exchanges taking our solution like Nigerian stock exchange most recently. But that\u2019s a longer sales cycle, obviously there\u2019s a finite number of exchanges, but we continue to find real success there, and that\u2019s a more mature part of our business. The broker dealer community is the second community that we\u2019ve sold to and that\u2019s a newer part of our business, but definitely the fastest growing. We actually surpassed 1000 users this year and we were just thrilled with that. We, in fact, send him a small gift. And then [indiscernible] client. And I think that its really exciting to see continued double digit growth in that part of the business as we continue to find striking demand for trade surveillance solutions across the broker dealer community. In the year, over the last two years we have made it so it\u2019s multi-asset class and it\u2019s every geography. So it really can serve any and all trading firms in the world. The third community is the buy side community. And for the first time this year we do have three buy side clients who have signed up for the service and we\u2019ve chosen to invest through our R&D program to build out more fulsome buy side solution for the trade surveillance. So buy side firms, both hedge funds and traditionals are really becoming much more sophisticated in their trading operations and they realize now that they need sophisticated tools to couple with the sophistication of their trading strategy. So we believe that that will be a new area to increased demand for us for the SMARTS service. We also were looking at how we can integrate more machine intelligence into the solution and we have been discussing how to integrate even more intelligence to make it more useful across the platform in terms of compliance and trade supervision. So that\u2019s a quick synopsis of the SMARTS business, but it really is a great business for us.","Kenneth Hill","Great. I appreciate all the color there. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt of KBW. Your line is now open.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning.","Robert Greifeld","How are you doing?","Kyle Voigt","I just wanted to ask a question on the regulatory environment in the U.S. I guess recently there\u2019s been much more focus on equity market structure in the U.S. given all the comment letters and press around the IEX exchange application. I guess I\u2019m just wondering, your conversations with the SEC is all this attention by some of the largest market participants and equities kind of pushing them any closer to actually undertaking this holistic market structure review?","Robert Greifeld","That\u2019s a difficult question for me to answer, directly you\u2019d have to talk to them. But I\u2019ll just make one comment on the topic. Certainly we think it is time for a redo of Reg NMS and I also think Reg NMS deserves some credit. In that we had a duopoly kind of situation before Reg NMS came along, and we\u2019ve seen a dramatic decline in spreads and effective transaction cost in the market. So it served the purpose for a long period of time, but we certainly think refinement is in order. With respect to IEX our position is it\u2019s thoughtful, it could be innovative and it\u2019s very similar to what we had suggested to the Commission back in 2012. They told us it was not in either the letter or the spirit of Reg NMS and said we could not do it. So our position with IEX is that, you really should be after there is a rethink of Reg NMS and how do we get the new market structure in place and let innovation develop under the new set of rules and not patchwork and try to get exceptions under the existing rules that exist.","Kyle Voigt","All right. Thanks for the color. And then I guess my follow-up is the big question -- a big picture question around blockchain. So you certainly seem to be one of the leaders in terms of adoption and development in the financial services sector. But I guess the first part of my question is, do you think -- ever think that blockchain technology will ever be adopted in public cash equities trading in the U.S? And then, secondly, maybe you could give us some of your thoughts around, what other areas in financial services you see the biggest opportunities for adoption of blockchain maybe over the next two to three years? Thanks.","Robert Greifeld","Yes. So I would say, yes we certainly see blockchain adoption coming in public market equities, but we\u2019ll not predict when. Certainly that will take a village to get there and to move from a legacy infrastructure that is ingrained in everybody\u2019s infrastructure is not an easy thing to do. So we\u2019ll be involved with those conversations and an active participant, but when you think of NASDAQ and blockchain you have to think of us being focused on what's the art of the doable, what's pragmatic and what's possible. So obviously with NASDAQ private market it\u2019s the beginning of time, so we\u2019re able to create the experience we wanted. We\u2019re looking for similar type opportunities. We want to have use cases where you can deliver and get paid for and bring real value today. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re committed to proxy voting. In Estonia, they have a rule set that will allow us to do that. We have about three other use cases which we\u2019ll not announce today, but a very close to being funded. And those use cases will have a common theme that they\u2019ll be doable, we can deliver it, and deliver real value and not get wrapped up in the allure of blockchain\u2019s technology, but focus on blockchain to enable real products that customers want to pay us for.","Kyle Voigt","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Vincent Hung","Hi, good morning.","Lee Shavel","Hi, Vincent.","Robert Greifeld","How are you doing?","Vincent Hung","So, on market technology again, this time on change requests, how much of an impact did change requests have on revenue? What's the typical impact from change requests, and what typically drives change requests?","Adena Friedman","While Lee looks at the exact impact, I\u2019ll answer the second part of the question. So as we work with a very broad set of clients, that we\u2019ve over 70 market places around the world that will leverage our technology. They have things that they want to do to enhance that technology over time. And so it maybe a new feature, a new product or asset class that they want to bring into their market place and maybe speed that they want to continue to enhance their speed or they enhance their volumes, and then maybe regulatory changes that they have to make to be able to manage through the regulatory environment that they\u2019re facing. And in all of those cases, that would be a change to the original scope of what we built for them and therefore they come to us and they ask us to size out and work through enhancements and change requests associated with the technology. In general, I always think of it as, in general, somewhere in the range of a $20 million annual revenue stream to us, but it can fluctuate year-over-year. And so I\u2019m going to, I will turn it over to Lee to answer the specific question.","Lee Shavel","Yes. So, Vincent the change request variance from the prior year was on a year-over-year basis the increase in change request was $5 million. So that gives you some context now. Also keep in mind that that\u2019s on a -- that\u2019s a reported basis and so a portion of that revenue is going to be subject to the FX impact that we have. So I\u2019d estimate it\u2019s probably proportionately and probably the $3 million to $4 million of an organic impact relative to market technology revenue as a whole.","Vincent Hung","Okay, great. And last one for me; could you just give us any color around new product developments in the data products business?","Adena Friedman","Sure. So, in the information services business, as you know, we operate two sub-businesses, the index business and the data products business. And we look at product development across both of those areas. So clearly in the index space we worked very closely with ETF partners to launch new products that they believe will have investor demand around thematic indexes and we can do that now with the AlphaDEX index family, with First Trust, we can do that with our dividend achievers index family, our buyback index family and Dorsey Wright index family. And so we have a broad range of strategies that we can deploy through new products and we do that on a regular basis. With regard to data products, we have been -- we do a lot of work with our clients to look at new ways that we can either present our data, provide new technologies around our data like FPGA technology to deliver some of the data that we already have, and then we have been working closely with clients to start to get their demand and their interest in some new data analytics and again the use of machine intelligence to help fuel some of those products. But it\u2019s early days and we\u2019re still in the research phase for that.","Vincent Hung","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Brian Bedell","Good morning and thanks, folks.","Robert Greifeld","How are you doing, Brian?","Brian Bedell","Good. How are you?","Brian Bedell","My congrats to Lee, also. It\u2019s been great working with you. Most of my questions have been asked actually, just one, maybe, and that would be on the revenue momentum in the technology solutions segment. Given the momentum of the new IR product, and also layering in Istanbul, and as you see that trajectory going out in 2016 and into 2017, and Bob as you commented the cross-sell seems to be picking up momentum, as well, do you feel like the mid single-digit revenue growth rate in that segment could be higher, high single digits, in both \u201916 and \u201917?","Robert Greifeld","I would say it\u2019s too early to change that target. As Adena referenced, the product is new and we\u2019re so excited that it rolled out and we\u2019re gaining experience by the day, and in the quarters to come we\u2019ll have a better sense of that.","Brian Bedell","Okay, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Robert Greifeld","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Bond of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Andrew Bond","Thank you, good morning.","Robert Greifeld","How are you doing, Andrew?","Andrew Bond","I\u2019m doing well, thanks. A question on the future initiative. NFX appears to be progressing nicely. I just want to talk about NLX and share gains have been somewhat more elusive there, as obviously it's a pretty tough market to break into and win share. So, just from your point of view, what kind of progress are we making here, and what are the plans moving forward to continue with the business?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, so with respect to NLX we are continuing to have what I call intensive dialogue with our customers. The focus now is with respect to the open interest realizing that\u2019s an enduring value. There remains in that community a strong desire for a credible alternative. We have been successful in running the enterprise at, I think, a hyper efficient level. So it allows us to have betting strip on the table without us impacting the mother ship in some material way. So Hans-Ole was just there last week, I was there a few weeks ago. Community\u2019s engaged and we have some pretty exciting plans in place and we\u2019ll see how they play out later in the quarter. Hans-Ole, you want to add anything?","Hans-Ole Jochumsen","We could add that, but we believe is very important is a question about moving open interest and we have an approval for a scheme for that approved by the U.K. authorities and now we are working with customers to making that real. And I would say that, I made a couple of that, that very big players in discerning products and they are very keen that something is going to happen in this field soon. And the reason for that is pretty obviously for me. What they have in their mind is only one thing, how can they reduce the capital cost of the bank. And the way to do that is to clear more products in the same clearinghouse, in this case [indiscernible] clearinghouse, because thereby they can reduce the cost of clearing and thereby the capital cost.","Robert Greifeld","And for the record, scheme is a defining term in the U.K. and it doesn\u2019t have the connotations it has in the U.S. just a pricing plan.","Hans-Ole Jochumsen","An improved one.","Robert Greifeld","Improved one.","Andrew Bond","Great. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Kenneth Worthington","Hi, thank you. Just on the legacy eSpeed business, volumes down a lot; looks like industry volumes are weak. Are you also losing share? Maybe talk about what\u2019s happening here, how broker tech is reacting to you as a competitor, and how the strategy is evolving? Thanks.","Robert Greifeld","Yes. So, I would say there\u2019s one, the treasury market is undergoing some fundamental rethink. And the market is not just us and broker tech. There are other competitive forces in play. That being said, I think we\u2019ve seen on the positive side some marginal increase in activity based upon the rate movement. We have seen some increased take up of eSpeed Elect where we have more participants coming on pretty much every week or so. So, that\u2019s on the good side. But I think on a relative basis, even though there are competitors, I think relative to broker tech we\u2019re still share challenged and have -- obviously our efforts have to become more effective in that regard, and we are working hard at it.","Kenneth Worthington","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Rutschow of CLSA. Your line is now open.","Robert Rutschow","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Adena Friedman","Good morning.","Robert Greifeld","How are you doing?","Robert Rutschow","Good. I wanted to wish Lee, good luck. And a quick question on market technology. Do you expect that Borsa Istanbul, that you will complete Phase 2 in 2016, and if so, is that included in any of the expense guidance?","Adena Friedman","We basically are continuing to work towards a full solution offering that will continue to allow -- it will, actually will turn on the GAAP reporting of the contract. We are not giving any sort of estimates right now on time and we are working with the client. So I can\u2019t give you a direct answer to that question at this point, because we continue to work through the development and the acceptance by the client. But as we get closer, we will certainly make sure that you stay informed.","Robert Rutschow","Okay. And then, one on corporate solutions. Can you talk about how many customers will go from sort of free trial users to paying this year? And of the ones that have done that, what are the products that they\u2019re most interested in paying for?","Adena Friedman","Okay, yes. So to just to clarify for everyone, the way that the question really relates to IPOs that we have come on to NASDAQ, and we basically for the period or switches, and for a multi-year period they\u2019re able to take the services for free, and then we turn them into paying clients as they choose to -- to continue to take those services over time. And with those, we have had a strong IPO environment in 2014 and 2015. But if you really look at it, the clients who are rolling off are clients that went public in 2012 and 2013, and we do have strong success in converting them into paying clients. But I think that, we also have these two years where we are offering a fair amount of free services to a lot of new clients. And therefore, the way that we manage that internally is that the listing business does pay the corporate solutions business some piece of that costs to be able to offer those out to their clients. So, really, those free clients are being partially paid for by listings, and that\u2019s reflected in our segment results.","Robert Greifeld","But the 10,000 customers are not getting a free trial of IR Insight.","Adena Friedman","No, there\u2019s no free trials going on, on IR Insight part of phase right.","Robert Greifeld","If that was your question.","Robert Rutschow","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Hi, good morning, guys.","Robert Greifeld","How are you doing?","Lee Shavel","Hi, Patrick.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Good. A question for you on, how do you think about the barriers to entry for your listings franchise? BATS is talking about maybe trying to go again IPO -- IPO on their own exchange. IEX is talking about starting a listings franchise. So, how comfortable do you feel that your franchise is going to stack up pretty well against those new alternatives?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I think we feel incredibly comfortable. One, you have to realize that when you go public it\u2019s an event to raise your profile, I mean, you want to get publicity associated with it, and the companies want publicity associated with a brand that they know and like. So, there is a very large brand barrier to the IPO pipeline. And obviously we\u2019ve seen others try to build an IPO franchise with very limited success in the past. But, in addition, I think under Adena\u2019s leadership we\u2019ve done a lot to actually put hard products into our listing. So when you think about our corporate solutions product, which we talked about today, and talked about on the last question, that\u2019s a whole range of services that we uniquely can offer, and that is a large barrier to entry. When you think about the technology we bring to bear on the IPO across at this point in time, again a big barrier to entry. So it\u2019s our job to always be paranoid, but with respect to the different businesses we have, the IPO business has a large and I think protectable mode [ph].","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Great. Thank you.","Robert Greifeld","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back to Mr. Bob Greifeld for any closing remarks.","Robert Greifeld","Thank you. I thank you, everybody for your time today. Certainly it was another record quarter based on a record year. We are executing very well across our different businesses. And as I said in my prepared comments, I judge our businesses on how we are stacking up relative to the competition, and how we\u2019re doing relative to serving our customer needs. These measures can be different than financial measures and they\u2019re over time the more important measures. And I\u2019m happy to report to our investors that across the vast majority of our businesses, we\u2019re more competitive than we were a year-ago. And we are serving our customer needs better than we\u2019ve been in any time in the past, and that will certainly portend well for financial results going forward. So I look forward to getting back with you again in the quarter and taking your calls and meetings during the quarter. And again, Lee, thank you for your personal relationship with us and your professionalism. So, thank you.","Lee Shavel","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ed Ditmire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Edward Ditmire","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results. On the line are: Adena Friedman, our CEO; Michael Ptasznik, our CFO; Ed Knight, our General Counsel; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A.","The press release and presentation are on our website.

Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Adena.","Adena Friedman","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's strong 2018 financial and business performance, review the progress that we have made to drive forward our new strategic direction. We'll discuss how Nasdaq is addressing important issues in our foundational marketplace businesses, and lastly, detail our execution priorities for 2019.","Turning to our results, I'm incredibly pleased to report that Nasdaq's strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2018. 2018 was a critical year for Nasdaq as we pursued a new chapter for the company that was guided by our strategic pivot to maximize our opportunities as a technology and analytics provider, while we sustain and grow our core marketplace businesses.","The good news is that the strong results we delivered in 2018 confirm our renewed vision and how we can execute on it successfully and I will go into that in a little more detail. Our annual revenue growth materially improved in 2018 as we delivered solid full year organic revenue growth of 8% across our businesses up from 2% in 2017.","This was driven by our current segments all contributing at or above their respective medium-term growth outlook ranges, while our Market Services business delivered its best performance in 7 years, achieving organic revenue growth of 9% for the full year.","Focusing in on the fourth quarter of 2018, we delivered strong financial results across our businesses, especially strong Information Services and Market Services performance contributed to total company top-line organic revenue growth of 11%, while operating leverage delivered 3 percentage points of operating margin expansion over the prior-year quarter.","Non-GAAP EPS of $1.26 increased 21% year-over-year. While I'm incredibly proud of the company for executing well in 2018, as I said before, I'm most excited about the encouraging early proof-points it provides to confirm that we're on the right track as we continue along our strategic direction in 2019 and beyond.","Turning to the specific highlights from our businesses throughout the year, and more specifically, in the fourth quarter and starting with Market Technology, that segment delivered 10% organic growth in 2019 within its medium-term organic growth outlook as it progressed with the transformational implementation of the Nasdaq Financial Framework platform.","Total order intake in 2018 was $223 million, including $74 million in the fourth quarter and an unusually strong mix of new clients in addition to renewals should make this critically impactful in future periods. Specifically, we signed 12 new market infrastructure operator clients in 2018 up from 6 new clients in 2017. And we signed 20 new buy-side and sell-side clients for our RegTech surveillance solutions, up from 12 in 2017.","In our Information Services segment, strong organic growth of 11% in 2018 [delivers a] [ph] moderate steady growth in market data, while our Index licensing segment put in an especially strong year with 20% organic revenue growth.","eVestment, which makes up most of the Investment Analytics segment revenue only began being included in our official organic calculation in mid-October when it passed its 1-year anniversary from close. And nonetheless, it continued growing at the double-digit rates we expect.","Starting with our Index business, full year 2018 revenues increased 20%, due principally to higher average AUMs which were 27% higher for the year on average as well as record volumes in Nasdaq-licensed futures contracts, which were 76% higher than the prior year. The fourth quarter did see declines in AUM levels due to the market pullback declines that were more profound at the end of the year value than the daily average in the period.","But the year-over-year quarter comparison still show a 3% increase in AUM in licensed ETPs at the end of Q4, well above the Nasdaq 100 and S&P declines of 3% and 4% respectively in the same timeframe.","In Investment Data and Analytics, we saw continued strong momentum at eVestment in 2018, the first full year as part of Nasdaq. eVestment's double-digit revenue growth is driven both by bringing new clients on to the platform, particularly in international markets, as well as expanding how we serve our existing clients, through up-selling to more sophisticated analytic modules, as well as broadening how many people at a client use the solution.","While Information Services' organic momentum was excellent in 2018, starting in the fourth - I'm sorry - during the fourth quarter, we also completed the acquisition of Quandl, a Toronto based provider of alternative and core data to more than 30,000 active users. This investment was made to better position us in the evolving alternative data space, where we combine Quandl with our Analytics Hub business. We will bring a very strong value proposition to a market of increasingly technology enabled buy-side investment professionals.","Moving to our foundational marketplace businesses, our Corporate Services segment delivered 5% organic growth in 2018 with a particularly strong performance by our listings business. For the 6th consecutive year, Nasdaq-led U.S. IPOs - U.S. exchanges for IPOs in 2018 was a 72% U.S. win-rate for the year, welcoming 186 IPOs. Despite the volatility in the fourth quarter of 2018, we welcomed 41 IPOs in the quarter and achieved a 73% win-rate during the period.","Meanwhile, our Nordic markets continue to attract new companies from across Europe. Our Nordic, Baltic and First North exchanges added 73 new listings in 2018 and expanded above the 1,000 company listing count for the first time. We also made important changes in 2018 within Corporate Services. As we work to complete the divestiture of certain businesses, we tightly focused our offering on to providing strategic C-suite and board-level solutions, and then integrated our Listings and Corporate Solutions client teams.","We now look forward to leveraging these enhancements to deepen our relationships with our Corporate Solutions clients in 2019. Finally, our Market Services business delivered very strong net revenue growth in 2018 with 9% organic growth across the year, helping drive to a record $958 million in annual net revenue.","In the fourth quarter in particular, our equities and options markets experienced a significant uptick in volume due to market volatility, helping to drive a 12% year-over-year increase in Market Services net revenues for the period. I'm pleased to report that Nasdaq exchange platform handled incredibly busy volume days, including a peak of 28 billion messages across our U.S. equities and options markets on December 27 with no significant degradation of our latency or performance.","I'd now like to talk about where we stand in implementing and executing our strategic direction. A key pillar of our renewed strategy, specifically our pivot to maximize our potential as a technology and analytics providers, provides continued change in evolution to our organization. We continue to invest capital deliberately to add capabilities and scale to our technology and analytics growth platforms.","Our investments include our organic initiatives, notably the Nasdaq Financial Framework and related initiatives to deliver our marketplace expertise to banks, brokers and market operators outside the financial industry, as well as to provide compliance capabilities to the buy-side and our eVestment Private Markets solutions initiative.","It also includes the recent acquisitions of Cinnober and Quandl with a material portion of that investment capital coming from the divesture of our stake in LCH Group, which had become over time a financial rather than a strategic holding.","The other pillar of our strategic evolution is our continued investment in unwavering commitment to sustain our marketplace core. These foundational businesses, comprising the Market Services and Corporate Services segment have earned Nasdaq a strategic position at the center of the capital markets in the U.S. and in Europe.","We've been able to create strategic relationships across broker\/dealers, investment professionals, corporate clients and other global market centers, which then provides the potential to expand those relationships with our technology and analytics capabilities.","The marketplaces also provide consistent profitability and cash flow to support both investments across the franchise and capital returns to shareholders. Consistent with our commitment to our core markets in Europe, we've announced this morning that we are making an offer to the Oslo B\u00f8rs VPS shareholders for a proposed transaction that would combine Norway's leading exchange and central securities depository with our Nasdaq Nordic marketplace business.","We put a specific presentation regarding this offer and the proposed combination on the Nasdaq IR website today. And I suggest listeners review it for more details. Oslo B\u00f8rs has been performing well in recent periods with a 5% revenue CAGR over the last 3 years and operating margins in the low 40% range. But together, we think that we can open significant new opportunities for efficiency and growth. In particular, we will use Nasdaq's technology to create a common Nordic exchange platform delivering significant efficiencies to market participants already using our systems in the other Nordic markets.","We also expect to deliver efficiencies and certain exchange and corporate functions across our businesses. We are excited to benefit from Oslo B\u00f8rs' expertise in post-trade CSD capabilities as they are the national CSD operator in Norway. We also believe we can leverage Oslo B\u00f8rs global leadership in shipping, energy and seafood to open up new markets through our more global franchise and client base.","Oslo B\u00f8rs' fit within our Nordic franchise as unique, and our clients have been enthusiastic about this opportunity. As we consider the acquisition within our strategic priorities, we also see a strong fit in advancing our strategic pivot. We're very obviously expanding our technology and analytics capabilities and scale to the benefit of the company's overall growth profile. But we're also making concerted sustaining investments in our marketplaces to ensure we continue our strong competitive position and our respected geographic and product areas.","We are also focus on delivering for our shareholders. With the Oslo B\u00f8rs VPS combination, we don't expect to material shift in our revenue mix. Our organic growth target for the non-transactional segments are unchanged and we expect to generate in ROIC add or above 10% within 3 to 5 years and we expect non-GAAP EPS accretion within 12 months of closing.","Now let me address our path to close the transaction in the context of a competing approach by Euronext. Nasdaq's offer is superior to Euronext both financially, but more importantly it is also in its ability to support and grow the Nordic capital markets for its many stakeholders. Because of this, we've earned the unanimous support of the Oslo B\u00f8rs VPS board and we have irrevocables from key investors constituting over 35% of Oslo's ownership.","Lastly, because Oslo B\u00f8rs VPS's critical importance to the Norwegian capital markets and economy, the Norwegian stakeholders, including regulators will carefully consider all options, when determining Oslo B\u00f8rs VPS's strongest path forward and we look forward to engaging with them.","Now turning back to the current operations of our core businesses, we are continuing our focus on some challenges and issues that are worth of mention. In terms of the Nordic's commodity CCP default event, we've made considerable progress over the last quarter. We developed a comprehensive plan to enhance and improve our clearinghouse throughout 2019 that we have vetted with the clearinghouse risk committees and board, and then communicated in detail with to our clients.","We are underway with our key improvement areas including enhancements to the member of requirements to initial margin, the member default fund and the default resolution proceedings - procedures. We also developed a voluntary capital release program for our clearing members, providing them the opportunity to opt-in to receive their pro rata share of \u20ac20 million pool of capital to supplement that recoveries they expect to receive from the liquidation of the defaulting members' assets.","Turning now to the regulatory landscape for U.S. equities and specifically related to U.S. equity data products. As I've mentioned in our last call, this has been a winding and largely court-litigated debate between banks and brokers and the exchanges over exchange data products and services that we feel have been an important contributor to how the U.S. Stock Markets deliver the highest levels of global standards in terms of efficiency, transparency and resiliency.","We believe this debate and related litigation will continue from many years to come. Last quarter, we discussed the SEC's October decision to overturn their own administrative law judge decision affirming Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange's depth of book pricing filings and their directive to remand 400 SEC-approved exchange pricing filings back to the exchanges for a re-review.","Nasdaq appealed the remand order to the D.C. circuit court of appeals, where we'd expect hearings to occur sometime late in 2019. Separately, the SEC was asked to reconsider the remand order, and in response, decided to stop the clock on its proposed six month timeframe for exchanges to design a review procedure for the remanded filings. The SEC has not yet restarted the clock.","As we manage our business going forward, we continue to expect to deliver on our information services organic revenue growth, which has predominately driven by expansion of our market data in new geographies as well as specific initiatives in our unregulated Index, licensing and investment analytics businesses.","Lastly, regarding reports of a new competitive entrant to the U.S. equities exchange landscape, we certainly can't be surprised by continuation of what has been for over 15 years, a hyper competitive landscape in the U.S. Securities markets. Over the last decade and a half, Nasdaq and the other exchange groups have made significant improvements to create a highly efficient resilient low cost trading environment for all market participants.","As this is at least the sixth time that our trading clients have attempted to introduce a new exchange competitor, we are fully prepared to meet such an important, and albeit challenge if and when it receives SEC approval and launches.","For your reference on January 7, we posted a presentation on our IR website where we addressed our strong competitive positioning and track record of delivering across increasingly fragmented markets, often in competition with venues backed by important customers, along with other important regulatory and other complexities of the modern U.S. equity market structure.","So now let's turn to looking forward, as we begin 2019, and we've developed the following specific execution priorities for the year. First, we want to focus on enhancing our technology presence across the capital markets and beyond, where we intend to measure - which we intend to measure principally through the implementation and client adoption of the Nasdaq Financial Framework based technology solutions. At the same time internally, we also intend to continue our adoption of NFF in Nasdaq's own marketplaces.","Second, we intend to drive better client interactions in the capital markets with data, analytics and integrity tools. Success here will be measured through our sales and growth progress with our trade surveillance, data analytics and governance solutions across our sell-side, buy-side and corporate clients.","Third, we want to continue to enhance our leadership position in the marketplaces, in which we operate as we continue to innovate with new functionality and strong market share in our core markets.","And lastly, we want to build meaningfully on our high integrity machine driven culture to multiply our opportunities to innovate and to grow. I look forward to updating you on our progress on these goals as the year progresses.","As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that the fourth quarter pretty strong results for Nasdaq particularly regarding our organic revenue growth, completing a successful 2018 that provided encouraging early data points as we begin executing along our new strategic direction as well as affirming the strength of our franchise in an evolving capital markets landscape.","Moving forward as we begin 2019, we remain relentlessly focused on advancing our strategic pivot to maximize opportunities as a technology and analytics provider with the continued strong demand for our Market Technology solutions and our data and analytics offerings, even as we continue to invest and sustain the highest possible effectiveness in our foundational marketplace businesses in the U.S. and Europe.","We are very pleased to announce our offer to acquire Oslo B\u00f8rs VPS and look forward to strengthening our European markets business with Norwegian equities market, its unique CSD capabilities and its expertise in energy and seafood sector.","The external environment we are operating at is characterized by significant opportunities including strong market volume environment but is also its share regulatory challenges that we will continue to address effectively. And with early and encouraging results of our strategic pivot in 2018, I remain confident that we're moving in the right direction that we have every opportunity and the ability to execute against the sizeable opportunities that the organization identified in our long-term strategic review.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Michael to review the financial detail.","Michael Ptasznik","Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing fourth quarter revenue performance as shown on page 3 of the presentation and organic growth on Pages 4 and 14.","The $15 million increase in reported net revenue of $645 million consisted of: organic growth of $67 million, including 10% organic growth in the non-trading segments, and 14% organic growth in Market Services; a $6 million positive impact from the inclusion of revenues from the acquisition of eVestment; a $50 million negative impact from the divestiture of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses: and a $8 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.","I will now review quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments. I will start with Information Services, which as reflected on pages 5 and 14, saw a $31 million or 20% increase in revenue consisting of $26 million or 17% organic growth. Index revenues were up 17% in the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to higher average assets under management in exchange traded products linked to Nasdaq indexes and higher licensing revenue from futures trading related to the Nasdaq 100 Index. During the period, a record $45 million futures contracts traded tied to the proprietary Nasdaq 100 Index, an increase of 137% versus the fourth quarter of 2017.","Market Data revenues increased 4%, primarily due to growth in our share of U.S. tape plans, and revenues from sales of data subscriptions in Asian and European data products.","Investment Data and Analytics revenues increased $19 million due to a positive $10 million impact from a lower purchase price adjustment on eVestment deferred revenue, a $6 million impact from the acquisition of eVestment completed in October 2017 and organic growth in eVestment. For the full year 2018, information and services organic revenue growth totaled 11%.","Market Technology revenue as shown on Pages 6 and 14 increased $5 million or 7%, while organic growth was slightly higher at $6 million or 8%. The increase primarily reflects higher software delivery and support revenues and higher software as a service revenues, partially offset by lower change requests and advisory revenues. For the full year 2018, Market Technology organic revenue growth totaled 10%.","In 2018, the operating margin for Market Technology totaled 13%, down 10 percentage points from the prior year. As we previously communicated in 2018 to 2019 period includes elevated investments spend to implement the Nasdaq Financial Framework and advance towards a managed solution model.","2019 margins will continue to be temporarily impacted by both the ongoing NFF implementation as well as the early stages of the Cinnober acquisition and integration. We do expect margin expansion in 2020 and beyond, as we progress the NFF development, expand customer adoption of the more scalable service model and benefit from the scale and synergies of a fully integrated Cinnober.","Turning to Corporate Services on Pages 7 and 14, revenues increased $2 million or 2%. The increases in our Listing segment, where revenues were up $4 million or 6%, primarily due to higher U.S. listings revenue from the all-inclusive offering becoming effective for all U.S. issuers on January 1, 2018, and increase in the number and size of IPOs partially offset by the run-off of fees earned from listing of additional shares.","The Corporate Services operating margin was 29% versus 32% in the prior year period. The decrease primarily reflects the residual expenses related to the divestiture, which we believe we have now eliminated as we begin Q1 2019.","Market Services' net revenues on Pages 8 and 14 saw a $27 million or 12% increase including a $31 million or 14% organic increase and a $4 million negative impact from changes in foreign exchange. The organic increase was due to higher revenues in U.S. options, U.S. equities and European equities, partially offset by a decline in fixed income and commodities revenues. Market Services operating income margin totaled 57%, up 2 percentage points from the prior year period. For the full year 2018, Market Services organic revenue growth totaled 9%.","Turning to Pages 9 and 14 to review expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased $9 million to $330 million with a $25 million organic increase offset by $27 million decrease from the net impact of the divestiture of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses and the impact of the acquisition of eVestment and a $7 million favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.","On an organic basis, expenses increased 6% during 2018. As a reminder, we expect that during periods of higher revenue growth, such as the 8% organic revenue growth we've experienced 2018, the company's organic expense will likely be above our longer-term 3% expectation in those periods.","Turning to Slide 10. We are introducing 2019 non-GAAP operating expense guidance range of $1.325 billion to $1.375 billion, which includes our projection of the full year costs related to the acquisitions of Quandl and Cinnober, the latter which closed in mid-January.","Adjusting for the expected impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FX changes, the midpoint of the 2019 expense range, it represents an approximate 3% organic increase year-over-year. Regarding the potential acquisition of Oslo B\u00f8rs, we will update our guidance once the transition is successfully closed.","Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the non-GAAP operating margin totaled 49%, up 3 percentage points from the prior year period.","Net interest expense was $35 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $1 million versus the prior year period, primarily due to higher interest rates on floating rate debt.","The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 26%. On a GAAP basis, we recognized $289 million non-cash tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2018, as we finalize the provisional tax impact related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was previously recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.","For 2019, non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be between 25% and 27%. In addition to the non-cash tax charge which impacted GAAP results in the fourth quarter of 2018, we're also reserving $23 million in relation to Nordic CCP's capital relief program, which Adena touched on in her commentary.","Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $211 million or $1.26 per diluted share compared to $177 million or $1.04 per diluted share in the prior year period.","Turning to capital on Slide 11, debt decreased by $49 million versus Q3 2018, primarily due to a $34 million decrease in outstanding commercial paper and a $16 million decrease in Eurobonds book values caused by a weaker euro.","Our total debt to EBITDA ratio ended the period of 3 times, down from 3.1 times at the end of the third quarter of 2018. Spending a moment on capital, I'd like to emphasize that our announced offer for Omega does not imply any major shift in our capital plan, specifically, our capital priorities in terms of continuing to grow our dividend as income and cash flows grow, our commitment to execute our buyback program to maintain a flat share-count and our 10%-plus ROIC target on organic and inorganic investments are unchanged.","In terms of our capital structure, we have a stated an intention to delever back to the mid-2s by the middle of 2019, a long-term target level consistent with our investment grade credit rating.","If the offer for Oslo B\u00f8rs is accepted by shareholders, putting us in a position to close later in 2019, we refinance the acquisition with a mix of cash on hand and new borrowings. The net impact of this would be that we'll be in the mid - could be in mid 2019 reach our deleveraging objective excluding the cash that we have maintained for the Oslo B\u00f8rs acquisition. And then we would establish a new objective of reducing gross leverage to the mid-2s before the end of 2020.","During 2018, the company returned $674 million to shareholders, including repurchases of common shares valued at $394 million and $280 million in dividends.","Thank you for your time and I will turn it back over to the operator for the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Richard Repetto","Yeah, good morning, Adena. Good morning, Michael.","Adena Friedman","Good morning.","Michael Ptasznik","Good morning.","Richard Repetto","And, congrats on your second year, Adena.","Adena Friedman","Thank you.","Richard Repetto","I guess, if we have one question, I guess, it is on the market data issue, because you gave some interesting - new to me that, when you had to review these market data price increases that you wouldn't get a court ruling until - I think you said the end of 2019. So I guess the question is, could you give - does that put a - sort of put a stall or prevent the SEC from making any changes until like in - at least, get an outcome from this court ruling? And, I guess, as long as I'm going to ask, any comments on this new IEX whitepaper that just came out as well?","Adena Friedman","So, I think that I'm going to ask, Ed, with regard to the legal proceedings. I don't think that it has a significant impact on what we said before.","Edward Knight","No, I mean, we will go forward with our filings at the SEC, the commission will consider them in light of what they have said in connection with market data in general. And we will continue to work with them constructively. And so, we feel we still have a path forward in working with the SEC. The previous filing has been explained in the order remanding them to us. A process for handling those has not been established by the SEC and we're questioning the underlying legal authority and process that the SEC followed.","And we have a lot of confidence around our position both based on the law and the facts. So we look forward to it being resolved in the courts.","Adena Friedman","And with regard to the IEX, I guess, announcement, we actually - I think we did a very nice job. Phil Mackintosh did put out a blog yesterday that really provides really good insights into the total cost of trading on Nasdaq and our competitors and looking at why we believe that the way - that we spread our model across a lot of different types of services and fees is actually a better way to spread the value that we provide to the market to the broadest possible set of clients, based on their specific needs and the way they want to interact with the market.","And I think actually frankly that blog was really well done and provides some really good data and evidence to show why our model works so well. So, we encourage you all to read it.","Richard Repetto","Okay. Thanks. I play by the rules. I'll get back in the queue.","Adena Friedman","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot. Good morning.","Adena Friedman","Good morning.","Michael Carrier","Maybe first question, just on the strategic pivot, when we look at where you've been allocating resources, obviously, on the tech side, Information Services, the growth has been I think stronger than people have expected. Like some of the areas that maybe have still lagged, whether it's on the Corporate Services, then maybe on the Fixed Income transaction business. Maybe just an update on how you're thinking about those businesses, then maybe what initiatives are in place in 2019, 2020, to maybe pick the growth or reconsider some of those investment areas?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Thanks for the question. So I agree with your assessment where we have some really great momentum in some large parts of our business. And we're very pleased with how our clients are reacting to the investments we're making across tech and in our Data and Analytics business, as well as the continued really strong performance of our core markets. But I also agree with you that the corporate solutions area of our Corporate Services business and the FICC areas within our Market Services business have not been the strongest performers in terms of delivering growth.","And so, one of the things we've been focused on within Corporate Services is that integration with our Listings client organization. I think that we have these two - these two businesses completely separated and segregated between - but they're also - they're both serving the same client base. And what we did earlier this year in connection with the divestiture of the PR and DMS businesses, which frankly were somewhat disruptive to the overall organization in terms of how we are managing our client interactions.","I think that we now have gotten to the point where we've integrated our sales organizations and our client service organizations between our Listings business and our Corporate Solutions business. And we do believe that that will give a much better client experience in terms of having more of a single point of contact within Nasdaq to serve all of their needs. It also allow us to alert ourselves earlier if things are - if there are areas where our clients are looking for more things that they want to do or if they're having issues with the services we're offering.","And then, I think it also allows us to focus our energies on those businesses that we do believe are strategic to our clients' interactions with the capital market. So we do feel like we're positioning ourselves to have more success in 2019 and we'll have to see how we're able to do that in terms of really driving improved retention and some very specific growth initiatives there.","In - I mean, in the FICC area, I think that has a range of issues. But I would point out that with our treasuries business the re-platforming did create some disruption to our clients. But it was also very necessary. I think that we're very pleased with the performance of the new system. I think our clients are pleased with the performance of the new system. And we're working now to kind of rebuild the business off of the back of a much improved system with much more flexibility and agility.","And we're really excited as we go into 2019 in being able to deliver new functionality as well as new products on the platform. So that to us is one of our larger, I would say, investment areas is FICC. And then, within the commodities business in the Nordics, as you know, we are going through a kind of a rebuilding - and frankly, I think that our clients are really being extremely productive with us to make sure that we maintain a healthy market there despite the issue that we incurred earlier last year.","So I think that those two areas have been an area of real focus. But you're right, we want to get them - all of those areas into a better state of operating performance as we go through 2019.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Hill with Rosenblatt. Your line is open.","Kenneth Hill","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Adena Friedman","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth Hill","So my question was on Cinnober, I know a few weeks back, you guys had a clearing system contract come up that you won from the OCC [ph]. I was just hoping you could talk about the opportunity set there for that business and how that's looking like - how you can maybe monetize some of the elements that brings, whether from the clearing side of the business, which seems profitable coming in or some of the other areas that didn't seem as profitable, maybe like post-trade risk or reporting transparency or maybe even some of the stakes in the surveillance companies?","Adena Friedman","Well, first of all, that's great, great understanding of the business. So I have to say, Ken, great job kind of dissecting the various elements of Cinnober. First of all, we're really thrilled to have Cinnober as part of Nasdaq. We - it's amazing actually how culturally aligned the organizations are. The talent there is excellent, and so as we've gotten into get to know people now and we've been doing town halls and individual meetings and we're starting to integrate the teams together, the talent base in Cinnober is just as strong as we've thought it would be.","And the technology that they have particularly in clearing, as you pointed out, is a very, very - it's a great system. And we also have a very strong system too. So I think what we're going to be looking at is a long term path on how we can make sure that we're bringing the best of our systems to our clients. But I can say that they have very strong technology and a very strong talent base, particularly in the clearing space. And I think that in terms of this other businesses that you mentioned, those are the areas that we will be focusing on to determine the best path forward in terms of driving to a more profitable outcome for the business and for our shareholders as we integrate them into Nasdaq.","So what's really going to be part of our strategy going forward and how should we take the assets and the capabilities that they have outside of clearing and make sure that we're either optimizing them or making the right decisions around them to get to a profitable outcome for us. And so that is our on - just beginning that ongoing review right now.","Kenneth Hill","And just to be clear on that, so those elements are included in your cost guidance here for 2019 right now?","Adena Friedman","Yeah. So we have a plan around integration with Cinnober. Our cost guidance does include Cinnober for all of 2019 based on our execution plan against the synergies. And we do expect to take some time to make sure that we can execute our synergies successfully and properly integrate the teams and the technology into Nasdaq without disrupting any clients. So that - our guidance does include all of that in - so our expense guidance is inclusive of that, which, of course, is an add-on to what your - the organic guidance would have been going into the end of 2018.","Kenneth Hill","Thanks very much for the question.","Adena Friedman","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Kenneth Worthington","Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. It seems like - on the Oslo deal, it seems like Euronext secured commitments for about 50.5% of the vote. Obviously, your bid presumes that you can win over some of those who already seem committed. So to what extent is it possible to win over the 50.5%? Are those votes - or to what extent are those votes irrevocable? Or is there something else at play here? And then any comments on initial cost savings that you might be able to extract from an Oslo merger? Thank you.","Adena Friedman","Sure. I'm going to hand over the first question to Michael.","Michael Ptasznik","Sure. So we do believe we have a superior offer to the offer that the shareholders currently have in front of them. Those are hard irrevocables that they currently hold, but those irrevocables expire at the end of August. And so that we believe that the combination of having the Oslo B\u00f8rs' board supporting our transaction, unanimously supporting the transaction that we have offered a superior offer from a price standpoint on top of that and the package that we can put together, which we think is beneficial for the Nordic financial community and for the Norwegian traders, investors and the entire community, we think is a superior offer in totality.","And that at the end of the day that will be taken into account by the parties that need to - make the determination with respect to which bid that they will accept. And so it maybe a position where we have to wait till the end of August for it to occur, but we do believe that we have put together a program here with the support of the key shareholders representing 35.11% behind us as well that we'll be able to execute on the transaction.","Adena Friedman","And with regard to the way that we are looking at Oslo from a synergy perspective, Ken. We have extensive experience and how we work on integrating these types of exchange businesses, as we've done with Denmark and Finland in terms of also looking at it as part of a Nordic - our Nordic family essentially, where you leave a really strong center within the local community. We also have real centers of excellence around the post-trade and CSD business as well as the commodities business in Norway.","But at the same time, have the benefit of combining the technology and delivering a lot of efficiencies and synergies to our clients off of the back of that in addition to operating synergies as well as just making sure that we are creating kind of Nordic and kind of community orientation towards some of those key exchange and business functions within the business.","So we have a lot of experience doing this, and we have a successful path that we know that we can execute on to deliver efficiencies and to deliver returns to our shareholders, while they also maintain a really strong operation and operational core within Norway.","Kenneth Worthington","Great. Thank you.","Adena Friedman","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open.","Christopher Allen","Good morning, everyone. Just, I guess, want to stay at the topic of Oslo B\u00f8rs, got a number of inbounds just in what this means from a strategic perspective. And I guess the question is, this kind of a unique opportunity in the Market Services business, where you look at other opportunities to add scale? And what does this tell us about deal opportunities in the non-transactional spaces at the current time?","Adena Friedman","Sure. You are right about that. So I think, one of the things I noticed is back in 2016, we did make it clear back in 2016 that Oslo B\u00f8rs was a market that we saw as being very attractive to our Nordic business and to Nasdaq in general. So I think that it something that we've had on our radar for a very long time. And this really is a great opportunity for us to size up in the business. And frankly, it's a complete family within the Nordic markets. And so I think that it's seen very positively by our clients, because they - almost all of our trading clients in the Nordics operate across all four markets, and yet, the Nordic - the Norwegian market has been on a totally different technology stack than the rest of the Nordic markets.","And so by having this is an opportunity for us to integrate the technology and create a more unified technology stack, it gives our clients a great benefit. And so we're getting a lot of support from our customers on this and we are a very client-oriented business, so - and we're excited to be able to deliver that benefit to our customers. It is definitely a good opportunity for us to size up in our markets. But recognize that when we look at our overall capital allocation that we've undertaken over the last couple of years.","The investments we've made across both organic investments and inorganic investments that we've made across our non-transaction businesses whether that's the eVestment acquisition, Cinnober, Quandl, but also our organic investments that I mentioned on the call, are really - that's a real shift for us in terms of capital allocation and a shift towards making sure that we can deliver on sustainable growth in those businesses. But of course, we operate great markets and we have to make sure that we are always there to sustain our preeminence in those markets. And this is a great opportunity for us to do that.","Christopher Allen","Any comment on the non-transactional opportunities? Or...","Adena Friedman","Yeah. I mean, I think that we're always at opportunities. I would - as you can tell, we've been in the mode of looking at some bolt-ons and executing on bolt-on deals. I think that, that's just an activity that we undertake on a regular basis. I can't say that there is anything in particular that I would want to point out, but I think that we will always be looking at our organic approach to growing our business, first and foremost.","And then if we can supplement that and complement that with some really interesting and exciting acquisitions that can help kind of catalyst growth or expand our presence in the technology area and in the data area we will continue to do that. So as we have done over the last two years.","Christopher Allen","Thanks.","Adena Friedman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm","Hey, good morning.","Adena Friedman","Hi, Alex.","Alex Kramm","Just coming back to Cinnober for a minute. I guess, for Michael, I was hoping that maybe now that it's closing, you can give us a little bit more concrete impact on the financials. I know you mentioned it in - a little bit in your cost guidance. But can you give a specific number how it's impact the cost side between - you're shutting businesses down, as you mentioned, the synergies may take a little bit to materialize. So how should we be thinking about the impact to our models? And any comments on the revenue side that we should be looking out for in terms of seasonality? I know, there are some public filings, but just maybe now that you see the business more clearly.","Michael Ptasznik","Yeah. So - as Adena said, the - both Cinnober and Quandl are included in the guidance that we've provided. So in there, we would be roughly in the range of $40 million to $50 million, would be the cost for Cinnober and Quandl on a full year basis that's included in those numbers. And so obviously we'll be looking to achieve synergies through the year period. So that's what's included in those numbers. And again, that's on top of the 2% organic growth, plus or minus range that we typically believe in a regular year. So if you combine those two pieces together, that's how we get the forecast for the next year.","With respect to seasonality, again, you do have the historical numbers that Cinnober has published. And so as we work through, we have to take a look at what those contracts will be. And I would say that it wouldn't be substantially different that you would typically see from the rest of the Market Tech business. But as we start to work through those contracts and see some of the new opportunities there, then that may fluctuate somewhat.","Adena Friedman","Yeah, we're about 12 days in, so we are working through a lot of details right now collaboratively with the team at Cinnober to understand the contracts, the revenue opportunities, the way that we want to make sure that we're looking at our staffing needs across both organizations as well as doing the reviews that we mentioned - that Ken had brought up with regard to some of the ancillary businesses that they own.","Michael Ptasznik","We also take a look at the revenue recognition, make sure that it aligns with ours. And so that type of work is happening right now as we go through the year-end.","Alex Kramm","Excellent. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks.","Adena Friedman","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Blostein","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Adena Friedman","Hi, Alex.","Alex Blostein","Just a follow-up question around just the appetite for acquisitions. I mean, clearly, feels like over the last few months, you guys have been more acquisitive. I guess, the question is why now? And as we think about the appetite for buybacks over the next kind of 12 to 18 months as you've integrate these deals, and obviously potentially another deal, how should we think about that?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well, I think that what we mentioned is, taking that latter point first, we'll continue to focus our buyback activity on managing our share count and that's really our stated purpose of the buybacks. We've been - we did have one increase in our buyback activity this year on the back of the sale of the PR and DMS businesses to make sure that we delivered the right return or the right outcome for our shareholders on that deal.","But generally, we're managing our buybacks to manage share count and that will be what we continue to do. With regards to acquisitions kind of why now, what part of it is, because they're available, these are - I can tell you that all of the acquisitions Cinnober as well as Oslo have been companies that we've known very well for a long time that we had important relationships with for a long time. And that we've been having conversations with for a long time.","So the fact that they've culminated this year and this moment is just - I think, just coincidence. But we have to be ready to act when we know that we have a real opportunity to grow and expand our franchise the right way. And these acquisitions just happened to be timed right now.","I think the Quandl deal is a much smaller deal. It's a business that we're really excited to be able to grow and expand. It's very consistent with our strategy in the GIS business. And it's really a small bolt-on to our already organic approach to driving towards more alternative data. And so I think that it just happens to be that, that's the way it works. Sometimes, they do tend to bunch up. But we are very excited about being able to execute to across our - the deals. They're all in different parts of our business. I'd like to point out that each one of them is focused on a different part of our business. So our ability to execute - we have every confidence in our ability to execute well across all of them.","Michael Ptasznik","And if I could just add one thing to what Adena said with respect to the buybacks. So we will continue to do that that is taken into account with respect to the comments that, if we go ahead with the - when we go ahead with the Oslo transaction that the pay down where we get back to the mid-2s, would be towards the end of 2020. However, just with respect to the buybacks, the timing may fluctuate. We've typically front-loaded it, and so right now, we're just analyzing this with respect to the timing of the transaction, when it may come out. And so the buybacks will continue. The timing may fluctuate depending on the transaction and the timing of that.","Alex Blostein","Great. Thanks very much.","Adena Friedman","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Adena Friedman","Good morning.","Brian Bedell","Good morning. Adena, maybe if you - you mentioned the 12 new Market Technology infrastructure clients in 2018 and 20 new buy-side clients for surveillance. Could you talk about the tempo of the revenue attribution for 2019 from those clients in terms of, I guess, timing of when they're getting integrated into the businesses?","And then also, if you can just - in fact, just one on the Oslo, if you can quantify the ultimate expense save that you expect to achieve from the technology integration on that?","Adena Friedman","So with regard to the Market Tech question, it's going to be - it's going to differ by client, so one of the largest clients, these new clients we signed last year with the National Stock Exchange of India, which is a very large implementation across post-trade clearing and settlement. So that would be something where we've launched that project. We're well underway with that project but it's a project that will take a fair amount of time to get to full production.","The way that revenue recognition works now is we are able to start to recognize revenue associated with the delivery of our projects. But then you get to a more steady state in terms of the revenue recognition as you go into production. So a client like that, you'd probably see more of a steady state revenue recognition as you get into 2020, whereas some of the smaller clients that we signed some of the crypto markets and some of the smaller regional markets that we signed, we should be able to get to full production in 2019 and therefore you will get earlier revenue recognition or earlier steady state.","But do want to say again the revenue recognition rules have changed and we can now start recognizing revenues as we're doing the projects. The one thing I would say is that the cost, the expenses tend to go - be much higher during the project phase of delivering. And then once we go into full production, then the expenses become more steady state expenses until we get higher profitability off those contracts once they get into full production.","So those 12, it's just going to range, I would say, Brian, anywhere into 2019 and 2020 are when you're going to see kind of the full benefit of those 12 new clients. But I can't give you specific dates.","With regard to the Oslo deal question, we're not giving out specific expense synergy numbers. But we can say that we confident in our ability to be able to deliver our 10% ROIC within the 3 to 5 year timeframe. And we believe it will be accretive within 12 months. And that's on the back of some good work we've done with the Oslo team to make sure that we understand how to bring the two organizations together the right way.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And then just on the expenses associated with the onboarding of the project like you mentioned, should we expect that - I'm sure it's in expense guidance for 2019, but should we expect that to sort of diminish a little bit relative to that revenue onboarding from those clients as we get to 2020?","Adena Friedman","Yeah, that will be the right way to look at it. Of course, they will probably sign new clients hopefully. And we'll always have new clients for signing up. You're 100% right. As we continue to grow out base of clients over time and we're getting to a point of being in production across a higher base of clients, then you get a nice margin lift on the back of that growing client base. But we're always going to be signing new clients and producing and delivering for new clients. So they will also factor into our expenses every year as well.","But you're right, it's all baked into our expense guidance, yeah.","Brian Bedell","Yeah, okay, great. Thank you very much.","Adena Friedman","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, good morning. Maybe just a question on the members exchange. As you said in your prepared remarks, we've seen this story before, with your trading participants creating a new exchange. I think some people have been calling this BATS 2.0. But certainly a lot has changed since BATS launch. Could you just comment on what's different this time around or why you feel very confident that you'll be able to defend your transaction fee in SIP revenue pool, just because some of the attempts previously have been successful?","Adena Friedman","Well, I think the - first of all, as we all know, the U.S. equities markets, it's a very competitive and very dynamic environment. And we've operated within a very competitive and dynamic environment for a long time. When you look at what - the timing of when BATS came into place, it was on the back of other acquisitions, both Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange have done acquisitions. It was also at the very beginning of the whole electronic market phenomenon on the back of Reg NMS.","And so there was a lot of - there was just a lot of changes going on, a lot of changes in behavior going on. I would say that the pricing still was kind of fluctuating a lot across the different markets. Today though, I would say that we have spent the last 10 years since then really honing our markets extraordinarily well, developing very deep relationships with our customers.","This will always be coopetition environment. This always will - always has been and always will be. But the best thing we can do is make sure we have really strong and positive relationship with our clients, make sure that they understand how best to use our services and our systems, make sure they understand how low cost we really area. And again, I do encourage you to read sales report on that. I think it does a great job of laying out how we look at our total cost of trading and make sure that we have the best possible trading environment to deliver to our clients.","And I think the last decade, we've really done a spectacular job of that. So if we face new competitors like we have several in the last few years, we're ready to take them on. And I also would say that 35% of the trading occurs off exchange today anyway, primarily by those customers that are forming that exchange. So to the extent they bring some of that flow that's currently internalized into an exchange environment, we then get to compete for that.","So I think that we recognize that there are - there is always going to be a dynamic environment here, but we're ready to take on any challenge that comes our way.","Kyle Voigt","Thank you.","Adena Friedman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeremy Campbell","Hey, thanks. Just want to piggyback off of Brian's question on Market Tech side, can you just remind us, is there seasonality in fourth quarter, because your new orders kind of tick back up versus kind of the run-rate from the first part of the year?","And then, I know these are kind of longer sales cycles and then can be a little chunkier. But, I guess, which element are you seeing a little bit more of the momentum in, as we get to the back-half of this year and looking ahead to 2019? Is it the infrastructure side or is it the surveillance side and just comment on that at all?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Yeah, I would say that on the market infrastructure side there is always - there is definitely seasonality at the fourth quarter in terms of people signing deals. So at the end of the year, a lot of budgets get approved. We've been working with them throughout the year to try to get to the point of getting them really comfortable with what they are preparing to do. They like to tend to start - launch into a new project at the beginning of the year.","So a lot of deals get signed in the fourth quarter. And also change revenue, a lot of activity occurs in the fourth quarters to deliver on enhancements before the end of the year, before they have [code] [ph] freezes, et cetera. And so, we tend to have higher what we call CR revenue in the fourth quarter as well. So it tends to be our seasonally high quarter.","In terms of looking at demand for services, I would say that demand for surveillance tends to be steadier throughout the year, whereas demand in kind of signing up of market infrastructure tends to be chunkier as you mentioned. These are longer sales cycles and sometimes - frankly, sometime you can - we get pleasantly surprised and get to sign a deal on the quarter. But a lot of times these take anywhere from 6 to 12 months to come to fruition.","Jeremy Campbell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Herbert with Citi. Your line is open.","Ben Herbert","Hi, good morning.","Adena Friedman","Good morning.","Ben Herbert","Could you just speak to late cycle dynamics potential slower global growth against durability on the non-transaction side? Are you seeing any impacts to pipeline or sales lead-time? Thank you.","Adena Friedman","Sure. So I would say that our business has been going forward as we would expect and has continued to be strong in terms of demand for our services. And the interactions we've had with prospective clients has continued unabated as they continue to see core demand and core reasons to want our services. I have to say I think that our business in general is resilient business, when it comes to economic cycles. What we do - we're number one and number two in our space in a lot of what we do.","Our services are quite core to general - the general economies that we operate in as well with regard to those clients who are developing their economies in other countries. And our relationships and our contracts particularly in tech are very long-term contracts. And our Data and Analytics business, they tend to be subscription based, and they tend to be products that they really want to have regardless of the cycle, because they help them strategically operate their business across cycles.","So we feel very good about the resilience of our business across cycles and we don't - we're not experiencing anything that could be what I would consider a, quote unquote, late cycle type of phenomenon.","Ben Herbert","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Christopher Harris","Yeah, thanks. 5% revenue growth profile at Oslo B\u00f8rs, you highlighted that. We know there is expense benefits associated with this deal, but wondering if you guys think you might be able to accelerate the revenue growth at Oslo once it becomes part of Nasdaq. And if you think you might be able to do that, maybe you can give us some potential examples.","Adena Friedman","So, I think that there certainly are opportunities that we discussed with the Oslo management on how we could catalyze the business. I think one good example actually is by bringing them into a common technology of platforms, there are participants in the Nordic markets today that don't participate in Oslo and when you look at the turnover of trading in Oslo as compared to the turnover of trading in the rest of the Nordic markets it is lower.","And so, we definitely see an opportunity for us to bring more participation into the market through that common technology platform. I also think that it also means that there could be increased demand for data, and then, as we kind of grow the interest in the market. And then the last thing on the index side, they do have a small index business, and in fact, that's an area we've been collaborating with them for a while.","We obviously have a very scaled index business. We know how to deliver and develop indexes that are meaningful to the Nordic marketplace. And so, we look forward to finding new ways to leverage some of their expertise in energy and seafood and other asset classes to deliver some new index products to the market.","Christopher Harris","Great. Thank you.","Adena Friedman","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back to Adena Friedman for closing remarks.","Adena Friedman","Great. Thank you very much. Well, in closing, we are really pleased with fourth quarter performance and the full year performance of Nasdaq in 2018. And we are extremely energized. We had a sales kick-off meeting earlier this month across our franchise and it was just the enthusiasm and excitement that we have within Nasdaq right now to be able to deliver for our customers and deliver for our shareholders, as we go into 2019 it's just extremely high.","And I do believe that it has been guided by our strategic direction to re-imagine markets to realize the potential of tomorrow, our own mission, our own stated mission. So we're very excited about our opportunities in 2019, so thank you very much for your time today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Ditmire - Nasdaq, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's fourth quarter 2016 and full-year financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Michael Ptasznik, our CFO; Ed Knight, our General Counsel; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A.","The press release and presentation are on our website.

Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I now will turn the call over to Adena.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that 2016 was truly a significant year for Nasdaq, our businesses, our leadership team, and the geopolitical landscape. I'm very excited to have been named CEO and to have the opportunity to lead this tremendous organization forward during its next phase of growth and expansion.","I would like to start by thanking Bob Greifeld for his incredible dedication and leadership over the past 14 years. Bob led a transformation that strengthened the company's foundation and then expanded it in a logical, disciplined and progressive manner. It is because of his vision that Nasdaq is as well positioned as it is today as a leading global technology solutions company, serving the global capital markets.","Bob's focus on shareholders was incredibly important to him and one that he engrained in the entire organization. This manifested itself in the company's tremendous efficiency, as well as the outstanding shareholder returns the company has delivered over his tenure.","I know that Bob appreciated the insight and support he received from you throughout the years. I fully intend to continue Nasdaq's focus on our shareholders, as well as our clients. Most importantly, our emphasis on delivering strong, consistent shareholder returns, while providing our clients with world-class exchange and capital market solutions across the globe.","Having been in this role for a month now and having spent time with key personnel in many of our businesses at their annual sales and strategy kick-off sessions, we are very excited about our prospects in 2017, and my confidence in this organization's ability to continue to execute has only increased.","Today, I want to organize my remarks around a few of the areas where Nasdaq is evolving our business, as well as cover some performance highlights from 2016 and then end with our execution priorities for 2017. As I noted, 2016 was indeed a significant year of progress for Nasdaq. We welcomed several additions to the business and executive leadership team, all of whom share strong expertise in their respective areas. I have the utmost confidence in the leadership team we have assembled today and their ability to move Nasdaq forward.","Moving ahead for us means that we are constantly evaluating our businesses and our client engagement and finding the best path to success in serving our clients in a unified and strategic way. With this goal in mind, we've decided to group Listing Services and our Corporate Solutions business under one segment called Corporate Services in our reporting.","Bringing these two businesses under one reporting segment will allow the investment community to gain a better understanding of the full range of services we offer our corporate clients as well as highlight the unique value we deliver to them.","We strive to be a strategic partner to our 18,000 corporate clients throughout their lifecycle, both as private and public companies. And we intend to build further on the momentum in this area through increased collaboration and innovation across the teams at Nasdaq.","We are also now reporting Market Technology as an independent segment. This change will provide investors with a clear view of what we consider one of the most differentiated and compelling aspects of Nasdaq's business model.","We are very excited about the growth and expansion opportunities in Market Technology as we become an increasingly important partner to other markets, broker dealers and institutional investors.","We are also making significant changes in our Fixed Income businesses. Under new leadership, we are bringing our fixed income offerings together under one common brand, Nasdaq Fixed Income, as we begin to evolve the strategy to better support both our clients and our growth objectives. While it resulted in a non-cash accounting impact in the fourth quarter, which Michael will detail, we're confident the business will be better positioned moving forward.","Lastly, in terms of our business alignment actions, we have decided to end the NLX European rate futures initiative and we'll be working with our clients and partners to facilitate an orderly wind down of open positions.","Now moving into the broader results for 2016, we are proud of the accomplishments that we achieved for our clients throughout the year and the resulting financial performance for our shareholders. Specifically in 2016, we delivered record of raw net revenues of nearly $2.3 billion, record non-trading segment revenues of nearly $1.5 million and record non-GAAP EPS of $3.68, an increase of 9% year-over-year. Building on this with our dividend payments and valuation improvement, Nasdaq achieved double digit total shareholder return of 17.5% in 2016. This performance is a testament to the strength of our model, our team and our ability to execute against a mixed volume backdrop.","Recognizing that 75% of our revenues comes from subscription and recurring revenue businesses, I'll speak to the non-trading segments first. We continue to see steady organic growth across each of our non-trading segments, which together delivered 4% organic growth in 2016, a figure that is consistent with both our track record over the last several years as well as our forward-looking medium-term outlook. This was driven in special part by accelerated growth in our Market Technology segment, which delivered a very strong 11% organic growth for the year along with strong momentum exiting 2016 in terms of the fourth quarter's robust new order intake of $136 million, one of our highest quarters ever, capping a very solid $276 million total for the year.","Breaking down 2016 order intake into how we delivered for our clients included deepening our relationships with existing clients such as contract extensions and in some cases contract expansions with the Hong Kong exchanges, Australian Stock Exchange, NEX formerly known as ICAP, SIX Group, Borse Dubai, and Borsa Kuwait, and significant new customer sales from clients such as NYIAX and the Affinity Capital Exchange among others.","In conjunction with our trading business, we are particularly excited to announce in the fourth quarter our agreement to support and host a leading bank's dark pool as part of our Ocean initiative, a new way of leveraging our expertise in trading and compliance support solutions to solve customer challenges. And we look forward to building on this success in coming periods.","Along with Market Technology's new order intake success in 2016, we were also excited to announce the Nasdaq Financial Framework or what we call NFF, which is our new modular architecture that will provide next generation capital markets capabilities, including the integration of Blockchain technology across the issuance and settlement of securities as well as cloud-enabled trading and clearing capabilities. We expect this next generation platform to contribute meaningfully to our order intake in 2017 and beyond.","In our Corporate Services segment, we are very pleased to see solid progress in terms of improving our competitive position as a result of our continued client focus. In particular, issuers continue to see Nasdaq and our listing value proposition as the preferred venue for their public offering. This is evidenced in our 73% win rate across, among U.S. IPOs in 2016, including an 87% win rate in U.S. Tech IPOs, as well as, our success in large tech deals, in fact, seven of the top 10 technology IPOs selected Nasdaq in 2016, including amazing companies such as Trivago, Nutanix, and Coupa Software. We also attracted the largest Energy IPO of the year with Extraction Oil & Gas, and the largest bank IPO with First Hawaiian bank.","We believe the investments and enhancements we've made to the IPO open experience coupled with our Corporate Solutions and our long-term orientation to our listing relationships are truly differentiating our offering.","In the Nordic, DONG Energy and Nets, were two of the largest Nordic IPOs ever, and two of the top three IPOs globally last year. With 62 IPOs in 2016 and over \u20ac8.5 billion raised, we are very proud that our Nordic markets topped all other European regions.","Lastly, Nasdaq became the fastest growing venue for ETF listings, delivering 50% year-over-year growth in our total number of listings with an increase of 110 Nasdaq ETF listings.","In Corporate Solutions, we made significant progress to enhance the client experience through the introduction and rollout of the next generation IR platform, IR Insight platform. In doing so, we created an architectural foundation for all of our next generation Corporate Solutions products going forward. The IR Insight launch and rollout and other product enhancements combined with the continued improvements in our service and support all contributed to the ability to improve our organic revenue trends. Our revenue performance in Corporate Solutions stabilized as we progressed through 2016 culminating in modest, but encouraging organic growth in the fourth quarter.","Turning to our Information Services segment, it continued to provide solid gains in 2016. The Data Product's business specifically delivered a 7% revenue increase for the year, most of which was organic. Our Index Licensing and Services business on the other hand experienced a challenging start to the year due to beta headwinds and fund flows and market performance. But we progressively improved as the year went on with assets under management ending the year higher versus 2015.","As we look to the future in Information Services, we're encouraged by the progress in leveraging emerging technologies, most notably machine intelligence, to expand the ways we serve our clients such as, including the launch of the trading and analytics product suite, which is just beginning to leverage the machine intelligence in its logic.","The new family of solutions offers, includes offerings that our clients use to refine their trading strategies or identify potentially alpha-generating investing areas. We continue to launch new Analytics and Insights products throughout 2017 and into the future as a way to generate new growth opportunities for us moving forward. We also continue to make strides in expanding our Index franchise, in particular with our smart beta products, which make up 44% of our growing, $124 billion in AUM total. An example of this was launching the first fixed income product leveraging the DWA relative strength methodology in partnership with State Street.","Now turning to, from our non-trading segments to the Market Services segment, it was a mixed year. In terms of beta drivers, the first three quarters of the year were characterized by low volatility and volumes, an obvious challenge, although volumes picked up post U.S. election. In terms of our alpha drivers, we experienced a continued fierce competitive environment for market share in U.S. Equities and Fixed Income, while we made some late year gains in market share at Nordic equities and U.S. options.","Specifically in our U.S. options business, we believe the ISE acquisition provides us with significant upside in how we serve our options trading clients, in particular in the complex order business and in our front end. We began to see the benefits of the combined options business, as we went through the year, and we've worked closely with our clients to begin to see new order flow achieving market share north of 40% entering 2017.","Additionally, Nasdaq CXC are recently acquired Canadian market, provides new ways to leverage our core trading expertise in North America. NFX, our energy futures market continues to demonstrate a positive trajectory in the year-and-a-half since its launch. Open interest reached a peak of 1.6 million contracts in January of 2017 a new high. Volumes averaged 170,000 contracts per day in the fourth quarter, and we are averaging about above 200,000 per day so far in January 2017. We entered 2017 with a clear opportunity to add to the 140 clients who have already traded and we continue to identify additional products to bring to market.","Overall, we are proud of our progress and accomplishments for 2016 across the businesses and how we are positioned to continue the momentum as we enter the New Year. Shifting to the execution priorities in 2017, there are three in particular that I've communicated internally and we'll share today.","First, is to remain intently focused on completing the integrations of the 2016 acquisitions, so that we can provide the full benefits of these investments to our clients and shareholders.","As of the end of the fourth quarter in 2016, we've achieved $38 million in realized run rate cost synergies and we continue to have high confidence we can deliver the full $60 million total by the end of 2017.","Second, is to commercialize emerging technologies in meaningful ways for our clients and shareholders most notably in the areas of machine intelligence, Blockchain and the cloud.","Leveraging our investments in the Nasdaq Financial Framework and the new trading and analytics platform, we will progress our commercial offerings in areas where we have the most compelling client opportunities.","Third, is to improve our competitive positioning across all of our core businesses through continuous innovation and best-in-class client service. In my view, client centric innovation service coupled with a return orientation to our investments are the best means to secure our future growth.","Of course we're going to have to navigate the macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop in 2017. Looking very specifically at the most critical areas and matters that will impact us, our industry and our broader clients. Our initial areas of focus will be financial regulation, tax reform and broader trade and immigration issues given that we are a global business.","In closing, at Nasdaq, we are always focused on our future and the new ways in which we can serve our clients better. While we support our clients in a variety of different ways, technology has always been and will continue to be at the forefront of what we do. As a global capital markets infrastructure and technology solutions provider, Nasdaq has one of the most unique sets of capabilities in the industry. We use these capabilities to enable entrepreneurs and innovators with new ideas to find the capital they need to grow and expand.","We use the capabilities to enable investors and intermediaries to buy and sell financial assets with ease and efficiency. And we use the capabilities to help the entire industry mitigate risk. All of these result in more constructive interactions with the capital markets, which as we've seen over the decades creates jobs and drives economic growth. The management team and I are very focused on the importance of our role in the global economy and how we can best continue to leverage our unique strengths to advance our clients and visions.","I want to reemphasize my excitement about leading this tremendous organization. I fully intend to bring the progress and success that Nasdaq has achieved, and I look forward to taking our company, our business and our brand into the future to reach new levels. I look forward to working with and collaborating with all of you, as well as our clients and key stakeholders as we embark on this exciting journey together.","Now, I'll turn it over to Michael to review the financial details.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you, Adena, good morning everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results. Later in my prepared remarks, I'll discuss this quarter's differences between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.","I will start by reviewing fourth quarter revenue performance relative to the prior-year quarter as shown on page 6 of the presentation and organic growth on pages 8 and 19. The 12% or $63 million increase in reported net revenue of $599 million consisted of $54 million in net revenues from our 2016 acquisitions of ISE, Marketwired, Boardvantage and Nasdaq CXC, as organic growth in the non-trading segments of $16 million, or 5%. This was partially offset by an organic decrease in Market Services net revenues of $3 million and a $4 million negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.","I will now review highlights within each of our reported segments, and all comparisons will be to the prior-year period unless otherwise noted. I will start with Information Services, which as reflected on pages 9 and 19, saw $8 million or 6% in increased revenue, consisting of $5 million or 4% organic growth, as well as $3 million increase related to the ISE and Nasdaq CXC acquisitions.","The operating income margin was 69% in the fourth quarter, down 1 point from the prior year quarter due primarily to the impact of acquisitions, though the full year 2016 figure of 71% was unchanged from 2015.","Market Technology revenue, as shown on pages 10 and 19, increased $6 million or 8% with organic growth of $7 million or 10% partially offset by the impact of FX of $1 million. The growth was driven by increased revenues from software licensing and support contracts, as well as from surveillance products. Notably, new order intake was $136 million in the fourth quarter which is among the highest quarters ever, and the period-end backlog finished at $777 million, just 1% another record high from the fourth quarter of 2015. The operating income margin was 30% down from 32% in the prior year period, which had an unusually strong seasonal revenue spike.","Turning to Corporate Services on pages 11 and 19, revenues increased $24 million or 17%, primarily due to the Marketwired and Boardvantage acquisitions, totaling $21 million, but also $4 million of organic growth, $2 million of which came from Corporate Solutions. The Corporate Services operating margin was 25% unchanged versus the prior year period. While our new segment alignment reflects how we're managing our businesses today and going forward, to be sensitive to the fact that we've communicated a 20% margin initiative for the former Technology Solutions segment, which included Corporate Solutions and Market Technology. We will continue to provide periodic updates on our annual progress towards that margin goal.","Looking at full year numbers, the company has improved operating income margins from single digit percentage levels in 2012 to 17% in the full year 2016. We will continue to work to improve that margin by obtaining efficiencies that come from combining and streamlining our Corporate Solutions platforms, offering best-in-class service to retain and attract clients and innovating in our offerings to expand usage across our suite of products.","Market Services net revenues on pages 12 and 19 saw a $25 million increase reflecting inclusion of $30 million of revenue from the acquisitions of ISE and Nasdaq CXC, partially offset by a $3 million organic decline primarily in cash equities and $2 million in negative impact from changes in FX. Market Services operating income increased slightly to 54% versus 53% in the prior year period.","Turning to pages 13 and 19 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $39 million. This increase included $29 million in expenses from our acquisitions, net of $8 million of realized expense reduction from synergies, a $14 million organic increase which was partially offset by a favorable $4 million impact from FX. The 2016 full year saw a 3% organic increase in expenses, excluding the expense impact of acquisitions and related synergies in line with the prior year.","Now turning to slide 14, our 2017 non-GAAP operating expense guidance is at range of $1.26 billion to $1.31 billion, which reflects core organic expense growth, excluding synergies around 3%, the full year impact of the acquisitions that closed at various points during the first half of 2016, anticipated progress against our synergy opportunities and the impact of changes in FX rates. Included in this expense guidance is $40 million to $50 million of R&D spend.","Now, as many of you are aware, the cost associated with operating NLX were included in our previous year's R&D spend. With the closure of NLX, we expect to save approximately $6 million in 2017 versus 2016, including the impact of both expenses and contra revenues, with almost all the savings occurring in the second half of the year.","The $40 million to $50 million R&D range reflects in part the fact that we may choose to reinvest those savings into new R&D initiatives as we continue to pursue compelling opportunities to invest in our future. We will keep our investors informed as we progress throughout the year.","Non-GAAP operating income increased 10% in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the non-GAAP operating margin totaled 46%, down approximately 100 basis points from the prior year period, as organic revenue growth from our non-trading segments was mostly offset by higher organic operating expense growth.","Net interest expense was $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $9 million versus the prior year period reflecting the additional interest expense from our 2016 acquisition financing. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 33.5% and for the full year 2016 was 33.7% in line with our 33% to 35% full year guidance.","We expect the 2017 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 30% to 32%. The decline from 2016 is a result of the adoption of a new accounting standard, ASU 2016-09, which requires companies to include incremental tax benefits or charges related to the vesting of equity grants through the tax provision. Without this accounting change and the expected incremental benefit in 2017, our annual effective tax rate would still be in the range of 33% to 35%.","During 2017, each quarter's tax rate will differ, as the tax provision will be influenced by the number of awards that vest and the difference in the stock price from the grant price. For the first quarter of 2017, we expect the effective rate to be between 24% and 26%. The adoption of this accounting standard will also result in an increase to our average diluted share count of approximately 700,000 shares.","Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $161 million or $0.95 per diluted share, compared to $150 million or $0.89 per diluted share in the prior year period.","There were several non-GAAP items in this quarter's results, and given the number and size, I'd like to spend a moment to provide some detail around these. First, we had a $584 million in non-cash write-downs, which included a $578 million asset impairment for the carrying value of the eSpeed trade name related to our rebranding of the U.S. electronic fixed income business, and $7 million of other write-downs.","Second, we had $23 million in amortization expense for acquired intangible assets. Third, we had $20 million in merger and strategic initiatives, expense related primarily to the acquisition integrations. Fourth, we had $12 million in expenses due to an accelerated recognition of certain share-based compensation expense in connection with Bob's retirement as CEO. This does not affect the vesting timing of this previously granted equity. And fifth, we were issued a $6 million regulatory fine from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, an amount of which we are appealing.","Turning to capital, during the fourth quarter, our outstanding debt and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio were both reduced in the period due to fluctuations in FX rates and debt pay down. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period at three times and we continue to expect to deleverage to the mid-2 times level by mid-2018. While we did not repurchase shares this quarter, through dividends and repurchases, Nasdaq returned nearly $300 million in capital to shareholders in 2016, constituting 48% of our non-GAAP income even while executing on several attractive acquisition opportunities.","As of December 31, 2016, there is $429 million remaining on the board repurchase authorization. In 2017, we will continue to look for opportunities to deploy our capital through organic and inorganic investments, share repurchases, dividends, and debt repayment as we work to maximize returns on capital to shareholders.","Thank you for your time. With that, I'll turn it back to Adena.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you, Michael. So, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. You may begin.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good morning, Adena. Good morning, Michael.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Good morning, Rich.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","And congrats Adena on your first call here.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","First, on the Corporate Solutions and the sort of the realignment and thank you for being pretty straightforward, Michael. When you back into what you moved over, just the pure Corporate Solutions legacy, I guess ex market technology, it looked like 10% margins or so, was that correct? And then you said you're going to update on future margin improvements. If I look at the synergies, I guess with all the margin improvements as you get, as you were prior going from 18% to 20%, where's it going to be in the Corporate, the legacy Corporate Solutions rather than Market Technology?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. So the first question is what was the margin of Corporate Solutions for the year and you're very close, it was 11% for the year. And in terms of the margin improvement, I would say that the majority of the margin improvement we did expect to receive or we do expect to receive through the Corporate Solutions business as we continue to consolidate our platforms and kind of go down the roadmap that we established at our Investor Day back in April. We fully intend to continue to do that and we do see some significant efficiency benefits coming from that over the next year.","But I also would say that as we continue to grow our Market Technologies businesses, particularly the surveillance business, there are opportunities to continue to scale in that business. But that's a, I would say that we have also \u2013 we're also making some investments in that business to make sure that we're positioning it for the next 5 years to 10 years of future growth. So there are some investments there in addition to the opportunity to scale whereas in Corporate Solutions there's a very clear path that we are undertaking to get to a higher margin.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Thank you. Very helpful. And the one follow-up would be on NFX, the $0.02 drag. Is that reported in net revenues or is it actually \u2013 is it net revenue positive or is it really a drag on expenses or is it a drag on net revenues or a drag on expenses?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","We do get net positive revenue from the NFX business, but we obviously have higher expenses than we have revenues. So therefore we would expect that \u2013 so the drag is really coming from the expenses as compared to the revenue intake so far.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","There is \u2013 we're still negative on the revenue side on NFX total. We are charging now but through the rebates, et cetera, we still are a negative standpoint.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Okay, sorry. All right.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Understood. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Can you guys talk to us a little bit about the strategy in fixed income, what is your Nasdaq's value proposition? What are the plans to grow that business?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Well, when we look at it specifically for the U.S. Treasuries business, I think that we see the opportunity for us to, first of all focus our efforts. So we had two initiatives that we had started to launch in 2016 that we've chosen not to continue to pursue, because we really want to focus on the core business and the core value proposition, that the Nasdaq fixed income business provides.","And when we look at ways that we can provide our clients with better service or better capabilities, I think there are three things that we're focused on as we go into 2017. The first are some new critical order types that we expect to introduce in the first half of the year. The second is continued rollout of new assets into the platform and trying to get more volume into those assets, mainly off-the-run assets.","And then the third is the potential for us to look at creating more of a direct connect between the dealers and their clients, but through some interfaces and networking that we can provide using our technology as opposed to having to have them have to build that outside in their own infrastructure. So there are ways that we are looking at continuing to build on the business that we have and we would expect that as we go through the year we'll start to see the benefits of that.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Adena, I'm sorry, if I missed this, your target margins for the Corporate Services business in 2017 and 2018?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","We have not provided target margins for the Corporate Services business. What we will continue to provide you though is the Technology Solutions margin as it was prior \u2013 previously reported because of the fact that we've given you a target margin for that combined segment. So we want to continue to provide that transparency to you, and therefore, we will continue to provide that as we march to that 20% goal. But we're not providing a separate and distinct Corporate Services margin goal at this point.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And as you said, before I guess, most of the cost saves are focused toward the margin improvement and focused really on the core basis and in the legacy Corporate Solutions product suite, is that correct?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Right, and it's a combination of \u2013 it's margin improvement combined with \u2013 for a combination of both continuing to progress the business and the value proposition to the clients in addition to finding new efficiencies, yes.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I understand that the tax rate guidance, so 30% to 32%. So we assume that then steps up from that low pace in the first quarter back almost to a normalized rate in the third quarter through fourth quarters, or is there opportunity for further tax rate reduction?","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","So it's really tied to the timing of the vesting of the equity where it's historically. So, we provided the guidance for the full year and for the first quarter. The second quarter we'll go back more of a normalized run rate. The third quarter we'll probably be down, again the tax rate will be down again. We'll provide greater guidance as we get closer to that rate and we get more assurity as to what the percentages might be, but you can use the average for the year in that range and that does take into account that there should be also a drop in the third quarter.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. Okay. Great, I'll get back in the queue. Thanks.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Just to be clear, it won't be as big a drop as it was in the first quarter, it will be much smaller than the first one.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right, great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Warren Gardiner with Evercore. You may begin.","Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks. I think you guys referred to some pricing changes to some of your market data offerings in the last few months. You increased some, you lowered some others. So just wondering if you had any thoughts on how we should maybe thinking about the net impact from some of those all else equal?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. While we take a very strategic approach to looking at market data pricing across the suite of products that we have both in the U.S. and in Europe, and we take a very measured approach to looking at how we can generate value for our clients and therefore pursue some pricing changes in our products, we don't do a standard sweep of pricing increases on an annual basis, that's not our approach at all. But we do anticipate that the pricing changes that we have proposed and implemented in the market data business in particular will generate somewhere in the range of \u2013 I think around 2% growth, but it's not \u2013 it's not particularly significant, but it is something that we continue to pursue in connection with of course, growing the demand for our products, as well as introducing new products in the business.","Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC","Sure. Of course. Thanks. And then, on NFX, I think, you said, 200K contracts in January, just could you remind us where breakeven there is? I think you'd kind of said that level before but I could be off on that.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","I don't think we've ever provided you a breakeven level specifically on contracts traded. We have a combination of growth in the contracts traded as well as continued work with our clients to effectuate some pricing increases, as we go into 2017, and through the year, and we are working in collaboration with them, to establish what those pricing increases should be, in connection with those products, where we've had a critical mass of market share. So that's a dynamic conversation that we have with our clients, but we \u2013 they are very aware of and supportive of us making certain pricing moves to continue to get to a sustainable level within that business, but it's going to be a combination of those pricing changes and continued growth in the contracts traded, and we've not provided any specific goals for that publicly.","Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may begin.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just starting on the Corporate Solutions business, I guess nice to see the 2% organic growth. Can you just give us a little bit more color here, what's driving that and as we look into 2017, do you think that organic growth rate can accelerate and coming back to pricing, can you just remind us in the Corporate Solutions, are they annual inflators at the beginning of the year, do they have come throughout the year? Or, should we actually expect a tick-up already in the first quarter as we compare to the fourth quarter growth rate here?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Alex. So the first thing I would say is that we are obviously encouraged by the fact that we have gotten to the point of stabilizing the revenue and now experiencing some organic growth in the business. We certainly are hopeful that we can continue that momentum into 2017, and we are doing that sort of combination of a lot of things, one is continuing to improve and increase the value proposition to the clients to making \u2013 to make it so that it's more interesting for the clients to take our products or maybe expand our usage of our products as well as making sure that we can retain the clients because this is a renewal type of business, so that's very important for us to make sure that we can renew our clients every year.","And then on top of that, we are making sure that we invest in certain innovations that make these types of offerings more compelling to them. In terms of what drove the fourth quarter specifically, we were \u2013 we found the highest growth in the advisory business, which is a part of our IR intelligence suite where we provide very detailed information around ownership levels for publicly listed companies, as well as in our board portal space, that continues to be a great growth business for us, and so those were the two drivers of growth in the quarter.","In terms of pricing changes, we do do modest pricing changes, not across the entire suite of solutions, every year we make a determination as to where we believe that it's appropriate to do pricing changes, but we have, but they are very modest within the contracts they are very, we have a cap, it's somewhere in the range of anywhere from 2% to 3% and we have done those as we've gone into 2017, and that just kind of flows into the business. We don't make mid-year pricing changes as a general matter.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Great color. Thank you. And then, just going to the Market Services side for a minute, you highlighted the options performance and the market share improvements so far this year. Can you just give us a little bit more color, what exactly you are doing, you have obviously six different markets, so now, so what exactly are you doing? And then secondly, given the I think 5 percentage point increase year-to-date, any early color on the pricing trends which we'll be thinking about in terms of rate per contract in the first quarter and going forward? Thank you.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. So, well we are \u2013 we're very aligned with our clients, and so we spend a lot of time working with them to determine how best to enable them to effectuate their strategies within the options markets that we have. We now have, of course have six options markets, and a lot of different choices in how they can participate in the options business. So it does give them more opportunity to work with us to find ways to effectuate their strategies. We have had some of our larger clients choose to increase their participation in our market. We are very pleased with that, and that of course brings with it follow-on volume from other clients who want to interact with that flow, and that's been driving the increase.","In terms of the contracts, the pricing per contract, the \u2013 there are volume tiers and others things in the market, so we would anticipate that as to the extent that they are bringing in more flow and creating and hitting certain levels that we might see a slight decline in the contract \u2013 pricing per contract as it has to do with the (39:35) incremental market share, but nothing dramatic.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks a lot. Adena, just given the new segmentation, I think it makes a lot of sense but I think the \u2013 when you guys look at like the growth outlook by segment, it seems like the segmentation on the Corporate Services that adds that lower growth rate is increasing in size. And so just wanted to get a sense on how do you look at the overall growth rate, just given that that used to be Listings and now it's Corporate, that's on the lower end. Does that have much of an impact or is it just you maybe being conservative right now and we'll see how it plays out over 2017 and 2018, particularly as Corporate Solutions, you guys revamped it, and seeing how that kind of takes hold in the market.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Well this is just a movement of the segments, but overall for the non-trading businesses we continue to project out that we have outlook of mid-single-digits growth across all of our non-trading businesses. I think that in terms of looking at how we've broken it out now, you can see that we believe that the Market Technology business has more of a mid to high single-digits opportunities, whereas the Corporate Solutions and combined with Listings continues to have more of a low single-digits growth opportunity for now. And I think that that's our outlook at the moment and we will continue to refine that as we continue to progress the businesses.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And then, Michael, just on the leverage and your outlook in terms of hitting the net, debt-to-EBITDA ratio, just wanted to get a sense, you guys list both the net and the gross. So just wanted to get a sense over the next 12 months to 18 months, which one are you looking at to get to the mid 2 times just so we understand how much flexibility you have for buybacks or other uses.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. We look at that on a gross basis, and we're aiming for that for the mid 2018 as you know that's where we'll be heading towards that mid 2 times.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. And in terms of buyback activity, as we've said, we've actually been saying this since the middle of last year. We will continue our buyback activity primarily associated with managing our share count, but we will also take opportunities when they present themselves to do buybacks as well.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, everybody. Good morning. Just a question around the Market Tech business, so the order intake was very strong in the fourth quarter. But kind of uneven I guess throughout the year. So I was wondering if you can give us an update on the typical kind of conversion timing and as we think about the revenue trends into the next year, should some of these wins be more, I guess backend loaded just given the timing of the order intake. Thanks.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. So order intake does tend to progress as you go through the year, and there will be certain years where we might have some large contracts signed earlier in the year. But for this particular year, we just found that a lot of our clients are kind of making these big decisions towards the end of the year. So we're very pleased with that.","I think also the introduction of the Nasdaq Financial Framework did catalyze more conversations with clients, and that takes time for them to understand what we are presenting to them in terms of the next generation technology, and getting them to understand the value that it presents to them and their business, and that then also culminated in some sales later in the year.","In terms of revenue conversion under the current accounting guidelines or the way that we account for that revenue today, it does, as you know we don't account for revenue until we've fully deployed the solution into the client. So that's why there was such a lag with Borsa Istanbul, in terms of when we signed the contract versus when we started seeing revenue earlier this year.","And so, for these clients, these \u2013 I mean, across all of that order intake some of it will be \u2013 some of it will be recognized frankly within six months and some other of the revenue might not be recognized for another year or 18 months. But none of them are as big and complex as the Borsa Istanbul deal in terms of taking years to be able to show up in the revenue.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. You may begin.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. I guess first and a follow-up on, I think a question a few questions ago. Did you repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter, it didn't seem like it?","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","No, we didn't repurchase any in the fourth quarter. We continue to analyze it and we will continue to repurchase shares as Adena mentioned. But we do it on a \u2013 we look at it overall and for the year we repurchased about $100 million in shares for the year and we'll continue to repurchase as we go forward.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just to keep questioning this out, like there were some big dips in the stock during the quarter. I think Adena mentioned that there was \u2013 that you would pursue more of an opportunistic share repurchase. Any additional flavor you can give us as to maybe why those dips didn't represent good opportunities or did you just sort of hit the kind of the, what you expected to repurchase for the year earlier than expected?","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's basically, we had achieved a number that we had wanted to for 2016 and as we continue to evaluate the different opportunities in front of us we'll look at the timing. So there isn't a commitment to repurchase every single quarter. But we will take a look at that going forward.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that makes sense. Thank you very much. And then, just in terms of the options business, can you flush out the recent market share increases? I think it was Adena again who mentioned the focus on the complex order business. Maybe how are you winning share there? And then, I think, when the deal was announced, Nasdaq indicated it would reinvest a portion of the corporate savings into price reductions to win share. Maybe talk about pricing more broadly in options as well. Thanks.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, I would say that the conversations we've had with clients in terms of having them drive their volume into the platforms has not been specific to complex order functionality, but rather the overall value proposition we have between kind of the pro rata market, the complex market, and the price-time market. So, it wasn't specific to any sort of complex order strategies that they were trying to deploy.","In terms of the pricing and we did make some moves earlier last year, leading up to the close and then right after the close, we did make some pricing moves across some of the price-time markets and those who were already \u2013 they've already manifested themselves into the pricing. And as of right now, that's kind of what we're carrying forward with us.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Buckingham Research. You may begin.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Morning, everybody. I just want to follow up a little bit on Alex's question on market technology. You gave us some color, a decent amount of the order intake was driven by existing clients. Just wondering, when you kind of think about the \u2013 kind of the penetration of existing clients in terms of what's left to go, i.e., is this just kind of a chunky quarter or is there a lot more opportunity with your existing client base to kind of see the upgrade you saw this quarter and then maybe any thoughts around new clients and the potential for growth there?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Well, I would say that we continue to have a very healthy pipeline of opportunities across both our existing clients and new clients for our core market tech business. And just to remind everyone, the market technology business is really in three components. There is the core market technology business that we offer out to other marketplaces around the world; there's the smart surveillance business that's offered both to marketplaces and broker dealers and now also institutional investors around the world and then there's the GRC platform that's really primarily offered to corporate clients. So we do have a lot of different ways for us to penetrate our clients or grow our client base","And I would say that where we're seeing a lot of opportunity, number one, is we have been working with new markets that want to launch in new asset classes that are frankly not necessarily financial asset classes. And so that's a really fun and exciting area, because we're able to leverage our core technology. And particularly the Nasdaq Financial Framework, because it's cloud-enabled, does allow us to essentially launch markets in the cloud now and that is kind of a very compelling offer to some new markets that are looking at new ways to generate liquidity in other asset classes, so that would include the two that I mentioned in my script.","I think that then on the existing clients in the core market technology business, we have a healthy pipeline of clients who are looking to upgrade or really upgrade their existing platforms as well as broaden out what they do with us. So, where you can see with Borsa Istanbul, we had more than 10 components that they implemented with us, whereas some of our other clients were still working on one or two. So we do have the opportunity to expand across what we do with our existing clients and that manifested itself in some of the order intake that came in the end of the year.","And then in the smart surveillance business, that continues to be a very high-growth business for us. We continue to penetrate the broker-dealer space with our surveillance offerings. We're now offering a key e-coms compliance combined with surveillance, total package using very advanced machine intelligence. And then we also have launched a buy-side platform, specifically for them in surveillance, and we already have some early clients working with us to implement that. So, we have a lot of growth opportunities across the businesses.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. That's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. You may begin.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just another follow-up on capital. I know the focus right now is on deleveraging, but I'd still like to hear your thoughts on M&A at current valuations in the market, and how you weigh that versus capital return. And then, I guess, a second part to that question is if you could update us on the capital return front, whether we should think about a continued shift towards a dividend, away from share repurchases, just given that we usually get an update on the dividend next quarter. Thanks.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Great. So, I share Bob's general view that we need to take a balanced approach to looking at how we deploy our capital across the franchise. We focus on R&D and we've given you view as to looking at essentially somewhere in the range of 2% of our revenue. We're trying to make sure we're investing in R&D. I think that we also look at the capital return in terms of our dividend, and we're very committed to that, and I'll touch on that a little bit more in a minute, share buybacks. But then also making sure that we do take advantage of opportunities that are in the market to expand our business meaningfully, and provide good returns for you.","We are very disciplined in the way that we look at the return profile on deals. I think that the deals that we've done over the last two-and-a-half years, since I've been here, I think reflect the fact that we are very, very focused on making sure we generate great returns to you as shareholders, but also really meaningful improvements in what we can offer our clients, and we will continue to do that as part of our strategy.","In terms of dividends versus buybacks, again I think we do take a balanced approach to that, and we will continue to do that. We will provide any sort of updated guidance on our dividend in the next quarter, and that's all I'll say about that right now.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And then if I could just have one follow-up. At least (51:23) on the Listings business. I think back in 2015 you introduced that all-inclusive fee structure. And if I remember correctly, your clients had the opportunity to opt into that fee plan in 2015. I'm just curious when all the clients will be migrated to that, or if it already happened. And if there's another corresponding bump in revenues we should be thinking about in either 2017 or 2018.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Well, they will all be migrated onto that pricing next year in 2018. And so this year, it continues to be a voluntary program, and we have had the majority of our clients move into that all-inclusive fee, because it is very compelling for them, particularly if they do \u2013 they have any sort of share incidences (52:04) across, in their business. So, but we will be migrating all of our clients onto that new fee structure next year.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Rutschow with CLSA. You may begin.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi, good morning. I just had a big picture question. You know, as the new management team, I expect you've taken a fresh look at all of your businesses. So I'm hoping you can give some perspective on what if any revenue synergies you see from having cash equities, options and derivatives trading under the same roof.","Or in other words, listings, trading and market data and corporate solutions all seem to fit together, but the revenue synergies between cash equities, trading and options, and derivatives aren't quite as clear. So, can you make that case?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","I think that, well, we do have some restrictions in our ability to generate kind of pricing synergies across exchanges in the United States. The SEC, we have proposed the opportunity for us to provide pricing across our exchanges and try to leverage the fact that we do have great businesses in equities and options in the United States as well as in Europe. But, the \u2013 there are some regulatory restrictions to our ability to do any sort of cross pricing. In terms of though \u2013 in terms of the way that we work with our clients, in terms of connecting into our data center and leveraging all of the capabilities we have, I think that we do find that we have much deeper relationships with our customers because we can offer them an opportunity to trade across asset classes, the complex order functionality in ISC or in our options business now does allow them to create strategies across equities and options.","And we actually are continuing to look at, particularly in the data products area, ways that we can look at the options data and make \u2013 and using machine intelligence find opportunities potentially in equities. So, there are things we can do, but we do have some regulatory restrictions because each of these exchanges are separate and distinct exchanges.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Maybe just one more on NFX for, I guess within your expense guidance and you did give some commentary on the expense versus the net revenue drag with \u2013 I guess within your guidance, are you still expecting that to be a $0.02 drag per quarter for the year or do you expect that to improve to a breakeven by year-end?","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","So, there does continue to have about a $0.02 order in the short-term, although depending on the timing, as we see volume increases and the pricing changes start to come in, obviously that will start to, we hope breakeven and then reach profitability. So, I would say built into the guidance does assume that we will continue to have that expense \u2013 the expenses behind it. The revenue impact of that is not included obviously in that expense guidance, that shows up in the revenue line. So there continues to be the expense behind it, but the revenue piece of that we hope to improve as we go throughout the year.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then, maybe just one last one on I think Adena you were talking about some of the longer term, some of your longer term visionary goals and one of the big ones is obviously to commercial technology and I appreciate that's a very long-term endeavor, but can you talk about \u2013 you mentioned machine learning, blockchain and the cloud, and you did touch on your comments in response to some other questions, on a couple of those, but maybe if you could talk about how you see that evolving in the different segments in 2017 and 2018, and to what extent can we see that start to filter into revenue?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Well, I think that the primary area of initial opportunity as we continue to deploy the blockchain and certainly the cloud, as well as, machine intelligence, I would say all are primarily focused in the Market Technology business because of the fact that the Nasdaq Financial Framework is cloud enabled and provides full blockchain capabilities from pre-trade risk management all the way to settlement. So we do have some near-term opportunities to leverage those technologies with clients who are paying to deploy those technologies within their markets. And so, we definitely see that as a good area of growth for us. I would say primarily in 2018, but certainly with order intake in 2017.","And then, of course, with the SMARTS business we are fully integrating natural language processing machine intelligence capabilities from a partner into our solutions. And so that is a near-term, immediate term, and we already have on two clients signed up to do proof of concept with us and we do anticipate to have signed clients this year for that.","And then on the Trading and Insights business, our platform, which is in our Information Services business, we are specifically working with several machine intelligence companies to leverage their capabilities to look at our data and find potential alpha signals within our data, as well as actually bringing in other third-party data into the platform. And it's a really fun and exciting area for us. That will take a while for that to manifest itself. We already having paying clients using some of those machine intelligence-driven products, but that's very early days, and we do anticipate continuing to rollout products over the next several years to grow that into a critical mass, but that is a long-term opportunity for us with some near-term revenue but against the entire revenue stream of GIS business, it will continue to be small in the short run.","And then lastly in the Corporate Solutions business, we will be starting to work with the machine intelligence in the IR intelligence suite, and that's, we haven't yet done that though, so that's kind of right in the beginning of where we are looking at ways to innovate on the IR intelligence side of the business.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, that's really helpful. And then is this mostly obviously all of those initiatives are organic, but as you see, your vision in commercializing technology looking forward, do you view it as much more of an organic strategy or do you think a number of acquisitions may be required or be opportunistic to leverage that further?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","I would say that we are primarily focused on organic opportunities. We may have the \u2013 we have made a couple of strategic and small investments into some interesting and growing technology companies most notably in the blockchain and machine intelligence area, and we may continue to do that. But at this point, we are focused on this being organic. We have been growing our team of data scientists. We have been growing our capabilities and our expertise in the blockchain. We have I think a spectacular technology team that really is working hard to make sure that we can create as many organic opportunities as possible across these technologies. So, we're very excited about it.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Great. That's great color. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. You may begin.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. Good morning. Just two quick ones. First one, maybe I missed this. What was the reason for the quarter-on-quarter drop in the data products revenue this quarter? And then secondly, if you could just comment on the mandate fee proposal for the price changes you are planning to make for the SIP and connectivities since last year? Thanks.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","So, the quarter-on-quarter drop in the data revenue was primarily due to two reasons. One, we were slightly lower in our audit revenue in the quarter, down, we were $3 million this quarter down from $4 million last quarter. And the second reason is due to FX, so there was sort of a slight impact of FX, so that was what caused the difference.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","And with regard to the, we call it Trade Management Solutions now instead of Access Services, but the connectivity fee filing that you're mentioning, we have amended that filing and we do continue to work with the SEC to get it to be approved. I think that it will \u2013 that the filing itself in terms of the proposal itself does not have a very significant impact on our revenue, it was a modest filing to begin with and it will continue to be a modest filing in its refined form.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may begin.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Hey. Thanks again for letting me come back on here. Just a couple more, just coming back to NFX, I guess, first of all good to see that you cut the cord on NLX, but I would say, some investors probably thought you should have done it a long time ago, and that's really the question with NFX. Like, how do you think about the timing of that business in terms of when you need to make a decision if you want to be in that business or not. I heard you saying about profitability later this year, but clearly it's taken up a decent amount of resources. So just talk about like how you think about the timing of that business and any decision making. And, just maybe, lastly related to that, the reason why I'm asking is some people argue that the reason why the multiple is lower than some of the peers is some of that initiative spending and some of the inconsistencies around capital return. So do you want to comment on that, as part of the question? That would be great too.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Okay. Well, I would spend a couple of minutes comparing NFX to NLX. I think that NLX, we do want to make sure that when we make investments in these types of things that we are finding every opportunity to succeed, and we are working very closely with the clients to understand whether they see a path to success as well.","And with NLX, I think that as we went through last year and we continued to struggle in terms of building up open interest in the platform and we continue to have significant delays from LCH in their ability to support cross margining across the short-end, which only came towards the beginning of last year, and then, the long-end still hasn't arrived, and now they're delaying it even further. It really essentially created or eliminated the momentum in that business and we started to get the sense that they just \u2013 our clients did not see a path to success for the business. And then, I would say that now we can compare that to NFX. In NLX, we topped out at maybe 100,000 contracts of open interest in the platform and that was before last year. So last year we did not top 50,000 contracts in open interest.","In NFX, we have almost 1.5 million contracts of open interest. We have daily volumes of, as I mentioned north of 200,000 contracts a day, we continue to onboard new clients. Our Market Advisory Committee is incredibly engaged and committed to the platform, they continue to push us to add new products onto the platform, they are continuing to bring other clients into the platform; it's been an amazing experience in terms of the motivation that our customers have in NFX to drive to a sustainable competitor in the business.","They want to see competition in this business, they appreciate the fact that OCC has come in as a clearing house to support the business and they are very, very committed to us. So, it's just a totally different experience with our customers as we've looked at the juxtaposition of these two businesses. And, it was time \u2013 I think with NLX to say this does just \u2013 we don't see a path to long-term success here, whereas NFX we see, we do see a path to long-term success, assuming we can continue the momentum in the business and that continued commitments from the customers, which is really pretty spectacular right now.","I think that in terms of looking at a path to profitability for NFX, just to refine Michael's comments, we do see a path to profitability. Do we expect that to happen this year? It may not, just, it all depends on how much growth we can get in contracts traded and how much of the pricing that we can implement as we go through the year.","So, I just want to say that we continue to see a path, it may not be this year, it may be that we end up hitting that next year but that's certainly our expectation and our goal.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","And, sorry, just to come back, but in terms of my comment on the multiple do you agree or do you think it's the wrong way to look at it, that some of that inconsistency on cap returns and that some of that spending is weighing on potentially the stock and valuation or is that something that you thought about?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well in a business where we generate over $2 billion in revenue, the idea that we would commit $40 million to $50 million in R&D activities to me seems actually very, you could argue prudent, or you could even say that we can \u2013 we need to find even more opportunities for us to invest in our future.","So I feel very confident and comfortable that we're making the right level of investment in R&D, I think that the key is for us to make sure that we are focusing our R&D efforts on things that we believe can generate the right long-term return on invested capital and we look at every R&D initiative going forward. We will look at it on \u2013 on a long-term ROIC.","Now, organic activities and organic growth as compared to M&A. M&A tends, you tend to have a shorter time horizon for looking at the return of invested capital, because you're investing more capital upfront and you're buying an existing business and then you are integrating it quicker, whereas organic growth opportunities some might manifest themselves with an ROIC over three years, some over five years, and some over longer, but we need to make sure we know that going in and we look at that and calibrate what's the return we expect versus the investment and therefore how long are we going to give it to have runway to grow. And that's a very, very important focus for me and it is something that I'm extremely committed to working on with Michael to make sure that we are balancing that out appropriately as we look at new opportunities in the business.","So I feel that and then on the capital return side, we've been extremely committed to returning capital to shareholders through a growing dividend that we've had, I think we've gotten to, I think a nice return profile for the clients -for our shareholders, sorry, on the dividend. I also think that we've been very opportunistic and strong in our share repurchase program.","So I feel like we are returning a lot of capital to shareholders while we're also investing in our growth and that is the right way for us to run this business. And I think that that's we will continue to do going forward.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back over to Adena Friedman for closing remarks.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you. Well, thanks everyone for your time today.

We have opportunities across our businesses to leverage that foundation to continue to grow and expand our relationships across our broker-dealer, investor, corporate and exchange clients, and we are excited about our ambitions for 2017.","So with that, thank you very much, and this concludes the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Ditmire - Nasdaq, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's second quarter 2017 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Michael Ptasznik, our CFO; Ed Knight, our General Counsel; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A.","The press release and presentation are on our website.

Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I now will turn the call over to Adena.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you, Ed. Good morning and thank you for joining us this morning. I am pleased to have the opportunity today to report our strong second quarter 2017 results, update you on our progress regarding our 2017 execution priorities, and discuss our long-term strategic initiatives, and importantly, how we are progressing with them.","The company's second quarter results were strong, particularly in our non-GAAP diluted EPS growth of 12% year-over-year. Additionally, we set new quarterly records, including total net revenues of $602 million and non-GAAP operating income of $287 million, up 8% and 11%, respectively, year-over-year.","We achieved this despite a lackluster backdrop in terms of the beta for the capital markets industry with respect to volatility and trading volumes. The average daily VIX in the second quarter was near all-time lows and about 25% below the prior year period. That said, when I look closely at the quarter, and more broadly at the company's progression during my first six months as CEO, I continue to be encouraged by the consistently high level of execution I see from our team, as well as the enormous potential and possibilities for this firm.","During those first six months of 2017, we achieved record revenues up 8% year-over-year, while our margin expansion drove non-GAAP operating and pre-tax income up 10%, also setting new highs. Organic revenue growth in the first half of the year has been 4% across our non-trading businesses, led by 10% in Market Technology, 4% in Information Services, and 1% in Corporate Services, while our Market Services segment is improving after industry volume headwinds starting the year off with a negative 1Q growth. The balance in our business allows us to grow in a wide variety of underlying macroeconomic and business circumstances.","Our results were achieved from a combination of our relentless focus on our clients and shareholders, our confident commitment to hold a long-term view of the opportunities we see on the horizon, and our strong conviction and our ability to realize them.","With respect to the second quarter of 2017, in particular, I'd like to review some highlights. On the revenue side, our Information Services business delivered record revenues of $144 million, with 7% organic growth, particularly driven by our index business, though growth in proprietary data revenues were also solid. While Market Technology grew 4% organically in Q2, we think it is especially important to view its progress in terms of the annual cycle. And to this point, our year-to-date growth has been 10%. And we continue to execute on significant opportunities that we believe will continue to deliver material growth in the coming periods.","Market Services achieved positive organic growth of 2%, despite the lackluster volume environment due to strong market share performance across its largest trading categories, along with continued positive organic growth in Trade Management Services. As with the last quarter, across our largest equity derivatives and cash equity marketplaces, we're very pleased with our performance in the areas under our control, notably market share, pricing, and the implementation of performance and functional enhancements.","Corporate Services saw revenues increase 1%, but produce a 10% increase in operating income, as margins expanded meaningfully in the corporate solutions business. Looking at our broader profitability, we realized significant benefits during the quarter from the disciplined approach to operating efficiency that you've come to expect from this firm. Our 48% non-GAAP operating income margin in the second quarter of 2017 was at multiyear highs.","I want to provide you with an update on the key execution priorities that we outlined for 2017, which are completing the acquisitions \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 the integrations of our acquisitions, increasingly commercializing our expertise in key disruptive technologies, and improving our competitive position across all of our businesses. In terms of the work we're doing to complete the integration of our 2016 acquisitions, we have completed the transition of Chi-X Canada, and we are well under way with the ISD transition to the Nasdaq technology platform. We completed one market earlier in the spring. We are mid-roll-out of the largest ISD market now. And we will complete the third in the fall.","We have already reached our original cost synergy targets 12 months after the closing of the last of the four acquisitions completed in 2016, which is a full six months ahead of the 18-month target that we set originally. And we've identified additional synergies that Michael will detail later.","The next priority we outlined at the beginning of the year is focused on putting innovative solutions in our clients' hands through the commercialization of disruptive technologies, where we've invested and partnered to develop special areas of expertise.","To that end, we continue to be encouraged with the progress of the Nasdaq Financial Framework, our next generation Market Tech platform that is fully cloud and blockchain enabled. Building on the NFF sales we announced last quarter, this quarter we've signed agreements with AIFC Exchange, which is Kazakhstan's newest stock exchange; Dep\u00f3sito Central de Valores, the Chilean CSD, and an agreement with the SIX Swiss Exchange to implement a distributed ledger technology based solution for SIX's structured product business.","We also launched the Nasdaq Analytics Hub in the second quarter, which has a number of robust proprietary and third party datasets, as well as analytics layer leveraging machine intelligence. This product expands how we serve the buy-side in their investment decision-making process and has generated significant interest since its announcement earlier this year. Our initial launch has generated widespread interest and has led to 20 firms formally trialing the product so far.","The feedback from the trial users has been encouraging. And in the second half of 2017 we have opportunities to turn those users into subscription paying customers, as well as expand the product to include new data sets and functionality, further expanding its appeal. As we have said before, this is a long-term growth opportunity for us. And we are just at the beginning of the journey.","Yesterday's announcements of the Sybenetix acquisition, a small London-based technology company, is another good example of how we are applying disruptive technologies, in this case machine learning, to benefit our client. This company has pioneered a behavioral science-based approach, incorporating machine learning, which originally applied to serve the buy-side surveillance needs, and which will further our buy-side initiatives. But we will also plan to incorporate it into the SMARTS regulatory exchange and sell-side offerings as well.","Lastly, in terms of our 2017 execution priorities is our goal to improve our competitive position across all of our businesses. In Market Services, we're focused on sequential progress, so I'll compare the first half of 2017 to the preceding six-month period or the second half of 2016. In our three largest trading areas, we improved U.S. options share to 42% from 39%, U.S. equities to 18% from 17%, and European equities to 65% from 63%. I attribute these gains quite simply to our effective engagement with our clients and as a result of finding new opportunities to bring our broad array of marketplace solutions to bear to solve their most important challenges.","Along those lines, we've decided to unify management of all of our Market Services businesses under Tom Wittman, our Executive Vice President of Global Market Services, as a reflection of the way many of our customers are bringing their electronic trading across multiple asset classes into a more holistic management and organizational structure. We want to thank John Shay, who managed our FIC businesses previously, for his work over the recent periods in helping to bring that business enhanced client focus and energy. And we wish him very well as he moves on to new endeavors.","Another area of strong progress has been in our index business. AUM and licensed exchange traded products, tracking Nasdaq indices, reached $147 billion at the end of June, up 36% year-over-year, far outpacing the market gains of 19% for the NASDAQ Composite or 10% for the S&P 500. One of the most interesting drivers of how we've outperformed is that we've added $7 billion in AUM from new products introduced over the last three years. Therefore, our innovation and deep relationships with our key ETF sponsor partners have enhanced our growth potential and our index business, and we're very proud of our progress.","To this point, in this quarter we were pleased to partner with First Trust on the launch of a new suite of ETFs called Nasdaq Riskalyze, and with VictoryShares, which launched its first ETF tracking the Nasdaq Multi-Factor Minimum Volatility Index.","In addition to the very clear ways our Market Services and index businesses have made share advances, the competitive position of our Market Technology business continues to advance. The investments we continue to make to upgrade our offering with the next generation capabilities of the Nasdaq Financial Framework are moving the needle in terms of what is required to compete and have materially improved our already strong competitive position.","Clients that can benefit from next generation capabilities, such as blockchain and cloud, have become exceptional candidates for the Nasdaq offering. As I pointed to in my opening remarks, there is nothing more important to me and this management team right now than satisfying our client needs and ensuring that we identify and execute on opportunities to drive organic growth across this firm.","I believe the recipe for the success in this endeavor will always center on our people and our culture. And to this end, I am focused on making sure we continue to develop a world class collaborative team that enables Nasdaq to innovate effectively and execute on growth opportunities and the competitive challenges we face.","Our R&D program, which we've communicated as totaling $40 million to $50 million of annual investment spend, encompasses several initiatives that we believe will create long term client and shareholder value. Over recent quarters, we've communicated our plans and progress to you across these important growth initiatives, including NFX, our U.S. futures exchange, where our open interest now stands at over 3 million contracts and volumes and participate continue to be developing well.","NPM Alt, our liquidity solutions for alternative asset management, which we announced in April; Analytics Hub, which we launched in May and have discussed on the call today; and several SMARTS surveillance growth initiatives, the Nasdaq Financial Framework is being funded through our core Market Tech and Market Services businesses as a more foundational investment to drive those businesses and our entire business forward.","We also launched our Ventures program earlier this year, and we have one new investment so far. More broadly, our new initiatives have given us an opportunity to engage more with our clients and then concentrate our investments and resources to focus on the opportunities that can best help us grow over the long term.","We also continue to adapt and respond to the regulatory \u2013 the evolving regulatory and geopolitical backdrop, working closely with regulators. We are on a mission to ensure that the regulatory framework in the U.S. supports much-needed reform to increase the appeal of the public market, and benefit innovative and growing companies that will lead our economy forward.","In May, we released a blueprint for revitalizing the U.S. capital markets, including recommendations we see as essential for the U.S. routine is preeminent in the global capital market. This blueprint encapsulates Nasdaq's view for the public companies' critical and invaluable role in the capital market ecosystem, and our desire to leverage our unique position as the exchange that is invested to deliver the most comprehensive set of solutions to corporate issuers, to advocate on their behalf and, in doing so, support entrepreneurs, innovation and job growth in all of their positive forms for our economy.","To close my commentary, I feel that this year so far is demonstrating the balance and resiliency of our model in being able to achieve meaningful progress and growth, despite a volume environment that remains challenging. The profitability this delivers allows us to continue to invest in our future through our growth initiatives, as well as deliver strong capital returns to our shareholders.","Now, I'll turn it over to Michael to review the financial detail.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.","I will start by reviewing second quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter, as shown on page 3 of the presentation, and organic growth on pages 4 and 14. The 8%, or $43 million, increase in reported record net revenue of $602 million consisted of $34 million in net revenues from our 2016 acquisitions of ISE and Boardvantage and organic growth of $15 million, with 3% organic growth in the non-trading segments and 2% growth in Market Services. This is partially offset by a $6 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.","I will now review highlights within each of our reporting segments and all comparisons will be to the prior period, unless otherwise noted. I will start with Information Services, which, as reflected on pages 5 and 14, saw a $10 million, or 7%, increase in revenue, consisting of $9 million, or 7%, organic growth, as well as a $2 million increase related to the ISE acquisition.","Market Technology revenue, as shown on pages 6 and 14, increased $3 million, or 4%, with organic growth primarily driving the change. As Adena noted, organic growth totaled 10% for the first half of 2017, as organic growth in Market Technology tends to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter more than other segments. The growth was driven by increased revenues from software, licensing and support, software-as-a-service, particularly SMARTS surveillance subscriptions, as well as higher change request revenues.","New order intake was $64 million in the second quarter and the period end backlog finished at $799 million, a record high and an increase of 4% from June 2016. The operating margin for Market Technology was 22%, down 3% from 25% in the prior year period, reflecting the investments we have made to upgrade our technology for the next-generation Nasdaq Financial Framework, and enhance and grow our surveillance offering.","Turning to Corporate Services on pages 7 and 14, revenues increased $2 million, or 1%, due to the inclusion of revenue from the Boardvantage acquisition. While listings activity in the Nordic region is robust and related revenue increased as compared to the year-ago period, revenue growth in the Nordics was offset by lower U.S. listings revenues from the runoff of listing of additional share fees and an unfavorable impact due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Reflecting the progress we've achieved in our synergy targets, the Corporate Services operating margin was 27% versus 25% in the prior year period.","Market Services net revenues, on pages 8 and 14, saw a $28 million, or 14%, increase, reflecting the inclusion of $27 million of revenue from the acquisition of ISE and $3 million of organic growth, partially offset by a $2 million adverse impact from the changes in foreign exchange. Market Services operating income increased 1 percentage point to 55% versus 54% in the prior period.","Turning to pages 9 and 14 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased by $15 million. This increase reflects a $9 million, or 3%, organic increase and a $26 million impact from our acquisitions, partially offset by $50 million in synergies and a $5 million favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange. Synergies achievement from our 2016 acquisitions rose to $60 million on a run-rate basis in the second quarter, hitting our original target within 12 months of the closing of the last deal, six months ahead of the original schedule. We've also identified $10 million to $20 million in additional synergies, which will be realized as we complete various platform transitions. But rather than update you on this specifically going forward, this progress will be reflected in our overall operating expense and profitability measures.","Now turning to slide 10, our revised 2017 non-GAAP operating expense guidance is a reduced range of $1.26 billion to $1.29 billion. The updated guidance does reflect our higher planned investment spending in the second half of the year, as well as current exchange rates and the adverse $10 million to $15 million estimated impact of the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against both the Swedish krona and euro. So another way to view this is the reduction would have been larger if the foreign exchange rates had been unchanged.","Non-GAAP operating income increased 11% in the second quarter of 2017 and the non-GAAP operating margin totaled 48%, an increase from 46% in the prior year period. Net interest expense was $34 million in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $3 million versus the prior year period, reflecting the additional interest expense from the financing of our 2016 acquisitions, but also reflecting $1 million of the partial quarter impact of the late May balance sheet restructuring that we did, which I'll review in more detail in just a minute.","The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was 33%, at the low end of the 33% to 35% range we provided during the last quarterly call. And there was no material benefit from the adoption of accounting standard ASU 2016-09, which added $0.13 to our Q1 results. We continue to expect the 2017 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 30% to 32%, and for the third quarter of 2017 we expect the tax rate to also be between 30% and 32%, with the fourth quarter expected to be between 33% and 35%.","Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the second quarter of 2017 was $172 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, compared to $153 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, in the prior year period. There was negligible impact from the change in tax accounting during the period.","Turning to capital, as we indicated last quarter, we redeemed the 5.25% January 2018 bond with a face value of $370 million using a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from the sale of commercial paper issued through Nasdaq's newly established commercial paper program. Additionally, we utilized our CP program to make a $300 million repayment on our term loan.","During the second quarter, our outstanding debt decreased versus March 31, 2017 due to our refinancing activity with $160 million of net debt repayment partially offset by a $91 million increase due to FX from a stronger euro, impacting the value of our euro denominated debt. This resulted in our debt-to-EBITDA ratio ending the period at 3 times, unchanged compared to the first quarter of 2017. We continue to expect to delever to the mid-2s leverage level by mid-2018.","We didn't execute any share repurchases in the second quarter. However, as a reminder, we executed $156 million in buybacks during the first quarter and together with dividend payments, including the 19% increase we announced last quarter, we have returned $272 million to shareholders through the first half of the year. This is double the $139 million returned in the first half of 2016 and represents 76% of our non-GAAP net income for the first half of the year.","Looking forward in respect to our capital deployment and return priorities, while in the near term our actions in part will reflect our commitment to deleverage moderately over the next four quarters, we are looking to optimize returns to shareholders with the following ways. One, continued investment in organic growth initiatives, such as the Analytics Hub that Adena referred to in her remarks.","Two, carefully considered M&A, especially tuck-in acquisitions that have great fit with our strategy and meet stringent investment return profiles, such as the 2016 acquisitions and our Sybenetix acquisition announced yesterday. Three, continuing to grow our dividends as earnings and cash flow increase. And four, buybacks that principally offset the impact of share issuance and, when opportunistic, can additionally return larger amounts of capital.","With that, I'm going to turn things back over to Adena.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you, Michael. We are very pleased that our offerings continue to resonate with our clients and our business continues to perform well for our shareholders. We're very focused on executing on our goals to drive our competitive position, optimize the benefits of our acquisitions, and innovate with new technologies that meet and exceed our clients' expectations.","So with that, we're really excited to turn it over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Richard Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Sir, you may begin.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good morning, Adena. Good morning, Michael. And first, congrats, Adena. You certainly carried on the focus on efficiency from your predecessor.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","So I guess, the first question is on getting away from the efficiencies, but on the top line and the organic growth of the non-trading segments. Market Technology was huge in the first quarter and you acknowledge it's going to be volatile. But I guess, what's the outlook on the top line? I know you're making margin improvement from Corporate Services, but seems like these other segments are still below that mid-single-digit number that you sort of put out there as guidance prior.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","So what I would say with Market Technology, as we've been saying, and I said it in the first quarter even with that strong growth in that one quarter, that we have a long-range outlook of mid-to-high single digits for the Market Technology business, and we continue to support that. So as we look at the first half of the year and because of the volatility, we do tend to look at as the year progresses as opposed to each quarter alone, we have had 10% growth in that business. And we continue to feel that that supports our mid-to-high single-digit overall outlook for the business.","I think with regard to our Information Services business, as you've seen that has obviously had a nice growth this quarter with the growth in our AUM, as well as just continued growth in our proprietary products. And overall, we're at 4% so far this year. And we continue to find opportunities to grow and expand that business. So I feel very comfortable with our mid-single-digit outlook for that business as well.","And then for Corporate Services, we have said that that's a low single digits grower, as a general matter. And with the 1% so far this year, we continue to see opportunities to expand the bottom line. And we obviously continue to find ways to grow that business, but it's a lower grower in general.","And then on Market Services, which we do not give outlook for, because volumes can be so volatile and changing over time, we are starting to see a recovery of volumes in the market, which has definitely helped the Market Services business in the second quarter.","But what I focus on as CEO is those areas that we can control, which are market share and capture rates, as well as functional enhancements and things that can drive businesses forward. And I really do feel that everyone on the team has really been focused on that, and we've been executing well against those goals.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thank you. And then my one follow-up would be, I know this is a small part of your revenue and it's \u2013 to your, I guess, return. But the fixed income, you did mention that you had some turnover at the leadership after very short period. And you continue to have to put out 1 million shares to the acquirer. So I guess, what's the outlook for fixed income? Is this \u2013 it seems like a weak area, I guess, the shares been lost. But can you turn that around? Is it things that can rebound here on the U.S. fixed income?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So when we look at our fixed income, our fixed business more generally, we have the U.S. fixed income or Treasuries business. We have our U.S. Futures Exchange, which is focused on commodities. And then we have our Nordic fixed income business and clearing house, as well as our Nordic power business. And I would say that the macro backdrop across our fixed platform in terms of volumes in general has been low. I think that's been reflected across the industry, and so that's definitely a challenging backdrop.","In terms of our competitive position, specific to our U.S. Treasuries business, we continue to find ways to enhance that platform and try to drive more volume back into the platform. It has been our biggest area of challenge, I would say, within Nasdaq.","And I think that as we move all of our trading businesses under Tom's leadership and into a single organization, we feel that we're going to be able to take all of the talent that really, frankly, has been extremely successful across our equities and options businesses, our derivatives businesses in Europe, and apply that to those areas of challenge within the fixed income business.","And I think that we will continue to work with our customers. And one of the great things that John did coming in was really bring a client orientation to that business. So we want to continue that and to try to drive progress. We had an enhancement that we brought in in June that basically created new functionality around off-the-runs, as well as creating more functionality in our Elect offering, and we do hope that will drive more volume back onto the platform in the coming quarters.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Just a clarifying question on the expenses. Does the updated guide for this year incorporate any of the $10 million to $20 million of incremental synergies you guys have identified?","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yes, it does. That $10 million to $20 million won't all necessarily be realized this year. It'll be realized over the following periods as well, but yes, it does include that.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. But we're not quantifying how much potentially this year versus 2018, I guess?","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","No. Like I said, we're just including it in the overall guidance that we're now providing. And we've hit the $60 million, we think there's additional that we can achieve. But we'll achieve it over future periods instead of continuing to track that separately. It gets harder as we start to integrate these parts of the business and just starting specifically split out the synergies related to different aspects of it. So it's in the plans and we have additional things that we're going to do. But as you start to try and suss it out, it gets a little more difficult. So we're just going to include it in our overall guidance.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. You may begin.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. So what is the driver of the delta in the $10 million to $20 million of additional synergies? So what would lead you to be at $10 million versus $20 million?","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well...","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, I would just say, I think that when we look at the opportunities for us to continue to drive costs out of \u2013 from a technology integration perspective, as well as certain, I would say, agreements that we had with the sellers in terms of transitions, we have the opportunity to find additional efficiencies in the way that we drive the operations forward, but also making sure that we're meeting certain criteria that allow us to roll-off of certain agreements early.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Right. Just a follow-up on SMARTS. What is it as a percentage of revenues and order backlog right now?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","So we don't disclose SMARTS separately from the rest of the Market Technology business, but we are very pleased with the general \u2013 obviously, we have said that SMARTS is a double-digit grower and it continues to be a very strong part of the overall Market Technology business. And we also would say that it is a subscription business, so it's a nice driver in terms of the margins of that business as well. But it is something that we look at as holistically part of what we offer with our market infrastructure business, and we will continue to look at it that way.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. You may begin.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. First question, I guess, is on market structure. It seems like there's going to be at very least a pilot program that's going to be proposed to help understand the impact of lower access fee caps in the cash equities market. Just wondering if we could get updated thoughts on the potential impact to your business if access fee caps were eventually reduced or eliminated over time.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, so I would say that we don't see this as having a material impact on the net capture that Nasdaq or the exchanges in general receive, because the goal of lowering the access fees is to lower the rebates. So I think that that's at the end of the day what the SEC and certain participants are trying to achieve. We've been pretty clear on our position on establishing an access fee pilot. We attempted to do that on our own a couple of years ago, but the rest of the industry didn't follow.","So as we look at what the SEC or what the industry is trying to achieve with lower rebates, which would come from a lower access fee, I think that we just want to make sure that we're cautiously going into that and saying, oh, what is the problem that we're really trying to solve for? And are we really going to be able to use this access fee pilot to really study and solve any specific market structure problems that exists?","The other area of most concern to us is with small to medium-sized companies and the liquidity in those companies. If we think about what rebates are for, rebates were established after decimalization, because the spreads narrowed so dramatically that market makers were finding that they were not motivated to post liquidity openly and available for everyone to access and to see. So rebates were there to drive -- to motivate market makers to post passive liquidity onto the markets.","And I believe that in less liquid stocks, those rebates are an important driver of nice tight spreads in market maker liquidity. So we believe that we have to be very, very mindful and cautious as we walk into any sort of access fee pilot as to what problem we're solving and what potential unintended consequences could result. So we'll see how it progresses, but as I said, we don't see this as having a material impact on exchanges' net capture. The purpose of it is to lower the rebates.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then just one follow-up on the Sybenetix deal. It really grows the compliance offering that you have, but also seems to expand the offering more into the buy-side. Just wondering if you could help us understand the strategy and whether you think that client base, that buy-side client base is a significant opportunity for Nasdaq going forward and maybe also an area of focus for in organic growth? Thanks.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. So, well, I think it is good to point out when we bought SMARTS back in 2010, that business is really primarily driven by providing surveillance solutions to exchanges and regulators. And we started to realize that, that market participants or the sell-side also have very sophisticated trading that they do and they could leverage the exact same alerting and same capabilities to look at their own internal trading behavior and the trading behavior of their client. And so we started \u2013 and we embarked on a program to bring SMARTS into the sell-side, and today we have 140 market participants that use SMARTS surveillance as their core surveillance system. So it's been a very successful strategy over the last seven years.","And when we then look at how the buy-side is becoming more and more sophisticated in terms of their interactions with the market, and their own regulatory obligations have been increasing over the last several years, our view is that the same surveillance and, frankly, the behavioral analytics approach to surveillance that Sybenetix brings is also going to have increasing demand within the asset management industry. So it does open up new avenue for us to continue to grow and expand our surveillance offerings.","So we actually identified this as a strategy for Nasdaq about year and a half ago. We've been building out the SMARTS surveillance buy-side solution. We have clients in the buy-side already using it, but Sybenetix really helps catalyze that growth and brings an orientation to that surveillance that we think is very relevant to them. So we're very excited about that. I think in general, the asset management industry is clearly an area of focus for us right now with our Analytics Hub and with our SMARTS surveillance offering, as well as other things that we'll continue to look to do and, obviously, our index business and data business to continue to drive demand there.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Good morning.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I want to actually pick up on the last point you mentioned around Analytics Hub. Clearly, the growth area within asset management has been around quants recently. I'm assuming, obviously, that's kind of the area where you guys are trying to tap into. So could you spend a couple of minutes just discussing the opportunity you see there for Nasdaq? How are you guys thinking about partnering versus acquiring capabilities in this area? And then, I guess, more importantly, where are the synergies that you guys see between kind of that kind of customer base versus your existing customer base?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Well, it's been \u2013 I would say that we do have a strategy internally to look at how we can expand the value added data that we provide to entire industry, both the sell-side and the buy-side, as well as to brokers that service the retail audience. And what we want to make sure of is we look at leveraging our own data that we have internally and finding signals within that data, using machine intelligence, in addition to bringing in other third party data that provides what I'll call more driver information that would be relevant for a quantamental shop or a pure quant shop that's looking at ways to find \u2013 use data to make a fundamental decision or using data to make a technical decision in terms of their investments.","We want to make sure we build out this hub. We definitely like the idea of partnering with other exchanges, partnering with our clients to find the signals to bring in the data that they're looking for, and to serve their needs. And one of the things that we're really proud of is how we've architected this solution, because it's completely in the cloud. It allows for us to \u2013 allows a client to come in with multiple types of interfaces, it could be fixed or could be APIs or could be \u2013 we can multitask the data out. They can provide data into the platform. They can get as much data or as little data as they want out of the platform. They can do it in real-time or at end of day. It's an extremely flexible platform and it allows us to grow and expand what we're doing in multiple ways. So it is meant to be for the entire industry, but certainly the quantitatively-oriented buy-side strategies, we think, are a good starting point for us to focus our energies.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. And then just a follow-up around, again, some of the newer initiatives around the index business. It seems like competition in this space is definitely heating up and, I guess, not surprising given kind of pricing pressures on ETF managers. Can you guys discuss the pricing in your index business versus some of the larger incumbents and how much of a driver, I guess, has that been in you guys picking up some share recently?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","We actually are really good at partnering with ETF sponsors to make sure that we're both happy. And it kind of depends on the type of index that we're creating. So if it's a very advanced, I would say, SMARTS beta index, like we have from our Dorsey Wright business, we actually \u2013 we do tend to see that that's got higher value and there's more IP that we're bringing to the table. That tends to have a higher price point versus a benchmark index, where we really do try to partner to be a low cost provider to our ETF sponsors. And so it really just depends on the type of index that we're calculating on behalf of our clients or that we're generating, and then partnering with our clients to bring to market. And we do have a wide range and we're very partnership driven.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got you, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may begin.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to come back to the beginning. I think it was Richard's question on the organic growth, particularly on the Market Technology side. I appreciate kind of your comfort level with the overall full year outlook of high single digits. Just wondering a little bit more near term in the third quarter, if I look at typical seasonality, I think the growth will be roughly in line with the second quarter again. So just wondering, is there anything else you would point out that may swing this a little bit higher or lower, any new business wins that might come in the third quarter that we should be thinking about as we think about our model. Thanks.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, we won't predisclose business wins, but we definitely have \u2013 we are working with a lot of clients right now to make sure that they understand the value of our offerings. We have some clients that are, frankly, in what I'll call predevelopment mode. But we \u2013 all I can say, Alex, is we do continue to see really high demand for our services across the entire spectrum of what we do, whether it's risk management, trading, clearing, settlement. Those \u2013 clearing and settlement continue to be very strong growth drivers for us, in addition to the surveillance offering. So we \u2013 I can't give you any sort of specific things, but I could say that we continue to have very high demand across the suite of what we offer.","In terms of the third quarter, I mean, you are right that from a, what I would call, change request perspective, that tends to be a lower quarter for us, because not only do \u2013 really our clients have more vacation time, so they tend to demand less in terms of enhancements and that the fourth quarter tends to be our strongest quarter in that. So that is some of that seasonality that you do see. But in terms of general, our general view is that we continue to see very high growth drivers overall, but we're not going to speak specifically to the third quarter.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Fair enough. And then just maybe stepping back for just a minute, Last time I spent time with the management team, I kind of sensed that in addition to spending more time on capital allocation, you also thought, I think, a little bit more about resource allocation. I guess, I mean, hey, you have several different businesses here, some may benefit and actually have an opportunity for acceleration and growth. If you throw more resources at them, where some are little bit more in \u2013 maximize the returns or the margin mode, any new thoughts you are having as you've now spent a few more quarters here at the helm, where you may want to change a little bit of where you're spending more time or less time in terms of dollars, time, etcetera?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, I think our general approach is, for those businesses that are strong incumbent businesses, we try to drive to the greatest efficiency that we can to make sure \u2013 but while we're still optimizing the business and its opportunities. But then as we look at really specific growth initiatives and ways for us to invest our resources, as you said, our people resources and our capital resources, we try to make sure that we give you some disclosures around those areas where we're really investing a lot of time and capital.","So what we've been discussing with you in terms of \u2013 you can kind of see that in terms of which initiatives we've been highlighting to you. So the Nasdaq Financial Framework is clearly an investment area, surveillance is clearly an investment area, the data business is clearly an investment area, Nasdaq Private Market is clearly an investment area, and then NFX is our trading investment area.","So I think that those are where we try to make sure you know where we're kind of moving resources into those areas to drive growth. And we're trying to make sure that the rest of the franchise is as efficient as possible.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right, very helpful. Thank you.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, thanks. Hey, Michael.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Hey, Mike.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","First on the technology side of the business, obviously the trends there have been favorable. I think 2016 you had a bit of a tough comp, just given some of the timing of some of the projects that came on, like Istanbul. But, yeah, your pipeline is at a record. So I'm just trying to understand \u2013 and this isn't for like a quarter or anything. But if I'm looking over the next, like, four quarters, has anything changed on the timing of sort of the revenue recognition of the current pipeline? Meaning, as things shift to be maybe a little bit more regulatory driven, does the timing shorten versus lengthen? Or should we continue to expect kind of the same pace of revenue recognition on that pipeline?","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. So I think the one thing that you'll start to see is as more of the business moves to more of a SaaS-based model and those contracts are more annual-based contracts or shorter periods as opposed to some of the five- to seven-year type contracts that you would see in the core business, and as we continue to build out the things that Adena's been talking about with respect to the SMARTS surveillance business and the whole SaaS business, that those contracts are \u2013 that does change the nature to some degree of that backlog that we're looking at.","So we are actually looking at, are there alternative ways of presenting some of that information to you guys going forward? But so some of it is more of on recurring basis. When I say recurring, on a shorter term recurring basis as opposed to longer term contract. And so that will change the nature of that a little bit and how we recognize it.","In addition, looking into next year, we are looking at what the implications are of the new GAAP requirements. We don't think that there's going to be a material impact overall in the way that the information is reported, but it will have a bit of an impact. So there will be more information coming out in the next couple quarters as to how you start to recognize that in the back half of the year.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And then, Adena, just a quick follow-up on some of the stuff on strategy, maybe like two areas. Just in terms of the paper that you guys put up in terms of improving the capital markets, just wanted to get a sense on what's the reception been, particularly on the political regulatory side, if some of it's driven on that angle?","And then just given your guys' focus on blockchain, artificial intelligence, just wanted to get your sense when you're working with the client, seems like there's a lot of interest. But when do you see that kind of conversion versus interest versus like a more meaningful revenue opportunity?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Okay, great. So on Revitalize, I think that we have had a very, very positive reception across many aspects of our client base, and as well as the lawmakers. What I really like about the fact that we took a leadership position in coming out with our views on the capital markets and what we can do to improve the capital markets is that we've been able to elevate the discussion to the bigger picture issues that are really facing the country and the economy, as it pertains to getting more companies to want to enter the public market. And what are the benefits of the public markets to investors and to companies.","So we like this. There is one stat that we have in the Revitalize blueprint that talks about the fact that in the last decade, 76% of all job growth has come in these companies after they've gone public. So going public is a job creator. It is a growth driver for the economy.","And so we want to make sure that lawmakers, regulators, issuers, investors, and market participants are all engaged appropriately on those issues that actually matter. And what's been great is it has elevated the discussion, the debate on those topics that are bigger picture topics, like proxy access, disclosure obligation, tax reform, litigation reform, as well as market structure. So market structure isn't the only thing on the agenda any more. It's looking holistically at the system.","And we have been heavily engaged with lawmakers and with regulators on the topic. It's gotten a very positive reception. I think that there's also some element of \u2013 there are certain areas that not everyone agrees on, but what we've really wanted to do was get an active and open debate on the topics, and I think we've been successful in that.","So we do hope that we're going to see progress on some of these core initiatives. We are really pleased to see that Chairman Clayton took as one of his very first acts to allow for confidential filings at every level of a company's size. That's a perfect example of a change in disclosure obligations that we support. So we are hopeful that we can actually drive positive change there.","In terms of the blockchain and AI commercialization, those new technologies are going to take time to seep into the financial fabric of the economy. But we have seen \u2013 what I really like about the blockchain is that I think that it kind of came to market as a solution looking for a problem. And then there are some problems that were identified. So particularly in illiquid OTC instruments, where there are bespoke trades that are done and they take forever to settle. And so you're standing out there with a lot of risk waiting for those trades to settle. And there is just not an efficient system to support that.","And the blockchain, whether it's the Nasdaq Private Market and our Alt initiative, or whether it's the distributed ledger technology that SIX is looking to bring into their OTC market, the whole purpose of it is to create a more efficient and effective way to settle out trades that then lowers the risk of doing those trades, which then lowers the capital requirement.","So we have definitely keyed in on problems that are solved with the blockchain. And we are moving forward with commercialized business opportunities with the blockchain and the Nasdaq Financial Framework.","On AI, as you can tell, we obviously think that there's a lot of opportunity there across our data products, our surveillance products, and our IR product. And we are actively working with machine intelligence and bringing those products to market. It just takes time for the clients to trial them, to back test them, to make sure that they are, in fact, doing what they hope that they will do. And it's just a time issue of working with the clients to get adoption, but we're highly confident that the solutions we're bringing to market are valuable to the customers. So that's just a matter of time, I think, Mike, to get that adoption up.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Adena, if you can just expand a little bit on the revenue opportunities from Nasdaq. I know it's up. I appreciate all the color on this. It does sound like sort of an exciting new area. But if you can talk about \u2013 I know it's early, but if you can talk about what you envision as the revenue expectations, and maybe too early for the second half this year, but certainly coming into 2018 and if that alters your long-term mid-single-digit growth outlook in Info Services at all?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, I would say, I think we need to have more experience with it and working with the clients very extensively to understand the total breadth of the opportunity. In a way, it's kind of an interesting project for us, because when you're going into a highly competitive space, where you kind of know what the total addressable market is and you're trying to grab at it, it's easier for you to come up with projections as to if I progress this way, I will get this money. In Analytics Hub, it's a whole new thing. It's something \u2013 these are products that clients have never had access to before. It's a very \u2013 it's a new space. So as a total addressable market, in a way it's kind of unknown.","And so what we are looking at is how do we just \u2013 obviously, we have our own internal targets, but in terms of our expectations and how quickly these targets will be met, we are not providing those publicly, because we do want to have more experience with the technology and with our customers to know what fits their needs and how they are going to be adopting it, before we give you any sort of true, clear guidance or outlook on that particular part of the business.","We are doing this as a subscription, and as they \u2013 so the way it's priced is you pay a monthly fee for either a third-party data set or you pay different monthly fee if you want to take analytics on that data set. And so there are \u2013 there is established pricing that we're working on and making sure that the clients are seeing it as a subscription service, but we don't yet have targets that we're able to communicate to you.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. I'm sorry, you said that you're piloting this right now. Did you say 20 clients or was that something else...","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","That's right. We have 20 clients who are piloting various aspects of the data, so they may be piloting one data feed. They may be piloting all the data feeds. They may be looking specifically the analytics that we're creating. And what they're doing is back testing it against their models and making sure that those models do, in fact, get a positive impact from the data. That's what they're doing at the moment.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Fair enough. Okay. And then, Michael, just on the M&A strategy broadly and, I guess, Adena as well, obviously, you want to be opportunistic in that and thanks for the priority outline on the capital deployment. But as we think about opportunities going forward, do you look at debt flexibility? In other words, I know you're trying getting to 2.5 times on debt-to-EBITDA next year. Would you be willing to flex that back up to 3 times if you saw more important opportunities? And maybe, Adena, if you just want to highlight again on your M&A priorities in terms of what businesses you'd like to try to look at?","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, I would say from a financing standpoint, the priority is identifying if we have good opportunities. We'll look at the best ways of financing those opportunities. And if it means that you're increasing the debt for a short period of time, we would look at doing that. But the priority is getting the investment, and we think it's a good strategic and financial return for the company, then we'll look at the best way to finance that. With that, I'll turn it to Adena to...","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. I mean, I would say that we are very committed to our investment-grade status. We've been very proactive in working with the rating agencies to make sure that they understand our business well. And we will \u2013 I mean, the purpose of having debt capacity is to use it for the right opportunities. But when we look at the opportunities that are before us right now, I think that what Michael discussed in his capital allocation outline is where we're focusing our energies right now, which are on these kind of, I would call them bolt-on-y type of deals, where it adds a capability to \u2013 a technology capability to us, it expands our market presence in a certain area, or in the case of the deals we did last year, which \u2013 the highly synergistic, basically doubling down in areas we believe in, that we can believe we can grow and expand our franchise. So those are the areas that we're particularly focused on right now, and I think that that will play out, hopefully, as we continue to expand our business.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for all the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ben Herbert with Citi. You may begin.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondering if you could provide some context around MiFID II in Europe and where you see maybe opportunities or risks around that next year.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, we have been very focused on making sure that we're compliant with MiFID II, and that's got a fair number of work streams across our technology organization, our business organization in the Nordics, and it's a big project, not only for us. It's a much bigger project even for our clients. But we see the Auction on Demand functionality that we launched in June on our Nordic market is a direct reflection or a direct reaction to MiFID II in terms of allowing people \u2013 I think the general goal of MiFID II is to bring more flow into the venues and to the exchanges, which I think that is benefiting us.","But the Auction on Demand allows people to execute their strategies as large institutional players and still do it within an exchange environment and make it so that the systematic internalizers don't have as much of a motivation to take that type of activity off exchange. And so we are doing those types of enhancements to our systems. We're also continuing to look at the disclosure obligations, and whether or not there are opportunities there to enhance our disclosures in our data to help people comply with MiFID II.","But I would say also, MiFID II and the new M-A-R, or MAR obligations are really, really helpful, have been helpful to our SMARTS business and its demand for surveillance in Europe over the last couple of years. And so we've seen that as a growth driver for us, and that's been benefiting us.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may begin.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Just again here for a follow-up.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","NFX, I think, Adena, you mentioned NFX at the beginning as continue to gain open interest \u2013 or building open interest, et cetera. When I look at volumes, I feel like the growth over the last three quarters have stalled a little bit. And if you look at your competitors, I mean, I think their comps are looking a lot better. Obviously, different businesses, but just wondering, like, you're very excited about open interest. It's not translating into volume. Like, where's the differential coming from, I guess?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. So I think that when we look at how our clients are using NFX, they're using it for \u2013 they're using it definitely to trade on it and they're using it to clear. And they \u2013 and sometimes they can do internalized prints that they then just send into the system to clear. And that then drives the open interest, but they may not actually be using the \u2013 what we call the CLOB or the Limit Order Book to trade. And so \u2013 but both of those things are beneficial to the health of the platform, the fact that they're willing to put their risk into the clearing house on long-duration related contracts we feel is very, very healthy and encouraging. And I think that that helps us to generally drive client demand to get connected and to be a part of NFX.","In terms of the volumes on the system, we have seen \u2013 we've been introducing fees, and we've introduced fees at the beginning of May. And as the market makers and the other participants have been getting used to these fees, we've seen some moderation of volumes, but honestly, we continue to see new participants joining. We've had a couple of new firms joining as partners in the last couple of weeks and definitely, there still is very strong demand to continue to develop the platform and bring on new products and new activities. So we see this as maybe a little bit of a plateauing just based on them getting used to new fee-based, but we're pretty \u2013 we're still very encouraged and optimistic about the business.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Sounds good.

Sir, you may begin.","Ed Ditmire","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Nasdaq's fourth quarter 2017 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Michael Ptasznik, our CFO; Ed Knight, our General Counsel; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.","I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations, and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","And now I'll turn the call over to Adena.","Adena Friedman","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I want to use our time together to discuss our strong 2017 financial performance, update you on the actions we've taken to drive forward the new strategic direction for Nasdaq that we unveiled last year. Detail our execution priorities for 2018, and lastly, address the latest developments on macro and regulatory backdrop for us and our clients. Q4 2014 featured strong results with non-GAAP EPS of $1.5, up 11% year-over-year exhibiting particularly strong momentum across key areas of our business.","Turning to the full-year 2017, we generated total net revenue of $2.4 billion, an increase of 7%. Non-GAAP operating income rose 9% on higher margins, and we increased our non-GAAP diluted EPS by 10% year-over-year. Free cash flow from operations excluding Section 31 fees rose 18% to $756 million. Subscription and recurring revenues increased 7% in 2017 compared to the prior year to over $1.8 billion driven in large part from organic growth and represented 76% of total net revenues.","We continue to invest where we have conviction that we can bring value to our clients in new ways both through our organic initiatives and through our eVestment and Sybenetix acquisitions. We complemented this with strong capital returns to shareholders. Dividends and share repurchases totaled 65% of our non-GAAP net income for the year.","The net results was another year of delivering on our double-digit total shareholder return ambition, driven through a combination of great positioning we've established to help our clients respond to important industry trends and technological advancements, gains from our improving competitive position and continued focus on execution and efficiency.","Turning to the specific highlights from our businesses in the quarter and across the year. In our Information Services segment, we saw 19% increase in Index Licensing and Services revenue in 2017 with assets under management and exchange traded products linked to Nasdaq indexes rising 35% to a record $167 billion at year end. I've known in particular that Smart Beta indexes today comprise over 40% of our total AUM which positions us especially well for the future.","Market Technology generated a 10% increase in revenues in 2017. More importantly, new business is strong with $292 million in total order intake for the year, a reflection of the increasing demand for the partnership approach we take with our clients in offering world-class market infrastructure and surveillance technology to the industry.","Order intake in the fourth quarter reflected new and deeper client relationships including an expansion agreement with Tadawul, the Saudi Arabia Exchange to deliver new cash and derivatives clearing, central securities depository and post-trade risk management technologies, as well as an agreement with SIX Group for the provision of an index system. Additionally, the Singapore Exchange is adopting the Nasdaq Financial Framework technology for their securities markets.","Importantly, over the course of 2017, Nasdaq also signed a record six new exchange clients across core trading matching, risk management, and post-trade systems, including BVP in Panama, STRATE, the South African CSD, and Astana International Exchange in Kazakhstan, while also experiencing growth in its SMARTS surveillance and BWise enterprise risk management businesses.","Turning to our Foundational Marketplace businesses, starting with Corporate Services. We completed the year with strong trends across the business. Nasdaq continues to be the U.S. listings leader, winning 69% of U.S. IPOs in the fourth quarter, and 63% for the full-year with the 136 IPOs and 62 new ETP listings.","Some highlights for the fourth quarter include CarGurus, MongoDB, National Vision, and Stitch Fix. Nasdaq's Nordic markets delivered a record breaking 108 new listings in the year, including [indiscernible] or video entertainment and monitors group. The total number of Nordic listings increased 9% to 984, and our Nordic markets continue to lead Europe in SME listings.","Nasdaq also attracted an especially strong number of listing transfers in 2017 with 21 ETP switches and 11 corporate switches, including PepsiCo the largest exchange switch ever, Principal Financial, Visteon, Xcel Energy, and Workday. The switches represent companies across six major industry categories making at our most diverse year for companies choosing to join us from our key U.S. competitor. In total, $358 billion of market capitalization switched to Nasdaq during 2017, bringing the aggregate market capitalization switch to over 1.2 trillion over the past 12 years.","In our Corporate Solutions business, we continue to enhance our flagship Nasdaq IR Insight product by rolling at two new analytics supplements in 2017. Insight 360 which uses machine learning to help companies quantify and benchmark the effectiveness of their IR program, and passiveIQ which delivers unique insights to our corporate clients on the increasingly important passive portion of the investment universe.","In Market Services, we gained market share in 2017 across our three biggest revenue categories; U.S. options, U.S. equities, and European equities, while Trade Management services continue to deliver consistent growth. In Europe, we have positioned ourselves to deliver for our customers and earn more of their business as a result of the new regulations and requirements resulting from MiFID II.","We've adapted and innovated around changing regulations with the launch of a periodic auction feature called Auction on Demand. We've seen good initial momentum since the start of the year and we believe that momentum will continue to pick up as the double cap restrictions are placed on European Dark Pools in the spring.","Stepping back to look at the broader organizations performance, I am pleased to report significant achievement against our execution priorities for 2017. First, we increased our competitive position across the majority of our businesses, best exemplified by our market share gains in the three largest trading revenue categories, our exceptional performance in Index Services, market leading new listings in the U.S. and Nordic markets, and our landmark wins in new applications of our Market Technology.","Second, we completed the integration of the ISE acquisition, six months ahead of schedule, while maintaining market share and customer momentum, delivered on the full $60 million in targeted cost synergies and identified additional cost opportunities along the way.","And third, we saw meaningful progress commercializing the important disruptive technologies where we have developed deep internal expertise, including sales of the Nasdaq Financial Framework, which puts Blockchain and cloud capabilities enhanced the market operators as well as the Analytics Hub and Insight360 products, which levers machine learning to develop new insight to our investor and corporate customer client basis.","As we focused on those execution goals, we also spent the year reviewing our broader strategy to determine the best way for our Company. Specifically in September of 2017, we communicated to use the results of the strategic review and articulated a renewed strategic direction to maximize the resources people and capital allocated to our biggest growth opportunities, particularly in our Market Technology and Information Services businesses.","We also affirmed our commitment to sustaining the special marketplace platform businesses that are core to Nasdaq, and said that we will be reducing capital resources in areas that are not a strategic to our clients and do not have the significant growth potential within Nasdaq.","We immediately went to work to begin executing against our strategic plan in terms of putting more resources behind our biggest opportunities, we closed the acquisition of eVestment in late October, adding their unique and high growth institutional investment data and analytics and with it, the potential to catalyze higher growth, not only in our information services business, but also to unlock bigger opportunities across several buy-side focused organic initiatives for eVestment's great client relationships could open new doors.","We've been very pleased to see eVestment's strong momentum continues for the fourth quarter. eVestment's topline standalone results in the fourth quarter of 2017 grew 13% year-over-year to $23 million. And in terms of metrics that drive future period new subscription sales in the fourth quarter rose 77% and the retention rate was 5 percentage points higher versus the prior year fourth quarter.","In addition to our eVestment acquisition, we reaffirm some key ongoing internal strategic growth initiatives, notably our investments in the Nasdaq Private Market, and FX, and ocean. We also decided to continue to increase our investment in our analytics of data initiative, our buy-side market surveillance offering supplemented by the acquisition of Sybenetix and the Nasdaq Financial Framework as the foundation for our next-generation market infrastructure platform for both our own markets and for those clients we serve with our Market Technology expertise.","On the other hand, in terms of where we are reducing capital, we announced on Monday that we completed the review for strategic alternatives for our public relations solutions and digital media services businesses, resulting in the sale of those assets to West Corporation.","As part of the terms of the transaction, we've agreed to an exclusive multi-year partnership with West to provide our eligible Nasdaq listed clients, seamless access to certain products and services included in the transaction. This will allow us to concentrate our investments going forward on our core high value investor relations intelligence and board collaboration solutions along with our leading listing franchises and pioneering private market solutions, which have been critical in terms of our strategic positioning with our corporate clients.","To sum up our progress on implementing our new strategic direction with the eVestment experiencing strong closing momentum, our decisions to move resources more decisively behind our most promising growth opportunities and our agreements to put the press release and multimedia businesses in the hands of a high quality partner, we are taking strong early action to get our business position to reach its full potential.","Building upon our momentum and executing against our strategic pivot, we have developed our tactical priorities for 2018. Specifically, first maximize our opportunities as an innovative analytics and technology partner to the capital markets industry. This includes, one, enhancing our culture to attract and retain creative talent across our technology and business organizations.","Two, investing our capital and innovations such as the Nasdaq Financial Framework behavioral surveillance analytics and analytics have to carry our clients into the future of trading and investing, and three, on the flip side, completing the Multimedia and PR divestiture to free up time and resources to focus on growth.","The second priority is developing and deploying our marketplace economy technology strategy, which is intended to broaden the set of applications for our world leading capital Market Technology to include a wide range of sophisticated non-financial markets.","And lastly, advancing our competitive position across our core businesses, which is obviously continuation of the 2017 goal. Because ISE opportunities to continue to build on our momentum in some areas that we saw gains last year. I look forward to updating you on our progress on these goals as the year progresses.","Now I want to spend a few minutes on the current state of the backdrop we operate and encompassing with macroeconomic conditions as well the regulatory environment. On the macroeconomic backdrop we remain positive on the potential impact of synchronize global economic growth.","Economies as well as equity markets have considered momentum across the U.S., European and Asian regions, which are all important in different ways to our core client group. We continue to experience relatively low a volatility environment, although we are seeing some early signs of increasing volatility as we enter 2018.","Moving to the political and regulatory environment almost a year-ago we saw an opportunity in Washington as the new administration is getting started and took action by releasing our blueprint to revitalize the U.S. capital markets. It is intended to spark a dialogue about making sure we're doing all we can to foster and attractive public environment for growing companies.","In many ways the administration's agenda and priorities as it relates to the markets as well as various legislative initiatives have wind up closely with the proposals in our blueprint. This includes regulations for proxy advisory firms proposed by Congressman Sean Duffy of Wisconsin that recently passed by the House.","And the new SEC Chairman Jay Clayton views an Activist Investor is used as a proxy system and his actions to allow firms to keep parts of their IPO of registration filings confidential regardless of their size. These early initial steps towards improving the U.S. public markets to make them more attractive, well thereby further job growth and job creation and economic growth.","Switching gears to specific market structure proposals of the SEC. In our strong view and the recent [CeeLo] market unclosed proposal, risk destabilizing the market close harming our listed companies and their shareholders. This proposal generated unprecedented protest, including negative comment letters from dozens of issuers, the largest U.S. equity index or trading firms and asset managers that rely on a critical market closing auctions to value trillions of dollars of investor's assets every day.","While we see the financial impact to Nasdaq is likely immaterial we feel strongly that the proposal carries a significant risk of harming issuers and investors. Therefore, we are actively responding by filing a petition, highlighting the potential act and asking SEC commissioners to review the decision. We will look to continue our leadership as a voice in Washington for our clients in 2018.","Turning to tax reform we've been active and enthusiastic supporters of tax reform as a mechanism to spur investment and growth and to make the U.S. corporate environment more competitive globally. Therefore, we are very pleased with the outcome of the bill. Specifically to Nasdaq assuming the tax reform bill is applied to normalize 2017 results it would have resulted in approximately $6 million in additional free cash flow for the year.","Going forward with the additional cash flow we intend to focus our investments on our largest growth opportunities where we expect to generate the highest returns for shareholders. While also providing increasing capital returns to shareholders all of which is consistent with the capital allocation priorities we put in place.","In conclusion, we are coming off a strong year and will continue to be guided by our new strategic direction. As I enter my second year as CEO, I see evidence of an expanding potential for this organization. In terms of how we solve increasingly advance client challenges as well deliver for our shareholders. I could not be more excited about the future of our company.","I'm convinced that Nasdaq has unique skills, experience, and vision to continue generating tremendous value and importantly there are relentless drive to continue innovating and disrupting as we've done since our founding.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Michael to review the financial details.","Michael Ptasznik","Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and our comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.","I'll start by reviewing fourth quarter revenue performance as shown on Page 3 of the presentation and organic growth on Pages 4 and 15. The 6% for $36 million increase and reported net revenue of $635 million consisted of organic growth of $17 million including 5% organic growth in the non-trading segments. A $12 million favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates and a $7 million impact from acquisitions, which is net of an $11 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associated with the closing of the eVestment acquisition.","I will now review quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments. I will start with Information Services, which, as reflected on pages 5 and 15, saw a $21 million, or 16%, increase in revenue, including $12 million, or 9%, organic growth. Index Licensing and Services revenues were up 23% in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher assets under management and exchange traded products linked to Nasdaq indexes.","Data product revenues increased 13%, primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of eVestment which closed in late October, net of an $11 million deferred revenue purchase price adjustment. This adjustment was approximately $2 million higher than the estimated guidance we provided last quarter. This does not reflect the change in the total adjustment just the shift in timing of recognition. For the full-year of 2017, Information Services organic growth totaled 7%.","Market Technology revenue, as shown on pages 6 and 15, increased $10 million, or 13%, with organic growth totaling $8 million or 10%. Organic growth totaled 9% during the full-year of 2017.","The period end backlog finished at $847 million a record high and an increase of 9% from the prior year quarter. The operating income margin for Market Technology was 24%, down 6 percentage points from 30% in the prior year period, primarily due to the impact of investments we are making to upgrade our technology for the next generation Nasdaq Financial Framework, and to enhance and grow our surveillance offering. Two initiatives that we believe can help move the Market Technology margin to higher levels as they scale in future periods.","Turning to Corporate Services on pages 7 and 15, revenues increased $3 million, or 2%. In our Listings segment, there was a positive $2 million impact from changes in foreign exchange, while revenue growth in the Nordics was offset by lower U.S. listings revenues from the runoff of listing of additional share fees due to the adoption of the all acquisitive annual and listings of additional share fee package.","We expect a moderate boost to U.S. listing fee revenues in 2018 as all acquisitive offering became effective for all U.S. issuers on January 1. For the Corporate Solutions segment, revenues increased $1 million, or 1% due to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The Corporate Services operating margin was 30% versus 25% in the prior year period with operating income increasing 24% reflecting increasing efficiencies and achievement of synergies.","Market Services net revenues, on pages 8 and 15, saw a $2 million, or 1%, increase, with $5 million positive impact from changes in foreign exchange, partially offset by a $3 million organic decline. The organic decline was due to lower revenues in U.S. options, partially offset by organic growth in European cash equity trading and trade management services.","The decline in U.S. options was due to lower average net revenue capture, driven by shifting mix factors as well as our deliberate actions to share a portion of cost synergies related to the acquisition of ISC with market participants. This is partially offset by higher market share and industry volumes. We have put in place pricing refinements intended to stabilize pricing as we move into 2018. Market Services operating income totaled 55%, up 1% from the prior year period, and operating income increased to 3%.","Turning to Pages 9 and 15 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased to $17 million to $341 million with a $16 million expense increase from acquisitions and $7 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates partially offset by $6 million organic decrease. The organic decrease was $6 million compared to the prior year quarter, principally reflect the changes in variable compensation accrued in the period, as well as lower provision for bad debt.","Turning to Slide 10, I would like to discuss our expectations for 2018 non-GAAP operating expenses. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $1,375 million to $1,415 million in 2018 which based on our current projections includes approximately $170 million of full-year costs related to the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses that we announced that we agreed to sell.","The increase from our 2017 expense base of $1.270 billion which is restated for the impact of revenue recognition accounting changes is composed of about 3% organic increase, most of which is due to spending in our growth initiatives about 1.5% from FX changes and the remainder due to the full-year impact of our late 2017 acquisitions of eVestment and Sybenetix.","Assuming a mid-year 2018 close to the transaction, we expect our expenses would decline by approximately $65 million to $70 million from our 2018 expense guidance. We expect to achieve a full annualized run rate savings of approximately $170 million within 12 months of closing of the transaction. We will update our official guidance to reflect the exact closing date in any updates to the expenses elimination timing after the transaction is closed.","Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased 7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the non-GAAP operating margin totaled 46% unchanged versus the prior year period, a reflection of margin expansion in the core business being offset by the impact of the eVestment acquisition, which profitability is temporarily impaired by the purchase price adjustment on deferred revenues as well as compensation and other expenses associated with our acquisition.","Net interest expense were $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $2 million versus the prior year period, primarily due to refinancing to lower cost debt partially offset by the increased debt due to eVestment.","The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 32%, which excludes the impact of excess tax benefits related to employee share-based compensation. We made a decision to exclude the excess tax benefits from our non-GAAP results presented for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 as well as going forward due to the volatility, the fact that they are not reflective of current period operations because management does not consider the excess benefits when evaluating or allocating resources to our businesses.","For the full-year 2018, our non-GAAP tax rate guidance is a range of 24.5% to 26.5%, a decrease of 7 percentage points to 9 percentage points from our 2017 non-GAAP tax rate of 33.3% reflecting principally the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017.","Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $197 million or $1.05 per share - diluted share, compared to $161 million or $0.95 per diluted share in the prior year period.","On Slide 11, we discuss revenue and expense impact under adoption of ASU, 2014-09, which impacts the timing, not the amount of revenue and expense recognition. This accounting change will go into effect beginning Q1 of 2018 and will be restating 2017 results at that time to ensure results are presented on a comparable basis.","While this change will lower our 2017 GAAP and non-GAAP results modestly, it does not affect our cash flows in the period, nor change our expectations for the organic growth we expect in the coming period.","Turning to capital that increased by $464 million versus 3Q 2017, primarily due to $441 million net debt issuance to fund eVestment acquisition and a $22 million increase in Euro Bond book values caused by a stronger euro.","Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.3 times versus 3.1 times at the third quarter of 2017. As mentioned previously, we continue to plan to delever to a mid two times leverage ratio by mid 2019.","Share repurchases in the fourth quarter totaled $29 million, bringing total 2017 repurchase to $203 million, together with dividend payments we returned $446 million to shareholders during 2017, representing 65% of our non-GAAP net income in the period.","In addition to continuing our regular stock buyback activity with intention of maintaining a stable share count, we anticipate using after tax proceeds of the sale of the Multimedia and PR businesses to repurchase additional shares, which is expected to lower our share account modestly and largely offset the EPS impact of the elimination of the annualized net income associated with the divested businesses.","As of December 31, 2017, there was $226 million remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program and our Board of Directors recently approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization of an additional $500 million.","We plan to continue to use our capital including the enhancements due to lower tax rates to optimize the returns to shareholders to focused investment in organic growth opportunities, carefully considered M&A, continuing to grow the dividend as earnings and cash flow increase.","Thank you very much for your time and I'm going to turn it back to the operator now for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. You may begin.","Richard Repetto","Yes. Good morning, Adena. Good morning, Michael. I guess my questions on the strategy and the strategic pivot, and it looks like you took up the R&D spending by $20 million or more than 50% compared to last year. And I guess the question is how do we think about like the return on the ROIC and as you invest more I guess in the Analytics Hub buy-side surveillance in Nasdaq Financial Framework?","Adena Friedman","Michael, why don't you start by saying what that comprises of that would be great.","Michael Ptasznik","Yes. So Rich, thanks for noting that. So the increase in the R&D expenses was $65 million to $75 million. Now this does appear higher than previous years for two reasons. First of all, it's in line with the new strategic approach that we've been outlining and reflect the reallocation of resources from the businesses that we will sustain or deemphasize towards those initiatives that reflective of the longer-term growth opportunities would like an effect that Adena spoke about earlier. So it's a reallocation from these businesses into the new areas and the new, so it's not an increase in the overall spend, it's a reallocation of resources. That's number one.","Secondly, the previous numbers that we used to provide excluded certain initiatives that were included in normal operating expense and now have been reclassified and grouped with our R&D program, and that really allow us to manage these investments in a manner that's more conducive to their growth nature versus operational nature.","Adena Friedman","And in terms of the return potential and how we manage and measure these investments, Rich, a couple of things. By putting all of this initiative into what we're now calling Nasdaq next, which is our internal program name. We have a - a means basically require a lot of visibility around the programs. We do regular meetings with the teams that are implementing the different initiatives.","They provide us future forecast in other ways for us to measure how they're progressing against certain targets. But as we have made the decision to either approve or re-approve these programs, we do look at the long-term ROIC characteristics of these opportunities. And each one of them has a different timeframe for that, because if it's a relatively - if it's kind of an extension of an existing business, we might put a shorter timeframe on when we expect to see a nice return from that. But if it's a brand new thing that we've never done before, we usually give it a longer runway to continue to try to grow.","In terms of the ROIC, I think that these are the things that we can do that if we can scale them on an organic basis. The ROIC is significantly higher than if you're using your capital for acquisitions and other things. So it's worth taking the risk to try to get a really attractive return over the long-term.","And we do believe these are the things that will also strategically carry us forward with our clients and so they're very important to the way that we're running our business going forward. But they do have different - each one of the investments kind of has a different profile to them.","Richard Repetto","Okay. Thank you. And then my one follow-up would be I guess closely related to the first question here, but when you look at the margins Information Services as well as Market Technology they were down year-over-year and Information Services quarter-over-quarter materially. And I guess can you help us understand I guess from the first question, the extra investment that's going in there and the impact on margins I guess going forward in these areas that you're prioritizing?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Yes, so on Information Services the margin is really down because of the eVestment acquisition and especially given the fact we have some deferred revenue that we have to - the purchase price adjustment on the revenue in the fourth quarter also brings it down even further than otherwise wanted on a normalized basis. But the eVestment acquisition does have a lower margin profile than the overall Information Services business, so that will have somewhat of an impact.","The Analytics have initiative within that the data business has been an ongoing initiative for a while. So that's kinds have been baked into our margins over the last few periods. And even if we increase investment there it's still going to be modest in comparison to the overall business there. On the Market Tech side though that is more a reflection of organic growth, I mean organic investment in both our surveillance for buy-side and our Nasdaq Financial Framework initiatives.","And those are areas with relatively heavier internal investment and organic investment because we see the profile of those being very high return over the long-term. And the one thing I would say is when we first - when we first started took on the Market Tech business, it really was - frankly it was actually a money losing business, but we've been marching it up to the margin that started the year at over time, but there were periods of time where it either flattened out or even declined a little bit as we invested in integrations or invested in new technologies to try to drive it to a higher margin.","And I do believe that with the Nasdaq Financial Framework investment that's a period of investment that will drive us to a higher margin and much higher growth over time because we'll be ought to scale that business, hopefully provide a deeper relationship with our clients and make it, so that we can deploy more clients faster over the long-term. So there are a lot of benefits that come from that investment right now. And that's what's really driving down the margin this year.","Richard Repetto","I understood. Thanks and I'll look forward to a strong 2018.","Adena Friedman","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Rosenblatt. You may begin.","Christopher Allen","Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to touch a little bit on Market Technology. It seems like it was another very strong quarter, nice broad-based growth in the order backlog. Last quarter you talked about that moving to more of a SaaS recurring business model and order backlog is not as representative as it has been in the past. I am just trying to interpret how to think about the growth we are seeing in the order backlog and just the ongoing trend here. It seems to me you are building a nice stable recurring business revenue line, but now you're seeing some accelerated growth on top of that, so any color there would be helpful?","Adena Friedman","Sure. And you are right. We are doing two things. One is we want to move more of our implementations towards our recurring model. We want to move more of our product base to more towards kind of a platform-as-a-service or a software-as-a-service model, and that is frankly part about Nasdaq Financial Framework investment. So there are - parts of our business is certainly surveillance and increasing the BWise where it really is more of a software-as-a-service.","The core Market Tech business continues to be primarily a deployed solutions business, but with the Nasdaq Financial Framework, the whole notion is to move it more towards a platform-as-a-service model. But we have said in the past that we are looking towards new metric to measure this business and that order intake is becoming kind of less relevant as the only way to look at the business. So we will be - as we go into Investor Day, we will be looking at new metric or additional metric that we want to provide you, so you see get a better sense of how to measure the growth.","But I would say, overall you are correct that the overall characteristics of the business, there's just a lot of demand for what we do, and it's really great to see that our clients see us the best partner for them. I think the investments we're making in the Nasdaq Financial Framework are giving them even increasing confidence that if they invest in us now, we'll be able to carry them into the future. These are really long-term investments that the clients are making, but they know that we're investing in their future by investing in the Nasdaq Financial Framework.","Christopher Allen","Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up. I mean you noted some nice change this quarter, I think in the last quarter you talked a little bit about penetrating some of the Tier 1 banks. Do you see any further opportunity with the bank penetration because that seems to be to me like one of the bigger opportunities from a longer term perspective within this business?","Adena Friedman","Yes. We do see continued opportunity in the banks and those sales cycles just take a while, so we are in active dialogue with several banks, and we hope to obviously continue to drive that growth in new bank deals as well.","Christopher Allen","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. You may begin.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Good morning. Just a follow-up on some of the color earlier around SEBO's market on close, I think you said it was likely immaterial to results. Is there any way you could help kind of quantify like a percentage of the cash equities revenue that comes from market on close orders today?","Adena Friedman","So we don't provide that level of detail in terms of the financial performance of our equities business, but I think that it's been widely stated and I think it's out there. About 5% of our volume in Nasdaq was issues comes from the closing activity, but that's a combination of a lot of different order types that all come together, so you got the market on close going on close, the balance only and then regular market orders that are regular way orders that come in.","So it's really a combination of a mix of things and so we don't break out very specific areas, but as I said before we really do believe that assuming we manage through this issue successfully, frankly we believe that we should continue to have all of those orders come into Nasdaq, and we believe very strongly about that as witnessed by our petition. To the extent that there is a competitive environment that develops, we definitely believe that we'll be able to manage that very successfully with as we said likely a material outcome for us.","Kyle Voigt","Okay. Thanks. And just one follow-up for me would be on really the strategic pivot. And I know at the time the eVestment acquisition you kind of laid out. What the idea was for investing in different segments and we got to divestment since then. I guess is this strategy going forward, is this going to be a continued kind of looking at lower growth, lower margin businesses that maybe within different segments across the firm on an ongoing basis? And I guess if that process still going on and guess if you could share if. there's anything else here that you're thinking about in certain segments they potentially divest going forward? Thank you.","Adena Friedman","Sure. Yes, it is a continuous process and it will be going forward. So I think that it's something where our leadership team is always considering how we are best serving our clients and making sure that everything we do is strategic to them, strategic to us and it's something we're really good at.","And so we will continuously look at our - on the suite of things that we offer to the capital markets and make determinations as to whether or not they continue to be - we continue to be the right place for them. We do not have any other specific things that we are currently contemplating. We obviously have to focus on completing the sale to West and making sure that that partnership got off to a great start. That's a critical next step for us and I will take some time to do that.","Kyle Voigt","All right, thanks.","Michael Ptasznik","And Kyle, just the other parts add to that is, part of that allocation process is necessarily mean that there's going to be an acquisition of divestiture per se every time. We could also just reflect the reallocation of the resources in capital as we've talked about earlier with respect of the increase in the Market Tech area as well on our advantage basis. So it's really a combination of those things that we're going to be looking at regularly.","Kyle Voigt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Brian Bedell","Thanks. Let me just start out with the sale of the Public Relations and Digital Media Services. I assume that's all in the corporate services and that would reduce that revenue we make almost half, but from the long-term perspective that three to five year revenue growth outlook, assuming that was a lower growth business wouldn't that make you more confident that you could bring up that that low single-digit target to something a little higher? Is this the matter of time or should we still be thinking of that business in lower single-digits?","Adena Friedman","So I mean in terms of the sale, I guess it is in the Corporate Services segment and specifically in the Corporate Solutions part of the Corporate Services segment. In terms of the long range outlook, we will continue to assess that as we complete the acquisition or - divestiture to understand our views on to in terms of the long-term growth of the remaining assets and make sure that we feel confidence in our deliver against that growth profile there. But we're currently assessing that.","Brian Bedell","Okay and maybe just listing that's holding it down right now?","Adena Friedman","Well, historically what we have said about listings in the past is that it's low single-digits because of the fact that price increases and other changes are episodic and depends on the IPO environment. So we'll continue to have that as part of our assessment.","Brian Bedell","Okay, and then just when I guess in the spirit of reallocating to [indiscernible]. If can you talk about NFX, is that still losing $0.02 a quarter and that's been going on for a while, is there any view of reassessing whether you want to stay in that business?","Adena Friedman","We remain very committed to the NFX business. We continue to look at ways to bring new products onto that platform. Our clients' remains very focused on it and dedicated to making it work. I would say for in terms of an investment from that it's about $0.01 to $0.02 a quarter. So it continues to be a pretty modest investment, but one that we believe that continues to have a very bright long-term future for us.","Brian Bedell","And will bitcoin futures product part of that potential from the launch perspective?","Adena Friedman","Yes, if we were to choose to launch a bitcoin future, we would launch it on an effect.","Brian Bedell","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Christopher Harris","Thanks, another question on the Tech business. Where do you think this business is in the context of the potential addressable market?","Adena Friedman","That's a great question and I would say again we'll probably provide a little more color and details on that as we get into our Investor Day in March. But we definitely see an expanding addressable market. So the fact that we are looking at the exchange base in itself is we've always kind of look that as the potential kind of $2 billion addressable market.","You go into the banks and you start to look at market infrastructure at the bank level, you've got many billions more opportunity to go into the surveillance business and for purely in the market surveillance, market oversight space that's actually got a large addressable market and the exact size I don't remember, but it's a large - certainly much larger than what we're achieving so far.","But then you also can then look at how do you move and expand that into more of the client side and into the buy-side. So it's kind of in the billions range on each of those, billions of dollars in each of those addressable market. It's a matter of how we make sure that we execute against that and we deliver the technology and the service they need to be able to succeed. But we're really excited about how we can continue to find new opportunities. And then the markets economy concept is one where Ad-hoc we get requests from non-financial markets to use our Market Technology.","And it's just been kind of like inbound over time what we're doing in 2018 which is why I made it our business priority is to become much more structured and how we it approach the non-financial markets with our technology and recognize that specifically if we can deliver a market in the cloud have Blockchain as an integrated part of that have a really integrated data layer and allow from markets to be able to deploy faster and new markets to emerge faster we believe that we can really address a non-financial markets economy outside the financial markets with our technology and so that's yet another area of opportunity for us that we're just starting to understand.","Christopher Harris","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may begin.","Alex Kramm","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just shifting to the markets services site for second, I think Michael you mentioned the options business as obviously shrinking business from a revenue perspective. I think you ran through pricing as well. Can you just flush all those comments again in particular as we think about the strong equity options activity so far the first quarter? I mean it's pricing on taking to the step down and how are you looking at the run rate right now of pricing given the strong volumes?","Michael Ptasznik","First of all I don't think we said that it's a shrinking business, I think it was lower in the quarter, but that's not a comment of both is the future of the business. And in fact there has been strong activity so for the beginning of this year which in contrast to where it was at the end of last year.","So from a pricing standpoint as I mentioned on in my remarks it was a reflection of a bit of a mix shift was part of the reason why we saw the reduction and capture of the more the volume is going through the Philex floor, which has a bit of a different capture right there as well there was some changes to some of the fees to that effect that as well that we did maintain and actually grew our overall market share in that business.","Again in my comments we did talk about some of the changes that we were making that with intention to stabilize the pricing there and so that would be the intent we do try to optimize combination of market share and pricing and trying to ultimately optimize the revenue.","Adena Friedman","Yes, I'd say Alex one of the great things about having the six venues we have now is it does allow our clients to have a lot of choice. All within the kind of umbrella of Nasdaq, and so if they're looking at new strategies that they're undertaking and they might say that the Philex floor is a better way to execute this strategies or maybe ISE complexesor maybe [indiscernible] itallows them to have that flexibility all within Nasdaq, but that does each one of those then yours has a different fee characteristic to it.","And so it really is a matter of how they're spreading and managing their strategies, but we get the opportunity to have all of that within our umbrella. I think that in terms of going into 2018 we will always be looking at those kind of incremental things that we can do to drive market share, maintain capture and serve our clients and as volume comes up also you've got the potential for some volume caps to head, but we are very confident that we have a good strategy here and there's not - there's no concern within Nasdaq around how are managing this I think it's just a natural way for to manage our client relationships.","Alex Kramm","Okay. Great thank you. And then just on the Market Technology side for second. This might be a little bit nitpicky, sorry, but you talk about all these business wins and being like a strong partner to clients and new technologies to one thing that I notice at the end of last year is that ASX which has been a partner since the late 90's when somebody else digital assets on something and related to Blockchain. So now maybe you can flushes out a little bit considering that you know you talk about Blockchain a new technology is a lot and it's a strong part in the path. So it looks like a business when other business loss, but something that's been a new wins. So maybe you can flush that particular one out?","Adena Friedman","Sure, that's not a problem. Yes, so ASX has been a really great partner to us every year and they continue to use us for new things they've signed a new SMARTS agreement they continue to work with us on clearing. We are - but in the derivatives side. We have never actually been a clearing technology provider to them on the cash equity side. That's always been an internal system that they've had. So clearing and settlement of cash equity has been a very internal build call test that they've had a very esoteric to the Australian markets very different from what you'd see and other markets.","And what they've been trying to figure out our frankly several years is how to and upgrade or replace or advance that technology. And so they made a decision a couple of years ago actually to partner with digital asset holdings. And it was at the very beginning of the whole discussion around Blockchain and we were really, really early in our internal work there.","So I think had they made a decision a year ago perhaps it would have been a different decision. But they were making a decision right when everyone was getting started in digital assets holdings was a little further along and we were very early on. I think that if this stage particularly with the integration of the Blockchain into the Nasdaq Financial Framework I think people are recognizing that what we can offer is a much more integrated way to use the Blockchain end-to-end whereas what they're working on with test is a pure settlement depository solution.","And they still have yet to implement it, they still have work to do to get to the implementation stage. But it is we're not going to win every single bit of business from every single of our clients. What we want though is for them to see us as a partner. So that maybe they move forward and ultimately integrate what they've built in the Blockchain into what we have across the rest of the platform. So we still have lots of things we can do together with them.","Alex Kramm","All right. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Adena Friedman","Yes, sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Alexander Blostein","Great. Hey, good morning, everybody. A question for you guys around eVestment first, so just a couple of clarifications. So sounds like $23 million in run rate revenues in Q4. Is that inclusive how many purchase price adjustment is that mostly going to hit you guys in the first quarter? And then just kind of broader it sounds like subscriptions are up nicely where's the demand coming from and I guess what are the areas of potential cross-selling opportunities do you go see for this business now that you've added for a few months now?","Adena Friedman","Sure. The $23 million was kind of when we run rate it's because it doesn't include the purchase price adjustment that's just kind of within the investment financials when we look at it as a business that's what they delivered in Q4. So that doesn't include a purchase price adjustment. In terms of - and so but - in terms of how that fit into the Nasdaq overall financials there was $11 million purchase price adjustment off that $23 as it kind of came into Nasdaq.","And so going into 2018 we still have a few quarters that purchase price adjustment to play out and consistent with what we told you when we closed on the deal. So I think that you just that $23 is a run rate number. In terms of cross-selling I think that - and not only cross-selling but to synergy opportunities from running perspective there are several that where we're working on with them.","I think some of the opportunities are the relationships they have within the institutional investment space does give us a chance to look at how we work with them on the Surveillance side, so the Sybenetix, buy-side surveillance platform that we have opportunity to use some of the relationships that eVestment has to get there.","We also are integrating the Nasdaq indices into eVestment also bringing some of the investment data onto the analytics hub and making that an aggregated level more available we're also looking at how we can leverage those relationships around selling some of our border leadership tools into the asset management space. So there are a lot of areas of collaboration and work together that we're focused on right now.","Alexander Blostein","Got it. Thanks for that and then just a quick follow-up to Michael around capital return priority. So as we think about the buyback of incremental $500 million authorization. Is the timing of that really kicks in and once the sell closes to come in the back half of the year and as you think about it goes the implications for sort of the share count over the course of the year. So is the goal to still keeping it flattish or because of the incremental buyback we could actually see overall share count go down for 2018 versus 2017?","Michael Ptasznik","Yes, so the incremental buyback that would occur would be with the proceeds from - the after tax proceeds of the transaction and so that could result in a reduction in the overall share count. So again the primary use of our normal buyback would be to maintain the share count flat. And then in addition to that we would use the proceeds of the transaction which would result in a reduction in the overall shares.","Alexander Blostein","I see it great. Thanks so much.","Michael Ptasznik","And from a timing standpoint, yes, it will start after the closing of the transaction.","Alexander Blostein","Great. Make sense. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin.","Michael Carrier","All right, thanks and good morning. Maybe one more question on just the strategic review and then like the revenue outlook. If I look at 2017, did you guy did around 7% total and then I think it was 2% inorganic. And just when I think about it like from where you are from a leverage standpoint, it seems like on the inorganic side. That will be a little bit less least in 2018, 2019.","So, on the organic front, given that you're repositioning some of the businesses, where do you see kind of the opportunities for that 2% to be moving higher? There's obviously some clear things that you mentioned on the listing side and the changes, we just wanted to maybe stag some of those up?","Adena Friedman","Sure. I mean as we look at the strategic pivot and the orientation that we have around the business, clearly we see the Market Tech and Information Services businesses is deriving a fair amount of growth into the business, and we want to make sure that we're positioning it to continue to drive growth because if we can - if we can continue to accelerate that growth or at least get it to the point where it's really driving the rest of the organization.","Then we obviously have the opportunity to bring the whole organization up and that's why we've been pivoting our investment dollars there. So that we can make sure that we can continue to kind of push that that revenue growth up to a more sustainable level that we're really excited about.","In terms of Market Services, the issue there is that we can control, we can control. And from a market share perspective and from a pricing and the way that we manage our client relationships, I think we're feeling really good about the largest revenue pools in terms of how we're managing those.","If there is a better beta in the market in terms of the higher volumes that obviously creates the lift, but we just can't rely on that. So we're not counting on that as being a driver of growth, but it certainly could deliver it. And instead what we're focused on is how do we make sure? We're optimizing our markets, so that we can take advantage of that if and when it happens.","And then on the Corporate Services side, as we said we are - we will be assessing that the growth characteristics of that business, it was close on the PR and DMS businesses because we believe that West actually has a much better opportunity to focus on those businesses, focus on areas that we weren't focused on.","Drive can - kind of invest in those businesses and drive growth there, but that was not our focus. So now we get to look at how do we take the capital that we invest into the business and drive it towards things that grow at higher rates. And again Mike, this is something that we will try to layout probably more detail as we get into the Analyst Day in March.","Michael Ptasznik","And that organic growth number that you quoted that is really being held down because of the reduction that we see in the volatility and activity we see it in the Market Services side as you know. We still believe that mid single-digit growth opportunity on this description recurring revenue side is there and with some of the pivot we're making, we're obviously if you try and accelerate those as much as possible. So if you break a few pieces of the business, we are seeing higher growth in the subscription recurring revenue side.","Michael Carrier","Okay, it makes sense. Thanks.","Adena Friedman","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. You may begin.","Jeremy Campbell","Hey, thanks. Just wondering within the context of your strategic plan, how do you guys think about the implications from the big announced Blackstone deal to acquire the Financial and Risk business from Thomson Reuters and whether that shake up may yield any opportunities are for Nasdaq to either grow faster organically or inorganically or perhaps even look to monetize some pieces?","Adena Friedman","We are reading the news, at the same time you are. So we're just trying to make sure we understand the contours of that partnership that they've announced and understand kind of implications. Thomson Reuters is a great partner to us actually in the Corporate Solutions business and in our Data business and we would certainly expect them to continue to serve those roles to us going forward. But we're digesting the news at the same time you are right now.","Jeremy Campbell","Well, it's funny because their partner, but there is also a little bit of a competitor in some areas too. Just wondering like the big picture if there is a jump, all like that as it happened before does that usually - does it tend to yield any opportunities that might be interesting on your guy's side?","Adena Friedman","Yes, generally speaking, we don't view Thomson Reuters as a competitor to us. They are a great distributor to us. They partner with us. They actually I mean we do things like - we've put our DWA data onto their platform for a web share type of model. I mean we do a lot with them. So we don't see - we don't kind of view them in the same way that maybe you do. But obviously will kind of look through what's happening there and understand whether there are opportunities.","Jeremy Campbell","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Ben Herbert with Citi. You may begin.","Benjamin Herbert","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up again on the Public Relations and Digital Media sale and having those marked as held-for-sale that $335 million, our position price, what those adjustments might be and then the potential to take a gain in the second quarter as it closes?","Michael Ptasznik","So we had - the last quarter when we announced that we were doing strategic review. We put the assets on the books and available for sale basis. So there's $250 million that shows on the books as the book value of that. So obviously a $350 million less whatever cost part of the transaction and the two will net off. So it's premature for us to tell you what the final number is, but there will be some gain. We will non-GAAP that obviously because we were into through the non-GAAP earnings. But those are roughly the numbers that you will be looking at. That helps?","Benjamin Herbert","Yes, thank you.","Michael Ptasznik","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Adena Friedman for closing remarks.","Adena Friedman","Thank you. Well, Nasdaq's fourth quarter performance was solid. The team is definitely energized and focused on delivering for our clients and exploring opportunities that will shape who we are as an organization and what will be coming and the years to come as you can tell that's a big area of focus for us and it really is an exciting time to be leading Nasdaq as the industry and technology role continue to evolve.","So we continue to work with the industry and other key stakeholders on a regulatory framework that we believe will provide maximum support to our clients while preserving critical investor protection and that would benefit the broader investment community and the broader economy it serves and also internally, we are focused on making sure that our clients come first every day and that we can - we bring the most innovative and creative solutions to them today and in the years to come. So thank you very much for your time today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ed Ditmire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Edward P. Ditmire - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ's first quarter 2015 earnings results. On the line are Bob Greifeld, our CEO; Lee Shavel, CFO; our Co-Presidents, Adena Friedman and Hans-Ole Jochumsen; Ed Knight, our General Counsel; and other members of the management team.","After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.","I'd like to remind you that certain statements in the presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I now will turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ's first quarter 2015 results. We had a very strong start to our year. Our focus on creating new opportunities for our businesses and our customers was clearly evident. And I am very pleased with the overall direction this franchise is headed.","The results we delivered during the quarter are the second best in our history in terms of non-GAAP operating income, net income, and diluted EPS. This occurred while also including material year-over-year bottom line growth despite elevated FX headwinds.","As I pointed out to you on this call before, we have a fundamental view that our performance at this particular point in time in our evolution is merely a starting point for us to build upon. As you look even more closely at the quarter, past the headline financial numbers, you will see evidence of that development as we advance our strategic ambitions across the businesses.","Today, I want to focus on three key areas which illustrate the tremendous progress we have made, specifically our financial performance, our strong strategic execution and the deployment of capital that results from these.","Our financial performance during the quarter was solid and once again demonstrates the benefits of diversity in our model. Our non-GAAP operating margins were at multi-year highs at 46%, a function of improving organic growth in the non-trading segments and continued intense focus on the best method of executing our plans. This more than offset intense FX headwinds, and what I would consider a challenging environment for our trading businesses. What is even more interesting to me is that when we look across our entire business, we continue to see meaningful contributions from each segment as well as an expanding set of opportunities.","A big driver in our overall performance was the positive trend we continue to see in our non-transaction business segments. We saw a 3% organic growth during the quarter continuing and improving trend over the recent periods. While progress is not where we want it to be, we remain focused on delivering for our customers and shareholders, while investing in the business and continuing to drive growth across the franchise. One of the opportunities in front of us right now is in our Corporate Solutions business. Over the last year, our focus has been on enhancing our product and services and the way we are structured to better serve our customers and meet their needs.","We're clearly taking the right steps in positioning this business as a marketplace-leader to the launch of our next-gen platform, which will take place later this year along with a number of other product enhancements across the entire IR, PR, and multimedia offering. This customer-centric framework and focus will give us the ability to develop new enhancements and product introductions and drive growth in the quarters to come.","In addition, we continue to see equally positive momentum across our other non-transaction businesses, including Information Services, which was boosted by the strong performance of Dorsey, Wright & Associates. Certainly, our core businesses have and will continue to be fundamental to our success. These businesses not only form the basis of what I refer to as the mothership, but it certainly have and will continue to drive many of the new opportunities for us across the franchise.","During the quarter, both our cash equity trading and listing businesses continued to perform well, together rising 7% year-over-year and 15% if you exclude FX. These businesses represent foundational parts of our business that we've successfully levered to expand our product offerings to our customers. Examples include, extending our trading platform to equity derivatives, and delivering Corporate Solutions to public and private companies. I believe this significant growth we continue to see in these businesses in the recent periods bodes well for other related businesses in the periods to come.","Delving in a little deeper, one of the more exciting areas of our business right now is the Listing segment, both in terms of recent activity levels, our strong competitive position and new product enhancements we are making. Last year, we had a record number of IPOs with a 61% market share and so far this year, we are trending to a higher win rate.","In the first quarter, NASDAQ again was the marketplace leader by capturing 66% of all U.S. IPOs. While we continue to see companies from different sectors, we're clearly living in the new age of biotech, which is truly exciting. Some of the outstanding brands joining NASDAQ during the quarter included Involaon, also we have the largest tech IPO by dollars raised, and Spark Therapeutics, the best performing U.S. IPO year-to-date.","As I've noted, we continue to attract many of the new companies that represent what I would call the new economy, including those in green energy like SolarEdge Technologies, a $900 million plus company that provides technology components for solar panel installers that also joined NASDAQ in the first quarter.","What's interesting to me is that many of these companies are truly changing our world as we know it today, and we are excited to play a role in their evolution and development by providing them with a platform to raise capital and to reach their stakeholders.","Turning to our European markets, we have seen some of the strongest activity in that IPO market in decades. For example, NASDAQ Stockholm had its best start since 1965. In the first quarter, the Nordic markets had 18 new listings continuing the new listing momentum we experienced in 2014 when there was 72 new listings, the most since 2000. The pipeline for the remainder of 2015 looks robust with a backlog of filed offerings remaining at very, very high levels. When you look at our financial performance during the quarter, I think it is a direct output of the way we execute as a company. I'd like to call out a few of the ways our strong execution as a firm continues to drive opportunities for us.","Clearly one of the things I think NASDAQ does particularly well today is how we invest in our future. We do this in a number of ways including through investments that lever the mothership as well as sound strategic acquisitions. I am pleased to report that our most recent acquisition Dorsey, Wright & Associates in our Information Services segment, which we just closed at the end of January is off to a tremendous start and moving well ahead of our expectations.","The business saw ETP assets licensed to its smart beta indices increased by 37% in the two months since joining NASDAQ and a staggering 48% over the course of the entire first quarter with further gains in April, a truly remarkable performance.","In addition, 100% of the clients of DWA's analytics business were successfully migrated in the acquisition, resulting in zero attrition. We are only just beginning the work to accelerate product development and broaden DWA's partnerships across this business but we're obviously very encouraged by the strong start to this partnership and the opportunities DWA adds to our portfolio. We are looking forward to seeing this exciting business grow and develop even further in the months to come.","Moving on, one of the most visible developments during the quarter was our announcement of the expansion of our global commodities offering in the U.S. energy derivatives space with the NASDAQ Futures Exchange, NFX. We expect to go live with this initiative later this year.","Now, I want to talk a little bit about how we're deepening our client relationships through some of the new product launches during the quarter. With respect to new product launches, we consider it our job to always work from an informed perspective of our customer. This means we work to address their needs, but we also have to go one step further and consider areas that they have not yet thought about.","Certainly our next-gen platform in Corporate Solutions business was developed this way and we are in the final stages of testing and we expect to introduce a beta version of this platform to some of our clients in the coming months.","NASDAQ private market is another example of this focus in action. This offering, which provides support to private companies as they manage their equity ownership, liquidity needs, and other important functions grew to over 75 companies in the first quarter, truly remarkable for such a new venture.","The growth in the first quarter included the addition of Shazam, an innovative UK based entertainment and technology firm, which joined a diverse client group that also included Magic Leap, Tango, Hipmunk, Health Catalyst and Motley Fool. While in the early stages, NASDAQ private market has seen acceleration in revenue and I believe in the medium and long-term will contribute quite meaningfully to the listing service segments' growth.","We also continued to introduce significant new product offering in other areas during the quarter, such as our new capabilities in electronic fixed income trading platform, eSpeed. Building on the success of the U.S. Treasury Bills offering in 2014, we launched late in the first quarter trading in Short Shorts, which are short duration treasury bonds and are working towards additional 2015 launches in coupon rolls and then off-the-run treasuries. These products will position us to take advantage of all the opportunities in the current historically calm treasury markets, but more importantly have the largest possible opportunity if and when the anticipated interest rates move by the Fed take place. We certainly believe that will create trading opportunities and stir volume in a meaningful way. The path we're on right now is the right one in terms of new products we have in our pipeline, not only in terms of eSpeed, but across all our businesses and in their ability to continue to deliver meaningful growth to the franchise.","Another area where we continue to focus our energies is the U.S. equity market. It's important to note that yesterday was the 10-year anniversary of our announcement of the (12:49) deal. This transaction remains the single most important action we took to secure our position in our core businesses and provided the platform for the growth we're witnessing today. Since our beginning over 40 years ago, we have never stopped dedicating our efforts to increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of markets as a foundational business and something we've levered to deploy a wide range of products and services to the investment community, our interest lies squarely on ensuring the long-term viability of the highest quality equity marketplaces.","We share in the excitement around the very successful IPO of NASDAQ listed Virtu Financial recently. In particular, we observed a large number of investors utilizing a multitude of resource sources coming to the reasonable and constructive conclusions about the quality of our regulated markets and the soundness of the business model of those market participants. This was of course in stark contrast to the anxieties once felt by many about a single person's un-researched opinion.","Now, when we look at market structure, certainly there are many opinions about what should and should not happen in the desire to improve markets. But at NASDAQ, we are focused on action and what we can actually do to effect positive, constructive improvements. One example is with the access fee program we launched this past February. We started with customers who indicated they are primarily trading in the dark because of the high cost of access or take fees, and others were concerned that significant liquidity rebates might negatively affect market quality. We started with a pilot group of 14 stocks to reduce the market access fee to $0.05 per 100 shares with the liquidity rebate lowered to $0.04 per 100 shares. These fees had maximum set at $0.30 by the SEC as part of Reg NMS about a decade ago, and have remained that way since.","That said, after initial review of early data, the experiment has revealed adverse changes in liquidity provisioning, and at the same time no meaningful compensation changes in liquidity taking orders. But to me, that is not the point. So far the experiment seems to be showing that costs are not the only factor in driving the increase in dark trading, while it's also producing the kind of data that can lead to full analysis on any impact of market quality. These are early days, but we're hopeful the data will lead to more discussion and eventually to action to ensure our markets remain the envy of the world.","Now, in addition to the strong progress we've made in many areas, which I have highlighted, certainly our focus on our use of capital has also been a significant factor in our success. We have always maintained that the reward of running our businesses well gives us the ability to do more things such as make investments in our future like our expansion into energy futures market and others, as well as giving us the ability to make sound use of our other capital deployment option for our shareholders, whether through share buybacks, dividend or selective acquisitions.","During the first quarter, we had executed on attractive deployment opportunities in all channels including $30 million of stock repurchases, bringing the total to $208 million over the four quarters since we restarted the program in the second quarter of 2014.","We invested in new initiatives including the meaningful groundwork laid for the launch of NFX and we completed the acquisition of Dorsey, Wright, which, as I mentioned, is already exceeding our expectations. So clearly, we're using all channels to great effect. But in addition, today the company is announcing a two-thirds increase in the dividend to $0.25 per quarter. Is that true, Lee? Two-thirds. Two-thirds increase in dividend to $0.25 per quarter from $0.15. This reflects the financial progress we've made as a company including both growth and diversification, gains that we expect we will improve upon, as well as our commitment to maximize returns to shareholders not only through the effective execution on our strategy and a relentless focus on efficiency, but also through careful and considered use of all available capital deployment options. We have the confidence we are pulling all the right levers and we are well positioned to continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders.","As I've said, we've accomplished many things during the quarter and continue to execute well. And when you look at NASDAQ today versus just a few years ago, we're doing more for our customers on many levels than ever before. It's an incredibly exciting time to be here at NASDAQ.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","Thanks, Bob and good morning. The following comments will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.","I want to start off as I did last quarter by highlighting the impact the stronger dollar had on our results this quarter, as it obscures, in many cases, solid organic growth that we saw in the business. Revenues of $507 million were reduced by $29 million from the prior year quarter as a result of the stronger dollar, and excluding FX and acquisition impacts were up slightly with improving organic growth in non-trading segments offset by some contraction in market services largely the result of lower volumes.","Operating expenses were down $18 million due to FX, but even eliminating this impact, we were able to reduce expenses organically by $7 million or 2% from the prior year. These combined contributed to operating income growth of 5%, excluding the impact of FX, and would have produced $0.04 higher non-GAAP EPS. In order to provide greater understanding of these effects on the business units, we continue to provide a schedule of FX impact on the revenues of each business unit on page 15 of the presentation.","I'll start by reviewing first quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter as shown on page three of the presentation. The 4% or $22 million decline in reported revenue of $507 million consisted of: firstly, organic growth in the non-trading segments of $9 million or 3% from growth in Listings, Information Services and Market Technology, and $4 million in revenues from the Dorsey, Wright acquisition, offset by $15 million due to the impact of FX for a net $2 million decrease in reported revenues.","Secondly, an organic contraction in Market Services net revenues of $6 million or 3%, the result of lower U.S. equity options and FICC revenues against significantly higher cash equity trading revenue, coupled with a $14 million FX headwind for a net $6 million reported decline.","And if we move to page four in the presentation, we show how organic growth breaks down historically between the non-transaction Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Services segments, which had 3% organic growth this quarter, up from the prior quarter and the volume sensitive Market Service segment at negative 3% for the quarter. On the bottom of this page, we reiterate our views on the medium-term organic growth outlook for the non-transactional segments. As I've said in the past that these views were meant to reflect multi-year cross cycle periods and actual growth in shorter periods can be above or below these ranges.","I'm now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be made to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. In Information Services on page five, we saw a $6 million or 5% operational gain partially offset by $4 million of FX headwinds for a $2 million net increase in reported revenues, while the operating margin remained relatively steady at 74%. Within Information Services, data products had unchanged revenues as growth in NASDAQ basic revenues and the inclusion of Dorsey, Wright revenues was partially offset by a $3 million decline in audit collections and a negative $4 million impact from FX.","Index Licensing & Services grew revenues 9% due principally to the inclusion of Dorsey, Wright revenues and secondarily to higher fees related to certain structured products. Core revenues from exchange-traded products licensed to NASDAQ indices were unchanged as increases in assets under management were offset by pricing mix, in particular a lower balance in the QQQs. Growth and assets under management and exchange-traded products licensed to NASDAQ indexes rose 12% to $105 billion at the end of the quarter, primarily due to organic growth and secondarily due to acquired Dorsey, Wright's assets under management.","In Technology Solutions, as shown on page six, we saw a $3 million or 2% operational decline in revenues, which compounded with $7 million in FX headwinds resulted in a $10 million reported decline. However, the operating margin rose to 11% from 9% in the prior period, and operating income was unchanged excluding FX due to fully offsetting operational expense reductions of $3 million. Market Technology revenues fell 5% or $3 million due primarily to negative impact \u2013 FX impact of $5 million more than offsetting organic growth, in particular in the SMARTS surveillance and BWise risk products.","New order intake was $40 million in the first quarter, a bit of a breather after a record $194 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, but the period end backlog finished at a new all time record of $728 million, which bodes well for continued strong organic revenue growth in the periods ahead. Please note that certain pre-trade risk product revenues previously included in the access broker services have been recast as part of Technology Solutions with all prior period figures restated.","Corporate Solutions revenue fell 9% or $7 million year-over-year, reflecting declines in certain investor relations and multimedia product revenues as we continue the product transitions and enhancements intended to enhance the product offering and eliminate redundant platforms, as well as $2 million in negative FX impact, partially offset by higher governance revenues.","Organic growth was material in the Directors Desk governance products, where we saw 18% growth in Directors Desk users and in our GlobeNewswire distribution business. The number of press releases published rose 11%, but broadly across our offerings, we continue to face elevated competitive challenges as we advance the integration and upgrade of our key product platforms.","We remain confident that as we complete the integration and upgrades to the Corporate Solutions offerings, especially when the phased launch of our next-gen investor relations platform is complete, which is expected in late 2015, we will have a suite of solutions for corporate executives that sets a new, higher bar for the industry and an organization fully aligned to support growth over the longer term.","While the segment operating margin of 11% was a material improvement compared to the prior year period, it saw an expected decline from the seasonally higher fourth quarter 2014 level, which is influenced by seasonally high change order requests in our Market Technology business.","Looking forward, we continue to target significant year-over-year improvement in the Technology Solutions margin in 2015 as we work diligently to realize our substantially higher medium-term profitability goals.","Moving to Listing Services on page seven, we saw a $10 million or 17% operational increase in revenues, driven by pricing changes and an increased issuer base, partially offset by $4 million of FX headwinds, resulting in a 10% reported increase in revenues. Operating margin of 44% was up 6 points from the prior year. The U.S. issuer base has 4% more U.S. companies at the end of the quarter compared to the prior year period while in the Nordics, the count is 6% higher with a 21% higher local currency market capitalization.","In Market Services, on page eight, we saw a $6 million or 3% operational decrease in net revenues, which was compounded by $14 million negative FX impact, resulting in a reported revenue decline of 10%. Operating margin however rose to 54% from 50% in the prior period due to both lower core expenses and reduced spending at NLX. Excluding the impact of FX, Market Services operating income would have risen $1 million despite the revenue decline.","Equity derivatives trading and clearing net revenues fell $10 million due to lower U.S. equity options, industry volumes and average capture and a $3 million impact of FX, partially offset by organic growth in Nordic equity derivative revenues. Cash equities trading net revenues rose $2 million as higher U.S. cash equity average capture and increased Nordic industry volumes were partially offset by $6 million in FX headwinds.","Fixed income, currency and commodities, trading and clearing net revenues fell $11 million from the prior year with principally volume driven declines in most FICC product categories. $3 million in foreign exchange headwinds and the scheduled end of revenues associated with an eSpeed technology license customer.","In Access and Broker Services, revenues were down $1 million at $59 million with organic growth offset by $2 million in FX impact. Turning to pages nine and 14 to review the income statement and expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased by $7 million or 2% on an operational basis plus $18 million in FX impact resulting in a $25 million or 8% reported decline.","A significant portion of the operational decline was due to a restructuring initiative, which will deliver $17 million to $19 million in annualized savings, which I'll go into more detail in just a moment. Non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2015 rose 6% on an operational basis, but was mostly offset by foreign exchange resulting in a 1% increase. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 46% up two points from the prior year period.","Net interest expense was $27 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $1 million versus the prior year, mainly due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange on our euro-denominated debt. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 34% in the middle of our 2015, 33% to 35% effective tax rate guidance range.","Non-GAAP net income was $138 million or $0.80 per diluted share compared to $136 million or $0.78 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2014. The $0.02 increase in our non-GAAP EPS represents core organic EPS growth of $0.05 operationally and $0.01 due to acquisitions, partially offset by $0.04 impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.","There were an unusual number and scale of non-GAAP items in this quarter's results and I would like to take a moment to give some detail around these. The items fall in four broad categories. First, we had $150 million in restructuring charges. The largest of these, at $119 million was related to the recent business decision to rebrand NASDAQ OMX as NASDAQ. This charge is simply the non-cash write-off of the OMX trade name booked at the time of acquisition in 2008 and does not reflect any deterioration in the financial performance or the value of the asset.","The remaining $31 million entailed about half of our projected $63 million in total charges expected to be recognized through the second quarter of 2016 related to head count reductions and job transfers to lower cost locations as well as facilities related asset impairment and other charges designed to increase efficiency and reduce costs, an action that we expect to result in $17 million to $19 million in annualized expense savings.","The second category was $31 million in special legal expenses. NASDAQ has established a loss reserve of $31 million for litigation arising from the Facebook IPO in May 2012. The reserve is intended to cover the estimated amount of a settlement of class-action litigation initiated on behalf of investors in Facebook common stock on the date of its IPO.","The reserve would also cover the anticipated cost of re-opening NASDAQ's voluntary accommodation program to allow any NASDAQ member that did not file for compensation in 2013 to submit a claim during the second quarter of 2015, subject to the conditions and limitations that were applicable to claims filed in 2013.","NASDAQ expects that the reopening of the accommodation program will fully resolve claims by UBS Securities against NASDAQ. NASDAQ further anticipates that some or all of the amounts paid from the loss reserve will be reimbursed by applicable insurance coverage.","The third category would be two roughly offsetting items we recognized other income of $13 million related to our share of OCC's income for the year ended December 31, 2014 roughly offset by $12 million charge due to a ruling on a foreign tax item.","And then finally, the fourth category is the exclusion of $15 million of amortization of acquired intangibles in accordance with the change in our non-GAAP reporting methodology we discussed last quarter. I'd also note that we only expect around $25 million of pre-tax cash expenses associated with a total of $195 million in net-GAAP charges in the quarter.","If you turn to page 10, we have lowered our 2015 non-GAAP operating expense guidance by 3% due to both the restructuring effort and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates since we initiated the guidance in January. Our new 2015 non-GAAP operating expense guidance, based on average March 2015 FX rates, is $1.85 billion to $1.110 billion including an unchanged $30 million to $40 million in research and development costs.","Moving onto the balance sheet, please turn to slides 11 and 12; our gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was unchanged at 2.3 times from last quarter as a decrease in the book value of foreign denominated debt and increased trailing 12 month EBITDA offset increased borrowings on the revolver to fund a portion of the Dorsey, Wright acquisition.","We repurchased $30 million of stock in the first quarter bringing our repurchases, since resuming our buyback program in the second quarter of 2014, to $208 million. We've also announced a significant increase in our regular dividend, which we're raising to $0.25 per quarter from $0.15 previously, a 67% increase bringing our yield on our current share price above 2%. This increase in dividend reflects confidence in the stability of the profitability and cash flow of our diverse and growing businesses, our ambition to grow our dividend over time, something that we've communicated since initiating the regular dividend in 2012, a balanced approach in return of capital between dividends and share repurchases, and consideration of peer and broad market yields and payout ratios.","This adds a much more significant income dimension to NASDAQ's investment proposition and something that will broaden the company's investor appeal while still allowing a very substantial amount of cash flow to be deployed where we see the highest risk adjusted returns for shareholders.","Thanks for your time, and I will now turn it back over to Ed.","Edward P. Ditmire - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, can you open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And our first question comes from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good morning, guys. I guess my question first with, Lee, there was a lot of expense movements around and the new guidance, and when you look at that guidance, it's down $35 million, I think to $40 million, the yearly guidance. Can you first tell us what component \u2013 and you did talk about an FX component and then a true cost savings component? Could you break out, out of that $35 million to $40 million, what percentage is what? And then also just on expenses; it looks like the margins in Corporate Solutions were aided by 200 basis points to 300 basis points as you moved the re-categorized revenues, and I just want to make sure that was correct and is that being incorporated into the goals of the margin targets at Corporate Solutions or Technology Solutions?","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","Yeah. So Rich, on the expense guidance, I don't have a precise breakdown for you in terms of the, on the guidance, what is FX and then what is operational. I think it's something we can provide supplementary to you. On the Corporate Solutions element, I don't think that the re-categorization had any significant impact on the overall margins. So I'm a little \u2013 just a little puzzled in terms of what you're seeing on that front, but we can maybe understand that a little more clearly.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think its Corporate Solutions. It's really \u2013 probably TradeGuard (34:58) in the markets.","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","Oh, in the markets.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Excuse me \u2013 it's Technology Solutions, because when we look back at the \u2013 last quarter, you had a 16% or it shows 16% in today's presentation, and it was 14%, I believe, when you reported in January.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so that was definitely the movement of TradeGuard and I would \u2013 I'm just guessing, but assuming that TradeGuard did dilute the existing margin.","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","Yeah. And you know what Rich, I think that what it represents \u2013 that difference represents the shift from including in the last quarter the amortization of acquisition intangibles, whereas in this quarter we're now excluding that for our non-GAAP purposes. Our prior year quarter as reflected in these numbers will also reflect that adjustment. I think that's what the difference is not any shift in the business.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay, okay. And then my one follow-up would be on market structure, and Bob, I thought you summarized sort of some of the events that just occurred as far as the market sentiment and a player coming public. I guess my question is, taken that in perspective, but also sort of the results of what you've done in your test on the make or take model. Would you say that you wouldn't be in favor then of reducing cap fees on the make or take, given that it's \u2013 well, I believe it was \u2013 negatively impact your market share and also the liquidity providers were sort of disincented I guess what my \u2013 I heard you say.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, one is we don't have any final conclusions. It's a pilot limited to a number of stocks and we need to gather more data. But certainly, the data we have here today reveals what we would have guessed. It's a lot easier for those who provide liquidity to stop doing it than others who are accessing liquidity to change their routing table. So we're still working on that problem set. To the extent the results stay very similar, then I think you could reasonably conclude that we wouldn't see a pressing reason to reduce the access fee.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks, guys. First question, just on the non-transaction part of the business. I think if I look over the past three quarters, it looks like the organic growth is coming around 2%. It seems like in some businesses, like Listings you guys have some momentum in pricing power, but there are some things on the Corporate Solutions and some of the other areas where there's this phase of re-pricing, and then I think the initiative is then to start to grow and take market share. So just want to get a sense like where are we in that stage of evolution where we see this maybe lower organic growth as you're going through some of this re-pricing to the process so that at the point that you expect that you see some acceleration once you had that behind you?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Great question. So one, we certainly agree with you that we are seeing really very strong momentum in the Listing business, both here and in Europe, and we're also seeing very strong momentum in NASDAQ Private Markets, which is particularly encouraging. With respect to Corporate Solutions, I would definitely say it's not the time to focus on a given quarter. This year is clearly a year of transition. We are working very hard, and I think quite successfully in coming forward with a number of different products. We mentioned next-gen in particular, but really as I said in my prepared comments across the wide range of products we have there is a significant amount of refresh going on. So we're pleased with the progress we have to-date. We're pleased with kind of the roadmap we have for 2015, but certainly expect to see an acceleration as these new products come on-stream.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks. And then just maybe one on the expense side. Any color you can give on, I know you mentioned it's tough to segment the FX versus the restructuring. But just curious, if you have any detail or when you do get that? And then just on the outlook, I think these \u2013 that the charges tend to be somewhat consistent or are ongoing. Just want to get a sense, when you think about the business model, you think about the level of acquisitions that you do over time. Is there an amount of, kind of charges, restructurings that you'd expect to be kind of consistent on an ongoing basis versus what would be more say one time in nature?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So with the first part of your question, we can definitely give you the breakdown, we just don't have it at our fingertips today.","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","Actually, I can provide more color.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Perfect.","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","So let me just address that quickly. So as we described in the restructuring program, we have identified $17 million to $19 million of cost savings in my earlier remarks associated with the restructuring. I think there have been some incremental savings that we have been able to achieve outside of that restructuring amount, but also I would say roughly in the $20 million category relates to expense savings, and then we have the balance of that difference will reflect the change in FX over that period.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. And the second part of your question, I definitely want to make it very clear that we look at this operation on a continuous basis, and we always focused on how can we run this business more efficiently and more effectively. And the answer you get in one year is always different than the answer you might get in the next year. So when you look at our businesses, independent of any acquisition, you have an organization which will always \u2013 from the bottoms up, analyze what we do and always try to make sure we're properly structured for the perspective periods of time.","When you have that mindset, we will always be going through some one-time or some level of refinement. We see that as a positive indication that the business is alive, dynamic, and thoughtful in terms of how to run the organization. So we'd like actually the number to be bigger, but obviously as we get more efficient, it becomes that much harder to find ways to do it better. But we remain positive that there are always ways for us to figure out how to run this business more efficiently. So I think when you think about NASDAQ, you should think about us always saying what can we do better and we're not going to get hung up on any accounting treatments in light of our ability to improve.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning, folks.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","How are you doing, Brian?","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good. How are you?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good. So just a little bit more detail on both the global rebranding initiative in terms of what you intend to get out of that, and then also in line with that, if you can talk a little bit more detail about the next-gen platform that the timing of the changes to that platform and if there are early revenue contribution targets from doing that, and then if you can remind us on the operating margin target for the TR Corporate Solutions business and the timing of that?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. All right. So let me start with the first part with respect to the rebranding. One is, we're very proud of the way we developed and evolved into a global company. That integration has been, I think very successful when compared with others in this space, somewhat remarkable.","And what was interesting to me for the last number of years, we've had folks from our European operation saying that we should drop the OMX from our name, that NASDAQ was the good global brand and it played in Europe and Asia, and in certain ways it's stronger outside the U.S. than in the U.S. I had resisted that for a period of time but it didn't really make any sense going forward. It's the way our customers think of us, it's the way the public perceives us and it's right for us to have the official corporate name reflect that reality. So that was the decision in the coming.","With respect to corporate solutions, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're going to beta release quite shortly in the next month or two months with selective customers. Obviously that is not a ready-for-production version, but it shows that we're getting close to that. We expect the first major production release of next-gen to be sometime in the third quarter of 2015 and we expect the full release to be available in and around the end of 2015. So as I said, those efforts \u2013 we have a great set of team, people and teams working on it and we grow increasingly comfortable and the customer feedback has been beyond our expectations.","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","And then on the third part, on the Technology Solutions margin, what we have said is that, we do expect to achieve year-over-year improvements on that margin as we successfully integrate the Thomson Reuters integration, reduce the number of platforms. And we have a long-term objective of getting the profitability of that business to 20% or higher, but we have not set a specific timeline. I think we'd like to make certain that we've completed the integration and have a clear review on the success of that before we consider any more precise guidance on timing.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's great. And then just may be one follow-up. Bob, if you could talk a little bit about the energy platform initiative? How it differs from NLX in structure and then if could also comment on what you're thinking about NLX in terms of timing of \u2013 if you continue to go with that and if it still a $0.02 drag per quarter?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that's two follow-on questions, but we'll...","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sorry.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's okay, Brian. All right. So let me start with our energy platform. So one, as you saw with the announcement, the broad base of support is quite remarkable, and I would have to say since the announcement, the number of market participants across the globe, who are signing up for it is greater than we could have anticipated. So you see a lot broader acceptance of the concept with our energy effort.","In addition, it's important to recognize that the core group and our energy product has to pay. So you might call a pay for play, but they have a commitment to the enterprise in terms of real dollars that have to work. So those are two, I think very strong differentials. I also say the FCM community has been particularly receptive to this, and we're getting stronger support again than I could have guessed.","With respect to NLX, you had basically NFX learn from NLX and now NLX is trying to learn from the model that was negotiated with our partners in NFX and we remain, I think optimistic that we have a future for NLX. We watch it every day and as you've highlighted with your number here, we have reduced the operating cost of NLX quite dramatically.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you. I just missed the cutoff. Okay. So can you just talk about the options business, it looks like recent entrants have been having a reasonable impact on market share and the incumbents generally seem to be losing. Maybe what are the new entrants doing effectively and I guess is a NASDAQ response required here?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the one thing that I would say with respect to the Options business, which is outside the normal realm of competitive pressure is that we agreed to participate in a further funding of OCC based upon one, our equity ownership and the strong push by the regulators to bring better balance sheet to that operation. So we did that investment, it represented a good return to NASDAQ's shareholders but I'd have to say that not all customers were wild about that and some wish that they had had the opportunity to participate, and I think certain customers then took that as an opportunity to essentially put us in the penalty box. So it is a 100% our responsibility to get back in the good graces with those customers. We're focused on it. We're working on it hard and we're optimistic going forward. That being said, the options market is competitive. We thrive in competitive field, so we have our plans in place and we have respect for the competitors, but know that we come at it with a strong arsenal of customer centric tools and capabilities.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Chris Allen from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Christopher John Allen - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)","Morning, everyone. Just wanted to ask on the restructuring. What was the thought process that led to the restructuring? What areas was targeted in specifically around in terms of head count reductions? And if it was FX driven, why was there a consideration around potentially using hedges instead?","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","Sure. So, Chris. A couple of answers there. First, the motivation for the restructuring charges. We are always looking at opportunities to improve our cost structure. I think, in particular, given some of the FX headwinds, we felt a higher obligation to take a close look across the businesses and we didn't rule anything out. We really challenged the businesses to find a variety of ways to reduce our costs. As I mentioned, certainly the head count reductions reflect in part permanent reductions, but also the acceleration of an initiative that we've had to look to move certain jobs in operations both market and accounting to lower cost areas, where we see a significant opportunity. So that represents a significant part of the restructuring charge as well as rationalization of some of our global real estate. Through acquisitions, we've acquired a number of facilities, and we've been in the process of consolidating those and have taken some steps to improve efficiencies on that front. So I would just describe it as part of our overall discipline here.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the point I would add is we're very attuned to how we (50:11) capital and what kind of returns we get, so obviously share buybacks are important acquisitions, internal investment. But by far and away, the highest return on invested capital is a restructuring opportunity. If we have the ability to invest to allow us to run more efficiently going forward, that is the best use of capital. So we just wish we had more of these opportunities. I think the team did a great job on reimagining how we can run this place, and obviously we're then reducing our core run rate going forward. So we're very happy with that.","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","And Chris, I think there was a second part to your original question?","Christopher John Allen - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, just whether any of the restructuring shown by FX, it kind of looked that way for future release.","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","Oh! Yeah. Well, not specifically and there's no specific restructuring charge associated with FX. Simply the change in our expense guidance reflects an expectation of a stronger dollar which reduces our overall expenses. I talked about the breakdown of that change where approximately $20 million of it is related to cost saves, the balance due to FX. And in terms of hedging, we do hedge our revenues when we recognize them, when we recognize, when we book the receivables so that we're not exposed to FX exposure on that front, but given the uncertain nature of many of our revenues, particularly on the transactional side or in the market technology business, which involves large contracts in uncertain timing, it's not, from our view, economically attractive for us to attempt to hedge those and we expect those exposures even out over time.","Christopher John Allen - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Good morning, everyone.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","How are you doing, Alex?","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good. So quick question for you guys, I guess, on FX again. So, Lee you gave this guidance which obviously implied some benefit from lower \u2013 from a weaker krona, I guess in March versus January for the year. I think it was \u2013 I think the krona was down like 5%, 6% when you kind of look at that March versus January timeframe. Any sense if you were to look at the revenues of the business, what that total number would look like, I guess if you looked at the same kind of FX impact in March versus January for the full quarter? Just trying to get a sense to like really match up your guidance on expenses and the kind of the lower guidance on expenses because of FX relative to revenues?","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","Right. So, Alex just to give you some sense around that, and it's important to understand that our primary FX exposure, it's a range of currencies, but it's not predominantly the Swedish krona because our revenues and expenses roughly match, and if you look at the enhanced disclosure that we'll be providing the 10-Q, it will provide a clearer sense of that transactional FX exposure. It really is predominantly a euro exposure, and to give you some sense of that, on a year-over-year basis from a revenue perspective, our revenues were impacted by a negative $29 million year-over-year. But on the sequential quarter basis from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, it was a $13 million impact on revenues. Does that give you the answer that you're looking for?","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sure. I was just kind of looking for the run rate as of March because you guys are using March for the FX, for the expense guidance for the full year, which March was obviously a further headwind, but we can follow-up offline. And then just my follow-up on, I guess around Corporate Solutions, clearly you mentioned this is a still kind of work in progress for you guys this year. Just wondering, where you think the quarterly run rate could bottom out where you \u2013 given the competitive pressures you guys are seeing in the business. It sounded like you thought you were kind of closer to the bottom couple of quarters ago, but that number continues to slip. So just kind of curious to see like, where this could go before we can start thinking about rebuilding that number.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think we're near the bottom. We do expect as we get further in the year for that number to have an inflection point.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got you. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","How are you doing?","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good. Couple of questions just around capital management, sideways to dividend. Just wanted to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about the dividend longer term, and also your current leverage levels as well?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. So, let me start with the dividend question, and as I said in my prepared remarks, we look at multiple channels for use of capital. I think it's important for us always to be positioned to execute across those multiple channels. We certainly did that very successfully in the first quarter with both share buybacks and the acquisition of Dorsey, Wright, and further investments in internal initiatives. So that's what we have to do. So the raising of the dividend is certainly a quite strong positive, because it means that we think our business model is strong enough for us to execute across all those channels while increasing the dividend by two-thirds. And that is the benefit of the great execution we've had over the last number of quarters.","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer & EVP-Corporate Strategy","And Ashley, on the leverage question, as I noted, our total debt or gross debt-to-EBITDA is 2.3 times, and that \u2013 that reflects at one level a benefit from the stronger dollar having an impact on our euro-denominated debt, but offset by \u2013 what I would describe as a temporary increase in debt as we were financing the Dorsey, Wright acquisition through our revolver. But we would \u2013 we expect for that dent to be paid down over the balance of the year, and we would generally continue to target that number in the low 2s as our leverage \u2013 normal leverage level.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for taking my questions.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great.","Operator","Thank you. I would like now to turn the call back to CEO, Bob Greifeld for any further remarks.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great. Well, I first thank everybody for the time this morning. As I said in my prepared remarks, it was a very solid quarter. We are executing really across a wide range of our businesses and it is an exciting time to be here at NASDAQ and we certainly have many great prospects going forward, and we appreciate your support in this effort. Look forward to talking to you in very short order. So, thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ed Ditmire, NASDAQ's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ed Ditmire","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ OMX's third quarter 2013 earnings results. On the line are Bob Greifeld, our CEO; Lee Shavel, our CFO; Ed Knight, General Counsel; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open up to Q&A.","The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material nonpublic information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.","I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I now will turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to announce a very strong third quarter. And what is noteworthy, this is the first time our acquisitions of eSpeed and Thomson Reuters' IR, PR and Multimedia businesses are fully incorporated in our results. You can see our mix of business is evolving, and we have set a new revenue and operating profit baselines.","In the third quarter 2013, revenues reached a record $506 million, driven largely by our Technology Solutions segment, now a $524 million annualized revenue business, as well as our Information Services segment, which set a new high with $472 million in annualized revenue. In addition, with the inclusion of eSpeed, 2\/3 of the transaction-based revenue in our Market Services segment now comes from derivatives and fixed income products, with 1\/3 now coming from equity trading, a pretty remarkable transformation. Looking at the bottom line, on a non-GAAP basis, third quarter EPS of $0.66 was up 6% over the year -- the prior year with $0.62. Our non-GAAP operating income was up 12% year-on-year.","We are on a good course, and we are seeing positive momentum in a continuing difficult environment. We are executing our strategy, and we are in progress and making progress against our targets and objectives we've outlined on our recent calls. This quarter provides further evidence that our strategy to leverage our technology and customer relationships to build profitable businesses, which deliver attractive returns for our shareholders, is working. Our objective is to become an entrenched provider of a diversified portfolio of services to the financial and investment community. When we think about our strategy and objectives, clearly, the integration of eSpeed and the IR, PR and Multimedia businesses of Thomson Reuters are important to these efforts. We're making good progress with each of these, and I'll come back to this later.","I want to turn to some of the broad business highlights that defined our quarter and the results we delivered. Our core listing business continue to demonstrate that our value proposition to issuers is compelling. With a recent high of a 59% IPO win rate in what has been a very busy quarter in terms of new issue activity, with activity through the first 9 months of 2013 the highest since 2007, we're obviously pleased about that. We also are having one of our best years on the IPO front, and most recently, we won several high-profile IPOs, including Rocket Fuel, FireEye, Potbelly Sandwiches, Sprouts Farmers Market and RetailMeNot. And just a few weeks ago, we won one of the largest switches of the year in Marriott, a $12-billion market cap company. And in addition to that, Fairchild Semiconductor, another billion-dollar-plus company which chose to switch to NASDAQ from our competitor.","What you are seeing in many of our core businesses is a microcosm of our diversification strategy implemented at the corporate level, and there is no better representation of that than our Global Index business. We saw a strong revenue growth in both our index licensing business, which grew 20% and, the first time, has more than half of its licensed AUMs and products other than the queues. Our Market Data business grew 19% due to a combination of organic revenue growth led by NASDAQ Basic, the inclusion of eSpeed market data and higher audit collections.","In our Market Technology business, within our Technology Solutions segment, we had several key wins right in the quarter that featured record new order intake and pushed the backlog to record highs. These include Borsa Istanbul, who, in addition to supplying them with our leading technology, we are forming a strategic partnership to help them expand their global presence. Other notable market tech wins include Boerse Stuttgart and Tadawul, which is the Saudi Stock Exchange. Overall organic revenue growth for the company was 4% year-on-year, and we saw organic growth in all 3 of our nontrading segments.","With regard to the Corporate Solutions business, which is the other business in our Technology Solutions segment -- they don't think they're the other, obviously the other way around. As I mentioned, we're very pleased with the progress we're making against our plans to integrate the Thomson Reuters businesses. Essential to our efforts has been the global reorganization of the sales team, which enables us to better execute and serve our base of 10,000 global customers. While we already have strong relationships with a long list of clients, our cross-sell opportunity is significant given that the vast majority of our existing customers are using only 1 or 2 of our solutions. In addition, we have been developing a new platform of shared standards, which will provide a uniform and consistent technology framework for integrating core components across our entire product suite. This product -- or the product roadmap that the integration team has been working on will create the next generation of IR and PR platforms. Our mission is to create a stronger industry leader in Corporate Solutions, and we believe we're absolutely on target to do so.","Now let me move on to eSpeed, which is a business we are extremely excited about in our Market Services segment. With the acquisition of eSpeed, we're now one of the leading providers of electronic government bond trading. Leveraging our leading technology is core to what we do, and we have established a near-term goal of achieving best-in-class responsiveness for the eSpeed platform, both in terms of latency and the consistency of that latency under varying volume loads. Right now, we think we're on track to accomplish this target by the end of the year, and we look to lever this to improve our market share. Looking forward a bit more, in the first quarter of 2014, we will move the eSpeed matching engine to our Carteret Data center, which will bring it closer to more of our customers and enhance its resiliency. In addition to the work we're doing on the technology front, we've been successful at bringing new market participants onto the platform with 4 new customers since we closed the transaction and another 4 expected to begin trading by year end. Also, we intend to add value to this eSpeed offering by expanding its product offerings. We expect to launch the first of these new products in early 2014.","Despite continued record levels of quantitative easing, treasury volumes were up almost 20% year-on-year in the third quarter 2013, and we expect to continue to enjoy market volume tailwinds in the form of both growth and treasury supply and a bias towards higher volatility and turnover of treasuries, something that will be fully realized as QE2 tapers then eventually ends.","In the quarter, we also continued to see solid traction in the internal investments we've made in our future. These include NLX, our European interest rate derivatives offering; FinQloud, a cloud-based data storage management solution for the brokerage community; and WorkSpace, our virtual data and product offering.","As we move forward through the fourth quarter and into beginning of 2014, we have several areas of critical focus: First, as always, we will continue to manage our franchises with the focus and the discipline, which is our trademark, while ensuring we're meeting our customers' needs. Second, we will continue our strong execution on our plans for both Thomson Reuters and eSpeed. Although they're already contributing to the dynamic evolution of our business and accreting to our investors, it's still early days and we are, in fact, just getting started. That said, we're on a good path to reach growth and synergy targets we have established for ourself. Lastly, we will continue our focused delevering plans so that we can return to our long-term leverage target sometime in the first half of 2014.","This quarter represents strong progress in a continuing suboptimal business and political environment. And while we at NASDAQ OMX are proud of this progress, we're more excited by the opportunities that our diversified business model presents to our employees, our customers, our investment -- and our investors. We look forward to our future.","With this, I'll turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Shavel","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. The following comments will focus on our non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaqomx.com.","I'll start by reviewing our third quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter. Net revenues increased $94 million to a record $506 million. Contributing to this increase was $78 million or a 27% increase in subscription and recurring revenue, primarily from acquisitions but also from material organic growth. Subscription and recurring revenue now represents 73% of total revenues. Transaction-driven revenues rose $16 million on the inclusion of transaction revenue related to the eSpeed acquisition, partially offset by slightly lower revenue in our legacy trading businesses, in particular by U.S. equities and derivatives. On an organic basis, constant currency and excluding acquisitions, total company net revenues rose $16 million or 4%.","I'm now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Information Services, which includes our Market Data and Index businesses, increased revenues by $19 million or 19% to $118 million and operating profit by $14 million or 19% to $86 million. Operating margin was unchanged at 73% compared to the prior year.","Market Data had a $16 million increase in revenues on growth in new product sales, in particular, NASDAQ Basic, select pricing actions, such as an increase for Level 2 quotes and mutual fund services, the inclusion of eSpeed market data and higher audit collections, which were $7 million higher than the prior period.","Index Licensing and Services grew revenues 20%, with a number of licensed exchange-traded products up 57% to 143 and assets in these rising 70% to $79 billion. One interesting footnote in index is that for the first time, the majority of the assets under management in licensed products associated with our indices are in products other than in our industry-leading QQQ ETF.","Technology Solutions, which includes Corporate Solutions and Market Technology, increased revenues by $58 million or 79% to $131 million, mostly because of the impact of the Thomson Reuters and BWise acquisitions, but also due to organic growth at both the legacy Corporate Solutions business and growth in Market Technology. Operating profit increased from $6 million to $9 million due to both the full quarter inclusion of Thomson Reuters and higher contribution from existing businesses.","Corporate Solutions revenue saw a large step-up in scale more than tripling compared to the prior period due mostly to the impact of a full quarter inclusion of the Thomson Reuters acquisition and secondarily due to continued organic growth in our legacy Corporate Solutions products, such as Directors Desk, where 232 clients were added, and press release services, which saw a 25% higher volume.","Market Technology revenues grew 4%, and order intake at $119 million and backlog at $579 million both set new highs. Significant new business wins included Borsa Istanbul and Boerse Stuttgart, and we also had a strong quarter in terms of SMART surveillance product sales and BWise orders.","I note here on our Technology Solutions operating margins, we saw stable margins versus the last quarter, but I also wanted to expand a bit on some of the positives and negatives that canceled each other out in terms of the sequential margin story. We did enjoy the benefit of a full quarter's worth of the Thomson Reuters acquisition, which generally enjoys higher margins than our legacy Corporate Solutions business, but the third quarter see some soft seasonality at both Thomson Reuters and our legacy Corporate Solutions business. We also have some temporarily elevated cost in the early quarters of the acquisitions stemming from temporary support services, professional services fees, et cetera, that will be receding over the next few quarters. We continue to target 20% plus margins in the Technology Solutions segment within the next few years.","Market Services, which includes our derivatives, equities and fixed income trading, as well as associated Access and Broker Services, saw a $15 million or 8% increase in revenues to $200 million due primarily to the inclusion of transaction and hosting revenues of the acquired eSpeed business, partially offset by a decline in legacy Market Services revenue. In particular, declines in U.S. equities and derivatives more than offset higher European equities and derivatives. Operating profit increased $5 million or 6% to $85 million, and operating margin of 43% was unchanged compared to the prior year period.","Net derivatives and fixed income trading revenues rose 24% due to the inclusion of $18 million in net eSpeed transaction revenues. I'd like to note here that the $18 million is net of $1 million in transaction-related costs, and our reporting has classified such transaction-related costs into a contra revenue item, different than how we showed eSpeed's 2012 results when the deal was announced, with the gross trading revenues reflected in revenues and these variable costs reflected in operating costs. Excluding this change, net fixed income trading revenues were relatively flat from the prior year period as higher industry volumes were offset by lower market share due to share declines that occurred prior to NASDAQ ownership. In derivatives trading, European revenues rose 4%, principally on revenue associated with clearing, but U.S. derivatives saw a decline that more than offset this increase on slightly lower industry volumes and market share compared to the prior year period. Net equity trading revenues fell 2% as European equity revenue growth of 17%, a product mainly of industry volume, was more than offset by a 14% decline in U.S. equities on lower industry volumes and market share.","In Access and Broker Services, revenues fell $1 million or 2% to $65 million due largely to muted demand for ports and co-location, partially offset by the addition of eSpeed hosting revenues and growth in newer products like Microwave.","Listing Services, which includes U.S. and European listings, saw a $2 million or 4% increase in revenues to $57 million, principally on higher European listing fees, which reflect higher market capitalization there. In U.S. listing fees, results were flat as higher fee revenue was offset by lower revenues associated with events at the market site facility, which is undergoing a renovation. Operating profit decreased $1 million or 4% to $22 million, and operating margin of 39% was down 3% versus the prior year period. U.S. IPOs priced in the quarter doubled to 64 from 30 in the prior year period, and our IPO win rate increased to 59% from 57% in the prior year period. In addition to having a productive quarter in terms of both new issue activity and a very strong win rate, we gained as many switches as we saw depart at 4.","Non-GAAP operating expenses increased by $73 million from the prior year, with the vast majority of the increase from the 2 acquisitions. Organic expenses, excluding the acquisitions and assuming constant currency, rose 7% this quarter, consisting of a 6% increase in core expenses and 1% due to higher GIFT spending. That organic increase is higher than normal due largely to timing issues around certain compensation items, which affected different quarters in 2013 compared to 2012, and elevated professional service expenses associated in part to managing certain support functions during the early months of the acquisitions. Year-to-date, organic expense growth was 2%, about half of which is the impact of the higher GIFT budget.","Moving on to 2013 expense guidance on Slide 20. We are narrowing our guidance range for 2013 now that we are 3 quarters through the year, and our new guidance is $1,120,000,000 to $1,135,000,000 compared to the prior $1,120,000,000 to $1,160,000,000 guidance range. We are lowering the new initiative forecast of $45 million as we ended up funding fewer projects than we originally anticipated when we communicated the original $50 million to $60 million range at the beginning of the year. And our core expense forecast has narrowed onto $1,075,000,000 to $1,090,000,000 from the previous $1,070,000,000 to $1,100,000,000.","Non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter of 2013 was $202 million, up from $181 million in the prior period. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 40%, down from 44% in the prior year period, primarily the result of larger contribution from the lower margin Corporate Solutions businesses due to the Thomson Reuters acquisition plus increased levels of internal investment -- internal initiative investment and, in particular, NLX.","Net interest expense was $30 million in the third quarter of 2013, an increase of $8 million versus the prior year due to increased borrowings associated with our acquisitions.","The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of '13 was 34% at the low end of our 34% to 36% guidance range. Going forward, we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the 34% to 36% range.","Non-GAAP net income was $113 million or $0.66 per diluted share compared to $105 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2012. The $0.04 increase in our EPS reflects a $0.02 improvement in our core operating profitability, a $0.05 benefit from acquisitions, net of financing costs and a $0.01 benefit from foreign exchange, partially offset by $0.03 of increased spending on GIFT initiatives and $0.01 higher due to a fully diluted share count increase.","Moving on to the balance sheet on Slide 22. We are showing our debt structure and our debt maturities. Our higher debt and leverage versus the prior year reflects the completion of our acquisitions of Thomson Reuters at the end of May and eSpeed at the end of June financed largely with debt, while both our debt and leverage declined versus the second quarter of 2013, reflecting debt paid down in the quarter since those acquisitions were funded. In the third quarter, the company paid down $98 million in debt, including retiring the $93 million convertible bonds, but changes in FX led to a $31 million increase in the U.S. dollar amount of debt on the balance sheet netted to a $67 million decline in total debt quarter-to-quarter.","Our gross debt leverage fell to 2.9x from 3x last quarter, consistent with our original expectations, and we continue to expect leverage to return to the mid-2s range within 3 to 4 quarters of the closing of the acquisitions, so before the end of the second quarter in 2014. Please bear in mind there is some seasonality to our cash flows and in addition to the fact, the third quarter is generally a soft earnings quarter due to lower activity levels. NASDAQ gets a specially strong cash flow in the first quarter due to payments of annual listing fees in that period. Once we reach our mid-2s gross debt to EBITDA leverage target, which, again, we are progressing according to plan on -- and expect to complete by the end of the second quarter of '14, we'll enjoy flexibility to return or deploy capital where it generates the highest returns for our shareholders.","Thanks for your attention, and I will now turn it back over to Ed.","Ed Ditmire","Stephanie, can you please queue the Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess this quarter is a little bit more difficult because you get the acquisitions coming in, a little bit more moving parts. And just the first, a cleanup on them to try to clarify some things, but on the eSpeed, what was the Market Data because we can see the $18 million in the fixed income trading, but what -- was there other contributions to Market Data, I think, you referred to in the prepared remarks? The other question, Lee, is, your expenses looks -- you beat us on expenses materially. And I'm -- when I take just the 7% increase from last year, 3Q '12, I'm, Lee, coming up with $57 million in expenses from the acquisition. That's down below the run rate of the $65 million you guided to. I'm just trying to see whether that's to do with GIFT spending or trying to explain the lower expense run rate that you reported in the quarter.","Robert Greifeld","All right. So Rich, I'll take the first question as Lee prepares for the second, a more difficult question. So when you look at the eSpeed numbers, we obviously have, as we do with basically all acquisitions, made a part of NASDAQ OMX. So the co-location services revenue and the Market Data revenue is separate from the transaction revenue. I think to get to the nut of your question, we had $99 million in revenue on a gross basis. I think the quarter was slightly below that pace if you add back co-lo and Market Data, but that's expected given it was the third quarter.","Lee Shavel","And Rich, on your question, the -- when you look at it versus the prior quarter, I think, probably, some of the gap here, you're looking at third quarter versus the second quarter, acquisitions added about $39 million of additional expenses. We had a benefit of about $6 million lower expenses due to lower GIFT spending from the second quarter, and we had an increase of about $4 million of expenses on the quarter related to some higher compensation. So I think overall, it's probably lower GIFT spending that accounts for some of the differences here.","Robert Greifeld","And the general comment I want to make is that we operate under the structure that we look for effectiveness first and efficiency second. So with respect to the acquisitions and, in particular, Thomson Reuters, we're at the effective level. We're not at the efficient level yet. That's not -- well, it not was our goal for this quarter, the last quarter or possibly this quarter, but we obviously would get there as we go into 2014. So it's exciting as the numbers are strong, but we have a lot of work left to do, and we obviously will get it down as we get into '14.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then one sort of follow-up on the strategic side. Bob, BATS and Direct Edge announced a merger, and I was just trying to see how you view that competitor -- now a combined competitor. And they've talked about -- well, your Market Data is extremely strong, but do you see that -- now that they have more material market share, has that been any sort of an issue on Market Data and the proprietary -- and the growth you're seeing in proprietary market data?","Robert Greifeld","Well, we were the innovator in this space with NASDAQ Basic, and we have 1,000 customers now and a commanding position, and it's our job to continue to work and improve that product. So we like our positioning. We certainly think that BATS and Direct Edge and NYSE, for that reason, also will try to compete with us, but it feels good to be the innovator in the space who has a strong position of incumbency and we're not going to rest on our laurels.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I had 2 follow-ups on the recent acquisitions as early progress looks pretty positive. First, on Corporate Solutions, Bob, you spoke about the cross-selling opportunity on the enhanced product suite. I was just wondering if you had thought about framing out opportunity and discussed the sales and distribution you have in place. And is that where you want it to be in order to kind of execute on that opportunity set?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, I would say this. The effort to combine the sales teams has been definitely ahead of pace, and you see it's essentially -- Dawn [ph], as I'm looking at Anna as I'm answering that question. She is shaking her head also. So that's good. And I think we will probably give you more granularity as we advance in time. I would say that Directors Desk is the hot product from the ex-Thomson Reuters people. Automated board books is a hot segment, and to be able to lever that additional channel with that proven product, I think has been successful so far and I think it will be remarkably successful as we go forward in 2014.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then shifting over to the business you acquired from eSpeed, you spoke about 4 new customers onboarding during the quarter. Could you talk about the nature of these customers, how meaningful you think they can be and just what's the universe of other new customers because I think a lot of people out there think that this business was relatively saturated and mature amongst the customer set?","Robert Greifeld","No. I would say -- and I'm looking at Eric as I say this, but we have, I think, a material opportunity to expand the customer base. One is that given the relationships that prior eSpeed had, there were certain customers who chose not to deal with the platform, and I think we, as the new player coming in, have the opportunity to change that. In addition, as we set for the announcement of the deal, that as you move the customers into Carteret and make it very easy and facilitate the onboarding of those customers in Carteret who are not customers of the eSpeed platform, we'll see some pickup from there. So we're excited about that. We're on with the plan.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on that, Bob. What was the -- can you just remind -- what's the limiting factor of why these customers may not have been there with the prior owner?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, I think one -- you've got 2 things. One is you had certain relationships that had been, I would think, handicapped through the years that now we as the new player can address; and two is that the equity world is still the widest world out there in fixed income, in U.S. treasuries. Is big, but it's not as big as the customer set that we have here. So we take those 2 drivers and it prevents -- presents us with opportunities. I also want to highlight that we made 3 fairly substantial changes to the platform since the acquisition. And as I said in the prepared comments, we're looking in the fourth quarter to really get us close to parity with the competitor with respect to raw speed and also the ability to perform under stress.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So my first question is on the regulatory environment and, I think specifically, regulation of op exchange trading. It does seem like there's more conversation as it is more actually looking into the issue of op exchange trading. Can you just kind of give an update of where you see things standing right now?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I would make this general comment. It's that I think the commission is in a better position than it have been in a while to execute on their desires. So I think under Mary Jo's leadership, you have a commission that's focused on getting things done. So I think in the fullness of time, that will be very helpful. And so while the debate continues to go on with respect to what is a proper structure, at the end of the day, we see that any change in structure will be good for us. We, obviously, will sweat the details and advocate for what we think is the right solution for the market, but at end of the day, the most important thing is that something happens, something changes, and my prediction is, with Mary Jo's leadership, we'll get there in some reasonable period of time.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right. I appreciate that. And my follow-up question...","Robert Greifeld","Yes, I just want to make sure that I'm not speaking for the commission. This is my personal opinion.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Noted. So my follow-up question is moving back to Thomson Reuters. Do you have a data on what the pro forma revenue will look like if you guys would have held that business a year ago? Just kind of curious on what the overall trends have been and the retention of their existing customers.","Robert Greifeld","Yes. I would say this, I don't have the facts in front of me. Lee will think about it. But I think the business has been operating under a similar path as in the Thomson world. So I don't think that we have materially changed that path for the better or for the worse in the period of time that we owned it. Obviously, our job is to make sure we change it for the better. And we have a lot of good things going on, as I referenced, with the sales reorganization and the cross-selling of the products. But that hasn't been a material impact to the revenue arc. So I think you see the same operation of the business as before.","Lee Shavel","Yes, and I would say, Patrick, it's difficult because we have just -- we're pulling businesses out of Thomson Reuters. We don't have a good kind of accounting comparison from one entity to the other. I think all we can really rely on our -- out of the operational experience that we have with the business right now. So I don't think we can answer that question precisely.","Robert Greifeld","Yes, so the dominant thought I want to leave at this call is these 2 acquisitions are, in fact, accreting to our shareholders today. They're being run in much the same way, or performing much the same way they did before we acquired them. But that gives us, I think, great optimism because we have a whole plethora of plans to improve the operation, to rollout new products, to make some product rationalization decisions, which a lot of these decisions have been made -- more to be made between now and the end of the year, which will have, I think, a fairly dramatic impact on the performance of the business in 2014. So for us, it's just a wonderful position to be in, to be putting scores up in the board with respect to the acquisition, representing, I think, proper purchase price and obviously, beneficial financing. But a lot of what we call the alpha return yet to come. And we're more excited now about the alpha returns we can deliver from these acquisitions than we were at the time that the deals were announced.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hill with Barclays.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I had a quick question. I wanted to get back to the GIFT spending here, sort of, the lower outlook going forward. I'm just kind of wondering what drove the change there and how you're thinking about some of the revenue outlook for some of those new initiatives, particularly like NLX, which has been eating up a little bit of the GIFT spend more recently?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, well, one is, the GIFT analysis is clearly from a bottoms up. The merits of the concepts and the business opportunities have to stand for themselves and so that's not governing the budget in a given month, quarter or really, a year for that perspective. So we're very happy that we're funding the right opportunities for us at this point in time. I think the revenue opportunity for NLX is delayed but still encouraging. As for those who watch the market share has seen that there has been some steady incremental progress over the last number of weeks, we do expect further participation between now and the end of the year. And we're watching it very closely and I say over the last 3 weeks, the progress has been encouraging.","Lee Shavel","I would just add one element here is that the reduction doesn't reflect a defunding of projects that were approved. So we aren't cutting back on the projects that we were excited about that we think have great promise. We do have money that has been set aside at the beginning of the year for new projects that will come through the pipeline. And either there haven't been as many projects or the projects that were presented, we decided, didn't represent good returns or investments at this stage. I think that -- I'm sorry, that, Ken, is what is coloring the difference here as we get to the end of the year.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. A follow-up here is on the Options market share. It looks like the overall market remains competitive. You've got a competitor out there being very aggressive through the back part of this year. I was just wondering if you could comment on how you're thinking about market share going forward? Does it get to the -- some like Cash Equities, where you get to more of a steady-state and you're kind of happy with where it is? Or is it something we can expect you guys to really ramp up and be more aggressive on towards the end of the year here?","Robert Greifeld","Well, happy would obviously be the wrong word with respect to just having steady market share. The qualifying comment I would make is the dividend trades have declined. Absent any regulation, we've seen some clearing firms step away from that business. So if you will isolate out the dividend trades, I think the market share has been very steady over the past number of months or quarters and that is, obviously, in face of renewed competitive threats and pressure. So it's the world we live in and we're very comfortable with it. Our Options team, led by Eric, has been incredibly strong. And I would say that the plans they have in place gives me great comfort. And we do manage the business for both profit and market share. So we're very happy with the progress, I think, on a combined basis for both metrics.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just following up, I guess, on the last question and just maybe focusing on the Cash Equities piece of the business. It looks like your market share last quarter came down again and then started to recover a little bit in October. So I just want to get a sense of whether or not you have changed anything on the pricing side that's leading to slightly better market share so far in the fourth quarter?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I do like our capture rate in the third quarter. I think you'll see a continuation and possibly an improvement of that in the fourth quarter. So I think the team is doing the proper job of managing profitability versus share. I think we could get into a quarter or 2 where you'll see both of them optimize simultaneously. So we're excited about that. So I think our positioning in Cash Equities is relatively strong and we expect to see improved metrics in the times -- in the quarters to come.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then on the -- on Thomson Reuters business, there's a couple of things in the press recently discussing the subsidies that New York Stock Exchange is providing to their list of clients. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of Thomson Reuters revenue has come from NYSE-listed subsidies?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, it's a small percent. I think it's around $11 million. So in the scheme of the operation, it's not large. We had, in our board model, planned for the elimination of that subsidy. I would say that the actual dollar is probably $1 million or so higher than we had in the board model. But I think the good news here is we probably gained multiples of that, with respect to customer goodwill, I think our competitor chose to announce the end of the subsidy in Carteret in a sudden way, it was not popularly received by the customer base. And we were able to step in and back stop that in a quick fashion. So in terms of our overall strategy of cross-selling into these accounts, I think we've come out of this situation quite positive and with a higher level of customer acceptance and goodwill, and I think that will serve us very well in the quarters to come.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just on the organic growth, you guys mentioned this quarter that you had 4% year-over-year. I think stepping away from the transaction business and looking at the nontransaction side, given that you have these transactions now incorporated. When we start thinking the next 12 months on that organic growth rate of 4%, like, is that sustainable? Do you see some areas where you can beat that 4%? Just want to get some sense in terms of when you're budgeting -- what you think those nontransaction revenues can do in a decent capital markets backdrop?","Robert Greifeld","All right. I was waiting for the last comment and you put it in there. So assuming you have a decent environment, I think, one, from a macro point of view, we think that a single-digit number, mid-single-digit number is a proper target for us. I prefer to think about it from a bottoms up point of view, from a product point of view, what products can we come to market with and what markets can we go after. And that, obviously, can yield us to a larger number if we're able to successfully execute on the business. So direct answer is, I think the mid-single digits is something we think about, but we obviously aspire to more than that as we build our execution plans for these businesses.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the cash side, so as we get to, say, second quarter next year -- and just maybe just give an update in terms of when you think about the targets on debt-to-EBITDA, whether it's total debt or net debt. I'm just trying to -- I think when you look at priorities in terms of looking at investing in the business, going back to picking up the buybacks, just want to rank those priorities once we get to your target debt level?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, I would think that conversation is something we'll be happy to have when we get there. Obviously, we have a lot of execution to do between here and now. We're pleased with the progress and we're pleased with the debt paydown we made in this quarter. And we'll continue to do that. But a lot of wood to chop between now and then. And when we get there, it would be the proper time for us to think about it in a fulsome way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Moving back to eSpeed. I just was wondering when those fixed eSpeed contracts come up for renewal, are you trying to restructure them so that there's more of a variable component, just given your volume outlook for treasuries? Or are you kind of happy with having a fixed component? And then also, I'm not sure if this is something that you can tell, but I'd be curious if, like, all those contracts come up for renewal at the same time or if they're staggered over the course of the year?","Robert Greifeld","They're staggered over the course of the year. And fixed contracts, obviously, there's some good to it and there's some bad to it. I think we prefer to see hybrid. Left to our own devices, we'd like to see a fixed element with an upside based upon increased volume. So you somewhat protect your downside, limit your upside. It think we'd be comfortable with that as the outcome.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then on NLX, I think you guys said that you'd be kind of evaluating, in the first quarter, whether it's something that you want to keep investing in because it is taking up quite a bit of your GIFT budget. But I thought maybe you could run us through some of the decision criteria there, like, what do you need to see to keep the operation open? Is there a volume or open interest threshold? Does it need to be approaching breakeven or a certain number of clients or -- I'm just wondering if there is some kind of trigger there?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I think the dominant trigger -- and there are many, but if I had to highlight one, I would say this, we have an engaged group of partners that came together, rallied around the team to launch this effort. These partners have varying levels of ability to deploy in a given time frame. To the extent that the partners have done what they could do, meaning, that they were connected and they were giving us the full they could give us, then, that is the time we say, \"Okay, let's assess where we're at.\" So clearly, if we do that and we're at 5% and growing, then, we're very happy. If we're at 1% and stable, then, we're unhappy. So we're working hard to make sure each and every one of our partners is doing everything he or she said that they would do. And we're making progress. And fourth quarter is a big effort. We obviously want to get a lot of it done going in before the system freezes -- it happened in mid-December, and we're going to gauge it as we go along. And one of the, obviously, interesting things with the GIFT council is it approves these fundings, but it also has a fundamental mission to be clinical with respect to its evaluation of the progress and its evaluation of its prospective future. And that's one of the key skill sets we have developed here in NASDAQ OMX, and it's something we think about on a regular basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just wanted -- I might have missed this before. But just, the expense guidance for the full year implies a decent tick-up in the fourth quarter expenses off of 3Q. Is there any seasonality in there? Is there any specific drivers to think about for the quarter?","Lee Shavel","Yes, Chris, there is. In the third quarter, we do have a lower level of overall on expenses due to it's generally a quieter quarter in the business so we have less associated expenses. So I think the uptick that you see reflects that. It also reflects an expected increase, to some extent, of some GIFT spending in the fourth quarter. And so I'd say those are the 2 primary components that create that situation that you correctly identified with the guidance, that we are expecting an increase in expenses in the fourth quarter.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then not to beat a dead horse but going back to eSpeed a little bit. ICAP's volumes were up or BrokerTec's volumes in treasuries are up about 34% year-over-year. So it looks like most of the market share was lost to them. Maybe, is there any specific points that you guys are focused on to reverse the market share deterioration? I know you talked about moving to Carteret, but is there anything else -- whether it was pricing, anything else that you think drove the decline in market share over the last year?","Robert Greifeld","Yes. So let me start with a general comment. What's exciting to us is both eSpeed and the Thomson Reuters acquisitions are providing an attractive return to our investors today and they help contribute to this very strong quarter. That being said, we, ourselves, have not done that much to add to their operational excellence. And that will not be the situation as we go forward in time, thereby, inferring that the returns on the investments, while strong today, will get even stronger. With respect to eSpeed, since we've owned the asset, the market share has been essentially stable. It is not a goal that we have to remain stable at the market share. We are basically launching a multipronged plan to address that. We've highlighted some of the things we've done already. Clearly, the move to Carteret will be helpful. Clearly, the ability to get our system on par with the competitive system, which we think we'll do by the end of the quarter, will be helpful as we go into 2014. And probably, most importantly, is the building and strengthening and rebuilding, in certain cases, of relationships with our customers. And that effort is ongoing and that's all done at the head trader level instead of done at the head of the fixed income division and probably, most importantly, has to be done trader by trader. So we're on with that. So we haven't seen -- in the quarters results we have today, we haven't seen any results of that yet. You will in the time to come. And just as in these quarterly results, you have not really seen, yet, any of the good work we're doing with respect to Thomson Reuters, and you'll see that also. So a very strong quarter. Excites us that right now it's just because we bought assets at good prices with good financing and there's more good stuff to come.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First question is a regulatory one. There's been a lot of chatter floating around about whether exchanges should have the ability to self-regulate. And just wondering if you guys could comment, in a worst-case scenario, if NASDAQ lost its ability to be an SRO, what exactly would that mean for you guys?","Robert Greifeld","All right. So one, I would separate out the SRO question from the Listings versus the Transaction business. So I think if there's going to be any serious discussion, it will be primarily around the Transaction business. But I'm not inferring that there will. But in the Transaction business, I think it's very important to recognize that we will have a contractual relationship with these customers. And if we're going to be reliant on the contract, we would be in a position to have a contract very similar to any other transaction processing vendor in the world. And that contract does not subject due to, what I would call, consequential damages. So to the extent that you lose a phone call when you're on the line with Verizon, to the extent that you're trying to do a transaction with the PayPal or anybody, and there is an interruption in the service, then, that's part of the experience of being in the Transaction business for better and\/or worse. So in a real sense, the SRO aspect would not have any material change on our Transaction business. And I'm obviously saying that as a nonlawyer but certainly, my firm opinion, having been in the Transaction business just outside of the regulated world, it's the standard way that you operate. So we have a very firm opinion that the immunities, I think, have value for the exchange function, which is fundamentally different than the broker-dealer function, but in particular, reference to the Transaction part of the business, it's not a material set of circumstance or effect.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Very helpful, Bob. And my follow-up would be probably another hard question, I guess, but some of the technology glitches that have occurred -- certainly, not unique to you guys at all, but just wondering what steps maybe NASDAQ can take -- and then the industry, more broadly, to limit these kinds of events?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, that's a great question and deserves a long answer. Let me give you the summary version of it. We always take the detailed question offline. But I would say this. One, is in the Technology business, you understand there's always going to be latent bugs in the code. It's our job to basically isolate and make sure when they happen, they don't have an impact on the world. So coming out of the 22nd, there's obviously a lot of things we have to do with respect to the SIP and how it works in the environment. I think that represents, in certain ways, an opportunity for our Technology business to put forward for a state of the art proposal for the SIP committee to get it up to world standards, like we do with our 70 other customers. We intend to pursue that. I think under Mary Jo's leadership, the industry itself is starting to grapple with what we have to do to live in this interconnected world. And the 60-day clock is ticking, and I think it comes up the 12th of November. And we intend to be ahead of the curve in terms of how we respond to that. So we're excited about that. Post that initiative, it's our strong feeling the industry has to evolve to some type of centralized testing regime. And we certainly referred to the telecom industry and others, where you have the equivalent of an underwriters' laboratory that represents your ability to do nonsequential testing that assures the safety and sanctity of the entire network. So what we're doing now is good, then we have to evolve to the next step of it and the industry will do that. With respect to our own operations, we obviously have looked at, coming after the 22nd, where are there dusty systems that are not paid that much attention to but have the ability to have an impact on the marketplace. And we're intensifying our effort to make sure that we can mitigate and insulate, wherever possible, us from any technology disruptions that can and will happen. And so that's an effort for us. People ask me what's the cost of that and I said, the real cost is not so much a direct cost because we -- clearly, when we see things that have to be fixed, the best people to fix them are the people on the systems today and they generally know exactly what has to be done. So as you look at our increased focus on this resiliency, I would highlight the fact that the cost is going to be primarily opportunity cost. So we will stop doing business things in order to make sure the resiliency in all aspects and all walks of our Technology life is solid and secure. And we're on with that mission today. There could be some minor increase in CapEx but when I look at the problems we're having with the HELP exchange and they said that they're bringing outside people in, then I know that's a longer runway. Clearly, if you don't have the internal expertise for the system, then it's an issue. So what we're looking at can definitely be addressed from our internal resources, but the opportunity cost is also real.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","If I could go back to the capital -- and thanks for giving us the kind of explicit guidance on the timing. It's only a few quarters away now and -- when you have more flexibility with your cash. So can you remind us of what is your interest level in European consolidation? There's certainly some compelling arguments to be made from a cost side. Before, I think you've kind of made some public comments about being potentially interested in some new European exchanges if they came on the market. What's your interest level now as you kind of get better visibility on these acquisitions you've already made?","Robert Greifeld","Niamh, I've never heard you be so vague in your life here. What European asset might you be talking about? I don't know. So what I've said publicly before, we would be remiss, if the asset were to become available, to not take a look at it. And that doesn't say that we'd have a strong interest, a medium interest or a low interest, I don't know. The devils are obviously in the details. The reason we have to look at it is we clearly have a European presence today. We have enough processing power in our European data center to handle every European equity trade today without spending a nickel. So you've got that kind of fundamental driver behind it. But these kind of things are just difficult. We're spending 0 time thinking about it right now. And to the extent that the European regulatory political infrastructure wants to do an IPO, the last thing we're going to do is waste any time fighting that train. So we're here. We've expressed to the European people that we know what we're doing in Europe. I think the way we integrated NASDAQ OMX is hailed as a proper way to do a cross-border transaction in Europe. And I think the NYSE Euronext is hailed as the improper way to do it. So we have that kind of fundamental credibility with the European regulatory community. But that being said, we're not spending any time thinking about it and to the extent they want to do an IPO, we wish them all the well with it.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then, if I could just go back to the SIP. And you talked about maybe this could actually be an opportunity if the committee decides that they need to substantially upgrade the systems and to be more like the private system, as it were, is there a potential risk that if you lose the entire role there, that it kind of gets outsourced to somebody else and there's like a revenue stream we should be thinking about attached to that?","Robert Greifeld","Well, there's a revenue stream, there's not profit stream. So I wouldn't worry about that too much. I mean, we've operated the SIP kind of by default, based upon the vestige of our monopoly position pre-Reg. NMS. And when you think about it, we've operated it for -- as it turns out, infinite risk with 0 financial return to it. So we have to -- have a proposal for the SIP that makes sense, that represents a decent margin for us. Not excessive, but more importantly, we have to put forward a proposal where the SIP technology can be brought forward into the 2015-type best-of-breed practices. And it deserves that. At end of the day, it's not our decision whether that's done. It's the decision of the committee. But clearly, we would not have too much interest in continuing in the current relationship where there's no -- the way it's operated, the technology is just fraught -- with too much peril.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Is there a chance or a situation where the regulators could -- nobody wants to hold up their hand and set a lot more money in operating it. But is there a chance that you could be kind of forced to upgrade it without necessarily getting compensated for it?","Robert Greifeld","No. Well, first off, it would have to be the committee, right? So we obviously received the publicity, but we're a member of the committee. So will the SEC force the committee to upgrade the SIP and then, the SIP has to choose who is the vendor to do that, that's a potential. But I would say this, that I think -- and I don't want to speak for the SEC or other market participants, but I think the community, as a whole, recognizes that the SIP is a critical piece of the infrastructure and deserves to have state-of-the-art technology behind it, state-of-the-art support contracts, state-of-the-art service-level agreements between the SIP and the vendor meeting us associated with it. So I don't think there's going to be too much commotion associated with this.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Robert Greifeld","Thank you. Well, certainly, it was a very strong quarter. As I said in my prepared comments, we still operate in fundamentally difficult times, political climate doesn't help either. That being said, the strength of the franchise -- the diversified franchise continues to reveal itself. The acquisitions helped, as I said a number of times, that we just got started. So they're going to help that much more. And I think the business plans we have in place, the diversification of our revenue and most importantly, the strength of the employees and the management team here at NASDAQ OMX position us properly for the future. We appreciate your support and look forward to talking to you in the days and the quarters to come. So thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to your host, Ed Ditmire. Please go ahead.","Edward P. Ditmire - Nasdaq, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's third quarter 2016 earnings results. On the line are Bob Greifeld, our CEO; Michael Ptasznik, our CFO; our Chief Operating Officer and President, Adena Friedman; Vice Chairman, Hans-Ole Jochumsen; Ed Knight, our General Counsel; and our other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A.","The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information, and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.","I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations, and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I now will turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review another quarter in which Nasdaq set several financial highs, as well as discuss progress on our key initiatives and our investments.","What is interesting and satisfying to me about this quarter is the balanced model we have created and a strategy which focuses first and foremost on serving our clients' needs, and this continues to deliver. As we have proven quarter after quarter, when we serve our clients well, we are privileged to be able to both invest in our future and serve our shareholders well.","A principal way we achieve this is our focus on technology leadership in which we can lever our expertise, our relative advantages in a manner that benefits clients and creates real opportunities for growth across our businesses. I will focus my remarks today on these central points and how they manifest in our results and drive our efforts as a financial technology company.","During the quarter, Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $585 million, non-GAAP operating income of $268 million and non-GAAP net income of $154 million, which set all-time highs, while non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 tied our record high.","When you look at the quarter, to me, what is most interesting about our performance is our continued consistent march in generating organic growth across our non-transaction business segments. Despite lower volumes in the transactional environment, the diversity, resiliency and the complementary nature of our model continues to drive us forward.","Just to highlight for everyone on this call, again, regarding the significance that our model plays in our results, post the ISE acquisition, over 75% of our net revenues during the third quarter of 2016 came from subscription and recurring revenues, a record $441 million; quite a remarkable testament to the evolution of this franchise.","During the quarter, we saw a 5% organic net revenue growth across the non-trading segments, which provide the vast majority of the subscription and recurring revenues, with the biggest contribution to our growth coming from the Technology Solutions segment with 10% organic growth, truly outstanding.","In addition to strong organic growth progress, we also continued to successfully integrate the four acquisitions made in 2016, which are right down the center of our bowling alley. We've already begun to deliver significant accretion to our shareholders from these acquisitions. I will come back to that in more detail later in my remarks.","As I mentioned, we are maniacally focused on the client, their problems and pain points, and what we can do to solve them and unlock new opportunities.","So, now, I want to turn and highlight on how this focus is responsible for generating opportunities in our non-transaction businesses and driving the growth we saw during the quarter. As I pointed out early on, one of the great advantages Nasdaq has is in technology leadership which provides us with a variety of options for responding to our clients' complex challenges and offering new and better solutions. Clearly, one of the best examples of this in action is in our Market Technology business, where over the past several years, we have shifted our strategy from a product-centric approach to a more holistic solutions approach.","The investments we have made to strengthen SMARTS surveillance, post-trade and risk and compliance offerings have resulted in strong growth and we continue to see strong uptick across these businesses during the third quarter as our clients continue to turn to us for these mission-critical solutions.","On the surveillance side, we clearly are the beneficiary of industry trends towards more transparency and regulation, especially in Europe where the Market Abuse Regulation, MAR, came into play at the beginning of July of this year.","Importantly, we see also other regions are continuing to bolster the regulatory requirements with regard to surveillance and compliance and also that the requirements on market participants are extending beyond the sell side to impact the buy side directly, something we've worked very hard to position the franchise for with our buy side SMARTS offering.","Certainly fundamental to our approach in the Market Technology business has been the introduction of the Nasdaq Financial Framework. We announced this in May of this year. This financial framework is truly a game changer. It provides a unifying framework for all our products and importantly allows us to deploy innovative capabilities such as the blockchain. This is a leading example of how we are in lockstep in an integrated manner with the balance of our products as we integrate this Nasdaq Financial Framework.","Staying within our Technology Solutions segment for a moment, I want to highlight the progress we've made in our Corporate Solutions business during the quarter. When we look at Corporate Solutions, we have been on a mission to add greater levels of value for our clients through product enhancements, new technology and scale.","Key to our efforts are the integration efforts of the Marketwired and Boardvantage businesses and our ongoing focus to provide our clients with more robust solutions like IR Insight. We have migrated 80% of our legacy platforms client base with over 3,800 users on the new platform to date. While we still have more work left to do, we do believe we have turned an important corner in making this business both more effective and now efficient. This is very encouraging and certainly indicative of the dedication by this very talented team to our clients and speaks well of our ability to deliver in the quarters to come.","Now, clearly, one of the businesses that benefits from our success in Corporate Solutions is our Listing Services business. Growth in Listing Services during the quarter continued to be impressive. In fact, I would say that our listing franchise has never been stronger. This is evident in both our U.S. and Nordic franchises. In the U.S., I'm very pleased to report our competitive position continues to increase. Year-to-date, we've achieved an outstanding 74% win rate in IPOs, welcoming Nutanix, the Trade Desk and Talend in the third quarter.","Additionally, in October this year, the largest energy IPO of the year listed with NASDAQ, Extraction Oil & Gas. In switches, we've welcomed 16 companies thus far in 2016, with a combined market capitalization of $42 billion from our competitor, bringing our total switch market cap to $850 billion \u2013 $1 trillion is not far away \u2013 since regulatory changes opened this channel up in 2002. In ETP listings, we've grown our issue account 48% year-over-year.","The Nordics, in many ways, is even more impressive. We're very proud of the entrepreneurial companies which continue to choose NASDAQ as their listing home. There are 57 new company listings to date through September 30, the most of any European financial center. For the first time in my memory, the Nordics have outraised or outlisted London, certainly a record performance.","And this does follow a great year last year, where we had 91 listings. The Nordic market also continues to gain attention from companies domiciled outside the Nordics. When you look at this together, it's evident that the platform we have built that addresses not only capital-raising needs but also provides companies with mission-critical solutions and intelligence solutions that supports our companies through their entire life as a public company is resonating in the marketplace. While the non-transactional businesses continued a very consistent, healthy expansion, it should never be forgotten that our suite of leading trading marketplaces are absolutely fundamental to our strategy.","To that effect, looking into our most foundational trading business, U.S. Equities, we had a bit of a mixed trend in terms of share and capture in the third quarter. I am pleased to report that average capture, in particular in U.S. Equities, showed sequential improvement in the third quarter, but market share was marginally lower. The biggest driver of changes was industry mix, in particular, more off-exchange trading. In particular in Tape C or Nasdaq-listed securities, where we are obviously heavily overweight.","In this relatively low volatility, low volume environment, we tend to see lower market share, but this is somewhat mitigated by a tendency to see an increase in capture. In addition, we tend to see increased revenue from our off-exchange trade reporting facility, the TRF. Our TRF serves over 90% of this market, which is currently around 35% to 40%. So, those are mitigants to the decrease in the volatility and the volume in the market.","Now, when you look at our performance, we continue to enjoy very strong lead in Nasdaq-listed Tape C securities where in the third quarter for example, we matched 28% of overall volumes, and we represented 64% of volumes, including our TRF off-exchange trade reporting services, which leaves only a combined 36% share for every other SEC-regulated exchange for Tape C.","We continue to see good opportunity to improve our share in the coming periods, especially given that our competitive position relative to the other exchanges remain strong, and we have important innovations in the pipeline such as our extended life order, or ELO.","As I mentioned earlier, we have completed four acquisitions this year, and what's most impressive is that our teams have done an outstanding job in incorporating the talent, resources and technologies these companies bring to Nasdaq.","Strategically, these acquisitions play to our core strengths or down the center of our bowling alley, as I like to say. They maximize our chance for success. This is the first full quarter with all four of the acquisitions under the Nasdaq umbrella, and they are already delivering meaningful accretion to our shareholders.","Let me share with you some of the highlights on our progress. We closed the transaction of the International Securities Exchange, ISE, in June. This was significantly ahead of schedule, and since that time, we have been executing on our objective to have ISE lever the best technologies and features from both Nasdaq and ISE to serve our clients.","Our continued focus on our clients throughout this process is important to us, and I'm pleased that we've continued to earn from these customers market share at industry-leading levels within 1 point or 2 points of the roughly 40% share that Nasdaq and ISE separately totaled in the periods prior to the combination. In addition, we've been able to realize $15 million in run rate synergies for both ISE and Nasdaq CXC at the end of the third quarter, and these acquisitions are accreting to our shareholders ahead of schedule.","In our Corporate Solutions business, we closed Marketwired and Boardvantage in the first and second quarters respectively. We continue to make strong progress integrating these businesses into our offering. These acquisitions are very appealing in that they both significantly expand our base of corporate customers, bringing our total corporate customer base to approximately 18,000 clients, and as we integrate them, will enable us to accelerate the depth and the breadth and speed at which we innovate and bring exciting new products to PR distribution, governance and board portal space.","Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress made so far this year. There is still work to be done, but as I said, we have turned the corner in terms of how we operate the business and we are very well-positioned to deliver meaningful organic growth in the future.","As you can see by the examples I have highlighted, our model, driven by a diverse mix of businesses, provides us with the flexibility and opportunity to both explore and execute on a variety of initiatives. To give you an example, year-to-date, we have seen organic growth, coupled with strong operational focus on expenses, synergy realization and sound capital deployment and returns, generated 8% non-GAAP EPS growth in the first nine months of 2016, in addition to a significant growth in our dividends.","This EPS and dividend growth in turn formed the foundation for an impressive 29% total shareholder return in the 12-month period ending September 30. Now, certainly, when it comes to how we look at investing in our future, organic growth is our first priority and our preference. We have a robust process for vetting growth concepts internally at Nasdaq through our R&D program and have a strong track record to date with our organic initiatives, some of which I will highlight now.","Clearly, one of the more outstanding initiatives we have undertaken and something we are very proud of is our launch of NFX in 2015. The increasing traction NFX has seen in the energy market over the past year represents a positive vote by market participants and our clients in a more efficient, cost-effective and responsible alternative was and is needed.","To highlight our progress, we set the following records in September. Monthly average daily volume was 151,000 contracts. We set new Brent and WTI volume marks each over 70,000. Open interest reached a new high before the September roll of 1.2 million contracts; truly impressive. So, perhaps more importantly, as we look forward, our client onboarding backlog, including merchants and utility end users, is at a record level. Good days to come.","So, while we don't consider that NFX has achieved success yet and certainly isn't guaranteed to do so, we can see clearly how continued growth in the coming periods could establish it firmly as a very important and valuable asset.","Another significant investment we have made, which has fulfilled a previously untapped need in the marketplace, is our effort to transform the private market. Overall, we are pleased with our progress with a 175% year-over-year increase in the number of liquidity events facilitated. This is a great example of how we are exploring ways to apply disruptive technology like the blockchain and market expertise to support our clients.","Our future depends on how well we see around the corners and apply technology in innovative ways to the benefit of our clients. To this end, we still currently have a number of use cases in our pipeline across all our businesses, and we're excited about the opportunities that leveraging these technologies represent for our clients and our businesses.","For example, in September, a new data product suite called Nasdaq Trading Insights designed to help traders better understand how they perform in the market, how the market behaves and how they can adjust their strategies to be more successful. It combines proprietary data with advanced analytics and machine learning to provide insights and is the first commercial solution to come out of our Information Services innovation lab which brings together inside and outside technologies, data scientists, software engineers, and business experts. It is a great example of the kinds of solutions that we're developing today that will harness disruptive technologies and the kind of innovation that you will certainly see more of from Nasdaq in the months to come.","In closing, I have talked a lot today about the progress we are making to serve our clients through strategic acquisitions, organic growth initiatives, and through the effective use of capital. But in reality, we view our job as much, much simpler than that. Our job is to listen to our clients and respond to them and to market stimuli. And this quarter is really a testament to our ability to do that effectively on a multitude of levels across this franchise. I have no doubt that the strength of our model, coupled with our ability to apply technology to benefit our clients will certainly drive this franchise forward for the remainder of this year and into the future.","Now, I will turn the call over to Michael to review the financial details.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. My commentary this morning will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.","I'll start by reviewing third quarter revenue performance relative to the prior-year quarter as shown on page 5 of the presentation and organic growth from page 6. The 11%, or $56 million increase in reported net revenue of $585 million consisted of $58 million in net revenues from our 2016 acquisitions of ISE, Marketwired, Boardvantage and Nasdaq CXC, and organic growth in the non-trading segments of $17 million, or 5%. This was partially offset by an organic decrease in Market Services net revenues of $20 million or negative 10%, resulting principally from the exceptionally strong multi-year highs in industry volume in the prior-year period.","I'm now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be for the prior-year period unless otherwise noted. Information Services on page 7 saw $2 million in organic revenue growth and a $3 million increase related to the ISE and Nasdaq CXC acquisitions. Data Product revenues increased 6% including organic growth in proprietary data product revenue, the inclusion of revenue associated with the ISE and Nasdaq CXC acquisitions, as well as higher audit collections.","Index Licensing and Services revenue saw a $1 million decline, primarily due to a decrease in the value of underlying assets associated with non-ETP Nasdaq-licensed products and lower fees on derivative products that license Nasdaq indices due to lower volumes. The operating income margin declined modestly in the third quarter to 71% from 73% in the prior year due principally to certain temporary expenses, including those associated with new product initiatives.","Technology Solutions revenue, as shown on page 8, increased $36 million, reflecting a $22 million contribution from the acquisitions of Boardvantage and Marketwired, and a $13 million or 10% organic increase. The operating income margin was 18%, up from 15% in the prior-year period.","Corporate Solutions revenues increased due to the impact of the two acquisitions. Organic revenues were unchanged, which is an improvement from modest declines in recent quarters.","Market Technology revenue increased $14 million, or 24%, primarily due to increased revenues from software licensing and support contracts as well as surveillance products. New order intake was $49 million in the third quarter and the period end backlog finished at $738 million, unchanged from the prior year.","Listing Services, on page 9, saw a $2 million, or 3%, organic increase in revenues, driven primarily by an increase in Nordic listing revenue due to new company listings.","Market Services net revenues on page 10 saw a $33 million increase from the acquisitions of ISE and Nasdaq CXC, partially offset by a $20 million organic decline, due mostly to the tough industry volume comparable in the prior-year period, netting to a $13 million increase. Market Services operating income margin totaled 54% versus 55% in the prior-year period.","Equity Derivatives Trading and Clearing net revenues increased 31%, primarily due to the ISE acquisition and higher U.S. market share at legacy Nasdaq markets, partially offset by lower industry trading volumes. Cash Equity Trading net revenues decreased 12%, primarily due to lower matched market share, industry volumes in U.S. average capture, partially offset by the inclusion of revenues from Nasdaq CXC.","Fixed Income and Commodities Trading and Clearing net revenues decreased 22% from the prior year, due primarily to declines in U.S. Fixed Income and Commodities revenues, as well as the impact of trading incentives on NFX revenues. And you'll note that we've renamed Access and Broker Services to Trade Management Services to better reflect the broader nature and scope of services these revenues represent. And revenues here increased 17% due to inclusion of revenue from ISE as well as increased demand for connectivity solutions.","Turning to page 11 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $41 million. This increase included $29 million in expenses from our acquisitions and $13 million, or 5%, in organic growth, excluding $4 million to $5 million in the quarter of acquisition synergy benefits.","Bearing in mind that Q-over-Q expense comparisons often have significant volatility due to things like changes in the performance-based compensation accruals or non-recurring items that don't meet the qualifications for a non-GAAP exclusion, I'd note, through the first nine months of 2016, organic expense growth has been approximately 3%, in line with the same organic expense growth rate we saw in the full-year 2015 period.","Turning to slide 12, our revised 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance has been narrowed to $1.22 billion to $1.24 billion, or a 4Q range of $323 million to $343 million. This is above the 3Q 2016 level. But please keep in mind that there are typically seasonal differences in the 3Q and 4Q expense run rates. For example, the third quarter typically features lower marketing, professional services, and travel expenses and some seasonal benefits in compensation.","Non-GAAP operating income increased 6% in the third quarter of 2016 and decreased 6% on an organic basis. Net interest expense was $36 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $9 million versus the prior-year period, reflecting the additional interest expense from our recent bond offerings.","The non-GAAP effective tax rate for 3Q 2016 was 34.2% and within our unchanged 33% to 35% full-year guidance. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for 3Q 2016 was $154 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $151 million or $0.88 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015.","Now, moving on to cash flow and capital, please turn to slide 16. We repurchased $55 million in stock during the third quarter if 2016, bringing our total buybacks to $100 million in the first nine months of 2016.","As of September 30, 2016, there is $429 million remaining on the board repurchase authorization. Through dividends and repurchases, Nasdaq returned nearly $250 million in capital to shareholders year-to-date in 2016.","And finally, while we don't have Ron on the call with us today, I'm sure he is listening and I just want to thank him for the great team that I've inherited, and for the immense support that he's provided me as I've transitioned into my role here at Nasdaq.","And with that, I thank you for your time, and I turn it back over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you. Operator, I believe we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good morning, Bob. Good morning, Michael, and congrats on the quarter and the record performance in the non-trading segments.","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","Thank you, Rich.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","So, I guess the first question is on the expenses. I see the seasonal increase. I've been looking at expenses all morning on this. And the only question I would have is that you're well ahead, or aggressively started on the synergies. So, do you expect \u2013 how do you get the rest of the \u2013 I think it's $23 million of the total $60 million? How should we think about your achievement of those over the next year to 15 months?","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, I would say, one, Rich, as compared to when we announced the deal, we've obviously have increased confidence that we're going to get there, but we're not prepared to be more granular with respect to the exact timing. So, we're well underway. We still expect to have both positive and negative surprises as we move along. But we know we're going to get to the end state.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then my one follow-up would be, Bob, you addressed a lot on the equity market share. It's still just slightly up in 3Q and volatility has improved. But, I guess, turning also to options as well, when you look at the ISE's market share that, I think, is at a low or record low. And then, you have the CBOE-Bats pending merger. So, how do you think \u2013 the market share has been drifting off there. I know it's, again, a small part of your revenues but I guess, maybe in more detail the steps you're taking to address the share issue.","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. So, I would say this, one is, I said on a prior call, we're managing the market share on a consolidated basis. We have a number of licenses. They're all important to us and we'll definitely take certain actions which have to have a positive impact on one of the license and a partially negative on the other. So, I would direct you to look at the combined market share and I made reference to that in my comments there.","I'd also make mention of the fact that, we certainly have seen with the OCC changes fewer dividend trades, strategy trades. So, I think, that has had a one-time impact on the market share going forward. And in terms of where we are, we certainly believe that complex order flow is an increasing part of the market going forward. And we have the leading position. We're going to continue to invest in that and we feel we will benefit from that trend line.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Hoping you guys might be able to talk to us a little bit about how you think the CBOE for Bats deal will impact the industry and, in particular, what you plan to do with ISE.","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. Good questions. So, certainly, we think the deal makes industrial logic, makes sense. I think it will certainly provide them synergy opportunities and I think it represents a return to their investors. We think, strategically, it doesn't change much. We're tough competitors with both CBOE and Bats today and we think that will continue there.","So, we're happy, obviously, to have Bats and CBOE in a public forum and represent a rational competitor. And we run an efficient marketplace, so the way we look at the competition against different players where efficiency is important is something we welcome. And we also know strategically we have the scale so we have the ability to lever more flow against our highly efficient platform. So, we feel good about that.","So, the options market is something we believe in. We think it's going through a down cycle with respect to overall volume trends, but we see that growing in the future. And as previously highlighted, we think complex is going to be an increasingly important part of the marketplace. And certainly, our job with ISE is to get through the transition as quickly as we can. And as I've said, we've made great progress on it, we've got a lot of work to do, but we've got a very talented team focused on it and I think you'll see us achieve that in a rapid pace.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ashley, your line is open. We'll move on to our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Can you expand upon some of the strength in Tech Solutions? Certainly in the quarter, we've had a couple of quarters in a row that being the primary source of growth, and then we're heading into the seasonally typically stronger period of the year. So, I guess any little guidance in terms of thinking about the fourth quarter as well, will be helpful.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. This is Adena. The Market Technology business continued to have a very strong quarter in terms of new sales in our surveillance business, in our GRC solutions to the corporate, as well as continued growth on the core business. Some of that is coming from the full quarter effect of the (32:23) deal. But some of it is also just other contracts coming online and some short-term, what we call CRs, or short-term development revenues that we had in the quarter.","As we look at the fourth quarter, you're right that the fourth quarter tends to be our seasonally strong quarter both in terms of sales as well as on short-term revenue. So, we would anticipate that seasonality would continue to occur. So, we just are seeing really good strength across the business right now.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. And then I guess just a follow-up on that deal. So, the margin kind of in that segment was, looks like, flat quarter-over-quarter. Do you still anticipate that to kind of continue to grind higher and kind of what's a reasonable framework to think about when you \u2013 or targets for that segment?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. So, the Technology Solutions business, as a reminder, includes both Corporate Solutions and the Market Tech business. And you're right. We are seeing that we've had a nice lift in the margin year-over-year quarter, and quarter-over-quarter from Q2 to Q3 is relatively stable. So, we are continuing to find opportunities to grow the margins across that segment. As we've mentioned before, we do have a 20% target, and we gave that target out around a year ago. So, we are marching towards that target and we continue to see progress there.","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","I'd also would highlight the fact, and I mentioned it on the prepared remarks, the fact that Adena and the team are completing the integration of IR Insight to simplify their mission, and certainly, it will narrow the focus, and I think, also help contribute to margin expansion as we get into 2017.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hill with Barclays. Your line is open.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","How we doing, Ken?","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Doing good. Just a question here on the data side I was hoping you guys could touch on. So, specifically, hoping you can provide an overview of some of the recent changes on the SIP, and then also your ability to charge for premium services like Ultra alongside of that. It seems like the upgrade definitely has implications for the industry from a speed perspective. But then also the read from some of the industry folks, it seems like they're trying to take a little bit more issue with some of the premium charges associated with things like Ultra longer term as market data costs move higher for them. So, I'm just hoping you could kind of walk through how you're seeing that area right now.","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. Let me start by complimenting the team, in that the performance of the SIP is beyond what we had on the drawing board, and we're significantly below 50 microseconds. You might say 20 microseconds or 30 microseconds. So, that represents, really, I think the top technological achievement in the industry right now. So, we're proud of that. I think it's better for the industry.","It's also important to recognize that our proprietary data feeds are first and foremost about content. Speed was always a secondary concern. So, there is unique content in our proprietary feeds that you do not have in the SIP.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. I would add to that. I think that we would look at the proprietary feeds as providing additional value in terms of the depth of market. That's really the primary reason why people buy those feeds in addition to the feed. So, they're able to get it in a machine-readable format that allows them to make complex order routing decisions, algorithmic decisions in terms of their interaction with the market that go beyond what the basic feed provides, through the UTP feed. So, we are very pleased with the performance of the SIP, and we think that it is a great benefit to the industry. But we also see it as complementing the proprietary offerings that we have.","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. And with respect to whatever controversy you're speaking to, it's important to know that the SIP, while we're providing the technology, is not governed by Nasdaq. It's an industry initiative. So, the pricing associated with the SIP is not a Nasdaq decision. It's a SIP committee decision.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Appreciate all the color there. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, folks. Thanks. Maybe, Bob, if you can talk a little bit about the NFX strategy just, once again, in terms of how you feel that's progressing and what the EPS drag is? I know the incentives are I think up a little bit. And just if you can remind us at what point do you want to see more progress in that before you curtail the strategy?","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","Okay. So, I would just start by saying with respect to NFX, it's important to recognize that we get the publicity and it has our name in it, but this is a industry effort. This was customers coming together saying they want to do something to change the duopolistic or monopolistic practices of vertical monopolies. And so, we responded to that and we have been down the road before, so it's important for us not to just be engaged with happy meetings but the customers had to put real skin in the game to launch this thing. And they've done and they've come through.","So, as we stand here today, our progress is certainly more significant than we would have planned for at this point in time. And as I mentioned in my comments, the onboarding of new customers is at a record level. What I didn't mention is we have additional large industry participants who want to become part of the partnership, and I think the partnership will expand to allow them in.","So, we're living in happy times, where there is a lot of inbound. So, our success today is very strong. The inbound, as a forward indicator, would say there is more success to come. But we remain quite focused and we know that while we've had great success, we need to get a higher level of success in order to have what I call a definable asset.","So, I would say this, Brian, there is zero, and I mean zero, thought with respect to the last part of your comment about us thinking about curtailing it. This is a thing that's expanding and we hear \u2013 and our customers are very excited about what's being created.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","Brian, the EPS effect is just $0.02 on the quarter.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","$0.02, okay. And that's a good run rate for future quarters in this project?","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","I think you'll see in 2017, that has a good opportunity to narrow. And what we have is what I'll call policy but a loose policy is when we have double-digit market share in a given instrument then we tend to work with our market committee and decide what is the proper price at that point in time. And as we've said, our target rate as we get fully established is in and around $0.60 a contract.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Okay. Great. And then, maybe just a question for both Bob and Michael, just if you can talk a little bit about what you're thinking for the longer term strategy in Canada with the Chi-X acquisition in that market. Is that something you \u2013 is Canada a market where you think you might, in a variety of ways, get much better penetration and focus longer term?","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","I do like the fact you directed it to Michael, as our Canadian sitting here at the table. So, I'll start and Adena can help and Michael is always free to chime in. So, I would say this, and it's not specific just to Canada. Our brand value and the listing game is a global brand, and we see it having pull in the Nordics for countries in the rest of Europe and outside Europe, and you see that same attraction in Canada.","So, our listing franchise is incredibly strong, and certainly I think you can reasonably see that there is ways we can use that not just in Canada but in other parts of the world. So, that's certainly part of our plans going forward. But we have to do that intelligently, and what I like about what's happened in the Nordic, it's grown organically as people realized how good the Nasdaq market is in the Nordics and we plan to move along.","So, we are very happy with the progress of our Canada operation today. We realize it's early innings and our plans will become more comprehensive as time marches on.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","So, I'll throw in, especially because I know that there'll be some \u2013 my Canadian are friends still listening in on this call, but the only comment I would add to what Bob said, he talked about the brand and the capabilities. What I've seen here is the numerous capabilities and the different products and services that we have here at Nasdaq, whether it's in the Corporate Solutions area or in multiple areas that we have from a technology capability standpoint I think will be very effective and will be welcomed by Canadian customers and the Canadian marketplace.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And so do you plan on getting traction in some of the Corporate Solutions products in Canada as well?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, as with the acquisition of Marketwired, we do have a large group of Canadian clients at this point. It was their primary market. And therefore, we have the opportunity to cross-sell other services into those clients, and it has become a larger part of our strategy. But even before that, we did have a lot of Canadian clients just using our investor relations services.","So, we have a nice presence in Canada now. We have a larger office there, and we certainly see opportunity to continue to grow the Canadian marketplace for Corporate Solutions.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks so much for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Buckingham. Your line is open.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a little bit more about market data. I might have missed it. I was wondering if you could give any color in terms of audit fees in the quarter.","And then there's been some recent worries about the trajectory of market data. FactSet noted on their call this lower number of U.S. screens as kind of some hedge funds have gone out of business. Just wondering if you could give any color just in terms of what you're seeing from a client usage perspective, and how to think about the trajectory moving forward?","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","I'll answer that second question first. In terms of the general usage of our data, we see that being relatively stable. Remember, we receive fees both in end users as well as in distribution fees and machine usage of our fees. So, we have the ability, more internally, to have a stable revenue stream associated with overall industry use of our data. We continue to see very good demand for our new Nasdaq Basic feed that \u2013 or not new, but it's been around less time than others. And we continue to see growth there. And we also interestingly have seen increased demand and sales of our data into Asia. And we have put a salesperson into the Asian region, and it's been a nice year in terms of new opportunities that have come from Asia.","So, I think that we are continuing to find that there is healthy demand for our service. It's relatively stable. And with the new Trading Insights product, we continue to find opportunities to find new insights in our data that we can sell to the clients.","We launched that product in September. We already have several firms using it, testing it, and one firm already said, yeah, this looks great, and they're now buying it. So, we're really, really pleased with how the data business is going in general.","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","And the total audit revenues in the quarter were $4 million, up about $1 million from the same period last year.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got it. And then any metrics you can provide in terms of sales of IR Insights? I know you've kind of talked about it a little bit in the past in terms of that's starting to pick up a little bit. I know it's kind of a longer sales cycle through the six months. I'm just wondering if you're seeing progress on that front right now.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","We are actually seeing progress. We don't give specific statistics, but we are seeing more head-to-head wins and fewer head-to-head losses with our competitors, in addition to clients picking up additional feeds. But it is a relatively mature business, so there is not a ton of new IR directors who don't have some sort of intelligence service, so we are making sure they're using this to compete much more effectively against the key competitors. In addition to finding new ways for them to use the product within the franchise, whether it's at the CFO level or other parts of the C-suite organization. So, we definitely are seeing really good progress there.","We did also, I should mention, launch a new service within IR Insight called IR Analytics, which is essentially a machine-readable way, or I should say, an automated way of delivering out some of the advisory services that we deliver. And there's more intelligence and integration of that data and information into the rest of the IR Insight suite. So, we're continuing to add really nice value into the platform as well.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, following up on some of this Corporate Solutions discussion, can you talk about some of the puts and takes why the revenue is flat versus the second quarter? If I recall correctly, there is typically some seasonality, but you also added a month of Boardvantage. And it sounds like the things that you're talking about, you're making a lot of progress with a lot of the key initiatives that you've got underway. So, just talk about the puts and takes on why that was flat quarter-over-quarter.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. That's a good question. So, we did have the benefit of the full quarter effect of Boardvantage. Marketwired has already been in there from the prior quarter.","But with regard to the webcasting business, it's been an area of weakness for us throughout the year. There have been some budget tightenings within some of the sectors that we're strong in, and we continue to see clients potentially trying cheaper options. We actually have seen a few clients returning to us after seeing that those cheaper options just don't provide the security and the service that they were expecting. But we are seeing some weakness there.","And then the legacy PR business, not Marketwired but the legacy PR business, had some downward trend in Q3 but that's often seasonal. So, with those two things, so the webcasting and the legacy PR business kind of offset the benefit of the full quarter effect of Boardvantage and general strength in the board portal sales that we are seeing.","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","I also would add that with webcasting, I think Adena and the team have identified really the customers we should be addressing. We provide a high-end service we call the white-glove service, and that's where we're going to go. So, we're not so much chasing the last dollar of revenue but making sure we're getting revenue where it makes sense, and it's integrated into the other suite of products. I think in the past it's just been about getting any order. And we're going to continue with that philosophy. Higher margin, better revenue.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. And then for my follow-up, if ICE have to divest Trayport, is that an asset that you guys would be interested in, and do you think the regulators would let you buy it?","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, I would say this, we haven't spent too much time thinking about Trayport. So, clearly, when it came for auction, we were there to decide whether we were going to bid on it. We chose not to. And I would say that our position is unchanged with respect to that asset.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Rutschow with CLSA. Your line is open.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","How we doing?","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Good. Thanks. I wanted to ask about expenses. Obviously, you guided fourth quarter up. But I'm wondering if the third quarter would have been seasonally lower versus the first and second quarters or whether that's kind of a more consistent level. And thinking about next year, would this be a good run rate for the first and second quarters as well?","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","So, the third quarter came in pretty much in line with the second quarter from an organic basis. The increase we saw was due to the acquisitions. With respect to the future years, we're not going to be providing that guidance yet. Typically we'll give that in \u2013 we'll do the report at the end of the year.","I would say the only things we can kind of point to, and I covered them in my remarks, was so far, year-to-date, we've had about a 3% increase in organic expenses, which is consistent with what we saw last year as well. And you'll also have to think about obviously the remaining synergies, $37 million that will come in. Not all for the full year, obviously, because they're going to come in through the year next year. So, those are some of the key factors to take into account as you consider next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks, guys.","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","How we doing, Mike?","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good. Well, maybe first on fixed income, just on the legacy speed business, I know you made kind of a strategic hire in the quarter. I just wanted to get your take on that business, kind of the outlook, maybe what you're retooling in terms of where you see that heading over the next year or so?","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. Great question. So, one, with respect to overall industry volumes, we certainly watch closely as the banks reported good FIC income. It's important to recognize that those metrics typically are not indicative of the Treasury business. So, our reference points are more the Fed (50:13) primary dealer Treasury bond volumes which were flat to down, or the CME government bond futures contracts or you look at the inter-dealer fixed income platforms. They are all flattish to down. So, we're still dealing with a somewhat difficult, I should say, difficult macro environment.","With respect to our execution, clearly John Shay coming onboard brings, I think, a lot of skills and talents and experience in relationships to that effort. So, we're proud to have him there. I'd also state that the efforts that are in place today with respect to eSpeed Elect is I think something that we're going to continue to work on and see great progress with it. And we also referenced the fact that there are in fact dark-pool capabilities that we can lever in the space.","I'd also make the general longer-term comment, Mary Jo White's comments with respect to implementing a Reg ATS kind of regime in the Treasury market would be seen, I think, as a positive for our efforts in the space. So, we like our internal efforts between the two things we have in place today and we like the general direction of the industry. And I think John will continue to add value, and certainly will, I think, augment and hopefully, improve this strategy going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, hey, good morning. Just maybe more holistically, can you give us an update on your M&A outlook? I mean, obviously, I guess CBOE and Bats out there. But I think you've been more focused on the kind of like Market Technology, non-trading side. So, what are you seeing out there? Where do you think you still need to add capabilities? And what are prices doing, considering maybe the weakness in the end market?","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","So, I would say this that we look for opportunities across the range of businesses that we're in. But the largest acquisition we've done this year by several orders of magnitude is ISE which is, clearly, in our Trading Services business. And we have a number of different assets in our portfolio. We have a very clear view of the playing field and what other assets that are out there that might be a value to us in time.","And as I said, M&A has to be a slow-moving game, and you have to have a prior view of the attractiveness of each of the assets. So, a compliment to the management team here. We have that. We pay attention to many things. And obviously, 90-something percent or 98% of the things we think about don't happen. We were fortunate that the, really, five deals including SecondMarket, after looking them for a long period of time, came into play. And we were able to then execute and you see the results on our efforts today. And those results will have a more material impact as we go forward into 2017.","I think we still live in a time where valuations tend to be higher than they should be. You have a number of companies who want to be bought at growth company valuations when in fact they're not growing. So, we do not stomach that kind of disconnect and we pay attention. So, the same story always. We look at a lot of things and we only move when we have basically perfect alignment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just one more follow up on the Corporate Solutions business if I could. It sounds like you've made good progress on the IR conversions. And, I believe last quarter's call you stated that you're on track to complete those conversions this year. Could you just confirm whether that's still the case?","And then, sorry if I missed this, but if you could also help us think about the difference between the year-on-year organic revenue growth rates between the Corporate Solutions and the Market Technology businesses in the quarter. Thanks.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. So with regard to the IRI migration, it is still on track to be completed at the end of this year. The clients have been very, very collaborative and excited about the platform. So, it has been a smooth transition over to the new services and they're seeing a lot of benefits from them.","With regard to the year-over-year quarter results on an organic basis, if we look at the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year with our Corporate Solutions business, it was flat. And with regard to the Market Tech business, it's 11% \u2013 I'm sorry...","Michael Ptasznik - Nasdaq, Inc.","No. It's over 20%.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","20% up on the second quarter, or sorry, sequential quarters. So, yeah, it's about 20% up year-over-year quarter for our Market Technology business, and that's organic.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. Your line is open.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi.","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","How we doing?","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Good. Can you talk about how some of the components of the index revenues trended this quarter just given that, I think, revenues were up 4% sequentially and the average AUM is up like 6%?","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. Sorry. Can you repeat the question? Sorry. Can we hear that question again?","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","If you could give us a bit of color on how some components of the index revenues have trended in the quarter.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Sure. So the index business, we've had a nice recovery of AUM from the beginning of the year where we had a major dip as a result of some of the market volatility. So, our AUM generally is kind of a little bit above where it was at the beginning of the year. So, we're pleased with that, and so we've seen recovery there.","The futures volumes were off a little bit in the quarter versus prior-year quarter because there was a lot more volatility in volumes in the third quarter of last year. And that has created some downward pressure in the revenue. And so, therefore, it's essentially flat year-over-year quarter.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. And just to follow-up on NFX, how many of the 118 firms that have traded since last year, how many of those are active users?","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","Well, I think in a given day, you see around 40 firms that are active. And I would say, of the firms who are active from the beginning, the vast majority of them continue to trade with us. But 40 is a number, and that number, obviously, is growing on a month-by-month basis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Apologies for the earlier difficulties. Just first question is just on your plans to become bigger in the governance risk and compliance space. I know surveillance has been a strong suit over the recent years. It's been a area of strength in recent quarters. Does that have a long runway for growth? Or what are some of the other adjacent capabilities that you would explore adding that you don't have today?","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","So I would start, certainly, on the surveillance side, we see an incredibly long runway for growth. And it's a product set that we're investing in a quite aggressive fashion. I think we just approved a further investment in it. So, when you think about where it came from the time we acquired the product to where it is today, it's a startling set of progress, but we think we have more to come.","Adena T. Friedman - Nasdaq, Inc.","Yeah. So, if we look across the GRC space, most notably starting with surveillance, I completely agree with Bob, and there are a couple of new things we have done. We made a minority investment in a machine intelligence company called Digital Reasoning which has natural language processing capabilities specific to the compliance space for brokers. And we are working with Digital Reasoning and with broker clients to create a holistic solution that matches up e-comm's compliance with the surveillance technology. So, that's a new capability we'll be delivering into 2017 and a growth area for us, an investing area for us.","And then, additionally, we continue to look at how we can get bigger across the spectrum of trade surveillance, trade supervision and compliance. And we continue to work with our broker clients to understand where are their biggest pain points and how can our technology continue to serve them well. And we see a long runway of opportunity there.","With regard to the corporate GRC business, which is really more enterprise risk management, operational risk management, we call that BWise, that's been going through a revenue shift. So, while we continue to see strong sales, as well as good opportunities to expand what we provide for our clients, and we are investing in new capabilities. For instance, we recently launched an IT GRC module for that. We are moving that also to more of a recurring revenue model from a perpetual license model. And so, that's been going through a little bit of a revenue shift. And we expect that to come out of that in the next couple of years so that we can continue to see growth in that business as well.","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","So, this space is ideally matched, what I referenced in my comments. We have leading positions in both of those \u2013 really, in all of those segments, but we're not complacent, and we recognize the technology. Change is coming, and we're in front of that, and we're going to integrate that in a very aggressive fashion. And we always like the fact when we compete against companies who call themselves technology companies but are not in fact that, they're more sales companies, and we have the technology muscle, the development muscle, to reinvent ourselves in this space. And this is a dramatically growing space and we expect to see great growth from it in the decade to come.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Bob Greifeld for closing remarks.","Robert Greifeld - Nasdaq, Inc.","Great. Well, I thank everybody for their time today. As we've said numerous times, this quarter again shows the resiliency and the diversity of our business model. We had an incredibly strong transaction revenue in August of 2015. We reverted to the norm in this August; in some ways reverted below the norm. But in spite of that, you see us deliver record results. Great business model and great execution by the team. I appreciate your time today and look forward to getting together with you again. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ed Ditmire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ed Ditmire","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's first quarter 2016 earnings results. On the line are Bob Greifeld, our CEO; Ron Hassen, our Interim CFO; our Chief Operating Officer and President, Adena Friedman; President, Hans-Ole Jochumsen; Ed Knight, our General Counsel; and other members of the management team.","After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.","I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I now will turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Greifeld","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's record first quarter 2016 results. First, I want to thank those of you that attended our recent Investor Day. I hope you found it beneficial in your understanding of our mission and our strategy. Among the themes we highlighted during this day was we are an apply technology company at our core, our spirit of innovation and how that lays the foundation for our growth, our resiliency for both our customers and for shareholders, and our drive to generate attractive returns for our shareholders. I will update everyone on how this quarter reinforces those themes later in my remarks.","Regarding generating attractive results for shareholders, we're also clearly detailed \u2013 we have also clearly detailed the opportunity we have to consistently deliver strong returns. So in keeping with that theme, I can't think of a more compelling way to start than in the context of record quarter results we delivered, and how it indicates, how our model is performing. In the first quarter of 2016 on a non-GAAP basis compared to the prior year, organic net revenue growth was a solid 4%. Our operating income grew 8% due in large for to a strong operating leverage. And then, largely due to the impact of capital deployment over the last year, our diluted EPS grew to a more impressive 14%.","Adding in the dividend, which we've recently announced had been raised, and an approximate 2% yield, the total shareholder return, assuming constant valuation was around 16%. Now, we certainly know the source that always align every quarter, but we do know our strong organic growth prospects, our operating leverage and our discipline around capital positions us to deliver strong returns to shareholders. Non-GAAP diluted EPS reached an all-time high of $0.91 and non-GAAP operating income and net income both were records at $254 million and $153 million respectively.","During Investor Day, we also said that at NASDAQ our fundamental mission first and foremost is to serve our customers. We accomplished this through an intensive engagement and feedback with these customers. We see our success based on the four core principles: applied technology, growth, innovation, and resiliency. When we do all these well, it will translate into a very positive total shareholder return and that is our focus. So with that in mind, I'm going to organize my remarks today around these four principles as they relate to our performance this quarter.","The first principle I'll discusses is growth. Here we are focused on two key areas, organic growth and expansion through acquisitions that are strategically compelling and meet our strict financial criteria on returns and accretion. When you look at the NASDAQ value proposition, we know our clients face increasingly complex challenges. And as a result, everything we do is laser focused to ensure we are listening to them and executing to better meet their needs.","Clearly a good example of this intense focus is our market services business. We saw a strong organic growth 6% as compared to the prior year quarter. Our cash equities business saw an organic growth of 17% on higher volumes in capture. While we also closed the acquisition of Chi-X Canada, which provides NASDAQ access to a healthy adjacent market and expands our equities footprint in North America.","Our laser focus on the soundness and efficiency of our market plays a significant factor in our ability to capture higher share during times of volatility and this is certainly what we experienced in the first quarter. We look forward to seeing how far new concepts like dynamic pricing can take things to further improve the quality of our markets in the most critical times.","Turning to our listing services, despite a rough start to the year for the broader IPO market, this business still delivered its second best quarter ever in terms of revenue, driven by a strong year-on-year increase in the number of listed companies. Overall, Nasdaq's U.S. win rate continues to be a very strong 76% market share of all IPOs and 278 new listings during the last 12 months. We won 10 of 10 IPOs in the first quarter, so certainly like 10 \u2013 well 10 is not a good number, 10 out of 10 we have to be proud of. This increasing competitive effectiveness should benefit us as we will pass a volatile start to 2016 and have better prospects of seeing more IPOs come out of a still healthy backlog of filed issuers.","IPO activity on our Nordic markets has been quite remarkable. During the quarter, Nasdaq will welcome 14 new Nordic listings, a near record quarter. Beyond IPO activity, we've seen $122 billion in market value switched to our market in the last 12 months with category leader such as Willis, Towers Watson, Scripps Network Interactive, CSX, TD Ameritrade and T-Mobile.","We're also seeing a very strong performance in ETP listings. Year-to-date Nasdaq won 43 new ETPs or switches including 25 in the first quarter alone, clearly the most by any U.S. exchange. Our total ETP listings on Nasdaq were 241 at the end of the quarter, up 36% versus the same period a year ago. The second quarter is also off to a fast start with 18 additional new listings. Clearly, these are big wins for us and certainly this is further indication of the value proposition this franchise offers in the marketplace. We\u2019re the only U.S. provider of a complete lifecycle solution to the ETP industry, ranging from product development and index creation to launch, listing and trading of the ETP.","I've said several times over the recent periods, but I think it bears repeating again this quarter, the foundation of Nasdaq's very diversified product offering at that Nasdaq is our equity trading and listings business, so it's very encouraging to see it performing so effectively with results at multi-year highs as well as maximizing opportunities for other businesses across our broader franchise, such as in derivatives, data and connectivity.","A great example of a business that is leveraging that foundation to succeed in terms of organic growth is our information services business, where we saw a record revenues and solid year-on-year growth not only in data products, but also in index and despite the first quarter\u2019s pullback in average market levels as our first quarter 2015 acquisition of Deutsche Wright, they enjoyed significant organic growth post close.","Now in addition to some of the positive organic growth trends, I just shared, are another fundamental prong in our growth strategy is strategic acquisitions. During the quarter, we announced or closed four new acquisitions, which we're quite pleased about. Most importantly, because they're all in our previously committed strategic direction, they are leveraging our areas of expertise, they will build upon the business \u2013 businesses we're already successful and well-established in.","Repeating the disclosures made at Investor Day, we said these acquisitions are each expected to generate attractive returns and generate EPS accretion within 12 months closing and together would have driven an 11% increase in our non-GAAP diluted EPS based on 2015 results, assuming full synergy realization.","We are confident these acquisitions will also drive meaningful growth opportunities and deliver even larger impact in the years to come. In the market services segment, we closed the acquisition of Chi-X Canada, the number two player in the Canadian equity space in early February. We are currently working on further expanding this offering, incorporating our technology and adding capabilities, which will benefit the Canadian market.","The acquisition of IFC will provide us with the opportunity to broaden our U.S. options offering, in particular gaining new capability through IFC's leadership and complex options trading and will provide new opportunities to innovate and bring greater value to our clients. Last week, we're informed by the DOJ that the ISC transactions HSR review has been successfully completed and we will work with the SEC towards obtaining their approval for this transaction. Contingent on receiving regulatory approval, this transaction could close as early as the end of the second quarter, our original estimate was in the second half of the year.","In our corporate solutions business, we announced two acquisitions: Marketwired and Boardvantage. These acquisitions will enable us to extend our corporate client customer base and increase our exposure to some of the highest margin and fastest growing segments in our corporate solutions business. With respect to Marketwired, which closed in late February, we are now working through the integration of the systems, technology and talent with the goal of a single new platform for news, distribution and analytical information.","With respect to Boardvantage, we\u2019ve received notice yesterday that the HSR review has also been successfully completed, and we anticipate closing in the coming week. We look forward to strengthening our position as a leading provider of board and collaboration tools.","As I mentioned earlier, technology is core to what we do here. It is core to the way we apply everything in our businesses, and we do that across products and solutions with the singular focus to benefit our clients. Let me give you a few examples of this.","With Nasdaq private markets, we are on a mission to bring increased liquidity and other advantages from the public market to the private market space. Our efforts continue to resonate with private companies, and at the end of the quarter, NPM now is 122 private companies using our software products for employees, shareholder liquidity and equity cap table administration. This compares to the 46 in the prior year period.","We continue to enhance this platform in new and innovative ways to reduce the administrative complexities and cost private companies face today. This success follows last quarter's successful execution of the first blockchain enabled transaction in the private space. This enabled participants to reach settlement in minutes compared to the industries, the public companies industry current standards, which is measured in days.","We are doing incredibly exciting things in the private market space today. But most importantly, we are only beginning to scratch the surface in terms of level of innovation and capabilities we can in fact deliver for private companies.","In our Corporate Solutions business, which serves issuers both public and private. We\u2019ve successfully launched our next generation IR Insight platform in the first weeks of January. And through the first three months of this launch, we migrated 750 clients and over 1,200 users, that's truly impressive. We also received much feedback from the early adopters, most of it overwhelmingly positive, but this feedback loop is also helping us to develop and quickly deploy innovative new features.","We expect to complete the transition of the remaining 2,500 clients within the next six months and sunset the legacy T1 platform on schedule during the fourth quarter of this year. We've added also new customers through cross-selling our existing base and winning competitive situations. In addition, we've seen IR Insight and the integration of platform offers serve us as an opportunity to deepen relationships with customers by cross-selling other products in advisory and communication segments.","While still early days, we see clear examples of how elevating the bar in terms of technology and product design, will be key to bringing sustained organic growth, to corporate solutions in the periods to come.","Moving on to our Market Technology business. We're also leveraging the transfer for applied technology to increase the capabilities to utilize blockchain technologies to evolve our post rate operations, as we continue to enjoy near record high \u2013 highs in our signed contract backlog.","SMARTS, our leading solution in the surveillance base is a good example of the success, we've had in evolving that product over time to increase the value for our clients. In fact we had a record quarter in terms of SMARTS new order intake and this is really a strong growth story for us as our clients are turning to us more and more to help them manage the complexities of the new regulatory environment.","We are also currently exploring the application of technology such as machine intelligence, which we expect to open up a host of new opportunities and capabilities for advanced compliance and surveillance that will detect fraud more quickly and in more asset classes. We're also currently exploring a number of proofs of concept in our lab that looks to harness, the predictive capabilities, machine intelligence offers to enhance our listing, our trading, our index and our data product areas.","To ensure, we are positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. We are making investments and also we have partnered with digital reasoning one of the thought leaders in this space.","Our use of apply technology is really only one half of the equation, is what we do with this technology to deliver on our clients' needs that is the most important and in many respects where true innovation takes place. NFX, our energy derivatives market is a good example of our focus, our new concepts in a better way to serve our clients. Now in its nine month of operation, we are extremely encouraged by the volume and open interest progress we are seeing.","During the April trading volume passed a significant milestone moving above 100,000 contracts per day on average, while open interest also continued to set new records. And we went about 800,000 contracts just this week, and we now make up about 40% of the futures open interest at OCC. We are seeing a growing number of firms use our NFX services and during the first quarter more than 70 companies managed their trading and hedging needs on NFX.","On May 1, we will implement our new fee program for NFX. We are committed to provide the market with transaction costs that are 50% lower than the incumbence, these fees will be introduced in a phased manner, May 1 is the first phase of that program.","When we think about resiliency at Nasdaq, we of course think about our technologies, and the systems and how reliably they serve our customers. We also think more broadly than that and on how we run this organization. Central to this business model, our business model is a diverse mix of subscription and recurring revenue. Almost three quarters of our current revenue is subscription and recurring.","We are also continuing on maniacal focus on optimizing efficiency, and margins on a product-by-product basis even while investing materially to grow each franchise. And this is evidenced in the significant increase in our profitability year-over-year. In fact our 48% non-GAAP operating margin matches a multiyear high.","Together, these give us an exceptional amount of visibility and stability in our growth path, which combined with our organic growth opportunity, significant operating leverage, and disciplined deployment and return of capital has us on a great path to deliver strong shareholder returns, both in terms of combined earnings, growth and dividend yield.","It also continues a successful story that can \u2013 we can continue investing and innovating on behalf of our customers, as well as nourishing the seeds of tomorrow's growth. In closing, it was another tremendous quarter for this franchise, the examples I've outlined here today, clearly demonstrate this franchise is focused on the innovative use of technology, growth and resiliency is not only increasing the amount of client opportunities for us, but it does manifest itself in the results we delivered to our shareholders.","What is most exciting for me is that when we look across all our businesses we're in, there are perhaps more quality opportunities in front of us today than during any other time during my tenure. We certainly feel very good about our ability to execute on these behind the resilient business model we have built.","We alluded to strong value creation during Investor Day, and I think this quarter is clearly an indication that we're on the right glide path to achieve this, and look forward to exceeding expectations for our clients and our shareholders in the quarters to come.","Now let's turn the call over to Ron. Thank you.","Ron Hassen","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. My commentary will focus on non-GAAP results, reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release, and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.","I will start by reviewing first quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter as shown on page three of the presentation. The 5% or $27 million increase in reported net revenue of $534 million consisted of organic growth and market services net revenue of $12 million or 6%, resulting principally from higher cash equity and access revenues.","Organic growth and non-trading Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Services segments totaled $7 million or 2% due to the growth in Listings and Information Services. In addition there was a \u2013 there was $10 million in revenue from recently completed acquisitions of Marketwired, Chi-X Canada plus one additional month in the first quarter of 2016 from DWA, while year-over-year change in FX rates, reduced revenue by $2 million.","I am now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments, all comparisons will be for the prior year period unless otherwise noted.","Information services on page 5 saw a $5 million or 4% organic increase plus a $4 million increase related to DWA and Chi-X Canada acquisitions, reduced by a $1 million FX impact. Market data revenues saw $4 million or 4% organic increase reflecting revenue growth in index data and proprietary products. Index licensing and service \u2013 and services saw $1 million or 4% organic increase reflecting growth in DWA. Technology solutions shown on page 6 saw a $4 million or 3% increase in revenue, including four main contribution from the acquisition of Marketwired.","The operating margin was 12%, up from 11% in the prior year period. We continue to have confidence and reaching on medium-term objective and expect further progress as we move through 2016. Corporate solutions saw $1 million or 1% organic decline as shown in the record \u2013 as growth in directed test was more than offset by declines in multimedia.","Repeating what we said at the recent Investor Day, we continue to believe we are on the path to return to organic revenue growth in corporate solutions, but would expect that in the second half of 2016 at the earliest. Market technology revenues saw a $1 million or 2% organic increase due to organic growth in surveillance products. New order intake was $22 million in the first quarter and the period end backlog finished at $783 million, up 8% year-over-year and they were a all-time record of $788 million set in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Listing Services, on Page 7 saw a $2 million or 3% organic increase in revenues, driven primarily by increase in the number of listed companies. Operating margin of 42% was down from 44% in the prior year period \u2013 prior year quarter.","Market Services on Page 8, saw a $12 million or 6% organic increase in net revenues plus a $2 million increase due to the acquisition of Chi-X Canada reduced by $1 million FX impact. Operating margin increased to 56% from 54% in the prior year period.","Equity Derivatives trading and clearing net revenue achieved a 4% organic growth primarily due to the higher U.S. industry trading volumes and higher U.S. average net capture partially offset by lower U.S. market share. Cash equities trading net revenues saw a 17% organic increase due to the higher cash equity in net capture and increased industry volumes, partially offset by modestly lower market shares.","Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities trading and clearing net revenues saw 17% organic decline from the prior year, principally due to an FX related trading incentives and lower U.S. treasury volumes, partially offset by growth in European fixed income and commodities trading.","Access and Broker Services saw a 7% organic revenue increase due to the increase in customer demand for network connectivity.","Turning to Page 9 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $5 million on an organic basis or 2% increase due to $6 million \u2013 and $6 million due to DWA, Marketwired and Chi-X Canada acquisitions, partially offset by $3 million in FX impact resulting in an $8 million or 3% reported increase.","Turn to Slide 11. Our revised 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance is $1,180 million to $1,230 million versus the previous $1,110 million to $1,160 million. The core expense guidance is unchanged, but we are updating it to include the impact of closed Chi-X Canada and Marketwired acquisitions as well as board advantage acquisition, which we expect to close in the next week, which we collectively are expected to add $70 million of expense in 2016, including $5 million that was already included in the first quarter of this year.","The expense guidance does not include the impact of our pending acquisition of ISC, but we look forward to updating you on its impact after it has closed. Non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter increased 6% on an organic basis and 8% in total. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 48%, up from 46% in the prior year period and primarily reflect in the margin improvement of our market service business \u2013 market service business, net interest expense was $27 million in the first quarter, unchanged from the prior year period. Other non-operating income came to $3 million in the first quarter, this income primarily represents our portion of income and losses from certain investment interest such as our equity interest in OCC, EuroCCP and TOM.","Going forward including the pickup from the incremental equity and OCC that will occur when we close ISC, we expect other operating income to range between $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the foreseeable future.","Non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5% and was within our guidance. Non-GAAP net income was a record of $153 million or $0.91 per diluted share, compared to $138 million or $0.80 per diluted share in the first quarter 2015.","Now moving on to cash flow and capital. Please turn to Slide 13. During the quarter, we repurchased $29 million in stock \u2013 in stock and through dividends we repurchased as we returned $70 million in capital to the shareholders. Additionally during the quarter, we announced a 28% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.32, and NASDAQ's Board of Directors authorized an additional $370 million in share repurchases, bringing the total remaining value authorized to $500 million. This authorization is expected to be used primarily to offset share issuance such as employee share-based equity plans and as such we expect its utilization to be over a multiyear period.","Thank you for your time and I'll turn the floor back over to Bob.","Bob Greifeld","Thank you, everybody. And we are ready for questions, right. Operator, can you please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Richard Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Richard Repetto","Yes. Good morning, Bob. Good morning, Ron. And congrats on the record earnings quarter, Bob.","Bob Greifeld","Thank you, appreciate it.","Richard Repetto","I guess, the first question is just a technical question. On the increased expense guidance, Ron, it just seems we \u2013 it feels like $70 million is probably the right number, but when do we get any of the $60 million in synergies, is the synergies I guess baked into that as well?","Bob Greifeld","Right now and for 2016, Rich, we're seeing very little synergies and it's really going to happen really in 2017 and 2018, the $60 million that we actually disclosed to you during Investor Day. So, there is no synergies really in that number at this stage.","Richard Repetto","Okay. Okay. And then, I guess, my one follow-up would be for Bob, yesterday they had the EMSAC, the Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee and, I guess, two things that look relevant to NASDAQ would be the proposal for the cap on access fees. I know you done your test, but just any comments color on that and then also, I guess, they're outlined for propose on SRO liability sort of limiting the liability to certain areas, as well as they even propose, I think the idea of capital being retained at the exchange for that liability. So, I guess thoughts on those things that occurred yesterday at the equity market structure advisory committee.","Bob Greifeld","Yes, Rich. The first thing I do is put that committee in context in that it's a prelude, and it has no official standing in the process. So whatever recommendations come out of that may or may not be put out for comment and review. And as you know, the comment review process is long and difficult by itself. So this is just very early stage with everything. And as you know that, we think the committee is not formed in a proper way, and it's a strange and curious situation where the two listing exchanges not part of that committee. And I think that in some very significant way diminishes the authority of the committee even though it doesn't have an official position. So, we'll digest what they've said, and then we'll comment either through the official period or depending on what makes it true or we'll comment now. So, we're working with it.","So, with respect to the access fee, as you know when you reference, we try that \u2013 we try that by ourselves, and clearly it has to be coordinated effort by the industry. So, we need to study the details but clearly we are aligned with that in concept with respect to immunities and Mr. Nights here to helping out, but understand the immunities are really a core issue more so than a commission issue at that point in time.","Ron Hassen","And the preliminary recommendations of subcommittee, there was none on immunity.","Richard Repetto","Right.","Ron Hassen","And I want to emphasize a point Bob was making. The sub-committee's recommendation, the next step is for the full committee to consider them. Then they go to the staff of the SEC.","Richard Repetto","Right.","Ron Hassen","The SEC has \u2013 staff has to decide what it recommends. Then it goes to the commission, the commission have to decide what it recommends. Then it goes to the public, and it goes to a process of public comments and the evidence in that comment period has to support the conclusions where there is the potential of court review. So there are many steps in this process.","Bob Greifeld","Right. So, I've said before that the pace of the SEC could be described as glacial it's important to recognize this is before we even get to the SEC and they're also will be a change of administration both in the Whitehouse and at the SEC probably in the not too distant future. So, it's hard to predict what's going to be happening which is will be at a very slow pace.","Richard Repetto","Got it. Thank you. And I totally agree with you on that sort of, what you call peculiar makeup of the committee. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ashley Serrao of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Ashley Serrao","Good morning.","Bob Greifeld","Good morning.","Ashley Serrao","So, I guess first question just on Corporate Solutions. With respect to the rollout of our insight, how'd you're making progress on the client conversions, but more curious about the competitive landscape, how our rivals responding and but even manage attracting newer clients to the offering?","Adena Friedman","Hi, this is Adena. Yes, we have been able to attract new clients into the offering and our sales pipeline is picking up quite nicely, particularly as we go into the second quarter because we had to get the system launched and then we had to start to show it to all the clients and it's easier to sell the product once it's in full production and you can really show it in all of its glory. So we are definitely seeing an increase in the sales pipeline as well as sales as well as competitive wins and we definitely see that picking up as we get into the second quarter.","Ashley Serrao","Okay. And just another question on Corporate Solutions, I guess MMS or multimedia solutions has been a drag now for many quarters. Just curious if there is anything you can do to either improve the margin profile of that business or even if you consider that a core offering today?","Adena Friedman","I think that the multimedia solutions business which really our webcasting business. As we mentioned at Investor Day has created some short-term challenges and we are working through with the partner to continue to look at enhancing our offering and we continue to look at how we offer the product in terms of pricing and service. So we are working through those issues and we will continue to update people as we progress.","Ashley Serrao","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Your line is now open.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning.","Bob Greifeld","How are you doing, Kyle?","Kyle Voigt","Good. So I guess the first question I'm going to ask on NFX, seems like you've been making some good progress there. But I believe some of the trading incentives were going to be eliminated for certain products shortly. So can you just give us an update on the timing there and remind us which products you expect to wind down the incentives for first? Thanks.","Bob Greifeld","Well, I'd say two things, one, there will always be some level of market maker incentive involved with NFX and other efforts in the space. But I think it's important to note as I said in my prepared comments on May 1, we will start charging early days some normal report by charging for those products, where we basically have double digit market share. And it's important to recognize that these charges have been done in direct consultation with our market committee and has broad support from the customers that now is the time to move along with that.","So, as I said in my comments, we are in active engagement with our customers across a wide range of our businesses and it's nowhere more true than in NFX, where we have strong customer support, strong customer support for what we're doing and actually start the charging on May 1.","Kyle Voigt","Okay and then just a follow-up would be on the debt financing for ISC and some of the other acquisitions. So, there are some headlines that came across just suggesting that you're planning to issue a euro denominated bond. Can you just give us an update on the financing plans and whether this has changed the outlook for a 4% to 5% interest rate on the new debt? Thanks.","Ron Hassen","Yes it\u2019s a great question. Yes, we are definitely looking into the both the euro market as well as the U.S. market. And as I mentioned to you at Investor Day, we're looking between a seven-year and ten-year, or actually a five-year and a ten-year offering. And as I indicated 4% to 5%, I would guide you closer to the low end of that in terms of an interest rate, since the euro market looks very favorable at this point.","Kyle Voigt","Okay. Thanks, Ron.","Ron Hassen","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Allen of Buckingham. Your line is now open.","Chris Allen","Good morning, everybody.","Bob Greifeld","Chris, good to have you back.","Chris Allen","Thanks. Appreciate it. I appreciate the updated expense guidance up for the deals. I'm just wondering, if you could give us any color in terms of what the \u2013 if the deals had closed this quarter \u2013 be in the quarter what the revenue run rate would have been. I know you gave us a little bit on the kiosks [ph] kind of $2 million [indiscernible] full quarter, and if we included board event?","Bob Greifeld","Well, the first thing I would say with ISE is, we didn't expect to get the approval so soon. So I know, I've not spend a second thinking about what the revere would look like. And if we close this deal at the very end of June, I think that would be beyond our most optimistic thoughts, as we announced the deal.","Chris Allen","Okay.","Bob Greifeld","So, I don't have anything here.","Adena Friedman","I think also, on Investor Day, we did provide you some disclosures of the impact of the acquisitions. And for the two conversations on acquisitions the revenues tend to be relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. So you can take some of our annualized impact and understand what would be impact would be for an individual quarter.","Bob Greifeld","If we just go back to Investor Day \u2013 we gave you guidance for the Corporate Solutions to acquisitions to be $85 million, so it's more or less in line year-to-year.","Chris Allen","Got it. So still stable with that the guidance you gave at the investor.","Bob Greifeld","Yes, yes.","Chris Allen","Okay. And then, just on the order backlog within market technology, I think, you said it was a record quarter in surveillance. But it is obviously is one of the lowest order in takes, we\u2019ve seen in a while, rather could be pretty lumpy. Any like, how do we think about the order intake that current backlog and kind of what you are working on in terms of new sales there?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well, I think it's very important to note that the fourth quarter was an extraordinarily strong quarter for us, in terms of closing new sales across the entire business be wise SMARTS and the core market tech business. And generally what happens is you go through a really big push at the end of the year and the first quarter tends to be a little bit slower, this one was, we had extraordinarily strong end of the year and so our first quarter has been a little bit slower. But we definitely see a very strong sales pipeline frankly across the entire market technology franchise. So, we have no concerns over the overall strength and growth potential of the business.","Chris Allen","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Carrier of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Mike Carrier","Thanks guys.","Bob Greifeld","How are you doing, Mike?","Mike Carrier","Good. Bob, just wanted to get your take like when I look at the growth that you guys have put up particularly on the non-transaction side, it\u2019s been healthy when you look over the past call it five quarters, six quarters. It always seems like the first quarter, even though there\u2019s seasonality, even on a year-over-year basis, it tends to look little bit weaker. Just wanted to get your take, is there something in the business that causes that and then you get kind of the resurgence throughout the year and that we should kind of expect on an ongoing basis? Or is there certain things like this quarter that kind of weight on that growth rate versus what we've been seeing in the past two few quarters?","Bob Greifeld","Well, I would say this. Once we get into the software and services business, it does bring me back to my days of as a software entrepreneur or as at SunGard, where the fourth quarter is the big push and then the first quarter is always weak. So I think with the business models we have, we're not going to have that fourth quarter boom and boss, but we will definitely see seasonality effects on a consistent basis.","Mike Carrier","Okay. It's helpful. And then Ron, just two things, just wanted to get your take and I know this is going to be somewhat quite too long out there in terms of timeline, but when you think about those synergies that you mentioned in 2017 and 2018, just wondering to try to quantify that without giving maybe expense guidance for 2017 or 2018, which is why I want to make sure we have those, when we start thinking out for like the 2017 expense growth?","And then also just cash use. So when we think about capital deployment, just what we should be thinking about in terms of the debt pay down versus, what I would call more core for you like buybacks and M&A?","Ron Hassen","Yes. So, in terms of synergies, we're looking really at a 18-month horizon in terms of the $60 million that we\u2019re looking at in terms of majority of it anyway. In terms of the buybacks and the deleveraging, I think we mentioned this before it\u2019s going to be more of balance approach. We want to get down to the mid two and half level, and it's going to be 18 months to 24 months before we get there.","So buybacks look to continue to happen as I said in my prepared remarks, its more or less going to offset the natural dilution that we have in the share count that we have, and we're really going to focus on deleveraging getting us back to two and half times leverage.","Mike Carrier","Okay.","Bob Greifeld","I would add two things. I would add two things to that. One with respect to the synergy realization, I don\u2019t think the management team is completely baked in terms of what the plan is, I think you'll find more details from us in the quarters to come, we're definitely just happy to be closing these deals sooner than we thought, and obviously we haven't closed ISCA [ph] yet. So, we have some more work to do there.","And with respect to the buybacks in addition to maintaining the share count, we would look to do buybacks on an opportunistic basis, as we've done in the past and we've been successful at making sure that we see value, in the stock that we\u2019re more aggressive rather than less.","Mike Carrier","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is now open.","Alex Kramm","Yes, hey, good morning, everyone. Wanted to just ask again about the excess services increase, I think, Ron mentioned, I think it increase in network demand. Can you flush it out a little bit more, it seems like the trading space has actually grown much slower in terms of new users? So is that pricing or do you actually see with increase volume that people want more bands with or are there actually new people connecting?","Ron Hassen","I think all the above. But, if I was to highlight one factor, we have certainly had success with our microwave offering.","Alex Kramm","Okay.","Ron Hassen","And that was probably the strongest single contributor to a very strong first quarter.","Alex Kramm","All right. Great. And then just secondly, just circling back to NFX, obviously yes the incentives coming off and so forth, but I think in the past just given some color in terms of the user base and also maybe how open interest is looking. So any particular color like who are the 70 people that are trading? Are you getting some of the commercial users to sign-up? And also how does your open interest can compare to what you see at the incumbents that [indiscernible] is. Any differences there that make us believe this is more sustainable than maybe some of the other initiatives that you had in the past? Thank you.","Ron Hassen","Well, I would say one. By definition, open interest shows that you're building an asset over time, and to get to 800,000 contracts in open interest, I think is certainly remarkable. 100,000 contracts we\u2019re very proud of is daily activity, but 800,000 of open interest and as I said in my prepared remarks compared to basically the biggest complex at OCC were 40% of the volume and obviously biggest features have been around for a lot longer period of time than that. So, still early days, but certainly more progress than we have planned for at this particular point in time.","With respect to the first party of question, when you have 70 participants that has to represent the broad spectrum of the marketplace we\u2019re averaging now in the high 40s on a daily day, with respect to number of participants. So, we feel very good about that. So, beyond the investment banks and beyond the market makers, we certainly see what we call the naturals coming in to the marketplace. And we're obviously a big story within that marketplace, we're too big to hide everybody is aware of it, everybody is aware of the liquidity and particularly the products we have where we\u2019re at double-digit market share on a daily basis.","Alex Kramm","All right. Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Brian Bedell","Great thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a focus on the Market Technology segment, question for Adena on the Corporate Solutions part. If you can just flush out it, I think, there was also some, you did mention in Investor Day, some reduced pricing for some of the energy clients also being a headwind to that revenue stream, and then if you can talk about the progress towards the 20% op margin goal for the Market Technology segment, I know, obviously it's depressed in 1Q, but if we\u2019re still on track for that for full year 2016?","Adena Friedman","Well, I think, that the \u2013 seeking the first question with regard to energy clients. As a general matter, we're seeing some M&A and what we would say, working with some of our energy clients to make sure that they retain their service what that they may, we might reprice it, and the short-term can make sure that they can continue to afford our service while they are working through some of their own business challenges, that is creating some level of headwinds. So, both M&A and that kind of activity in the Investor Relation segment of our Corporate Solution. But we want to make sure that we continue to work with our clients. We are very focused on that and we will continue to do that while we also grow through new clients and other things.","So it's definitely a mixed story right now in terms of finding new clients, upgrading our clients, adding users to existing clients, at the same time, working through some challenge sectors and managing through a lot of M&A activity amongst some of our clients.","And with regard to the second question, as we've said before it's multi-year outlook for the business to achieve a 20% run rate margin across technology solutions, which includes market technology and corporate solutions and we continue to be on track with that and we discussed that at Investor Day and we continue to see that as an achievable goal for us.","Ron Hassen","And last but not least, I mean, the acquisitions are certainly going to help you achieve scale and hit the market goals.","Adena Friedman","Absolutely.","Brian Bedell","Right. And that's helpful for the second half, I would assume on this acquisition closed on segment. Yes, okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the \u2013 Bob or Ron, the EPS drag that you expect from NFX and NLX combined, I guess, maybe just in the first quarter here and then what you are expecting with the new pricing arrangements for the balance of the year \u2013 like a quarterly EPS track?","Ron Hassen","The impact for NFX this quarter was $0.02 and NLX was $0.01.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And do you expect that to improve with the new pricing dynamic over the next three quarters?","Bob Greifeld","Yes. We think there\u2019s going to be two different things happening as we get to the second half of the year. We will be charging on the NFX side and also I think our cost base with NLX will decline, so the $0.03 might go to $0.02, but you are in that kind of ballpark.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Chris Harris","Hey. Thanks, guys. Just want to come back to the organic revenue growth and non-trading segments. I know we talked about the seasonality earlier, but if you guys think about the set up for the rest of the year, do you guys think you're going to be able to potentially hit your mid single-digit target? I know that's more of a longer term target, but I'm thinking specifically for 2016? And if you do feel comfortable with that where it's going to be the main drivers?","Bob Greifeld","Yes. The thing I would start with this by saying that that is a target over a multi-year period of time and we're still in a building cycle, the way I look at it. We're certainly very excited with the rollout of IR insight. We're very excited about the integration of the acquisitions into the existing product sets, unless it's going to mean to our competitive positioning in the marketplace, market technology is on the cusp of a new product cycle, and certainly we see great opportunities in clearing enabled and enhanced by blockchain technology. So this is a multi-year goal. I personally don't think about 2015, 2016 in a given time period, but look at the trend line that we have and we feel very good about that.","Chris Harris","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Hill of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Ken Hill","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Bob Greifeld","How are you doing, Ken?","Ken Hill","Doing great. Just a question then on the listing front. You guys had some pretty strong trends I think on the ETP business with 42% market share there. I was hoping if you could go through how you're seeing that market evolve for both the listing standpoint, maybe how you're differentiating yourself versus other exchanges out there as you guys compete for listings for exchange traded products going forward? And maybe what are the benefits that gives your business over time?","Bob Greifeld","Yes. So let me start with the last part. And then I\u2019ll let Adena answer part of it. It's important to recognize that with the ETP listing, it's not a great revenue opportunity for us, as bundle pricing across families and doesn't amount to a lot of money. Where the ETP market is interesting is if you happen to have one listed with you the trades actively. So clearly in this marketplaces, call it 10 that matter to the trading community, the others are good to have, we service our customers well with it, but not drivers of revenue in any significant way.","Adena Friedman","Yes. In terms of our efforts to continue to be the lifting venue of choice for ETP is, we have the benefit of being able to offer the exchange trigger products visibility through the market side and other visibility programs that we have here, which makes it, so that we can differentiated from some of our competitors. The other thing that we do is we work with the lead market makers and the ETPs around our market maker quality program that also provide for some rebate program to the lead market makers in addition to working through an opportunity to provide some benefit to the issuers on that as well.","And then we also, I think that we have this kind of full service approach, we are indexed ourselves, we understand what it takes to be successful exchange traded product. We leverage that expertise and we talk and we feel that we're very client focused around making sure the ETPs feel, they have the best possible market structure and market environment to trade their products. So, we're proud of what we can offer and that's obviously showing up in some really great success last year and this year.","Bob Greifeld","Yes. So certainly first quarter is a great quarter for switches. And I think we have evolved our market structure to be sensitive to the particular needs of ETPs. I think you can see that trend line continue in the quarters to come where you'll have market structural enhancements just for these issuers.","Ken Hill","Great. Thanks for my question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Bond of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Andrew Bond","Thank you. Good morning.","Bob Greifeld","How you're doing?","Andrew Bond","Good. Thanks. I want to get your thoughts on the U.S. cash equity markets, market volatility and volumes declined quite a bit from the beginning of the year. I mean, NASDAQ's market share is also continues to decline. Obviously, that's some of that is related to increase in volumes, but is there anything else driving the share declines from NASDAQ's market? Is there anything kind of strategic you wanted to do particularly as IEX becomes a national market soon, and DAX potentially gets more competitive given the recent IPO?","Bob Greifeld","Yes. I would say this. As we said before, we're very focused on managing the balance between share and capture, and I think the team has done an outstanding job with that over the years. So at a given month or given quarter, the focus will change somewhat, but overall I think we have a good balance and it's important to recognize from a trading perspective we still by far and away run the largest venue on untamed sea and that's the point of intersection between us on the trading side and the listing side, so we're very comfortable with our positioning there.","Andrew Bond","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is now open.","Alex Kramm","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in for follow-up. Just a couple of things, one, Adena, did you actually give the net sales number in Corporate Solutions, maybe I missed that? And I have another question.","Adena Friedman","We do not disclose net sales and we provide you with just revenue and expense results, and general trends.","Alex Kramm","Okay. I think it was $3 million last quarter, so you've given in the past, I was just curious, be an update. But all right, anyways, second question, just on the Index business for second, this is more of bigger picture question like, obviously always highlighted the AUM there, but can actually break the segment, I know it\u2019s a small segment like, how much of that business actually AUM from EPS? How much is the description revenues? And how much is derivatives trading fees? And can you give any general trends in terms of are you taking pricing on subscriptions, and any other color you can provide so we can model that piece better? Thanks.","Adena Friedman","The data revenue associated with the Index business is in the data business. So, you will see that sitting in the data business. In terms of \u2013 and so in terms of just generally though on the Index business, we continue to see strong trends in overall demand for our products. We have had some market related headwinds within AUM, but the fact that of the matter is, we continue to see strong demand for this products, and that AUM has recovered quite nicely, as you we\u2019ve gotten into the second quarter.","In terms of \u2013 we don't breakout the revenue, in terms of how much is contributed to each, but we have seen strong trading activity in the first quarter. We also continue to see growth and demand and new product launches for our overall business, and continue to work very closely with the EPS sponsors to launch new products, which will drive further growth overtime.","Alex Kramm","All right. Very good. Thanks again.","Bob Greifeld","Okay. All right, well, thank you everybody for your time today, and certainly we're proud to deliver another record quarter for our shareholders or stakeholders. And as I liked to say, we do judge how we are doing relative to our position with our customers and beyond the financial metrics we just disclosed. The first quarter was another good quarter for us improving our competitive positioning with our customers and obviously that will determine our long-term financial success.","So we're proud of hitting on both cylinders. We again thank you for your time and look forward to answering your questions in days and weeks to come. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",""],"15677":["Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) Q2 2016 Earnings Call July 27, 2016  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Edward P.

Welcome to the Nasdaq Second Quarter 2016 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ed Ditmire, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Edward P. Ditmire - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's second quarter 2016 earnings results. On the line are Bob Greifeld, our CEO; Ron Hassen, who was our Interim CFO and is acting as our Principal Financial Officer until compiling of our second quarter 2016 Form 10-Q; Michael Ptasznik, our new CFO; our Chief Operating Officer and President, Adena Friedman; President, Hans-Ole Jochumsen; Ed Knight, our General Counsel; and other members of the management team.","After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.","I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I now will turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review Nasdaq's second quarter 2016 results. Certainly, when you look at our performance this quarter and during the first half of the year, the balance of our business model continues to demonstrate its resiliency.","As I have pointed out to you before, while we are not immune to market forces and significant global events, we are, however, intensely focused on serving our clients and supporting them throughout pivotal moments in their evolution. As a fintech company, technology has always been the fundamental focus that drives our decisions and ultimately enables us to expand and grow our competitive position in the marketplace.","During the quarter, Nasdaq delivered record revenues of $559 million as well as record non-GAAP operating income of $259 million. We achieved non-GAAP EPS of $0.91, which ties our all-time high and is a second quarter record. It represents a 10% year-on-year increase and underscores our ability to deliver double-digit shareholder returns through EPS growth and dividend yield.","Clearly, organic revenue growth is one of the key benchmarks by which we judge our progress, and I am pleased to report that it was positive in all four segments. Our non-transaction segments combined delivered a very respectable 4% organic growth in the second quarter versus the prior-year period.","The biggest stand-out was in our Technology Solutions segment, which saw organic growth of 6% when compared to the prior-year quarter. Truly outstanding. And this was driven by recent business wins and continued growth in Market Technology, including SMARTS Surveillance and revenue recognition of our Borsa Istanbul contract.","On top of the organic progress, we also closed two important acquisitions during the quarter in ISE and Boardvantage. We're now clearly in execution mode on all four acquisitions we completed during this year. We have been and will continue to be maniacally focused on delivering maximum value in each of these deals to our clients and our shareholders. I'm pleased to report we've achieved the first $10 million of synergies in the second quarter.","When we look at how we are improving our competitive position across this franchise and all the businesses in which we complete, we are doing it in a variety of compelling ways; one, through organic investments and fundamentally disruptive technologies and also organic growth initiatives, as well as expansion through acquisitions that lever our core competency.","I want to talk about our progress this quarter in the context of these three core areas of focus and highlight how they continue to drive client opportunities and growth. As I mentioned, organic growth reinforces that we are on the right track strategically and in terms of running our businesses well. It's also a sound endorsement that we're doing the right things on behalf of our clients.","In our Market Services segment, we continue to focus on creating one of the most robust multi-asset platforms in the industry for our clients. To this point, perhaps most exciting for us right now is the progress of NFX. We just passed the one-year anniversary since the launch and we've hit three major milestones around that one-year mark.","First, we had just this week our first 5% market share day; second, we had our 100th firm transact on the platform; and third, we've gone over 1 million contracts in open interest.","Operationally, we've began a new chapter in the NFX story when we introduced fees in the beginning of May. In the two months period that followed in May and June, I'm pleased to report that open interest ended 22% higher, while average daily volume was 27% higher. Our market share during the same two-month period increased by 70 basis points, a 29% improvement.","As I've said before, pricing is being introduced at modest but meaningful levels in the products that have already seen a meaningful liquidity built. We will continue to price according to the value we are delivering to our customers.","In addition, we're already off to a strong start in the second half of the year. This is against a backdrop that featured macro and geopolitical volatility, as well as progress we've seen on strategic initiatives such as our acquisitions. And I'll come back to those a little bit later.","Given our momentum, we are in a strong position to defend and approve our competitive position in our trading businesses, something that has and always will be fundamental to our future.","In our Listing Services business, organic growth continued to be solid at 3% during the quarter. Overall, Nasdaq remains the new listings global leader in the first half of 2016 with a total of 167 new listings, including 68 IPOs, and a 73% win rate in our U.S. market.","One stand-out for us has been the performance in the Nordic markets where we saw 47 new listings in the first half of the year with over \u20ac4.2 billion in capital raised. Included in these numbers was the largest IPO of the year globally, the DONG Energy listing on our Copenhagen market.","We also continue to maintain strong exchange listing transfer momentum in the U.S. with 13 companies switch from NYSE in the first half of 2016. They were led by such great companies as Scripps Networks Interactive; tronc, which is formerly Tribune Publishing; OPKO, a leading biotechnology company. Since 2005, over $830 billion in market value has chosen to switch to Nasdaq, including $43 billion in the first six months of 2016. Truly outstanding.","Elsewhere, we also continued to improve in ETF listings. Nasdaq added 61 new listings in the first half of the year, including 24 switches, leading the industry with a 39% share of new listings and switches, and driving the total number of ETP listed at Nasdaq to 277 at mid-year, up 57% versus the prior year.","While still clearly an early-stage initiative in terms of revenue, we continued to see strong operational traction in Nasdaq private market. We saw 133 private companies use our platform in the second quarter, more than doubling from 62 in the prior-year period. We also are working to expand our offering. The private market opportunity continues to grow. We have new clients coming on board just recently such as, Yusero (9:07) and Skybox.","During the first half of 2016, the private companies' secondary markets saw the number of transactions grow by over 20%, the dollar volume rose most significantly 135% year-over-year, again, another outstanding performance.","As I mentioned before, our Technology Solutions segment saw the most dynamic growth during the quarter, achieving 6% organic growth. This was driven by Market Technology business, which benefited from continued strong trends in the surveillance, post-trade and GRC spaces, but also as revenue recognition starts to reflect more of the recent periods' significant business wins. These are just a few of the examples of how our focus on efficiency and serving clients continues to manifest itself in our results and improve our competitive positioning.","Now, as you know, in addition to organic growth, strategic acquisitions are core to our growth strategy and will deliver increased value to our clients. Let me give you a brief update on our progress. As I mentioned, during the quarter, we closed two acquisitions, ISE and Boardvantage. With ISE, we closed the transaction at the very end of June and I'm pleased we were able to do so in such a timely fashion, less than four months from announcement and executing on a financing package at lower-than-expected cost. We are intensely focused on leveraging our platforms to provide new capabilities and functionalities to clients of the combined businesses.","We're off to a strong start, and since closing the transaction, our combined options market share has remained very close to the 40% level, combining all our franchises together. It's certainly an early sign that the market understands and is responding positively to our client discussions and how the combination will deliver greater value and opportunity.","Upon closing the transaction, we've already realized approximately $8 million in annualized run rate synergies, a first step against a total $40 million synergy opportunity. And I am pleased to report that the transaction is immediately accretive to non-GAAP earnings, very similar to Philly, if you remember, Ron, back in the day.","Of course, we are targeting much higher synergies as we continue integrating our technology assets and teams, and migrating to our core trading platform. I'm looking forward to updating you on that progress as well as our progress in integrating and migrating by Nasdaq CXC business on to our core trading platform in the quarters to come.","In our Corporate Solutions business, we closed Boardvantage in May and are well underway with the integration and our focus to provide one of the most robust set of board and collaboration tools in the marketplace today.","Taking the Boardvantage acquisition together with the first quarter's close on the Marketwired acquisition, our expanded footprint in PR distribution and governance space gives our Corporate Solutions business a heavier mix to what we believe are the higher-growth, higher-margin and more scalable businesses, as well as material cost synergy opportunity.","We achieved $2 million in run rate synergies in the second quarter versus a targeted $20 million opportunity within 18 months of closing. Perhaps, even more importantly, as we work more broadly to return Corporate Solutions to positive organic growth, the two deals bring approximately 7,500 new corporate clients to expand our relationships and drive new cross-selling opportunities across this franchise.","In summary, during the first half of the year, we closed four acquisitions on or ahead of schedule at significantly better-than-expected financing cost. Based on that as well as our increased confidence in revenue trends and synergies, we feel comfortable raising the 2015 diluted EPS accretion number to $0.40 per share from the prior $0.37 we provided during our March Investor Day. The $0.40 accretion assumes 2015 pro forma results with full synergy realization. Certainly, very good progress so far.","As a financial technology company, our ability to see around corners and apply technology in new and innovative ways for clients is fundamental to our success and the future of the franchise. I want to briefly highlight our ongoing progress during the quarter.","In May, at our Semi-Annual Future of Technology Conference for Market Technology customers in Stockholm, with the largest customer attendance ever, we announced a significant step in the evolution of how we will deliver technology to our clients and our internal systems as well.","The Nasdaq Financial Framework is a result of listening to our clients and the result of significant R&D efforts. It truly transforms our offering into a more modular approach that will enable more flexibility in the way our clients use our solutions.","The heart of the framework will be an open-end high-speed communication operations and resiliency layer that will allow us to more effectively introduce new functionality, including blockchain capabilities across the entire trade life-cycle for clients. It's early days yet, but we are excited about the potential this innovation will bring to capital markets, as we begin to roll it out later this fall, and the interest and conversation levels with current and potential customers has been remarkable.","Likewise, in our Corporate Solutions business, we continue to accelerate the rate of innovation and new solutions we're putting onto the platform. For example, we continue to enhance IR Insight, even as we dedicate significant resources to the migration of thousands of users onto the platform.","In June, we announced the addition to the platform of IR analytics, which will provide clients with dynamic and rich data dashboards to help them analyze large amounts of data from multiple sources and make better decisions about how they allocate finite valuable resources to pursue their objectives.","In addition, we also introduced Nasdaq Influencers to our PR and communications suite, where we are empowering communications and marketing clients around the world to tap into an increasingly important network of thought leaders.","These are just a few examples of the types of ongoing innovation occurring at Nasdaq. In addition to proofs of concepts, we continue to develop to better leverage new technologies like machine learning and blockchain to improve our clients' workflow and alleviate business complexity.","In closing, I am proud of the team and the results we delivered this quarter. It is certainly indicative of our strong ability to execute against a variety of backdrops, while continuing to meet our clients' need. Perhaps though what is most exciting for me is the level and intensity of innovation occurring throughout this organization.","As I've stated before, I do not judge our business on backward-looking financial results, but forward-looking measures such as how are we meeting our clients' needs and how is our relative competitiveness. In both of these most important measures, it has been our most outstanding quarter. We look forward to the second half of the year and hope to execute just as strong for both our clients and shareholders as we did for the first half of the year.","Before I turn the call over to Ron Hassen, I want to introduce everyone to our new Chief Financial Officer, Michael Ptasznik. We are very excited to have him join the team with over 20 years of experience. We certainly look forward to working with him and benefiting from his extensive experience on both the financial and operational sites.","This is a particularly busy time in our company's evolution. We know Michael is a great asset for the team and you will enjoy getting to know him and working with him. Welcome, Michael. I also want to thank Ron for his dedication and guiding us through this transition, as well as working and serving as our Corporate Controller over my entire tenure at Nasdaq. His contributions have been immeasurable. He will be missed.","Now I turn the call over to Ron Hassen one last time to review the financial details.","Ronald Hassen - Finance Controller & Senior Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer, NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.","My commentary will focus on our non-GAAP results. Later in my prepared remarks I will discuss the period's differences between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.","I will start by reviewing the second quarter revenue performance relative to prior-year quarter, as shown on page 4 of the presentation. The 8% or $41 million increase in reported net revenue of $559 million consisted of organic growth in Market Services net revenues of $1 million or 1%, resulting principally from higher Access fee revenues.","Organic growth in non-trading Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Service segments totaled $13 million or 4%. In addition, there was $24 million in revenues from our recently completed acquisitions of Marketwired, Boardvantage and Nasdaq CXC. Year-over-year changes in FX rates increased revenues by $3 million.","I am now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segment. All comparisons will be to the prior-year period unless otherwise noted. Information Services, on page 6, saw a $3 million in organic growth, a $2 million increase related to NASDAQ CXC acquisition, and a $1 million increase due to the positive impact of foreign exchange.","Data Product revenues increased 8%, including organic growth in consolidated and proprietary data products revenues, as well as a growth in audit collections. Index Licensing and Services saw a $2 million decline due to lower average assets under management in the period, which was primarily due to decline in market values.","Technology Solutions, as shown on page 7, increased $28 million, reflecting a $19 million contribution from the acquisitions of Boardvantage and Marketwired, $8 million or 6% organic increase. The non-GAAP operating margin was 18%, up from 14% in the prior-year period. We continue to have confidence in reaching our medium-term objective of 20% and expect further year-over-year progress as we move forward.","Corporate Solutions revenue increased due to the impact of the two acquisitions. We continue to believe we are on a path to return to organic revenue growth in Corporate Solutions in the coming quarters.","Market Technology's revenues increased by $10 million or 17%, primarily due to increased revenues from licensing and support contracts, change requests and surveillance products. New order intake was $69 million in the second quarter and, at the period end, backlog finished at $769 million, up 9% year-over-year.","Listing Services, which is on page 8, saw a $2 million or 3% organic increase in revenues, driven primarily by increase in the number of listings. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 43% was down from 44% in the prior-year quarter.","Market Services, which is on page 9, saw a $1 million or 1% organic increase in net revenues, plus a $3 million increase due to the acquisition of Nasdaq CXC and a $1 million positive impact from foreign exchange. Non-GAAP operating income increased to 54% from 53% in the prior period.","Equity Derivatives trading and clearing net revenues increased 5%, primarily due to the higher U.S. industry trading volume and market share. Cash Equities net revenue increased 2% due to the higher industry U.S. volumes and the inclusion of revenue from Nasdaq CXC, partially offset by lower market share in both the U.S. and European markets and lower capture rate in the U.S.","Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities trading and clearing net revenues decreased by 13% from the prior-year period, principally due to the impact of NFX-related trading incentives and lower U.S. treasury revenues, partially offset by growth in European fixed income and commodity trading. Access and Broker Services revenue increased by 8%, due to an increase in customer demand across most product areas.","Before we turn to expense trends, I'd like to take a moment and give some detail around the non-GAAP adjustments this quarter. First, we had $33 million restructuring charges related to the completion of the restructuring program that began in the first quarter of 2015.","The total cost of this restructuring program was $214 million, which included $119 million related to the write-off of the OMX trade name. Excluding the write-off of the trade name, the restructuring cost was $95 million. The estimated annual savings associated with these costs are $36 million, which will result in a three-year recovery.","Second, we had $35 million in charges related to the acquisition and integration activity, and substantially all of this related to the ISE acquisition. Third, during the quarter, we received an unfavorable tax ruling, which resulted in a $27 million charge on our tax line.","Turning to page 10 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $19 million. The increase included $15 million due to our acquisitions and $4 million in organic growth. Turning to slide 12, our revised 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance has increased by $35 million from the prior guidance to reflect the expected impact of the acquisition of ISE.","Non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter increased 4% on an organic basis and 9% in total. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 46%, up 50 basis points from the prior-year period. Net interest expense was $31 million in the second quarter, an increase of $5 million versus the prior-year period, reflecting the additional interest expense from our recent bond offering.","Non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was 33.8%, within our unchanged 33% to 35% full-year guidance. Non-GAAP net income attributed to Nasdaq was $153 million or $0.91 per diluted share, compared to $143 million or $0.83 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015.","Moving on to cash flow and capital, please turn to slide 15. We repurchased $16 million in stock during the second quarter 2016. We purchased an additional $8 million in the first few days of July of 2016. Through dividends and repurchases, Nasdaq returned nearly $70 million in capital to shareholders during the second quarter of 2016. As of July 26, there is $476 million remaining on the board repurchase authorization plan.","Now, as many of you know, that the time I served as interim CFO coincided with my planned retirement from Nasdaq after serving 14 wonderful years as the Corporate Controller. And so I am probably even more excited about Mr. Ptasznik's arrival as a new CFO than the rest of the team. In addition, to welcome Michael, I wanted to thank Bob, Adena, Hans-Ole and the rest of the Nasdaq management team and the board for the opportunity to serve as the interim CFO.","To the analysts and the investors I met during this period, it was truly a pleasure talking to you about Nasdaq, a company that is positioned well to move forward to tackle its unique opportunities.","Thank you for your time. And I turn it over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Ron. As I said before, you'll be missed and your sense of humor will be impossible to replace.","Ronald Hassen - Finance Controller & Senior Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer, NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Thank you, Sir. Appreciate that.","Edward P. Ditmire - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, should we open up the queue for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","How are you doing, Rich?","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good morning, Bob.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","How are you doing?","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Pretty good, Bob. How are you?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I cannot complain.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Congrats on the record quarter. And first question is you beat, on the revenue side at least versus us, on Technology Solutions with a good portion driven by the Market Technology. And I know you've given three reasons why it did so well. I guess the question is, how much is one-time, how much can be \u2013 in that will improve the run rate going forward, whether it's the licensing fees, the change requests or \u2013 like, surveillance seems like it's an ongoing thing. So, I guess, to give us an outlook on Market Technology going forward because that was a clear feed.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll turn it over to Adena. But I do want to make it very clear, this business is really doing incredibly well across a number of different areas. So we highlighted a couple. But our competitive position as a result of our technology initiatives, our technology investments are focused on the customers, certainly starting to pay off in a major way.","Adena T. Friedman - President & Chief Operating Officer","Great. Hi, Rich. How are you?","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hi, Adena.","Adena T. Friedman - President & Chief Operating Officer","So, in terms of Market Tech, I think that there are, as we said, three factors. The Borsa Istanbul revenue recognition is an ongoing benefit that we will see. In the second quarter, it had about a $4 million positive impact. And on an ongoing basis, subject to FX, it should have somewhere in the range of $6 million of quarterly benefit to us.","I think that the second thing was the CRs and those tend to be \u2013 they can't ebb and flow quarter-over-quarter. There's some seasonality to that. It's based on change requests that our clients ask for. We got off to somewhat of a slow start to the year, but the second quarter was a great quarter for us in terms of the CR revenue. And we do tend to see that happen, and both the second quarter and the fourth quarter tend to be our strongest quarters there.","And then lastly, on SMARTS, you're right, the SMARTS trade system is a SaaS-based model. So we have about a $2 million impact there, and that would be an ongoing uplift that we can enjoy going forward as we continue to sell more of that service throughout the clients. So we're very excited about how Market Tech continues to progress.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Very helpful. And since this is Ron's last call, Ron, on the outlook for expenses, if you back out the first half, you come up with the midpoint somewhere around $330 million...","Ronald Hassen - Finance Controller & Senior Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer, NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Right.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","...in expenses per quarter. And I guess I'm trying to see what's the \u2013 we know we got the ISE, we know we got a small portion of Boardvantage in there, but to me that might be an incremental uptick of somewhere around $20 million. And you've got synergy that I would expect some of the...","Ronald Hassen - Finance Controller & Senior Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer, NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Right.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","...$52 million that you haven't realized yet.","Ronald Hassen - Finance Controller & Senior Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer, NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, you're right. ISE is in there for around $18 million. And if you normalized for Boardvantage for a full quarter, they're about $3 million. We gave you guidance also on R&D as between $35 million and $45 million. We expect to spend a large part of that in the second half. So you'll see some of that expense coming in. And then we're seeing higher activity where we have gross up in expenses and revenue from some of our Corporate Solutions businesses, which kind of make up that amount to bring you to roughly around a $330 million range.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Okay. Thanks. That's helpful, Ron. And Bob, one last quick question. Great results. And the one thing I want to ask about is on the market share. If you look at the market share in U.S. equities, it's hitting a low in July. I know it's low volatility, doesn't look like you're losing it to competitors rather than the TRF. I know you monitor it, but how do you think about that, I guess, is...","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, your point is well taken. When you see Tape C relative to A and B, we've had a greater use of the TRF there. So we don't quite understand why that is, but it is what it is today.","But I'd also say, as a general statement, our capture rate as you saw in the quarter was high. And as I've said before, we try to balance that. And I think you'll see us go forward taking a number of different actions which will probably increase market share, but still keep a robust capture but maybe not at the $0.50 level.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Understood. Understood. Thanks, and congrats again on the record quarter.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Marcus Carney - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. Hello. This is Marcus Carney standing in for Ashley Serrao.","Ronald Hassen - Finance Controller & Senior Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer, NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Okay.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","How are you doing, Marcus?","Marcus Carney - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Not bad. How are you, Bob?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I can't complain.","Marcus Carney - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Excellent. Just two quick questions. One, I was wondering if we could have an update on the IR solutions client conversions, kind of where we are in the process and how retention has fared?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Go ahead, Adena?","Adena T. Friedman - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. So we continue to be on track with the IR conversions. And in fact, I think that we've been accelerating that as we've been going through the quarter. It's been \u2013 people are receiving the product extremely well. We've built in an automated migration tool that's really helped and clients are very excited about being able to get access to the new product. So far, just want to make sure that I get the right numbers here, we've upgraded 1,600 clients to the IR Insight platform and 2800 users. So we continue to be on track to complete that through this year.","And generally, in terms of the client retention, it is a very competitive market out there, but we are seeing very good improvement both in terms of how our clients are taking the product and retaining our users, in addition to selling the products and competing against our tough competitors.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I think with respect to this business, it's important to recognize we come at it, as we talked about, as a technology company. So this is a game-changing release that we're putting out there. But we've only just begun. So there's active efforts to continue and invest in the product and that's where our skills, our abilities I think, are unmatched. And customers are starting to recognize, when you think about long-term direction, Nasdaq is providing it.","Marcus Carney - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Excellent. Thank you. And then, quickly on capital management, just wondering how you're thinking about kind of buybacks versus paying down debt? And whether you still kind of view the M&A market as frothy?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I'll say two things. One, with respect to buybacks, we're committed to do buybacks. You saw the board increase the authorization. But as I said before, we'll be opportunistic. I think, under Ron's leadership, we did a very good job in the quarter buying at the right time. So we're there, but we'll be opportunistic.","With respect to M&As, I think any time you have the interest rate environments you have here now, you have to guard against frothy valuations. And we've done that, I think, quite successfully. As I've said before, we have been shut out in a number of deals, but then after waiting for a long period of time, the four deals we've done this year, as we said, are I think fairly priced. They represent right down the bowling alley in terms of what we do today. The synergy numbers are impressive and the return to our shareholders will be equally impressive.","So those kind of deals, if they become available, we'll be in the game. If they're not and they're richly priced representing some type of asset bubble, then we're happy to lose.","Marcus Carney - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","How are you doing, Chris?","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Pretty good, Bob. Real quick question on the acquisitions you guys have done. I believe your guidance is excluding potential upside from any revenue synergies that might occur. So, as you guys are integrating these transactions, any thoughts on how material those could be and how quickly you might be able to achieve those?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I would say this, we're very comfortable increasing the number to $0.40. We believe there's an upside bias to that number for both expense and revenue, but we're not in a position to commit to that now. It's early days with all of them. But we feel optimistically inclined.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Just a quick question then unrelated to the quarter. Bob, I would really like to get your thoughts on blockchain technology in general and how big of an impact do you think this might have on the industry, and perhaps a little bit about how Nasdaq plans to capitalize on that?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so I'll give you two views. One, on the optimistic side is, the blockchain will change everything with respect to post-trade across a wide variety of asset classes across the globe in time. That will happen.","On the other side, you have to recognize that blockchain by itself, and I tie back to what Larry Ellison said back in the dot-com days is that's a feature, it's not a company. So blockchain is another method of storing data and it needs to be integrated into solutions that fit within the construct of the ecosystem we live in.","And what we announced at the Technology of the Future Conference, which I referenced in my prepared remarks, is a pure recognition of that. So we're putting the blockchain as a key part, a central part of the Nasdaq Financial Framework. But, by itself, it doesn't do anything.","So I think the deep integration of blockchain into core technologies is fundamental and we're on that mission. So we see this as a major opportunity, but we think just somebody out there trying to sell blockchain technology is not going to get that far. It has to get integrated into what happens today.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just maybe more broadly speaking on the non-transaction side, wondering if you could give us an update around the selling environment and how that's changed so far this year, given all the challenges on the financial services industry. And in particular, as you look forward, how Brexit in your opinion could change that in some of your businesses? Thanks.","Adena T. Friedman - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. Hey, Alex. So, if we start with the Market Tech business, I think that we continue to find a very receptive audience among our clients as well as new potential clients. We did sign on a new client in the first quarter. We've renewed several contracts. We've upgraded several of our contracts. That's why we had such good order intake in the second quarter.","And we continue to see very good opportunity in our core Market Tech business in addition to the SMARTS trade system, which frankly has tremendous traction, is an award-winning solution, and we continue to see a very, very robust pipeline of sales opportunities there. So I don't think Brexit is going to have an impact on either of those businesses in any meaningful way.","And then, if we turn over to Corporate Solutions, Corporate Solutions continues to have a variety, frankly, of sales environments in it because it's a wide range of products. But in terms of the need for, for instance, board portal technology and more intelligent PR distribution and intelligent solutions, that continues to be an area of very good growth for us.","In terms of the investor relations products, I would say it depends on the sector. So we continue to see weakness in the energy sector, but strength in some of the biotech and the technology sectors. And again, Brexit doesn't really have any impact on that business either. So I hope that answers your question.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Sure. Thank you. And then I guess, secondly, I think this is for Bob. I know Cash Equities isn't really that important of a business for you anymore in terms of revenue contribution. But it seems like there is some growing support within the SECs for some Access fee pilots.","So, just wondering what you think about that kind of initiative. It seems like it would actually impact a lot of the market if they really include all of the different symbols and some of the folks we've talked to think this could actually be a pretty big negative for volumes down the line. So, any thoughts, any discussions you've had from your end would be helpful. Thanks.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, the first thing I want to say is we are in love with the Cash Equities business. It's the core of what we do and we pay a lot of attention to it. So, as we get larger and do different things, it's important to recognize we will not do that unless we execute quite successfully in all our chosen businesses, and Cash Equities is really first among equals.","So, with respect to what's happening, as you recollect, we attempted of our own accord to do a basic Access fee pilot. And we picked certain stocks and we thought this was a good thing to do. Because when you think about the passage of Reg NMS and the $0.30 was picked as the limit for Access fee, that may or may not had been the right number at that point in time, but it cannot be the right number a decade later. And we have a belief that that number is too high. So we're in full support of the commission moving forward with that.","On the other side of the equation, we believe in rebates. We believe in the maker-taker model. But we also do not believe that the maker fee should be so high that it creates activity in and of itself. It should be there to provide incentive for somebody to reveal their hand first. So, to the extent we shrink the Access fee and the maker rebate declines, I think that could be a good thing for the market.","So, first and foremost, we believe that high-quality markets are good for Nasdaq and good for us, and we fully support what hopefully will happen in a faster pace with the commission. And we certainly think that, as I said before, if the market quality is better, then an organization like Nasdaq is better served.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. I guess, first question, just when we look at the updated expense guidance, just wanted to maybe get a comparable update in terms of the acquisitions that closed and some of them that closed during 2Q? Maybe like what the full run rate can be on the revenue side?","And then I guess just looking out, I know you guys aren't providing like 2017 expense guidance, but when I think about that, I think there's about $50 million of synergies that remain, I think you said over the next 18 months. And when we look at that midpoint of the expense range for this year, if we kept expenses flat going into next year, that would be like a 4% growth rate if you realize those synergies. So, just wanted to get some guidance what the core maybe expense run rate should be going forward maybe pre those synergies?","Ronald Hassen - Finance Controller & Senior Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer, NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","It's just a little too early to go. We want to see exactly what the synergies are going to look like going into 2017. But I think it's much too early to try to look out into 2017 at this point in time and to give any formal guidance.","We gave a fairly good guidance at this point, taking into consideration the synergies that we know to-date, which is roughly $10 million on an annualized basis, and gave a midpoint of roughly 12.40%. But to go beyond that would be quite difficult to go that way. And we'll give 2017 guidance, as we always have, in the fourth quarter.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then just anything on the revenue side, meaning any of the deals that closed like intra-quarter...","Ronald Hassen - Finance Controller & Senior Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer, NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","...just like a full run rate or an update there?","Ronald Hassen - Finance Controller & Senior Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer, NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","So, as you saw at Investor Day, I gave guidance on these deals as how they performed in 2015. And it's too early to talk about ISE at this point. But in terms of the other three deals, they're operating on the same pace as their 2015 revenue guidance that I gave earlier. So, not too much difference than what you saw there.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot.","Ronald Hassen - Finance Controller & Senior Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer, NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","All right.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Just want to shift back a little bit to Corporate Solutions. I think, Bob, you said in your remarks that the stage is set for better organic growth in the back half of this year. I'm just wondering what are kind of the catalysts for that. Adena talked about some of the tailwinds, headwinds that are in the business. And maybe any color on subscription sales that you guys have seen so far this year and what kind of the outlook is moving forward?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I would say this that the second quarter was very strong and that we're serving two masters in that there was a massive ramp-up in the transition to the new platform and, as Adena references, we're on schedule and I think soon will be ahead of schedule with that. And that's obviously a consumer resource and will cost money.","But at the same time, we saw a noticeable increase in our win rate versus the competitors, and that will obviously translate down the line to the growth. So the core drivers of the business look strong. And as we convert folks to the new platform, we're certainly in an ideal position to start cross-selling.","Adena, do you want to add to that?","Adena T. Friedman - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I mean I think more broadly, Chris, we've been talking about the different dynamics within Corporate Solutions all year, and I think one of the areas that we have had some headwinds is in the MMS sales, but that's been I think offset by continued growth in the board portal platform. Definitely, very strong revenues coming in on Marketwired as well as continued rollout, and definitely a pickup in sales within the IR Insight platform.","So there are lots of different dynamics there, but I think that as Bob said, we are moving towards a situation where we feel that we can hit revenue growth and we will continue to track that very carefully.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then just one quick question on market data. In the press release, you called out year-over-year growth benefited from audit collections. I know last year was a low quarter for audit collections to audit (47:45). I'm just wondering if any color in terms of magnitude this quarter, maybe how it compared sequentially with the first quarter?","Ronald Hassen - Finance Controller & Senior Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer, NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Yeah. So this quarter we had $5 million in audit revenues. Last quarter, the first-quarter, there was $4 million and the second quarter of last year was $2 million.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot.","Ronald Hassen - Finance Controller & Senior Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer, NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Thanks. Within the Tech Solutions, with the margin improvement quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year as well I guess, can you talk about the contribution from Marketwired and Boardvantage to that versus kind of the core trend potentially improving longer term?","Adena T. Friedman - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I think that the improvement in the margin was driven by the core business and primarily in Market Technology, not by Marketwired or Boardvantage. Right now is that we're having to absorb them. There are some one-time costs associated with bringing them in. And so they're not \u2013 as we achieve synergies, they will become a significant contributor and they should help us accelerate some of the path to that 20%. But, right now, they're not contributing to an increase in the margin right now.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. And then just a follow-up on the synergies. The outlook, I guess, the pace of synergy realization over the next 18 months. Do we think that's more of a 2017 event or we should see that kind of progress through this year?","Adena T. Friedman - President & Chief Operating Officer","Well, within Corporate Solutions, I would say that it's more of a 2017 event because we'll be consolidating platforms and providing our clients new benefits, and we'll be managing that through 2017.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","And then, also on the Market Services side, just with the synergies, the $40 million that's been targeted?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. There's one bump and that's when you actually move away from the platform. So we haven't locked-in on that date yet. So you'll see a decline \u2013 increase in the synergies and then an acceleration as the platform is migrated.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","How are you doing?","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Curious if you have any updated thoughts on what you might do with those U.S. stock exchange medallions you're getting from ISE?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, what I would say for today's call is the intention on the options side is to keep all the medallions active. So we'll be managing the six medallions. And it's important, and almost I expected the question, but I'll handle it here. With our options, we're definitely managing this as a portfolio. Tom will answer to Hans-Ole, Adena and myself with respect to the overall market share and we expect to pull different levers at different times between the different exchanges with the different market share results.","So we're happy with the fact that we're 40% market share this week and been in and around 40% certainly since the acquisition. I think the customer uptake has been very strong. To get to your question with respect to equities and the licenses we have there, we certainly have more than enough. We do not have an answer at this point. But we know they're assets and we want to come up with, what I would say, imaginative plans on how to monetize those assets over time.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","How are you doing?","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Go.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","So I just want to touch on the ISE deal again. So, when you announced the deal, you said there would be some sharing of synergies with clients. And I just want to revisit this. Could you provide some more clarity around your plans here, and when or if we should expect to see some impact on average capture rates in the options businesses as you realize your cost synergies?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I would say that, under Tom's leadership, we've already done some clever things with respect to pricing. It's not that noticeable on the outside but certainly appreciated by the customers. So, without those moves, I don't think we would have maintained the share we have.","And as I said before, we can be quite clever about where we allocate our pricing power. So we have the six licenses. And so we go into this recognizing we can and we have some big data analysis behind this to help us serve two masters, where we can more competitively price where it matters to our customers and probably gain some extra capture where the customers are relatively pricing sensitive.","So we feel comfortable that we are able to keep share and maintain capture. But, as I said before, if we need to, in order to make customers happy, we will sacrifice capture that has not been necessary as at this point in time.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Bond with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Bond - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. More a question on ISE, MIAX and Bats both plan to enter the complex segment and they've both been disruptors, won market share in their respective options segments in which they currently operate.","So do you guys believe there's going to be an additional pricing pressure or it'll just be a more difficult market for these exchanges to disrupt? And additionally, one of the competitive advantage of your complex book platform that will be more key at maintaining market share versus MIAX and Bats?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. So the first thing I want to do is put this in context. So we identify ourselves as a financial technology company and, as such, we recognize that whatever advantage you have today will disappear if you do not continue to innovate and move the product forward.","We have a massive lead right now in complex order flow. As we gained an appreciation of the ISE technology as the owner, we see that they are doing things that others are not right now with complex orders. But if that's all we do then we will lose share.","So, certainly, we have no intentions of staying where we are. We intend to continue to innovate within the complex order flow. I'm happy to report, under Tom's leadership, we're engaged with the customers and there's a path we can take in complex order flow that a lot of our competitors are not in a position to think about or leverage based upon the fact they don't have the presence we have in that area. So we will continue to innovate in that space and, I think, do incredibly well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Great. Thanks very much. Maybe, Bob, if you could circle back on NFX, you mentioned earlier in the presentation, if you could talk a little bit about the pricing that you've been increasing on which contracts and what the EPS drag from NFX is now and where you expect that to go in 2017?","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. All right. So I would say this, in terms of the way to think about our pricing philosophy, if you see us have double-digit market share for a reasonable period of time, then we'll look to take a pricing move. So the two contracts we have had double-digit market share. And it's important to note that we took a pricing move, and as I said, it was meaningful in that in May and June, from that pricing move we received $500,000 in gross revenue and our market share continued to increase.","We're still a fraction of what the competitors charge. So there's room to grow there. And as our share continues to grow and we deliver more value to our customers, we're going to see that. So, as different assets get to that double-digit threshold, then we will think about that.","It's also important to note that we're adding new instruments to the platform and I think we're very excited about that. There was a bit of publicity on that just the other day. So, that's going to continue to go forward.","With respect to the drag on the second quarter, Ron, that was $0.02?","Ronald Hassen - Finance Controller & Senior Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer, NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.","That was $0.02. Yep.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","$0.02 for the quarter. And so, one of the best investments we could make. So, clearly, as we have more instruments at double-digit market share and we're charging, then that burn rate will decline.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Warren Gardiner with Evercore. Your line is open.","Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks, guys. So, with the new IR Insight rollout kind of moving along and the addition of Marketwired and Boardvantage, I was just wondering if you guys can give us some thoughts on how to think about price compare in that business going forward. And then also kind of the same questions for Market Tech as well.","Adena T. Friedman - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. Well, Corporate Solutions operates within a very competitive landscape. So we are very, very mindful of our clients and what they expect in terms of the service versus the price and the value that we provide to them. We did make some small pricing changes at the beginning of the year, as we have the right to do under our contracts. But it's not something where we could make wholesale pricing moves and not expect client reactions. So we manage that very, very carefully. And again, it is a highly competitive space.","Within Market Tech, we have longstanding relationships with our clients and long-dated contracts with our clients. And so, again, it's not something where we can make kind of changes in pricing year-over-year or anything like that, because it's just a very different kind of business. Most contracts are five years in length and some of them are three years, some are seven years, some are longer. But it's definitely \u2013 those things are all negotiated upfront and so it's not really a situation where we can make pricing moves like we can in other subscription products.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I would add then with the new products we are coming out with, we're re-imagining the support requirements in using technology to deliver a better customer experience with less manual support from Nasdaq. And that represents a good lever for us with respect to margin improvement.","Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Rutschow with CLSA. Your line is open.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","How are you doing, Rob?","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Good. Thanks. I think most of my questions have been asked. Just one quick one. On Boardvantage, I think that had a high growth rate, maybe double-digits. Are you continuing to see that sort of growth rate in that segment and was that the main driver of the increase in Corporate Solutions revenue in the quarter? Thanks.","Adena T. Friedman - President & Chief Operating Officer","Well, I think that the full-quarter impact of Marketwired plus the closing of the Boardvantage deal during the quarter were the two drivers of the increase in revenue for Corporate Solutions.","But, yes, the board portal space and just the collaboration space in general tends to be a hybrid area for us. I would say that it's probably high-single digits, low-double digits is kind of the type of growth rate we've seen in those products and what Boardvantage and Directors Desk have been experiencing.","So we definitely continue to see companies moving away from paper towards electronic solutions and realizing how critical it is to have a very, very highly secured solution because of the sensitivity of the information that they're sharing either across the management team or with the board, and that is continuing to drive great demand both in private companies and public companies for these types of services.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today is a follow-up from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sameer Murukutla - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, guys. This is actually Sameer. Mike had to jump off. Just a quick follow-up on the Index business. What drove the licensees lower given that the markets and the average markets are at highs?","Adena T. Friedman - President & Chief Operating Officer","Well, actually so it depends on the index value. So, primarily, the index values did have a decline in the quarter, and based on things like Brexit and other thing that drove different indexes down.","And so, yeah, it's an average across a lot of different index products, a lot of different ETFs. So I think that it's definitely a beta much more and there really wasn't a lot of alpha headwinds. It's really just a beta headwind with large market valuations.","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's right.","Sameer Murukutla - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Ed Ditmire, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ed Ditmire","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ OMX's second quarter 2013 earnings results. On the line are Bob Greifeld, our CEO; Lee Shavel, CFO; Ed Knight, General Counsel; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A.","The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, nonpublic information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.","I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I now will turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on this call to discuss NASDAQ OMX's second quarter 2013 earnings results.","We are pleased to announce another solid quarter. Second quarter 2013 net revenues reached a record $451 million, up 8% from the prior year's non-GAAP result, and all 4 business segments showed organic revenue growth. Our non-transaction-based revenues remained near record levels at 72%, emphasizing our sound and unique business model amongst our exchange peers.","Our business is performing well and the results we delivered indicate significant progress and strong execution by this team. And in fact, this is, for me, one of the most exciting times during my tenure here at this organization. We ended the quarter with several significant achievements, which I believe are indicative of the positive growth and evolution of this franchise. We completed 2 transformative acquisitions: Thomson Reuters' IR, PR and Multimedia businesses and eSpeed, a leading platform for the trading of on-the-run benchmark U.S. treasuries.","As you all know, we strive to have accretion or demand accretion within 12 months of closing of the transaction. I'm happy to announce that in the one month we owned the Thomson Reuters' assets from May to June, we had, for the first time, accretion in that very first month. In addition, I'm happy to announce that eSpeed, we're moving the date of accretion up from 12 months to the end of this year.","In addition during the quarter, we launched NLX, a London-based futures market with a unique value proposition to compete with 2 major incumbents across a full spectrum of short and long-term interest rate derivatives, as well as other promising new initiatives like the WorkSpace, virtual data room and the German Power Initiative.","In addition, during the quarter, we raised $600 million -- EUR 600 million with very attractive rates and terms. We had our investment grade ratings affirmed, and on top of all this, as I mentioned earlier, we delivered record revenues. Again, all is coming in the last 3 months. So I would say this is truly remarkable progress, and we are now positioning this company to capture significant opportunities ahead and deliver attractive returns for our shareholders.","When we look at the drivers of our success, it really boils down to 2 key ingredients: clear strategy and quality execution. Our strategy is clear. We lever our technology, our expertise and resources to identify and develop business opportunities. We strive to achieve a #1 or #2 position through unrelenting client and competitive focus. We optimize profitability and capital returns through intense operational focus.","Our strategic objective is to continue to become a deeply embedded provider of product and services to the global market community of investors, issuers, traders, exchangers and regulators, delivering growth, stable cash flows and attractive returns to our investors. Whether it's NLX, eSpeed or Corporate Solutions, we are working to expand our offerings in ways that are important and meaningful to our clients.","Moving to the quality execution aspects of our culture, we have many great examples how we're executing this strategy with our recent acquisitions. I'll discuss some of that in greater detail later on.","As a result of our continued focus in execution, NASDAQ OMX is predominantly either the #1 or #2 player in the businesses we operate, business segments today that represent 96% of our total revenue mix. So for 96% of our revenue, we're either #1 or #2 in those chosen businesses. I would again emphasize that the management team here has done a tremendous job in executing our strategy, and the results you see is that we're competing very well in all these businesses.","In addition to expanding our set of solutions we provide, our strong and competitive standing, which I've already highlighted, our strategy continues to manifest itself in consistent financial performance. We delivered record revenues, and we have maintained a solid steady EPS level. We had a record quarter in our Index business, the strongest performance in our Listing business in several years and improvement in Equity and Derivatives volumes, as well as our capture rates.","With respect to our Index business, we achieved record revenue of $18 million and revenue growth of 13% year-on-year, largely driven by the launch of our Guotai NASDAQ-100 ETF in China, our partnership with accretive asset management on the NASDAQ BulletShares Indexes and the successful integration and contributions from our acquisition of the index business of Mergent.","In our Listing business, we are seeing an increase in IPO volume in general. We had 100 new listings year-to-date in our U.S. markets, significantly ahead of our competitor with 53 at midpoint of this year. And most importantly, for the first time since 2007, in the second quarter, we saw our issuer base actually increase. We're certainly very happy with that.","In our trading business, we're also seeing positive signs of a more favorable environment. Equity market volume continue to see modest but steady improvement. While we would still describe overall equity market trading and IPO volumes as tepid, what we're seeing is certainly indicative of a recovering economy, and continued flows into equity investments is a positive development that we will continue to monitor.","As I pointed out earlier, we completed 2 of the more transformative acquisitions in our history, and I wanted to spend a little time highlighting our progress with each. First, let me say that we're proud of the effort that went into making sure both the Thomson Reuters and eSpeed transactions closed on or ahead of schedule, and we're certainly on a strong path to bring value with these assets. Moreover, I believe the management team has a higher confidence than ever in our ability to realize shareholder value, as well as to deliver better products and services to the marketplace.","With Thomson Reuters, we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us. As a leader in the corporate solutions space, we will leverage our market position and unmatched product offering across IR, PR and multimedia platforms. And the integration and the rationalization is well underway. We have organized our talent, have set our leadership structure and unified our sales and product teams. Our focus going further is on further integration of the product sets, developing groundbreaking and exciting new products and further refinements to the operating model.","Certainly, I would say our disciplined approach to M&A enabled us to secure this asset at a fair price. And while still early days, we're pleased with the performance so far, and I mentioned previously, the transaction is already accreting to our shareholders, well ahead of the timetable we have previously set.","Similarly with eSpeed, we are very encouraged by the improved trading conditions since we announced the transaction, and we now expect eSpeed to be accretive by year end, ahead of the original 12-month projection. If you recall, we specified that we had abated thesis with respect to treasury trading volumes. And as I've mentioned during the earnings call, we said we cannot and will not predict when the fed will reduce bond buying, but we have a fundamental belief that they will and we will be a beneficiary of that action. I think in the last 3 months, more people recognized the wisdom of that point of view.","But for our part, we really need to focus on what we can control, enhancing the product offering and the competitiveness of the platform that broker-dealers are asking for, the alpha portion of our investment thesis. We have begun to execute on that alpha portion. We are hard at work on system enhancements, and product line extensions will become more profound in the coming quarters. Lastly, we've been able to finance these transactions at a lower cost than we originally anticipating -- anticipated, improving the profitability and the returns to our investors.","Moving on to NLX. This initiative underscores our commitment and continuing focus on our customers and investing in the future for us and our shareholders. We launched NLX with a more compelling and competitive model, driven by client demand for more competition and capital efficiencies with respect to trading and clearing of European long- and short-term interest rate derivatives.","The platform went live in May and, in only a few short months, has produced encouraging volumes and open interest. Over the past few days it has set a daily market share high in sterling products of over 9%, and open interest for the complete product set is at a near all-time high of over 30,000 contracts. We are expanding our customer base with 4 new participants added to the original 16 founding members, only -- we're in the process, a very active process, of bringing more participants online in the next several months.","We certainly have a fundamental belief that NLX is a value proposition for our customers as they are looking for attractive alternatives to the vertical silos that dominate the market today. There is not a single customer that says, \"I want to be part -- willingly part of a vertical silo.\" And we have certainly unique opportunities with our relationship with London clearinghouse to allow our customers to recognize and realize material capital efficiencies.","NLX is a compelling investment opportunity for NASDAQ. And this quarter, as part of the investment, we saw basically a $6.8 million increase in spending due to the launch of the product. Today, to recognize how big the opportunity, European incumbents generate about $1.5 billion in revenues from trading and clearing. And as I said previously, our goal is to get to a 10% market share in both the long and the short end of the curve, and this will obviously deliver to our shareholders a tremendous return on this investment.","In closing, we believe we're setting a new baseline in our performance, driven by a diversified portfolio of businesses. Certainly, we expect to have good and even better quarters in the months and years ahead. But fundamentally, we're pleased with the shape this organization is taking and the balanced business model we have created.","The underlying trends supporting our franchise, in particular the strengthening economy and the increased corporate confidence and the improving IPO market, are indeed encouraging for us. And while we are now entering the seasonally slower summer period, we have seen more busy $8 billion trading days in June, equity funds flows have been basically positive all year long, have a half a decade of drawdown and IPOs are up dramatically in the first half of '13 versus the same period last year.","But that said, more important than the improving macro environment is the work that we have accomplished, and in particular, what I outlined earlier, that has uniquely positioned this firm to deliver for our clients and capitalize on the opportunities we have before us. And my expectation is you will see this team and this franchise achieve even greater things to come.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Shavel","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. The following comments will focus on our non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaqomx.com.","I'll start by reviewing our second quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter. Net revenues increased $35 million to a record $451 million. Contributing to this increase was a $30 million or 10% increase in subscription and recurring revenue, with contribution from both acquisitions and organic growth. Subscription and recurring revenue now represents 72% of our total revenues. Transaction-driven revenues rose $5 million on higher derivative and European equity revenues, partially offset by lower U.S. equity revenues. On an organic basis, for constant currency and excluding acquisitions, net exchange revenues rose $3 million or 1%.","I'm now going to go over some highlights along the lines of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Prior periods have been restated for comparability to our 2013 re-segmentation.","In Information Services, which includes our Market Data and Index businesses, revenues increased by $2 million or 2% to $108 million and operating profit by $1 million or 1% to $79 million. Operating margin fell 1% to 73% from 74% in the prior year. Market Data had unchanged revenues as growth in new product sales, in particular, NASDAQ Basic, select pricing actions, such as an increase for level 2 quotes, and mutual fund services was offset by $2 million in lower audit fees versus the prior year period and lower industry tape plan revenues. Index Licensing and Services grew revenues 13% with a number of licensed exchange traded products up 40% to 125 and assets in these rising 59% to $68 billion.","Moving to Technology Solutions, which includes Corporate Solutions and Market Technology, revenues increased by $28 million or 42% to $95 million, mostly on the impact of the Thomson Reuters and BWise acquisitions but also on organic growth. Operating profit increased from $4 million to $7 million due to both the inclusion of Thomson Reuters and higher contribution from existing businesses.","Corporate Solutions revenue doubled, due mostly to the impact of one month of the Thomson Reuters acquisition in the second quarter and secondarily due to strong demand for leading products like Directors Desk, where 234 clients were added, IR desktop tools and press release services, which saw a 12% higher volume. Market Technology revenues grew 13% with order intake of $44 million, a significant rebound from the first quarter '13 period but well under a particularly strong second quarter of 2012.","A significant business win was announced in early July with Borsa Istanbul. The backlog at $507 million fell $15 million compared to last quarter as significant levels of deliveries occurred. I note here on our Technology Solutions operating margins, while we showed improvement from the last quarter and last year, we note that we're still early on in terms of enjoying the benefits of scale with Thomson Reuters, which was only one -- included one month in the second quarter. We have only begun to barely realize the $35 million in cost synergies related to that deal, and we continue to work to make the recent acquisitions of BWise and Glide more profitable.","Moving to Market Services, which includes our Derivatives and Equity trading of both in the U.S. and in Europe, as well as the associated Access and Broker Services, we saw a $2 million or 1% increase in revenues to $190 million, with growth in U.S. and European Derivatives, as well as European Equities, partially offset by lower U.S. Equities. Operating profit declined $5 million or 6% to $75 million, and operating margin of 39% was 3% lower than the prior year, largely due to the impact of NLX.","Net derivatives trading revenues rose 9% as both U.S. and European segments grew. Higher U.S. revenues were due to better industry volume and market share, partially offset by a slight decline in average capture, while European derivative growth was primarily due to higher equity-related futures and options and energy commodity volumes.","Net equities trading revenues fell 2% as European equity revenue growth -- grew 16%, a product of higher capture industry volume and market share, was more than offset by a 12% decline in U.S. equities on lower industry volumes and market share, mitigated by higher capture.","In Access and Broker Services, revenues fell $3 million or 5% to $63 million, due largely due to muted demand for ports and co-location, partially offset by growth in newer products like Microwave, where we now have 17 firms as customers, many with multiple routes, and FinQloud, where we now have 18 clients.","In Listing Services, which includes U.S. and European listings, we saw a $3 million or 5% increase in revenues to $58 million due to higher new listings in both the U.S. and Europe, plus the impact that rising markets have on European listing fees. Operating profit increased $1 million or 5% to $23 million, and operating margin of 40% was unchanged from the year earlier period.","IPOs priced in the quarter doubled to 66 from 33, and our IPO win rate increased to 53% from 45% in the prior year period. NASDAQ showed continued strength in healthcare, where we won 16 to 17 IPOs in the period, including PTC Therapeutics, Portola Pharmaceuticals and Chimerix. In addition to the IPO wins, we continued our success on switches as 8 companies switched to NASDAQ, while we only lost 3.","Non-GAAP operating expenses increased by $35 million from the prior year. However, $25 million of the increase was from acquisitions, including Thomson Reuters, $5 million was an increase in GIFT spending and $4 million was due to FX. Consequently, core expenses were essentially flat to the prior year and consistent with our prior guidance.","We continue to believe strongly in the return opportunities that we are investing in with our GIFT investments and acquisitions. Recall, through the end of 2012, our return on invested capital for our GIFT projects that have either graduated or been terminated is 25%.","Second quarter 2013 saw a high watermark in terms of our expenses associated with GIFT, and the concurrent impact on earnings was higher than usual as a number of new initiatives launched and went live in the second quarter. Over the coming quarters, we expect revenues associated with these projects to increase and, thus, reduce the earnings impact of the GIFT initiatives. But also, a critical component to the program requires we continue to make tough decisions about which investments are meeting their objectives and warrant further investment and which will be reevaluated, scaled back or terminated.","Moving on to our 2013 expense guidance on Slide 20. We have incorporated the expense budgets for the Thomson Reuters acquisition which will be for 7 months of the year, and the eSpeed acquisition, which will be for 6 months of the year. Together, these should add $145 million to $160 million to our 2013 expense guidance. We have also narrowed our core expense guidance to $925 million to $940 million from the prior guidance of $922 million to $942 million previously. So our new core expense guidance is $1,070,000,000 to $1.1 billion. Our new initiatives or GIFT expense budget is unchanged at $50 million to $60 million. And so total expense guidance is from $1.12 billion to $1.16 billion for 2013.","Now since we will be integrating and operating our acquisitions as part of our core operations, we won't be distinguishing between the eSpeed and Thomson Reuters expense run rates and our other core businesses in the future. We'll just report our core new initiative and total expense forecast as we have in the past.","Non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter of 2013 was $184 million, unchanged compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 41%, down from 44% in the prior year period, primarily the result of the larger contribution from the lower-margin Corporate Solutions business, plus the increased levels of internal initiative investment, in particular NLX.","Net interest expense was $24 million in the second quarter of 2013, an increase of $2 million versus the prior year due to increased borrowings associated with our acquisitions. While we don't usually give net interest expense guidance and we don't intend to continue this in the future, in light of the unusual amount of partial quarter impacts in the second quarter of 2013, we project third quarter net interest expense in the range of $29 million to $30 million.","The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34% versus 32% for the first quarter of 2013, due to a permanent tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2013 associated with taxable foreign exchange revaluation losses, which were not reflected in pretax earnings. Going forward, we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the 34% to 36% range.","Non-GAAP net income was $105 million or $0.62 per diluted share compared to $111 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012. The $0.02 decrease reflects a $0.01 improvement in our core operating profitability, a $0.01 benefit from our share repurchase activity and $0.01 benefit from foreign exchange, offset by $0.04 of increased spending on GIFT initiatives and $0.01 higher debt costs.","Moving on to the balance sheet. On Slide 22, we are showing our debt structure and our debt maturities. Our higher debt in leverage versus the prior quarter and the year-ago quarter reflect the completion of our acquisitions of the Thomson Reuters at the end of May and eSpeed at the end of June. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 3.0x consistent with our original expectation and as we continue to expect to leverage -- leverage to return to the mid-2s range within 3 to 4 quarters. Once we return to our mid-2s target, we'll enjoy more flexibility in deploying capital, where it generates the best return.","We were very pleased to successfully complete our inaugural EUR 600 million bond offering in June to finance these transactions at a more attractive rate than we originally anticipated. And this transaction provides increased funding diversification, as we have now been able to access a new funding market, and it reduced our overall FX exposure.","So thank you for your attention, and I will now turn it back over to Ed.","Ed Ditmire","Operator, can you please open up the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Reppetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Congrats on the progress on the acquisitions with both moving up the accretion sort of targets or being accretive already, I guess, in the Thomson case. I guess my question wasn't quite clear on the driver of why the accretion was coming early. I think you said on eSpeed, it was volumes. But could you give us a little bit more in depth on why, where -- is it cost as well coming earlier? And then -- and a follow-up to that is, if the accretion for Thomson and eSpeed are coming earlier, can we move up the potential buyback and debt to EBITDA getting to 2.5? I know Lee at the end said 2 to 3 quarters again, but wouldn't it make sense for that to come earlier if these things are accretive earlier?","Robert Greifeld","Let me start with your first question. Your second question is tougher so I may let Lee answer that. I don't know. But one is I would say is we've mentioned the financing cost was less than what we had on our board model, so that helped. Two is I want to make it clear that we owned it for one month and was mildly accretive. So it wasn't a major change there, but, still, I don't think we've ever done a deal where it's accretive right out-of-the-box. So I would say it was not an expense story. In the one month, we really didn't have much expense take out. I think the revenue numbers were stronger than we had in the board model. So if you identify 2 things, it's the cost of financing and the revenue. And eSpeed, there's the world of opportunity. As I said, we've got a lot of good things going on. I'll answer the last part of the question. I think it's too early for us to say. I think right now, it's steady as we go, and we're just very happy that the acquisitions are coming strong out of that chute.","Lee Shavel","And I would just add, Rich, the kind of the range of 3 to 4 quarters after the acquisition factored in, on the aggressive side, the possibility that we would be able to potentially enjoy better performance. And -- but the bigger driver is the overall performance of the business. And we look at our operating cash flows, it's not solely going to be driven by eSpeed or Thomson Reuters but the performance of the business as a whole. And I would just offer one comment in terms of the third quarter, as you know, seasonally, that tends to be a slower quarter. And so we're expecting that our ability to deleverage really to kick in beginning in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2014 in earnest, given that dynamic.","Robert Greifeld","I think it would be safe to say that didn't delay the date when we get back to a capital return, based upon the good performance. And that's as far as we can go, right, Lee?","Lee Shavel","I think that's fair.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Understood, okay. And then one follow-up would be with the new segment disclosure, we get to see a little bit more operating margins and expenses within each segment. And you made great progress are -- in Technology Solutions. In Listing Services, it looks like expenses, if I'm getting this right, quarter-over-quarter, not year-over-year, but went up $4 million. If the revenue went up $3 million and the operating profit went down, so was there an investment in the Listing segment?","Lee Shavel","I think that probably what you're seeing, Rich, is that there were some marketing commitments associated with the Listing business that increased the expenses. It wasn't really tied into the core operating aspect of the business, but those marketing commitments that we made that increased those expenses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen of Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You seemed focused on digesting this 2 transactions and deleveraging the balance sheet. But just given your advice in the accretion timeline forward and the financing was more attractive, can you discuss the bandwidth or appetite, the opportunities that you see to take on another sizable transaction here that came to a Thomson or eSpeed, Bob?","Robert Greifeld","Yes. I would say the fact that we're getting good financial returns is not speaking to the operational work that we've yet to accomplish. So from that point of view, I think we're ahead of what I might have thought, but it's only -- it's very early days. So we've got our heads down. We've got a lot of work to do in both transactions to make sure they're truly going to deliver the value. So I don't think there's been any change in our statement there. We're going to make sure that we do the right things with these assets, they're integrated into NASDAQ OMX, they're delivering, I think, a better value proposition for our customers and also for investors. So the fact that the revenue was good, the financing cost was low is great tailwinds, but operationally, we still have a lot of work to do.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up, you delivered some Market Technology projects during the quarter, can you just talk about the quantity and types of dialogue you and the team are having with prospective clients? The discussion that you mentioned about some signs of optimism in the broader environment, is that playing through into the Market Technology business?","Robert Greifeld","I'd have to say this, that the Market Technology business, that business, it services the exchange, exchanges in the broker-dealers is probably the shining star of our businesses so far this year. And again, that doesn't get reflected in the financial statements here and now like a transaction business was. It's a long lead time once you get the commitment. We have a couple of commitments that we're not publicizing yet today. We're still in contract negotiations. And then you got a while before you install the software. But the competitiveness of our offerings is at an all-time high. It's being reflected in our major wins. We did announce Borsa Istanbul, which is truly a very significant transaction for us, but it's just in a very strong position right now. And that goes for, obviously, the SMARTS component of Market Technology, which is just experiencing rapid growth, and the core offerings we have has been just very well received by the marketplace. So we're very pleased with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to touch on the Thomson Reuters acquisition of the Corporate Solutions business there. Can you talk about the client retention that you're seeing from that and the process, I imagine over the next year or so, of probably getting folks on to your technology as opposed to the legacy Thomson Reuters technology?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I would say this that from a people and a product point of view, we've approached this as a pure meritocracy. And there's no black-and-white answer to Thomson people, NASDAQ or old NASDAQ people or technology. So it's really sorting out in a proper way, where the best of breed is waiting from a people and technology point of view. So there's no clear line I can give you with that. I would say that in our board model, we factored in a certain loss rate, and I think we're doing better than that. I think a lot of that is a credit to the old Thomson Reuters team, which is a very talented management team, and they've kept that organization in very good shape. So we feel good about the retention. Obviously, this is about having superior product come to market and being on the offense, and we're going to definitely be investing in next-generation products for both organizations. That started already, and we're doing that from a solid base. And I would say that what the -- we have the advantage of, we have a solid base of customers and we have core technology we can evolve from to deliver kind of groundbreaking products. So that's what we're doing in the quarters to come.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A follow-up on eSpeed. I assume it was a really strong quarter for volumes. Can you guys give us some sense on what revenue would have been for that platform in the second quarter if you had owned it then?","Robert Greifeld","I cannot. We haven't thought about it that way. Obviously, we closed at the end of the quarter. I think the June volumes, as you know, were strong. We paid attention, but not that much since we didn't own it. We're in a slower period in the summer. But as I said in my comments, I think more people now understand what we said during the earnings call that fed bond buying, at some point, will reduce and that should have a positive impact. I mean, the fact we had a couple of great days in June illustrate the point.","Lee Shavel","Yes. And I would just say, Chris, that the kind of the run rate of about up $100 million for kind of the 2012 level is something we continue to expect going forward.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I guess my follow would be a question on the buybacks. I know you guys wanted -- want to kind of consider reengaging when we get down to this 2.5x leverage target. Are the rating agencies kind of signed off on that, or do you need to get leverage down to that level and then revisit with the rating agencies first before being able to do anything from a buyback perspective?","Lee Shavel","Well, first, we never want to speak for the rating agencies. But when we went to the rating agencies and described our capital management plan, it was clear that our immediate priority was in bringing that leverage down quickly back into the mid-2s range, where we've operated in the past consistently. And in the past, we've obviously repurchased shares at that leverage level, and the -- we maintained our investment grade ratings level at that leverage level while returning capital to shareholders. So I think absent any change, our expectation is that we would have the flexibility to make capital allocation decisions once we're back in the mid-2s range.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just the first question on the trends you guys are seeing in the -- on the Cash Equities business. There's obviously a lot of chatter around potential changes in the market structure. And curious to hear, I guess, your thoughts on what are some of the things the industry could do, or any update you could have on that front? I know that's been asked a couple of times on prior calls, but wondering if there's any update. And then secondly, I guess volumes continue to be fairly disappointing, and it looks like your market share has slipped again over the last few months and year-to-date. Any clarity on what you think is driving that and what you can do to see some turnaround would be helpful.","Robert Greifeld","Okay. With respect to changes in market structure, I think I'm going to adopt the same statement I make with respect to fed bond buying. At a point, it will change. And for us to predict when is a little bit futile. But as I said, I think, on the prior call, we have increased confidence that the change is closer rather than further away. I would say the dialogue in the community, given the buy, the sell side and the exchanges is intensifying, and some of the dialogue is obviously happening independent of direct involvement with the commission, which I think has some good aspects to it, so I think there's broad recognition from all aspects of the community that we do need to see refinements and improvements to market structure. So more optimistic than I was a year ago that something will happen, but I think it would be a mistake for me to be guessing when it will happen. But I do believe when it does happen, it would be positive for lit markets. And so we remain optimistic on that. And I also have to say, in Europe, which we don't get as much questions on but still in active discussion, we're even more optimistic that the market structure changes will, in fact, be favorable to exchanges. On the equity market share, we're looking at the numbers now. Because I don't know if you agree, but I thought you highlight the capture rate, and certainly I had improved quite well. So, Lee, we have the numbers here.","Lee Shavel","Yes. So, Alex, I think that what we see in the second quarter, we saw a -- an increase in our market share from 18.4% in the first quarter to 19.1%. And then as Bob mentioned, we saw a very material increase in our capture rate from $0.33 per 1,000 to $0.36 per 1,000. So we certainly feel as though the trend has been to the positive from the first quarter.","Robert Greifeld","Right. So we thought the second quarter was a marked improvement as compared to what was a low point in the first quarter.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I was just kind of talking on a full year-to-date basis versus last year to date but...","Robert Greifeld","Yes. We're looking quarter-to-quarter. It's more positive for us. But I mean, we are taking positive steps on the equity market, and we have a engaged management team. And I think what they have done in the quarter has been quite positive and more good things to come.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just a question on NLX. I mean, it sounds like you guys are getting a little bit of traction, but it still feels like you're some ways off from making that business profitable. At what point of time, whether it's just the passage of time or something material you need to see in the business, you say, \"Okay, if this works or if it doesn't\" and we -- you should either continue or not with that project?","Robert Greifeld","Well, your first statement was incredibly accurate. I mean, we are getting traction with NLX, and I would say that it's on pace where we thought it would be at this point in time, but it's certainly an investment for us at this point in time. What we look for is customer engagement and customer engagement which should then have a ripple effect with respect to volume through the industry. And I had the opportunity to spend some time in London a couple of weeks ago, and the level of customer engagement is incredibly high. We have the large banks that are very anxious to be involved with the product, with the service, takes them a while to move. And certainly, we've got to live through the dog days of summer, but the will is there. And we expect certainly, as we get into the autumn, to have a dramatic increase in level of participation. So to answer your question, right now, I look for customer engagement. I look for enthusiasm, a motion associated with it. And as I said during my prepared remarks, as you talk to customers, there's not a single customer that says, \"I like the vertical monopoly structure.\" And we represent for them and it could be their last good opportunity to break away from the grasp of that vertical monopoly. I mean, we're partnering with LCH on this. It represents a horizontal clearing opportunity and allows the customers to have some control of their destiny, in addition to providing great cross-margining opportunities in the future. So this is a core value proposition that can't be replicated somewhere else. The customers recognize it. They recognize it as strategic. So as much as we're always in it for the financial returns, and these will be spectacular when we get there, the first things you have to look for are nonfinancial metrics. So it's a level of customer enthusiasm at the very head end. And then you look for their engagement with respect to them hooking up to your system, doing some level of trading and then having incremental trading done as more participants join the marketplace. So, so far, I think our progress has been strong, and we certainly monitor it every day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of ISI group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just while we're on NLX, Bob, if you can talk about the long-term revenue goals you framed, the $1.5 billion sort of market pie at current rates, and you want to get to 10% share of volumes. Is that the same for your revenue goal? At 10% share, that $1.5 billion pie, obviously, would probably expand over time, given the pie would expand. But is that a goal we should be thinking about? And about -- how long do you think it'll take to get to that? And then if you also want to comment on the revenue synergies for Thomson Reuters and eSpeed coming from, say, $240 million run rate annualized at Thomson Reuters and about $100 million from eSpeed. Maybe just sort of characterize what type of revenue synergy growth we could think about for those deals over, say, 2 to 3 year or 1- to 2-year timeframe.","Robert Greifeld","Great. All right, good questions, Brian. So let me start with the first. I think the $1.5 billion, one, recognize that it includes some clearing revenue in there. So some of our competitors have a bunded -- bundled rate where we couldn't separate trading and clearing. One does it that way, the other does separate it. And where we could separate it, we only put the trading number into that. That being said, I think $1.5 billion is probably a little bit overstated. But our goal is to get to 10%, and $1.5 billion is not that dramatically overstated. Let's just call it a $1 billion-plus opportunity. You can do the math on what 10% of that is better than I can. And I certainly believe that number of 10% would have to be achieved sometime in the 2014 timeframe, and it could be the latter part. But this effort, as we get into beginning of '14, if we believe how the progress should go, should accelerate, so we'd look for that. With respect to the revenue opportunities, with the Thomson Reuters coming together with old NASDAQ Corporate Solutions, it's important to recognize, in the software and services business, you are somewhat just limited by your imagination with respect to the product and services you can bring to your customers. The market that we're -- we can possibly address, from a market sizing point of view, is quite large. We have to make sure that we're pinpointing our efforts and certainly directing our development dollars in the right perspective. So this will be a long-term story, but it should have notable progress every step of the way as we introduce product and services. And first and foremost, as I said as we announced the deal, we have this massive customer base, 10,000 customers, where the vast majority of them have 1 or 2 relationships with us. And we will be having to market, call it, 8 different products, so we just have tremendous cross-selling opportunity in that channel. So that will be the near term -- near-to medium-term focus. And as that's working its way through, we'll be spending dollars in exciting new products, which has started already, and we'll start leveraging the channel with these new products in the medium and the longer term. So just a lot of good things we can do with that. On eSpeed, from the revenue point of view, we certainly want to gain some share. We think as we make system level improvements to the eSpeed platform, we have the opportunity to do that as we make the interfaces into eSpeed something more hospitable to our traditional customers, meaning things such as ITCH and OUCH and eSpeed put FIX in just before the deal was closed, which is a very positive thing. So we'll be doing that in the short to medium term. But in addition, there is some low-hanging fruit with respect to different product and services we can get to, primarily in the treasury market so -- market itself, and the plans are very active to do that. Obviously, none of that's gone live. We just closed the deal at the end of last month. But that's what you'll see us doing in the next couple of quarters, new products related to the treasury marketplace.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. Looking forward to hearing the progress on those quarter by quarter. Just lastly, on high-frequency trading. We've seen just the market Cash Equities volumes in the U.S. in July here be a little soft relative to what you would think for, at least, an earning season, recognizing there are summer -- some summer seasonality. But, Bob, what's your perception of the high-frequency pace of volume? Do you see that dialing back in July so far from even a June and May pace? And then is that a -- if we see lower volumes, would you have a positive revenue capture impact on that?","Robert Greifeld","Yes. One is I don't know the exact percent of high-frequency volume in the last number of days. But I would say that as a percent of the market has declined over the last 4 quarters, and we don't see anything to change that trend line unless we see, I think, changes in the VIX, so I think that volume will mirror the VIX in some fundamental way. So that's what we have. I forget the second part of your question.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just with lower high-frequency share within your volume mix, does that help your revenue capture on U.S. Cash Equities material?","Robert Greifeld","I think you saw the revenue capture for the second quarter was significantly higher than the first quarter. A lot of that was based upon actions that we had taken, but part of it would be also supporting your thesis that with the reduction in high frequency, our capture rate does, in fact, go higher. So you saw really a 10% jump in capture quarter-on-quarter. So that was...","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First, on the expense guidance. You gave the $145 million to $160 million on Thomson and eSpeed for the rest of your -- I know predicting revenues is impossible and not something that you typically do. But can you give, just as of like the current environment, what the current run rate would be? Just so we have the same mapping on the revenue side. And then out of the GIFT expenses, the $50 million, $60 million, I'm just curious, like what's the total? Because I think that -- it sounded like that was for 2013. Just based on some of the GIFT initiatives that maybe were introduced in 2012, what's the total GIFT expenditures? And then like what percentage of those are hitting your targets versus what percentage are kind of in the category of we're going to keep a close eye over the next 12 months to make a decision whether we're going to continue with it or pull it?","Lee Shavel","All right. So, Michael, on the revenue side, we aren't going to give specific guidance. But you -- I refer back to the run rates that we disclosed at the time of the acquisitions. For Thomson Reuters, at the time of acquisition, we were looking at an LTM revenue rate of about $230 million. For eSpeed, it was approximately $100 million. As I've indicated previously in the call, we would anticipate that we continue to maintain that level in the near term. I think that's kind of the -- our current sense that our expectations are consistent with what we had at the time that we announced the transaction. Obviously, over the longer term, our expectation ambition is to improve upon that, but I think that's a good starting point. And moving to the second question, on the GIFT side, that $50 million to $60 million is the total amount of our existing GIFT portfolio. So it includes both past GIFT initiatives that were initiated in prior years, as well as initiatives that were started in 2012 and 2013. Now we do have a process where once a GIFT initiative has achieved its profitability objectives and its return objectives, then those initiatives graduate from the program and are moved back into the core business. And so we had a number of those. We had 4 of those last year that moved out of GIFT and back in. And effectively, that funding was then replaced by other new projects. But the $50 million to $60 million reflects all of our current active GIFT projects, if that answers your question.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Yes, that's helpful. And then, Bob, just on, I guess, the non-transaction areas of business that continue to increase their importance. When we look at the outlook, it just tends to be an area that's a little tougher to try to figure out what the growth opportunity is. But you mentioned, in Thomson, some of the cross-sell opportunities. When you look across -- whether it's the Corporate business, the Tech, the Listings, the Index, what do you think, in a decent capital markets environment, like the top line growth in those businesses can be over the next 2 to 5 years? And is it combination of the cross-sell and then new customer opportunity? Just trying to gauge what the potential could be in some of these newer areas that are expanding.","Robert Greifeld","Yes. The first thing I do want to say for the record is that as much as we're proud of the fact we've diversified our business and we have these businesses that have recurring models, in no way shape or form is that to be taken as a negative statement with respect to our interest and love for the transaction business, all right. We expect to have a balanced portfolio businesses going forward, and eSpeed and Thomson acquisitions, I think, reflect that spirit and that philosophy. To get to your direct question, I'm going to have a hard time giving you a direct answer to that today. But I do understand the validity of the question, and it's something that we're thinking about how we can better externally represent that. When you look at the businesses, the exciting thing is that the defined and proper market that we're going after is very large, right. The index marketplace is a very, very large market. There are established competitors and it's a growing marketplace, and we represent a change agent to that business. So we've seen steady progress with that business over the years and we're happy with that, but obviously, aspire to much more. When you look at the Thomson business, the direct question you asked, you have to understand when we say we're in the Corporate Solutions, we handle IR, PR, multimedia, these are very, very large businesses, and we just have to be properly managed, careful and thoughtful in terms of where we can and should grow. But the point for this call is that the ability to grow is very large, and it comes down to our strategic planning and our execution of how we're going to do that. But it's not like we have a $5 million or $10 million market to go after. These are markets with big zeros after them, that we think we have a position of strength to lever in the time to come. So we're excited about that. Understand the essence of your question, possibly, we can answer it better in the time to come.","Ed Ditmire","And, operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question comes from Niamh Alexander of KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So can I get you on the options, the big derivatives revenue stream there. There's been one of the competitors have been kind of running some campaigns to get you to be #1 in the market share with price pressure. You've lost a bit of share but, your fee hasn't really come off this quarter, which is impressive. So help me think about your appetite to give up more market share just to kind of keep the rate card and then keep the revenue, help me think about they pay off each other.","Robert Greifeld","Well, I think the options market -- I don't know. There is one irrational competitor in the space today that has probably 1% market share. And we have to focus on the value we're delivering to our customers. Our options team, I think, is quite clever in targeting which customers that then have ripple effects on the volume and in the marketplace. So we're very comfortable with the way we're playing our hand today. It's actually -- it's less publicity than the equity marketplace, but it's probably a deeper game of chess. And we have actions that we'll be taking in the months to come that we're very comfortable with that will protect our capture and gain back some of the share that we have. But we have the proper balance today. It's been an incredibly strong business for us. And let's not forget that we were not in this business at all not too many years ago. So we're very happy with where we are, and we're happy with the plans we have for the balance of 2013.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Have you made management changes in that business, or is it just that your kind of options -- your options traders are now kind of run most of the transaction businesses?","Robert Greifeld","Yes. I think the latter is more accurate. So Tom Wittman, who is running our options business, working for Eric Noll, now has direct responsibility for the Equity business also.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then -- just if I could, it's the last one. Cash Equities, I think we have touched on a little bit before, you got potentially new management or new executive management into one of your bigger equities lit market competitors. And they have been kind of talking about not giving away the business and maybe eliminating rebates. How do we think about NASDAQ's position there? Historically, you've been more of a leader than a follower. If so, why haven't you -- why have you not done that? I mean, what are the risks to your business if then something like that happens?","Robert Greifeld","That's a question -- I'm trying to think who that new competitor might be. But they're in the call here trying to tell me who it is. I think I know who it is. But -- so -- and as I said the last time -- I'm sure Jeff is now listening to the calls for the first time. So he obviously will be a new fresh voice in the space. And to the extent that the new voice can help move the market structure discussion along, we're fully supportive of that. I would say this, as I said in my -- I think in response to one of the questions, the level of dialogue between the market participants is very high at this point in time, and I think that there a lot of new thoughts being discussed, which I think are positive. And I would say that NASDAQ OMX, from its position, is likely to be a beneficiary of changes that happen, but we're not going to be beneficiary because we're NASDAQ OMX, but because we do run a very deep and liquid market that's transparent and where price discovery actually happens, right. So when you look at the equity marketplace today, it's certainly our data feeds, the price discovery that's happening in all market, that drives a lot of the volume in the fragmented world today. So we're comfortable with the fact that we are where price discovery happens or data feeds are the gold source for the entire industry, and that will serve us well with respect to any changes that will happen in market structure.","Operator","I'd now like to turn the conference back over to the Mr. Bob Greifeld for any closing remarks.","Robert Greifeld","I think -- I will have a closing remark or -- ed, you -- I close it then. All right. So, Ed, you don't get to speak.","I will wrap up by saying the evolution of this business continues. And any given quarter, it's interesting. But you step back and look at it from 4 quarters ago or 8 quarter or 12 quarters ago, it's remarkable. This next stage, as I said in my opening comments, is in some ways the most exciting. We have large markets that we can compete in and we can compete in very aggressively. We have also the proper investments that we're putting into our future. We're excited about that. The management team is engaged, it's strong, it's experienced, and we have a world of opportunity in front of us. And we're certainly pleased with this quarter and expect greater things to happen in the quarters to come.","All right. Thank you for your time today. And certainly, look forward to following up with whoever wants to talk to us after the call, but we appreciate your support. So thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ed Ditmire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Ed Ditmire","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ OMX's first quarter 2014 earnings results. On the line are Bob Greifeld, our CEO; Lee Shavel, CFO; Ed Knight, General Counsel; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, nonpublic information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC regulation FD.","I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I now will turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2014 results. We are pleased to report another consecutive quarter of record results, which is another proof point, validating our long-term strategic vision of leveraging our organizational and technological advantages in our core businesses into adjacent opportunities, while simultaneously maintaining a maniacal focus on executing our core mission.","Before we get to the details of our performance, I want to start by acknowledging that we understand there's a topic of interest to investors, U.S. equity market structure issues, and we will cover this topic in more detail a little further along in our remarks, and certainly answer any and all of your questions to the best of our ability during the Q&A portion of the call.","First, though, I think it is important that we provide a clear picture of the strong results we delivered in the quarter. This will serve as a proper backdrop in context for all discussions.","When we look at the course this franchise has pursued over the last decade and the transformation we have undergone, it is quite remarkable. The actions we took over the last year through our acquisitions and investments have positioned this firm for the strong results we're delivering today, our second straight quarter of record financial results. This will position us also to deliver in the quarters to come.","During the first quarter 2014, we again set new record levels in revenues of $529 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.72, the latter which rose 13% year-over-year. Even more of interest to us is the near double-digit organic revenue growth of 9%, including organic growth contribution from each of our 4 business segments, the principal driver for these record earnings.","We had an astounding 64% win rate in U.S. IPOs and a host of the largest Nordic IPO by market capitalization in 14 years. Our index groups, or AUM, in licensed ETPs crossed $100 billion for the very first time. And very importantly, our equity market share on both sides of the Atlantic saw significant increases. To me, these are positive signs that our efforts are on the right track and the chosen businesses would continue to resonate with positive momentum in the marketplace.","I want to turn to some of the business highlights that we think of are of particular interest and contributed to the record results we delivered. Our modeling approach continue to allow us to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us. When we look at the broader scope of what we do and how we do it and the value we deliver in the marketplace, it's that our businesses are rooted in advanced technology in the distribution of data and information. We have certainly excelled at innovating in this space over time.","Technology is truly the connective tissue across all our businesses, and allows us to have clients to move seamlessly across today's global capital markets. Clearly, one of the more remarkable highlights for this quarter, which is central to the value proposition, is our Market Services segment. This quarter, net revenue was up 17%, led by a strong equity market share, which rose 2% in the U.S. and 3% in the Nordics, where the material caps rate also increasing in U.S. equities.","Importantly, equity trading rose year-over-the-year for the first time since the third quarter of 2011 in both U.S. and Nordic markets. Truly outstanding. An event from which we're always happy to be the beneficiaries. It is our hope that this positive trend will continue not only for our businesses, but as further evidence that positive investor sentiment is steadily returning to the financial markets.","In Europe, the elevated IPO activity tends to help increase market share, and we continue to benefit from generally improving values of traded stocks throughout the region. Closer to home, I want to commend our U.S. equity transaction team, which, over the course of the last 9 months, have seen steadily improving market share and caps rates, which highlights our focus on strengthening the competitive standings of this franchise. As a result of these efforts, we saw a healthy 11% year-on-year increase in U.S. equity volumes and, in turn, a 39% increase in net revenues.","While the majority of our transaction revenue, over 60%, is from derivative and fixed income products, which have the strongest opportunities for us, we are encouraged by the strength the equity markets have exhibited, and they remain fundamental and core to what we do. Building on recent momentum, our Information Services segment continued to demonstrate strong performance during the quarter. Revenue rose 16% to a record $123 million, driven by both the 35% increase in our index licensing and service revenue and continued healthy growth in Market Data.","During the quarter, we brought several new index products to market, including the first ETF to be launched in the new year, the First Trust NASDAQ Rising Dividend Achiever ETF. In addition, we are certainly pleased to celebrate the 15-year anniversary of the flagship product of our index business, QQQ. Now the power share is QETF. It is remarkable to think that this product started with a little over $14 million in assets under management in its first year and, today, has over $40 billion, and is one of the most heavily traded securities and one of the largest ETFs on the planet.","Just to give you a little more perspective of leadership in this area, we are one of the -- one of 10 only index companies with license exchange traded products with over $500 million in AUM. That's truly remarkable. The innovative work we are doing today with our global index calculator and establishing benchmarks will continue to transform the index industry just as the Qs have done for the ETF industry. We are pleased with our progress, and we expect our efforts to continue to produce positive results.","Another bright spot for us, and one that bodes well for not only our business but for the broader economy and job creation, is the continued strength we're seeing in the IPO market. During the quarter, there were 73 U.S. IPOs, up from 34 in the prior year period. And let's remember, last year was a pretty good year. Our share of U.S. IPOs is 64%, well above the levels we've been seeing for the last 5 years or so. This is partially as a result of the increase in health care listings, another sector where we continue to win the majority of IPOs coming to market.","As I mentioned earlier, we also are seeing strong activity in our Nordic markets, where we recently welcomed ISS Group A\/S, the largest Nordic IPO in over 14 years measured by market cap. They raised $1.5 million in USD.","One of the core missions of this firm is always to be a partner and advocate for our customers and particularly the innovative companies who need access to capital to grow their franchises. This was certainly the driver behind the NASDAQ Private Market, NPM, a new innovative marketplace aimed at private growth companies that we launched during the quarter.","It is early days yet, and while we cannot change the world in 7 days, we are very encouraged by the robust pipeline of quality companies engaged with us, and we are very close to launching our very first liquidity program, truly an historic event.","Now we want to spend a few minutes and update you on our 2013 acquisitions, which remain key areas of focus for us as we continue to work to improve these franchises and position ourselves to deliver significant synergies in the near future.","With the Thomson Reuters IR\/PR\/MM business acquisition, we are focused on how we can improve our efficiency and effectiveness in delivering the best product and solutions for the best client experience. Specifically, we are focused on enhancing our product offerings and combining our best product and services to deliver something that no one else in the marketplace can match on an equal basis today.","We are leveraging our scale and expertise to consolidate and retire 6 legacy platforms over the next 18 months, taking our total number of platforms from 17 to 11. This will have a considerable impact on the efficiencies we deliver to our customers, and we expect to reduce our costs. We are on track to achieve $35 million in synergies, a major leg in a broader objective to hit our 20% margin target.","As I said, we have a long way to go until we are satisfied, but the progress we're making is steady and we believe the business offers tremendous value in the marketplace. We have over 10,000 potential cross-selling opportunities, and we are incredibly optimistic about this business' potential with this organization.","Now let me move to eSpeed. The sequential revenue decline in the quarter was somewhat anticipated, as revenue associated with supporting a third-party exchanges technology platform had been scheduled to phase out. That said, clearly, we are pressuring ourselves to accelerate our progress with eSpeed, and May is a pivotal month for us in this regard. May represents a culmination of the integration and transition work that was started before the close of this transaction. By the end of May, we expect to have completed all migration of the eSpeed matching engine to our data center. And, as importantly, during the latter part of May, we will commence the rollout of additional products on the eSpeed platform. The products will help our customers effectively manage their cost in a challenging fixed income environment. NASDAQ, as the new owner of this asset, is uniquely qualified to do that. We are confident of our efforts to enhance eSpeed's technology, expanding its product offering to more fully serve our clients, will improve its competitive performance in the quarters to come.","Now I'd like to spend a few moments talking about high-frequency trading and how we view this important topic as it pertains to the market structure debate that's been going on.","NASDAQ as an SRO has been awarded 3 exchange licenses by the SEC in the U.S., and we provide ourselves in providing fair and open access to our markets. This is our obligation under the law, and we are proud of our stewardship of these licenses since 1971.","One of the difficulties of this discussion is an inability to either define or measure HFT activity. We have all read the SEC definitions and many have read BlackRock's definition and categorizing constructive good H activity to destructive, bad HFT activity. We certainly recognize the need and desire to communicate to investors the extent of the HFT activity in our market and to communicate in a factual, data-driven method. The availability of proper and complete data is mandatory before we could even attempt to define this activity. We believe a primary indicator of HFT activity -- I'll get that right, is a high order to trade ratio. That data is also completely knowable. Based on news, these 2 facts for our analysis, we concentrated on high order to trade.","Now others may prefer different measures, and we are not here to criticize other definitions, but in the spirit of dealing with what we can clearly define and what can be clearly measured, we are adopting an analysis that focuses on firms that show a high degree of quotation to execution orders. In fact, within this context, you can also debate where we should draw the line. So we're going to show you several lines, 60 orders per trade all the way up to 100 orders per trade. That is our approach. Again, others may take a different approach, and we're not here to argue with them. With this as a context, we looked at the market participants' IDs. We call them MPIDs. And we look at those who are not registered market makers with NASDAQ and have order to trade ratios of at least 60:1.","So first question is, why exclude market makers? For the very good reason that under the current regulatory regime, we believe that putting capital at risk and by continuously maintaining a 2-sided market, you are, one, contributing to price discovery and helping investors by providing immediacy of execution. Now those who are not market makers who have a ratio of 60:1, 80:1 or 100:1 high order to trade will adopt the acronym HOTT, H-O-T-T.","So for these reasons, and taking into account the caveats that I stated earlier and which are mentioned in the deck, I call your attention to Slide 21 of the presentation. The numbers aggregate revenues from these products and they tend to rely on their activities in Market Data, Access Services and transaction areas.","This category of high order to trade ratio firms, HOTT, when you aggregate their revenue from our various product, constitutes approximately 1% of our global revenue. We hope you find this useful. We look forward to answering your questions during the Q&A portion. And as I said before, this approach has the advantage of being clearly defined, and we're the first ones putting a clear definition out there, and as importantly, clearly measurable. We have the data, we measured it and we know exactly that the numbers we represent tie to the definition of what we're putting in front of you.","But it's also to recognize that we say this is the revenue, and we're not saying this revenue will be impacted. And I have to say here at NASDAQ OMX, recognizing that 40% of the market trades away from the LIT markets, we certainly see significant opportunities as the market evolves for NASDAQ OMX to benefit. So we certainly look forward to the continued discussion. Markets can always get better, but as I pointed out before, you don't improve your transaction cost by 14-fold without some progress being made.","In closing, I would like to say the strength we exhibit during the quarter continues to, again, highlight the resiliency of our business model and the soundness of our strategy. While we have certainly benefited from a more positive macro and industry environment, we clearly advanced the ball down the field and increased our leadership position across all our businesses. We continue to exceed our customers' expectations with our disciplined approach and focus on creating value for our customers and shareholders.","I know, for me and this management team, it certainly is gratifying to see our business performing as strongly as they are. This is what we plan for and work toward, and so to see our efforts paying off is certainly a good fuel to push us to reach even greater heights in the quarters to come.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will go into more details on the numbers.","Lee Shavel","Thanks, Bob. The following comments will focus on our non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP and pro forma non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaqomx.com.","I will start by reviewing our first quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter, as shown on Page 3 of the presentation. Net revenues increased $111 million to a record $529 million. Contributing to this increase was an $82 million or 27% increase in subscription and recurring revenue, primarily from acquisitions, but also from material organic growth. Subscription and recurring revenue represents 72% of our total revenues.","Transaction-driven revenues rose $29 million, or 24%, due a little more than half to organic growth, with the rest coming from the inclusion of eSpeed, which closed at the end of the second quarter 2013 period. As Bob mentioned, on an organic basis, constant currency and excluding acquisitions, total company net revenues rose 9%.","I'm now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be made to prior year period unless otherwise noted. Information Services on Page 4, which includes our Market Data and Index businesses, increased revenues 16% and operating profit by 13%. Operating margin was down marginally, but remained at very high levels at 73%. Market Data had a 12% increase in revenues due to a wide range of drivers, including continued growth in NASDAQ Basic, which also had a price increase; the inclusion of eSpeed Market Data and the impact of higher equity market share; and a price change on tape revenues, partially offset by lower audit collections, which were $1 million lower than the prior year period.","Index licensing & Services grew revenues 35%, due principally to the growth in assets under management and exchange-traded products licensed to NASDAQ OMX, which rose 52%, to $94 billion, at the end of the quarter, and secondarily, the higher volumes of license derivative contracts.","Moving to Technology Solutions, as shown on Page 5, which includes Corporate Solutions and Market Technology, increased revenues by $60 million, or 80%, mostly due to the impact of the Thomson Reuters and BWise acquisitions, but also due to organic growth at both the legacy Corporate Solutions business and in Market Technology. Operating profit was $8 million, up from $3 million, and the margins saw a modest uptick to 6% from 4% last year.","Corporate Solutions revenue comparisons show the large step-up in scale due to the May 2013 Thomson Reuters acquisition, more than tripling compared to the prior year period. But it is important to note that we are still seeing solid organic growth here as well, in particular at Directors Desk, where we saw clients increase by 24% versus the prior year.","Market Technology revenues grew 4%. The order intake of $57 million was very healthy and the backlog stood at 652, just a bit under last quarter's all-time record and up 24% versus the same year -- the same period last year. Growth included contributions from both BWise and SMARTS, mitigated somewhat by lower change request revenues. As we said last quarter, we continue to expect year-over-year improvement in Technology Solutions segment margins in 2014, and continue to target a 20% margin by the end of 2015.","In Market Services on Page 6, which includes our Derivatives, Equities and Fixed Income businesses, as well as associated Access and Broker Services, we saw a 17% increase in revenues, due a little more than half from organic growth. In particular, we saw material improvements in U.S. and European equity revenues, and with the impact of the eSpeed transaction and hosting revenues. Operating profit increased 27%, and operating margin of 44% was up from 41% in the prior year period.","Net Derivatives trading and clearing rose 3%. European revenues saw a lift driven by commodities and clearing products, while net U.S. derivatives were flattish, the net of slightly higher industry volumes and modest declines in share and capture, which offset. Net Equities Trading revenues rose 29%, as we saw market share several percentage points higher in both U.S. and Europe. And our U.S. capture was up materially, and we enjoyed better industry volumes in both.","Net Fixed Income Trading revenues fell $3 million from the third quarter, due mainly to a planned reduction in revenues associated with supporting a third-party technology customer of eSpeed. We will continue to recognize about $1.5 million in revenues per quarter in 2014 from this client, and then we don't expect any revenues in 2015 and beyond from that third-party technology customer. Transaction revenues not associated with this client were unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2013 period. In Access and Broker Services, revenues rose $2 million, or 3%, to $65 million, driven primarily by pricing initiatives and new products.","And in Listing Services on Page 7, we saw a $3 million or 5% increase in revenues on higher European listing fees, which reflects higher market capitalization there, and U.S. revenues which reflected an increased issuer base and more new issue activity. Operating profit decreased $2 million, or 8%, to $22 million. And operating margin of 38% was down 6 percentage points versus the prior year period, related in part to NASDAQ Private Market related expenses.","U.S. new listings in the quarter more than doubled to 73 from 34 in the prior year period, and our IPO win rate was 64%, up from 52% for the full year 2013 and 53% in the prior year quarter, due in part to high issuer activity in health care, where NASDAQ has a dominant market share, 100% of the biotech IPOs in the first quarter listed in NASDAQ. In Europe, the new issue market has been busy as well, with NASDAQ OMX hosting the IPO of ISS Group A\/S, which, by market capitalization, is the largest new listing on the Nordic exchange in 14 years.","Turning to expenses, our non-GAAP operating expenses increased by $78 million from the prior year, with the vast majority of the increase coming from the 2 acquisitions. Organic expenses, excluding the acquisitions and assuming constant currency, rose 6% this quarter, including GIFT spending above our normal organic expense growth rates, due to higher incentive compensation costs as well as the initial temporary investment spend we're making into our acquisitions.","Non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2014 was $214 million, up $33 million or 18%, from $181 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 40%, down from 43% in the prior year period, primarily the result of a larger contribution from the lower margin Technology Solutions businesses due to the Thomson Reuters acquisition. As we achieve cost synergies related to this transaction, we expect to see Technology Solutions and overall margins increase.","Net interest expense was $28 million in the first quarter of 2014, an increase of $7 million versus the prior year, due to increased borrowings associated with our acquisitions. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2014 was 32.8%, at the low end of our 33% to 35% guidance range.","Non-GAAP net income was $125 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to $108 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2013. The $0.08 increase in our EPS reflected a $0.09 improvement in our core operating profitability, a $0.02 benefit from the acquisitions net of financing costs, partially offset by $0.01 of increased spending on GIFT initiatives and $0.02 due to a higher fully diluted share count.","Moving on to the balance sheet. On Page -- on Slide 13, we are showing our debt structure and debt maturities. Our higher debt and leverage versus the prior year reflects the completion of our acquisitions of Thomson Reuters at the end of May and eSpeed at the end of June, financed largely with debt, while both our debt and leverage declined over the period since those acquisitions, reflecting debt pay down as well as improved EBITDA.","In the first quarter, the company paid down $121 million in debt, including $95 million in repayment on the revolver and $26 million on our term loan, but changes in foreign exchange rates led to a $1 million increase in the U.S. dollar amount of foreign-denominated debt on the balance sheet, netting to a $120 million decline in total debt, compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.","Our gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage fell to 2.6x, from 2.8x last quarter, and a peak of 3x at the closing of our acquisitions in the second quarter of 2013. The de-leveraging process is on track and consistent with our original expectations, and we continue to expect leverage to return to the mid-2s range by the end of the second quarter of 2014. As we have said previously, when we have achieved our leverage target, we will have the flexibility to consider all of our capital allocation alternatives, including share repurchases.","Thanks for your time today, and I will now turn it back over to Ed.","Ed Ditmire","Operator, if you can please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ashley Serrao of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ashley N. Serrao - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question just on co-location direct data fees. I know the SEC has been looking at these practices for a while. But was curious if there was any change in customer behavior for -- or customer demand for these services since the media scrutiny intensified?","Robert Greifeld","The answer is no. We've seen the backlog remain fairly consistent, and customer activity is at a normal level.","Ashley N. Serrao - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Then on cash deployment, it looks like you're ever so close to your debt-to-EBITDA target. But in the past, you've spoken to being opportunistic should the index property come to market. But apart from that, is there anything else that makes sense or intrigues you today?","Robert Greifeld","I would say this much, that what we see in the marketplace is, from our point of view, somewhat frothy and valuations on the sellers are, I think, overdone at this point. So we're less inclined to be involved with any transactions with the current market sentiment. And I think, I'll just leave it at that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess first question will be sort of on some numbers in more detail, but the U.S. Market Data, $71 million, very strong. But I guess I'm trying to figure out if it's volatile, much higher than last quarter, but third quarter was $73 million. So I'm trying to see why this isn't more, I guess, level. It's a good issue to have because it's -- since it's up, but just trying to see the -- what's driving the increase here.","Lee Shavel","Yes, Rich, I think the components that have driven a little bit of the volatility in the Market Data line have been the audit component, which has varied from quarter-to-quarter. We recognize that we've actually been working to try to make certain that some of these audit resolutions are going to be evened out across the quarters, so I think that's the primary driver of the volatility. The other component is, of course, on the tape revenue, which may be influenced by market share fluctuations. We had, as Bob noted, strong market share in our U.S. cash equities business, which contributed to the strength within that business. But I think the primary issue is really the audit component. If we were to break out the audit-related revenues in the first quarter of this year, it was approximately a $6.6 million element, whereas in comparison to the fourth quarter of last year, it was effectively negligible. And in the first quarter of 2013, we had audit revenue of $7.9 million. So that is, I think, creating some of the noise that you're seeing.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it. And then my follow-up is a broader, I guess, more deeper question. But Bob, when we talk about market structure and you're excluding the market makers, and let's just say if we both agree that some of this behavior that's being professed to be out there, let's just assume it's in the minority. But if there were regulatory changes that did impact to try to prevent some of the, let's just say, small portion of predatory behavior, wouldn't that impact market makers as well, if they met whatever the -- again, I agree with you, the definition of high-frequency trading is still pretty gray right now, but wouldn't your market makers be impacted as well if there was some sort of regulation?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I would say 2 things. One, before I get directly to your question, it's important to recognize that I think it's broadly held that there are HFT strategies that are seen as beneficial. And I think the BlackRock report is quite constructive, and that's not just BlackRock, but many people. So even when you look at the revenue impact to us, say, at the mid case of 80:1 is $20 million to $26 million. But part of that number, and it could be a majority of that, is seen as good for the market in terms of the activity that they do. So I want to make that very clear. With respect to market making, I think, if anything, we need more market making in this marketplace, in particular as you go down the market capitalization curve. So if anything, I think you'll see strengthening of the market-making function in the years to come. The immediacy of the liquidity that they provide to investors is a valuable component of the market. So I've yet to hear anybody in any contest -- context say that market-making activity is bad for the marketplace. And I certainly stand by the thought that in the smaller and mid-tier stocks, we have to do something to encourage more market making. And that's one of the prime discussion points for JOBS 2.0, how do we bring more market making into the marketplace.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I would agree 100%, Bob. But I guess the question is, if they're -- as investors look at NASDAQ and if there is some -- any types of controls or if there is any changes, they're looking at how could that impact overall volumes, not to say that market makers aren't important across the cap spectrum and more needed, but just that it could impact volumes even for electronic market makers.","Robert Greifeld","Yes. Again, Rich, let's make clear we're talking about market making the way we are, all right? These are people who are providing a 2-sided market who always have to be on the adverse side of the investment decision, providing immediate liquidity to the marketplace and, under our rules, had to be within a certain percent of the inside market on a continuous basis, all right? So I think in any construct you talk about, nobody's going to try to restrict that activity. Why would you? The market needs that. They're exposed continuously. This is a pure market-making activity we're talking about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Katz of Citi.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I had to jump off for a moment, so apologize if you covered this, if this was already asked. But from your definition of the HOTT, what, from just an obvious perspective, might you be excluding? And then secondarily, has the dialogue with the regulators changed at all, just given the greater scrutiny following the release of the book?","Robert Greifeld","Yes. So I would say, when you look at the HOTT definition, what's in the number, which would be construed as good, it's certain activities with respect to what's traditionally known as HFT. So for example, somebody who makes directional trading bets, somebody who's doing [indiscernible] , these functions with fit into this definition that we possibly have here. And it's unlikely that any regulatory focus would be on eliminating the ability to make a directional bet in the market. So from that context, the number could be overstated. We're not representing it is, but they're in that bucket. The second side, on the other side, is what Rich hit upon, right, the market makers are not included in this bucket. And we have particularly left them out. There have strong obligations under NASDAQ OMX. They have to, as I said, maintain a 2-sided market continuously, have to be within the inside market and have to be ready to take an execution whether they really wanted or not. So that's a valid and it's a fundamental construct of the market. And let's understand that NASDAQ was founded in 1971, it was founded on market makers being the cornerstone of the growth of this market. So you've got market makers excluded on the one side. And then included in this bucket, there's a lot of activity that BlackRock and others would see, and ourselves, is good for the market, but we didn't have any way to provide greater granularity. The advantage of this HOTT approach, as I said in my prepared remarks, it's definable, it's measurable. You don't have to agree with it, but it's a clear way of trying to get away from this amorphous definition of what are we talking about here.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just what from the regulatory feedback, has anything changed?","Robert Greifeld","Oh, sorry. Yes, I mean, we're in constant conversation with the regulators. I don't want to speak for them, but I think it's in a normal state of discussion.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And again, just for my follow-up, and again, I apologize if this was already covered. Just in terms of we're that much closer now to 6 30, stock has pulled a little bit on the controversy, how are you thinking about capital management priorities as you work down the debt?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, I think it's important to recognize the whole market at NASDAQ OMX is we execute very well. We do what we say we're going to do. So when we announced the acquisitions, we said we had to, obviously, focus on delivering the value to our investors on those acquisitions. If we did that, we'll be able to delever. And if we're able to delever, then we'd be in the position to go back to a more aggressive capital return philosophy. So I'm proud to say that we've done well since we announced the deals. We're making progress. We're not quite there yet. And we're focused on the operational excellence right now. And as soon as we get to where we need to be, then we'll take that decision.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So Bob, thanks for all your color in the slide you laid out here on HOTT. Just kind of curious, when you guys looked at this, why did you decide on 60:1 as being the good metric, as opposed to some ratio lower than that? And then wondering, if you guys looked at these numbers, if you actually included the registered market makers and what would the numbers look like if that was the case?","Robert Greifeld","Yes. Well, let me start by saying we started with 100:1. And that NASDAQ, uniquely in the U.S., put in a pricing scheme that basically had a penalty for those who are above 100:1. And we looked at the regulatory actions in Europe, what was contemplated and discussed, it was always around 100:1. So we started with that. And I'd have to say, for the team who spent many hours, that was a lot of work. And then, one of the advantages of being the CEO, I said, \"Well, why don't we do it for 80:1?\" And then, we did that. And then late last week, I said, \"Why don't we do 60:1?\" And then yesterday, I said, \"Why don't we do 40:1?\" And they said, \"Well, boss, we'd love to do that, but there's no way we can get it done for this earnings call.\" So I think in the future, we might show 40:1. And like you say, it is a bit of work. And if you look at all the assumptions there, this is not an automated process, so I compliment the team for getting this amount done. So we -- on the second part of the question, with respect to market making, we haven't looked at it. I don't know if we can, and to do it is clearly definable as we are. But I do want to say, again, that in any discussion I've had with any regulator in both the U.S. and Europe, market making has never come into the conversation. We certainly see what the Volcker Rule, that market making was carved out. And if you want to use that as a model, you'll see that they recognize, in that construct, that market making was fundamental. And any discussions I've had both with Congress and with the regulators in the last 1 year to 18 months is how to improve the market-making function. And as I said, the discussion around JOBS 2.0 is how we make market making a key part of the success of the marketplace going forward. So I just don't think it's in the scope of any discussion at this point in time.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Bob, do you think a lot of the concerns people may have could be solved with just a speeding up of the SIP? And if you could think that, what do you think the impact of that would be, and would you guys be supportive of that?","Robert Greifeld","Well, it's a great question. So the first thing that's out there that's incorrect is the SIP versus the Prop Feeds, it's apples and oranges, all right? So you have to understand they provide different data to the marketplace, all right? So you can't say one replaces the other. You'd have to redefine what the SIP is at this point in time. The Prop Feeds provide entire book, right, for individual exchange. The SIP provides the top, right? And only the top for the bid or the offer. The bid could be coming from one exchange, the offer from the other, and you don't get any depth of the book there. So I'm always confused when knowledgeable people talk about the one versus the other because they are just, in fact, different. The other piece of data, which we'll talk about in more detail in the future, is the performance gap between the SIP and the Prop Feeds is remarkably small. Obviously, we'll work with the SIP committee to with respect to what information they want to put out. But if you look at the history of the SIP over the last 2 to 3 years, the focus has been on speed. We obviously, post-August, changed some of the focus to resiliency, but the entire focus was on speed of the SIP. It's also important to recognize the SIP does a different function than the Prop Feed, and the SIP has to do an aggregated -- an aggregation function. So when you compare the speed, that's also unfair. And then if I take in 5 Prop Feeds from 5 different execution venues, then I have to write the code and run the process to pull that aggregation together. So the SIP is doing that for you. So when you're talking about the raw speed of the SIP versus the raw speed of the Prop Feed, it's different. So it's different data, it's a different function, and so that's a lot more nuanced discussion than you commonly read about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just first question, just on some of the non-transaction revenue areas. I think last quarter, when the technology revenues came in really strong, you noted some of the items that drove that. I just wanted to make sure, when we look at Market Data, the Index business, both of those definitely came in stronger. And then on the flip side, I would say the listing business, despite your gaining of IPOs and the number of companies and shares that are listed, it just seems like that stalled a bit. So anyway, I just wanted to make sure on those like 3 areas, if there was anything that you would point out, either on the negative or the positive side.","Robert Greifeld","I'll just start with a -- not answering the question, but an important point. I think it's amazing that we passed $100 billion in assets under management. I mean, clearly, when you think about NASDAQ OMX, I myself don't think of us as such a large player in the space, but it's been a remarkable progress and another strong quarter for that group. With respect to the Listing business?","Lee Shavel","Yes, look, I think, actually -- I mean, the Listing business, we were really pleased with the 3% growth that we saw in that business. I think, Michael, if there were some areas that, I think, in the non-transaction side that we saw some declines, it would be in our Technology Solutions business, particularly around the Market Technology revenues, which, irrelative to the fourth quarter, it really had more to do with some accounting elements in our BWise business that contributed primarily to a $4 million reduction relative to the fourth quarter in that area, as well as a seasonal drop in change of request and advisory revenues from the fourth quarter, which were down about $7 million. But again, that's -- typically, we see strength in the fourth quarter and not so much in the first quarter. And then we had a small drop in software-as-a-service revenues of about $2 million. So I think if I were to isolate among the non-transaction revenues, where you saw some declines relative to the prior quarter, that's where they would be. But again, we saw organic growth on a year-over-year basis. And within Corporate Solutions, we were down slightly from the prior quarter by about $1 million due to the loss of or the phase-out of some of the New York Stock Exchange partnership revenue, but that was offset by strength in our public relations business, the number of press releases were up, as well as growth in Directors Desk. So that's where I would focus on in terms of looking at the non-transaction revenue trends for the quarter.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, the color on the HFT or that segment of the market, that's helpful. I think when you look at sort of the 2 items that are out there, there's: one, is the debate on market structure; and then there's the second one, which is more the legal side. And obviously, the market structure is much more quantifiable and the legal side is not. But just given that the AG has been looking into this area, maybe the FBI, like is there anything -- when you guys look at it, I mean, obviously, you can only talk about NASDAQ specifically. But in terms of subpoenas, is there anything that you would be worried about? Or is it an ongoing thing, where the market is always being investigated and there's nothing that you would say is out of the ordinary?","Robert Greifeld","All right, I'll just talk quickly on the market structure and let Ed Knight answer the legal question. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we have -- 40% of this market that trades in the dark, and that's been a discussion ongoing. It's certainly our hope that as a result of some of this controversy, there's an acceleration of efforts to bring more of that market into the lit and transparent world. And certainly, early indications are that, that will be some great opportunity for us. So we're clearly excited about that. Ed, with respect to the legal?","Edward S. Knight","I guess, what I would say -- I'll make a couple of points. One is, one of the beauties of electronic markets is the record that it's created when you trade electronically. We are a self-regulatory organization, we are constantly surveilling our markets, working with FINRA, innovating in this area. We believe in aggressive surveillance and investigation of the markets to protect investors. We support other investigators around the world in all the markets in which we are active. There's virtually no regulator or investigator that we haven't worked with at some point in time. Most of those reviews are confidential, so we have a policy of not commenting upon them, but we are for a vigorous enforcement of the law with regard to these markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I just want to follow up on a couple things. I guess, understanding that there's not a whole lot of tangible items right on the regulatory front, but one of the topics, that I would see is widely debated as well, is a potential change to the maker\/taker pricing structure, whether augmenting it slightly or considering just other options for pricing altogether. Clearly, the other big player in the space has been pretty vocal about it. What are your guys' stance on the issue? And I guess, how would that impact the business?","Robert Greifeld","Well, first, understand that many markets that we compete in, we don't have maker\/taker, in particular...","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry, just in the cash equities in the U.S., of course.","Robert Greifeld","What's that?","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just in cash equities in the U.S.","Robert Greifeld","Yes, but I'm talking about our experience on the success where markets where the maker\/taker doesn't exist. So in the Nordic market in particular equities, we don't have maker\/taker. We certainly have traders that fit the definition of HOTT, or HFT, whichever you want. And as you saw with the numbers, we've done fairly well. So from the point of view of maker\/taker, practically, we don't think it has any real impact on us. We'd have to see. Certainly, when you look at the Nordics, that's a great reference point. But we also philosophically see that there is some value to provide incentive to the person who provides the initial liquidity into the marketplace. The concept of somebody showing their hand first by putting an order into the marketplace and then giving optionality to the rest of the marketers to respond to that, the concept that, that person should be paid or incented to do that, I think, is a fair concept. So from a practical point of view, we're relatively agnostic. From a philosophical point of view, we understand there's merit to paying somebody showing their hand first.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just a follow-up, Lee, probably one for you. When I think about the pricing changes you guys have made both on the Market Data side and the Access Services side over the last quarter or 2, obviously, that's had an impact on revenues. Just trying to understand what's the appetite, I guess, of further pricing increase in both of those areas, and I guess, the capacity on the client side to handle more price improvements or price increases?","Robert Greifeld","So one, we don't think in pricing increases, we think how can we better serve our customers and, obviously, deliver more value to them. And as a result of that, we lessened their burdens. So you see the increases we have in revenue is not us just charging more, it's us delivering more value to our customers. So we continue to focus on that. We think there's certainly greater opportunity to better serve our customers in the quarters to come.","Lee Shavel","And I would just add, Bob, as an example of that, they -- what we have achieved with the NASDAQ Basic in terms of saving the industry a substantial amount of money is...","Robert Greifeld","Amazing.","Lee Shavel","Huge, and so we certainly launched the product, we wanted to get people connected to it. And so some of the price increases there, we still are saving our clients a substantial amount of money and creating value for them.","Robert Greifeld","Yes, I mentioned the products we would come out with for eSpeed at the end of May, which will, I think, affect us more in the third quarter, those will all increase revenue for us, and I think somewhat impressively. But it will represent a net cost decrease for our customers. And certainly, as I mentioned, the fixed income world has its own set of challenges. And for us to come out with products and services that reduces their overall cost footprint, I think, will be very well received.","Operator","Our next question comes from Akhil Bhatia of Rosenblatt Securities.","Akhil Bhatia","Just a quick question on eSpeed. Can you talk about the market share trends you've seen since the acquisition closed? Because I think we understand that there's a new competitor in the On-The-Run space, can you just talk about the market share trends?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, I think our market share has been relatively flat. We're gaining some momentum. We ran into a couple issues with the legacy data center, and that set back our progress, and we'd then -- we're building back up. So our margins are flat. We're not happy. We think there's opportunities. And as I'm referring to, I think our opportunities are the fact that we're going to come to market with a consolidated offering that meets their -- a greater set of their needs, across both the voice and the electronic world. So we have the unique ability to take some of the voice capability and put it into an electronic market and -- at a significantly lower cost than we have today. So I think that will then have some kind of sider ancillary benefit to our market share. The other thing not to be understated is the move to Carteret today is happening. It's happening basically in 2 weeks, and we've got a lot of customers waiting for that to happen to then further engage with us.","Akhil Bhatia","Okay. And then just a clarification. Lee, you mentioned in Market Data, you had the $6.5 million of audit in the quarter. Was that all in U.S. or was there some in Europe Market Data, too?","Lee Shavel","I think the $6.5 million refers to both U.S. and European, so it's across all of our clients.","Operator","Our last question comes from Niamh Alexander of KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","If I can go on to the market structure, too. Help me understand it, with the latency advantage and, I guess, part of the whole book thesis is this latency advantage is unfair or whatnot, and IDX is trying to eliminate it. If, for example, there was a new rule imposed to kind of have a minimum latency, would that significantly reduce your CapEx? There has been quite a lot of spend in innovation in kind of reducing the time getting to all the different markets. And I'm just wondering if that would significantly reduce your spend, your CapEx for a start and then maybe some of your running costs?","Robert Greifeld","What's the assumption you're putting after again? You're saying...","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","No, I'm just asking a question, like, if there were some minimum latency introduced, like if the SEC wanted to kind of eliminate some of this latency advantage that's supposedly predatory, HFT traders have an advantage over slower traders. So if there was some minimum time imposed, would that significantly reduce the spend to kind of -- that has been going on to reduce that latency?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I would say is this, and I'm thinking off the top of my head. From the exchange side, it probably would. But understand from the customer side, there's always going to be a race to the speed bump, right? So now there's a race to the market. If there's a speed bump up, then it's going to be a race to the speed bump. And the person who gets to the speed bump first, then has to be logically put first in that queue. So putting some type of delay in terms of how the lit markets work doesn't really change much. I mean, from our side, if they want us to have a slower system, then obviously, we can spend less money doing it. But I don't think it's material.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So for the HOTT, I guess you're saying it's not material, I'm just trying to understand, if there has been quite a lot of spend in reducing the latency, which is a whole discussion in the book about the latency. Is it really just 1% of the business? Or do you think that on the customer's side from HFT would want to continue to have you spend to make sure that they can trade faster and faster?","Robert Greifeld","Well, we certainly do spend a fair bit amount of money, and we take a lot of pride in the speed of our technology. But I would say this, the focus over the last number of years is really the elimination of the tails. The customers want to see a consistent execution experience against a range of volume outcomes. And so we do that, and we're proud of that, so we look at that very closely. We have a great engineering team. And I believe that regardless of what happens in the market as the market evolves, to have great engineering capability as a fundamental advantage of NASDAQ OMX, and we intend to keep that. So I don't see us changing our expense profile based upon any market structure changes.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, interesting. And if I could, just lastly, NASDAQ Basic, the Market Data that you advertise, that's something that's kind of -- it's almost competing with the tape data. Is that fair? And help me think about the risks and maybe your tape share or the tape data? It sounds like basic continues to gain more traction.","Robert Greifeld","Well, obviously, it does. I mean, where the value proposition is a customer can get NASDAQ Basic is not representing a complete set of data like the SIP would, but it's near enough. And it's at a significantly reduced cost. At the time of order entry, then you obviously have to go to the SIP. But if you were looking in for reference purposes, certainly in a retail environment, it's got a 90-something percent correlation to the market. So it's, as you can tell, a very effective product. And so if somebody leaves the SIP and goes to NASDAQ Basic, then that's a net positive to us.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","But I guess, the brokers have been arguing for quite a few years now. Quite a few years, the regulators said that the tape pie revenue should be reduced and they shouldn't be paying as much. I'm just wondering if there's some risk here that NASDAQ Basic, if it's too successful, those would kind of support the argument that the tape fees should start to come down?","Robert Greifeld","I haven't heard that. But certainly, as NASDAQ Basic grows, it's less revenue in the pie. But with NASDAQ Basic, we get 100% of that revenue. So it's a smaller number, but we get a larger percent of it.","Lee Shavel","And I think the important thing to understand is that we, obviously, have implemented the strategy with the expectation that this is a net positive for us, factoring that, the transition of tape revenue into NASDAQ Basic revenue.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Bob Greifeld for any closing remarks.","Robert Greifeld","Thank you. All right. So again, we're obviously very proud of this quarter. We have delivered record results. Important to note, these record results were done in the context of increased spending. You heard Lee mention GIFT spending is up. But we're proud of the fact that we're able to serve the long-term masters through our GIFT initiative and also meet the investor's needs in any given quarter. So the strategy we have put in place over the last decade is working. In many ways, it's accelerating, so we're proud of that.","With respect to our definition of HOTT, we don't expect it to end any debate of what HFT is, but this has the advantage of being measurable and definable. As you can see, the numbers are small within the context of NASDAQ OMX. I do want to repeat that within this HOTT definition, there clearly is activity that is beneficial for the market, and I think that is recognized by both the buyer side, the regulators and certainly by us. So from that point of view, those numbers are, I think, overstated.","With respect to what's not in there, it's market making, and we had a couple questions on that, but I'll repeat again, NASDAQ was founded in 1971 on a market maker foundation. It's fundamental to liquidity provision in the marketplace. If anything, I think you'll see that as a more important part of the marketplace going forward, as opposed to less important. And I do want to concentrate on the fact that we have been advocating for evolution of the markets for a number of years now. We have been somewhat frustrated by the fact that the pace has been slow. We certainly feel increased optimism that with this publicity, we can have maybe an acceleration of the evolution of the market. And with 40% of the market trading away from the lit markets, there's certainly great opportunity for us, and I know our team is excited. And we're working on a couple really exciting things now, that I think we can use to really bring volume back to LIT markets.","So a very strong quarter. We're using it as an excitement to continue to do what we do and do well. We're executing very well, so we're proud of that, and we look forward to engaging with you folks during the quarter and to the next quarterly call. So thank you for your time.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Michael Ptasznik, our CFO; John Zecca, our Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team.

Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Adena.","Adena Friedman","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on the following areas: Nasdaq's 2019 financial and business performance; the progress we've made to drive Nasdaq forward along our strategic direction; and our ambitions for 2020 and beyond.","Turning to our results. I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. We achieved $646 million in net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019, while non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.29 rose 4% compared to the fourth quarter 2018, despite a significantly lower volume and lower volatility market environment in the U.S. as compared to the same period in 2018.","Turning to full year 2019, we generated total net revenue of $2.54 billion, including 8% organic revenue growth across our non-trading businesses, tempered by a 3% decline in our trading businesses, with total organic revenue growth of 3% for the year. 2019 was another year of strong execution for Nasdaq, exceeding our longer-term revenue growth objectives in our non-trading businesses, while also exhibiting increases in efficiency hitting a multi-year high of 49% for our non-GAAP operating margin, despite an operating leverage headwind presented by moderated trading revenues.","Throughout 2019, we also continue to invest organically and inorganically to advance our offerings, guided by our strategic pivot to maximize opportunities as a technology and analytics provider, while also investing to sustain the strong competitive position of our core marketplace franchise.","We are now in our third year since the announcement of our new vision for Nasdaq. Our 2019 results illustrate how Nasdaq can deliver on our technology-led strategy and more importantly, how our disciplined client-centric focus is creating value, not just for our clients, but for all of our shareholders.","We entered 2020 with strong momentum following a great finish in 2019. We experienced an acceleration in market technology and new order intake as the year progressed. With the investment almost 40% of our new sales were to new clients and existing clients exhibited higher average spend as product usage broadened. Our ETP assets under management are at record levels and we have a very healthy new listings pipeline.","Turning to specific highlights from our businesses in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. Our market technology segment delivered 12% organic growth in the fourth quarter and 11% organic growth in 2019, as it progressed with the development and implementation of our next-gen technology platform. Our total revenue growth in 2019 was 25%, including the positive impact of the Cinnober acquisition.","New order intake totaled $204 million for the fourth quarter, while our annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, totaled $260 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year. The fourth quarter features some particularly encouraging wins. As part of our new market strategy, we recently announced that we have signed a new partnership with an Airbus subsidiary called Skytra, in which we agreed to provide the full suite of marketplace solutions to enable the air travel industry to price and manage the revenue risks associated with fluctuating ticket prices.","In our sell-side business, we signed two new Tier 1 global banks to our execution platform in the fourth quarter, bringing our total to six banks and brokers as we enter 2020. We also signed extension and expansion agreements with five existing marketplace clients in the fourth quarter, including Japan Exchange Group for derivatives trading and surveillance and FINRA for its multi-product trading and data platform services.","Next I'd like to update you on the development and deployment of our next-generation market technology product offering, the Nasdaq Financial Framework. Work on the core platform of NFF has reached advanced stages.","And while our efforts on application solutions on top of the core platform continue, we believe that both are on target in terms of our product planning schedule. As we begin 2020, other phases of this long journey become increasingly important.","For example we will focus significantly on our go-to-market approach with both our managed services and SaaS-based solutions. And we've made recent organizational changes to optimize efficient client delivery and support.","We are encouraged by the growth and momentum in the segment of our business with our sites now set up continuing to scale the business and delivering improved profitability in 2020 and 2021.","Turning to our Information Services segment, we delivered $194 million in net revenue during the fourth quarter, a 4% increase from the prior year period, bolstered by index licensing and investment data and analytics revenues.","Over the course of the full year in 2019, Information Services rose 9%, driven overwhelmingly by organic growth with both, the higher growth index and investment data and analytics businesses as well as the more mature market data businesses performing in line with their respective long-term organic growth objectives.","The fourth quarter marked an interesting milestone for Information Services. For the first time, over 50% of revenue was generated by our higher growth index and investment analytics businesses.","It's exciting to see this progress in the areas with clear secular growth opportunities, born out of our strategic pivot in action. And while quarterly figures can fluctuate, I expect this trend to continue over time.","As we move into 2020, we're making investments to ensure these growth engines have the fuel to continue performing in the long-term. For instance we're working to bring eVestment capabilities and insights to the fast expanding private market space.","Additionally our new eVestment products, Research Management and Market Lens, giving us new capabilities for our existing clientele and can provide new growth engines in 2020.","Moving to our foundational marketplace businesses, our Corporate Services segment delivered revenue of $129 million in the fourth quarter a 5% increase, boosted by particularly strong performance in our listing business and increased demand for our Investor Relations intelligence offerings. Full year organic revenue growth in Corporate Services was 3%.","For the seventh consecutive year, Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs in 2019, with a 78% U.S. win rate, welcoming 188 IPOs. We welcomed 50 IPOs in the fourth quarter alone, achieving an 82% U.S. win rate during the period.","In 2019, we listed 10 of the top 15 IPOs by dollars raised. In total, the U.S. Nasdaq IPOs raised $34.5 billion in 2019, well in excess of the dollars raised by our competitor exchange.","We are extremely pleased that our listing clients are demonstrating their trust in us, as a true partner to them, as they enter and navigate the public markets. Meanwhile, our Nordic, Baltic and First North exchanges continue to attract new companies from across Europe, adding 53 new listings including 34 IPOs in 2019.","I'm also very pleased to report that we had 16 new companies switch their corporate listings, from either the New York Stock Exchange or IEX to Nasdaq in 2019, including Exelon and the newly created ViacomCBS.","Sanofi and TCF Financial also transferred U.S. components of their listings to Nasdaq, which combined with the 60 new switches resulted in an aggregate of $230 billion in global equity market capitalization coming to Nasdaq last year.","On the private capital side, our Nasdaq private market business set a new record for annual volume in 2019, facilitating $4.8 billion in transaction value for private company liquidity programs.","Demand for our IR intelligence offering, drove growth in the Corporate Solutions sub-segment. We saw a 6% increase in the fourth quarter. I'm proud of the growing momentum in that business.","It underscores the years of under-the-hood work, by our team to focus and build solutions that best suit our clients -- our corporate clients' needs, like our new ESG offerings, expanding the ways we help them address the most acute challenges for our public issuers.","Finally, our market services business delivered net revenue of $225 million in the fourth quarter, an 8% organic decline compared to the prior year period, reflecting in large part the lower volume and volatility comparison against a very active prior year period. For the full year, the organic decline was 3%, again, due principally to moderation in industry volumes in our largest equity derivatives and cash equities products.","When I look at the factors that we have the most influence on, our competitive standing, as represented by our market share and capture trends, we deliver consistently in our lighter revenue categories, U.S. and European cash equities and equity derivatives. Our smaller FIC area continues to be a work-in-progress, where we're working to enhance our offerings to deliver the kind of performance we're looking for going forward.","In the U.S., The Nasdaq Stock Market remains the largest single venue of liquidity for traded\/listed cash equities, while in options we retained the largest combined market share from multiply-listed options, with fairly steady capture and share developments. In Europe, Nasdaq's Nordic List equity market share increased to 71% in 2019 versus 67% in 2018.","As part of our broader commitment to engaging with our clients, I would like to highlight one regulatory development. Nasdaq introduced our total markets reform agenda last April, which outlines our ideas and proposals aimed to make the capital markets more efficient for investors and combined with our revitalized efforts, also attractive to small and medium growth companies. The blueprint also highlighted our thinking around areas where we could help our clients be more effective in the market.","In that regard, we are pleased to see the SEC propose the merging of the Consolidated Tape facilities to propose -- and to propose governance changes to give customers more involvement in the SIP plans. As we review the SEC's proposal in detail through the comment period, we will focus our comments and recommendations on ensuring the best interest of the market and the goals of the plan are maintained going forward.","Switching gears, I would like to talk now about our efforts to advance our practices in corporate sustainability, both within our own operations and as we support our clients in solving complex challenges. Nasdaq launched several ESG-focused commercial offerings in 2019 to meet demand from our clients across our respective businesses.","This includes our ESG advisory program for corporate clients; the Nasdaq Sustainable Bond Network, the Nasdaq Center for Corporate Governance, as well as publishing our global ESG reporting guide. And just this past week, we announced our new ESG workflow technology to simplify the ESG reporting process for public companies.","Our offering is in response to corporates seeking to bring efficiency to a process that more often that not is plagued by data management challenges and survey fatigue. We are excited to be a strategic partner to our clients in this rapidly growing area of the market.","We're also very proud to have announced that Nasdaq achieved carbon neutrality across our business operations, changing our energy sources where possible to renewable energy and purchasing renewable energy certificates that offset the emissions impact of our office locations, data center usage, corporate travel and employee commuting. Nasdaq is also actively exploring ways to further reduce both its consumption of resources and resulting emissions.","As I've said, 2019 represented an important year in terms of progress on our strategic journey. As we continue on that path, I'd like to share our core ambitions for the next several years. First, it is to become the most trusted most successful market technology and regtech partner to trading firms, financial marketplaces and new nonfinancial markets worldwide.","Second, is to evolve as a strategic market operator and specialized analytics partner to the investment management industry across index, active and alternative management. Third, is to serve as the destination exchange and partner of companies worldwide, with unparalleled expertise across equity markets, investor relations and governance.","Fourth, to strengthen our position as a preeminent market operator in North America and Europe, by enhancing the client experience across the trading, data and connectivity aspects of our exchange complex. And fifth, to be the trusted provider of liquidity solutions for private asset classes, including private company shares, private equity funds and other traditional and digital assets.","We intend to execute against these ambitions through the combination of the incredibly talented and client-focused Nasdaq team, by understanding the clear needs of our customers as we work together and lastly, by investing in and embracing the capabilities of today's most powerful technologies, in particular, cloud and machine intelligence, notably through the deployment of the Nasdaq Financial Framework to accelerate the delivery to our clients. We look forward to updating you on our progress on these ambitions in the quarters to come.","As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying, our fourth quarter produced solid results for Nasdaq, completing a successful 2019 for our company. Moving forward into 2020, we remain relentlessly focused on advancing our strategic pivot to maximize opportunities as a technology and data analytics provider, while maintaining segment leadership in our foundational marketplace businesses in the U.S. and Europe. I remain confident we are moving Nasdaq in the right direction this year as we capitalize on the strong momentum generated in 2019.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Michael to review the financial details.","Michael Ptasznik","Thank you, Adena, and good morning everyone.","My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.","I'll start by reviewing fourth quarter revenue performance as shown on page 3 of the presentation and organic revenue growth on pages 4 and 14. The $1 million increase in reported net revenue of $646 million is a net result of 6% organic growth in the non-trading segments and a $5 million net positive impact from acquisitions and divestitures. This is largely offset by the 8% organic decline in market services as compared to last year's active Q4 and a $5 million unfavorable impact from the changes in foreign exchange rates.","I will now review quarterly highlights within each of the reporting segments. We start with Information Services, which is reflected on pages 5 and 14, saw a $7 million or 4% increase in revenue. Organic revenue growth during the period was 4%, reflecting growth in the investment, data analytics and index businesses.","Excluding investments purchase price adjustment on deferred revenues in Q4 2018, organic growth would have been 3%. For the full year of 2019, Information Services organic revenue growth was 9% or 6% excluding the investment purchase price adjustment with the growth coming primarily from non-regulated sources.","Market technology revenue as shown on pages 6 and 14, increased $22 million or 29% including organic growth of $9 million or 12%. Organic growth during the period primarily reflects an increase in change request revenues and Software as a Service surveillance revenues as well as an increase in the size and number of software delivery projects.","Annualized recurring revenue totaled $260 million, up 17% year-over-year and represented 66% of annualized fourth quarter segment revenues, down from 76% in Q3 2019 primarily due to the increase in change request and software deliveries revenues during the fourth quarter.","For the full year 2019, market technology organic revenue growth was 11% and the operating income margin totaled 16%. As previously stated, in 2020 we expect to begin to see year-over-year margin improvement in the segment as we leverage our investments in the Nasdaq Financial Framework over a larger recurring revenue base and experience the benefits of the run rate synergies achieved from the Cinnober acquisition.","Turning to Corporate Services on pages 7 and 14, revenues increased $6 million or 5% due to organic revenue growth reflecting an increase in the number of listed companies and higher revenues from our IR intelligence offerings.","Market services net revenues on pages 8 and 14, saw a $24 million or 10% decrease. Excluding the negative $3 million impact from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange, the organic revenue decrease was $21 million or 8%.","The organic decline during the period reflects decreases in cash equities, equity derivatives and FIC trading revenues, primarily due to the lower industry trading volumes compared to the particularly active Q4 2018 period.","Turning to pages 9 and 14 to review expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses increased $5 million to $335 million. While expenses came in at the high-end of our range, the year-over-year increase reflects only a 2% or $8 million organic increase.","In addition, there was a $1 million increase from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by a $4 million favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. During 2019, the company's organic expense increase totaled 2%.","Turning to slide 10, we're initiating our 2020 non-GAAP operating expense guidance range of $1.31 billion to $1.36 billion. Adjusting for foreign exchange rates, the midpoint of the expense range represents an approximate 3% organic increase year-over-year consistent with our medium-term 3% expectation.","Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the non-GAAP operating margin was 48%. During the full year 2019, the non-GAAP operating margin increased 1 percentage point to 49% versus 48% the prior year.","The increase in the full year margin reflects in part the benefits from a business model that is becoming more scalable as we evolve. We strategically pivoted to reorient our product and business portfolio towards more SaaS offerings and we continue to make investments in our technology platform that we expect to provide for even greater operating leverage in the future.","Net interest expense was $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $9 million versus the prior year due to lower debt balances and refinancing the 5.55% US$600 million denominated bond with a new 1.75% \u20ac600 million notes. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25% for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 26% for the full year 2019. The 2019 tax rate came in at the lower end of the full year guidance, primarily due to reduction in U.S. taxes associated with certain foreign-derived income.","For the full year 2020, we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be between 25.5% and 27.5%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $215 million or $1.29 per diluted share, compared to $207 million or $1.24 per diluted share in the prior year period.","Turning to capital on Slide 11. Debt decreased $91 million versus Q3 2019 primarily due to net payment of $148 million of commercial paper, partially offset by a $56 million increase in Eurobonds book value caused by the stronger euro. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.6 times unchanged from the third quarter of 2019.","During the fourth quarter of 2019, the company paid a dividend in the aggregate of $77 million. And during 2019, the company returned 505 million to the shareholders through dividends and our share repurchase program with the latter achieving objective of keeping our diluted share count flat.","With that, I thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back to the operator for the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.","Richard Repetto","Yeah. Good morning, Adena. Good morning, Mike. I guess, the first -- my question -- first question is on market structure. It seems like there's a lot of things going on and you made some comments about the SIP and the proposals at the SEC and then the recent approval of the CBOE market on close -- market close order.","So, I guess, Adena the question would be first on I guess on the SIP. What it leaves you to come up with a plan if the proposal is approved. I guess what's your response to that? Will you come up -- maybe is there going to be any -- how you're thinking about when you just follow that plan? And do you think the changes will be positive for Nasdaq?","Adena Friedman","Well, I think that as you all know the way that the SEC process works is they're putting out a proposal for rulemaking. And there actually really was a pre-proposal before the proposal for rulemaking. So that is the start of a pretty long and comprehensive process to consider changes in the governance and composition of the securities information processor plans.","And so there will be ample opportunity for us and all of our clients and peers to comment and provide recommendations to the SEC along the lines of their proposals. And I think that that will ultimately kick off most likely a multi-year process for determining the future of that part of the market structure.","And we are pretty encouraged by some of the things that they have in their proposal and other things that we certainly will have an opinion about, as we think through what is best for the markets. How do you leverage the securities information process in the right way? If you think about it, it is a regulated in our opinion kind of monopoly component to the industry. So how do you make sure that you're governing it the right way? And how do you make sure that you also are giving our clients proper choice and alternatives with proprietary products in the market?","So we have a lot to think about as we go forward. But we are pleased that the SEC is taking it on and considering it. We do think there's some elements that need to be modernized and as we had laid out in total market's proposal.","Richard Repetto","Thank you. And then my related follow-up would be -- you beat me to the punch on sort of outlining your strategy going forward after sort of implementing the strategic pivot over the last two to three years. And I guess what I'm trying to understand is it seems like the strategy -- the strategic pivot and then divesting of assets that weren't providing a good return has been well-received.","So the question is on what you outlined the five things, could you just highlight the differences -- or what would you highlight as the differences between what you've been doing for the past three years?","Adena Friedman","Well, it's a good question, Rich. I would say that the five goals that we have for the next several years are in line with the pivot that we've already established. But we're moving down the road on it. So when we first announced that we have this strategic pivot, we really focused on what do we believe are the long-term trends that our clients are managing through, and long term meaning over a period of the next 10 years when -- back in 2017 kind of what are we seeing over the next 10 years that could really impact our clients and therefore how should we be positioning ourselves. And so we're kind of three years into a long-term journey.","The ambitions that we have laid out for the next several years are not a change, but rather continuing down the road. And I think the difference is that we've continued to gain confidence in our ability to actually deliver against some of the ambitions that we have meaning to be the most trusted market tech and regtech provider to the industry we really feel that our Nasdaq Financial Framework and technology implementations, our cloud-based services, how we're delivering against SaaS now all of those things give us a lot more confidence that we can continue to expand and accelerate the business.","At the same time within our Data Analytics business, we've really gotten to know the investment management industry in a way that we didn't frankly get coming into the strategic pivot. I think eVestment has really given us a level of insight and expertise there and it allows us to continue to think through how do we expand our offerings to be even more of a strategic partner to them. So those are the kind of a couple of examples where we just feel more and more confident that we're going down the right road.","And then also having that -- I laid out five different ambitions but the fifth one being private markets, it's still very small business for us but the momentum in the private asset space in terms of liquidity solutions is really picking up. We're seeing really good feedback on the private equity fund offering as well as our core private shares offering and how we can continue to expand that. So we've elevated that up to be one of our key ambitions.","Richard Repetto","Got it. Thank you very much, Adena.","Adena Friedman","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","James Steele","Good morning. This is actually James Steele filling in for Dan.","Adena Friedman","Hi, James.","James Steele","My question is in the info services segment just on the sequential decrease in market data revenue. I think you mentioned FX is a driver of that but I was just hoping you can maybe elaborate if there's anything else that drove that sequential decrease.","Michael Ptasznik","On the sequential side one of the other key factors was a drop in the -- under reported revenue from -- unreported revenue usage. And so that was $9 million in Q3 and it was about $5 million this quarter. So that was one of the other key drivers quarter-to-quarter.","James Steele","Okay. That helps. And then my follow-up is just sticking with the same segment 400 bps decrease in operating margins sequentially. Was that $9 million also a factor there?","Michael Ptasznik","Yes, so that was a part of it. And there was also some increased investments both in infrastructure and the new initiatives that Adena referred to earlier as well as there's some timing around some of the compensation in there as well. So that was some of the key drivers on why the expenses were up higher in the quarter.","James Steele","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ari Ghosh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. ","Ari Ghosh","Hey. Good morning, everyone. ","Adena Friedman","Hello.","Ari Ghosh","So just on market tech -- this was another strong quarter even after like accounting for some seasonality. So Adena could you give us some update on the customer mix and revenue contribution that you're seeing from non-financial and maybe some of the newer markets where you're getting traction? And then just related to that too if you could give us an update on the competitive landscape in this business either from in-house client initiatives or maybe newer FinTech entrants in the space just as your TAM continues to evolve in the business?","Adena Friedman","Sure, great. So I think we look at the business in terms of how we are measuring revenue success and growth in four key areas. One is in our what we call our core marketplaces business so exchanges financial markets that's one key area of revenue and revenue opportunity. The second is in our regtech so really our smart surveillance offering and how we offer that out to the banks and brokers. The third area is in the banks and brokers in terms of selling trading solutions to them -- trading technology solutions to them. And then the fourth is in this new market space. ","And certainly still the vast majority of our revenue really comes from the first two which are our core marketplace businesses and the regtech space. And both of them had strong growth characteristics and we're renewing client contracts, expanding those client contracts and signing up new customers particularly in the post-trade area. That's where the majority of the marketplace demand is coming from in addition to continued expansion of SMARTS. But what we really tried to focus on in my remarks is the fact that, we went from having one in-place banks and broker client coming into 2019 to now having six on the exit of 2019. And those are really interesting opportunities because, they're often offer -- not in every case, but often offered either as a managed service or as a SaaS offering, so it's a new way of delivering a service. It's a more comprehensive service than just delivering the software. We're also providing hosting and surveillance for some of the clients. So, that's a really interesting area and that's definitely one of the key growth opportunities that we have.","And then the last, as you mentioned is a new market still very small. What we are focused on as we go into 2020 is the fact that, we have been expanding the number of clients in the sports, betting and gaming space. We launched two new clients in the horse racing area, both in Australia and Sweden this year. We have the football index which is in soccer or I should say European football in that space.","And then also insurance. We -- with the acquisition of Cinnober, they have a really interesting risk modeling tool that they've deployed out to insurance. So it gives us an opening into insurance and then in the transportation space as we mentioned with the Airbus partnership. So, we definitely are seeing growth opportunities there, but it's going from a very small base to something that -- where we see a growing TAM as we get more engaged in each of those industry verticals.","I would just say from a competitive perspective, this is a business I would argue that's very much a scale business, particularly in the core market tech and trading solutions business. It is a scale play and we believe that, we are the most successful scaled player in providing these comprehensive end-to-end trade life cycle solutions to the marketplace industry and also to banks and brokers.","And then on the surveillance side, there are always little niche players that are trying to come up with new things. But frankly, we've been really investing in machine intelligence in that business. We've launched the Nasdaq Data Discovery platform for surveillance. And so, we've continued to innovate to make sure we stay ahead of those niche players that are coming into the market. So, long answer, but it's a big area of opportunity for us. And the TAM is growing, as we're expanding into the banks and brokers and into the new markets.","Ari Ghosh","Very helpful. And then just a quick related follow-up on the margins in the business. Again, like following the heavy investment phase, the improvement has been solid over the last couple of quarters. Now I appreciate that this can be lumpy. But should we expect some of these margin benefits in the business to play out more in 2020 or think of more of a sustained level at a 2021 event? Again, thinking of it as a year-over-year improvement. Thanks so much.","Adena Friedman","Yes. And we do look at that from a year-over-year perspective. So, as you said, things can be a little lumpy on a quarterly basis. But on an annualized basis, we do expect to start to demonstrate that we can grow our margins along with the topline growth as we go through 2020 and -- in 2020 and 2021. So, we've been saying that all along and we do expect to deliver that.","Ari Ghosh","Great. Thank you, very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jeremy Campbell","Hey, thanks. With the Airbus and I'm going to butcher this but Skytra deal...","Adena Friedman","That's right. Skytra. You got it.","Jeremy Campbell","I was just hoping to get a little bit more detail on what that opportunity looks like. Like maybe first, what exactly air travel price derivatives might look like. And is there any way for us to think about the size of that potential market?","Adena Friedman","Sure. So, it was a really interesting -- Airbus came to us by the way. They're the ones who really came up with this really creative idea, which is, how do they create more stability of revenue for the airlines and for the travel agencies, so that -- in particular airlines feel that they can look further out into their planning cycle and they can be more confident in their revenue opportunities, so that they obviously can make larger capital investments over time including new airplanes.","So you can kind of see where the natural alignment of interest comes with Airbus being the provider of this. But they -- it really came out within a group within Airbus. They said, okay, let's go for it. Let's create a new subsidiary and launch this thing as a de novo start-up called Skytra. They are basically leveraging a lot of data. It's a vast majority of the ticket prices in terms of both tickets sold, but also actual settlement of tickets, so meaning, it's one thing to sell a ticket to a client, another thing for the client to actually get on the airplane and fly.","So they have both the -- what I'll say pre-trade pricing information from the airlines and then the post-trade execution of the tickets actually being sold and used. And they have data from certain industry sources and they are basically in index and in an index that looks at different routes so it could be a route. So it could be a route from New York to London or it could just be a route from Eastern U.S. to Europe. They can look at different routes and look at trends in pricing. And so if they have this index that allows them to create trends in pricing they can then create a future on that index. And the -- and that enables the industry to use it as a hedging tool. So airlines and travel agencies are natural users of this where they -- through broker dealers. So it is a broker-dealer professional system. They can basically hedge out their revenue risk and allow for them to have a longer-term orientation. So it's really creative. ","In terms of our involvement we are providing them the trading solution. We're providing the surveillance overlay and then there are other services that we hope that we will continue to be able to offer them as well across our trade life cycle solutions and operations. It is offered as a SaaS-based service and they are leveraging our next-gen technology. So we're really excited about that.","Jeremy Campbell","Interesting, interesting. And then just, I guess, on the follow-up and this is similar to your answer to Ari on the last question, but can you just remind us for market tech wins can you remind us of the typical ramp time line from signing to kind of P&L contribution for something either like this in non-financial markets or more traditionally like the two new sell-side execution venues you guys signed in 4Q?","Adena Friedman","Yes. So from signing so -- frankly the longest -- for trading solutions the longest time line is to get a signature on a page so from the first meeting until signing. Then from signing until we actually launch is usually -- we can usually do that in for a very simple system six months for a more comprehensive system 9 months to 12 months depending on the level of complexity of the client. And so -- and then also of course they often need to make sure that they're integrating it inside their systems as well.","So I would say nine to 12 months is a more common time from signing to production. And then in terms of post-trade systems that are much more complicated it can be anywhere from 18 months to two years to deliver a full end-to-end post-trade solution clearing and settlement into some of these larger scale clients. And we do have several of those ongoing right now.","Michael Ptasznik","But from a revenue recognition standpoint though as we start to build out the platforms in that 6 month to 9 month to 12 month period that Adena described there will be revenue recognized as we're building the platform. There will be typically a higher cost in that delivery. As we move more and more SaaS it will become lower cost going forward. But right now there is a bit of a higher cost. And then you see the more of the run rate revenues in the -- after that 12-month period or after the implementation.","Adena Friedman","And that was a change to the revenue recognition rules a few years ago. So we now recognize revenue as soon as we sign through to deployment the costs are higher between tying and deployment and then it goes into more of a service and maintenance cost base.","Jeremy Campbell","So once you get to that 6, 9, 12 -- finalized implementation level that's your full run rate for revenue and margins at that point?","Adena Friedman","Yes, the margins do improve as we go into production after we've been able to complete the development phase.","Jeremy Campbell","Perfectly. Thanks so much you guys.","Adena Friedman","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open. ","Alex Kramm","Yeah. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to stay on market tech, but want to bring it back to the numbers for a second. I mean Mike you went through kind of the growth numbers here. And I think you said the organic growth was primarily driven by the nonrecurring portion. So maybe you can also tell us how organic was on the recurring side given that's how we are supposed to measure you? And then related to that maybe just dimensionalize like how we should be thinking about the non-recurring portion because that obviously was up more than 50% this quarter. So is this going to be more balanced? Is Cinnober making it more balanced? Or as we think about the 2020 how do I think about the trajectory of those kind of like more onetime-ish items or both items?","Michael Ptasznik","Yes. So there was as you know there's typically more in the fourth quarter with respect to some of the change request and the other elements have come into play. I think if you look at the annualized recurring revenue slide you can see that the ARR went up from $255 million to $260 million in the quarter. So I think that's an indication of the type of growth you're seeing in more of the -- in the recurring revenue side of the business. And you can look at that on a regular basis to see what's happening from a recurring standpoint relative to more of the change requests et cetera.","Adena Friedman","And I wouldn't say Cinnober necessarily changes the composition of that. No. I think that we are finding that their revenue was generally consistent with the way that we look at it in terms of both the recurring and non-recurring revenue.","Alex Kramm","Okay. Fair enough. And then \u2013oh sorry.","Adena Friedman","And that's slide 19, you can kind of see the sequential quarter-over-quarter increase.","Alex Kramm","Sure. And then just coming back to Rich I think at the beginning of the call you mentioned the CBOE, I guess closing cross but then I think there was not really a question about it. So I guess coming back to it for a second. Now, that we're a little bit closer to this, I know you commented on it a couple of years ago when this was first envisioned but any updated thoughts on kind of like the addressable market there? I mean, clearly some of this pre-cross already exists in the brokerage world. So what is really the addressable market? Maybe dimensionalize a little bit more? And it would be great, if you could actually give us some of the economics that you're deriving from that maybe at risk portion of the closing option?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well, I think \u2013 first of all, we don't separately disclose kind of different components of the U.S. equities trading business. But I would say that, generally, we don't expect this to be a material change to our financials in terms of how we're going to address it. I think what we've been focusing more on Alex over the last couple of years is enhancing the functionality of the close. We've been making some changes and really working very closely with the buy side and the sell side to implement changes that really continue to make the close, as I would say as functional and as useful as possible in generating a true reflection of supply and demand at the close.","If you think about it several trillion dollars of assets under management are tied to that price. So having it be a really a comprehensive supply-and-demand price discovery event is critical. We were quite disappointed to see that the SEC ultimately approved that rule filing not from a financial perspective, but really frankly from a market perspective and investor perspective. We had issuers ride in. There were indexers who rode in. There were investors, who expressed concern and yet the SEC really didn't address a lot of their concerns in the approval order, but rather just decided that exchange competition is more important in our opinion than the quality of the closing price.","So we're pretty disappointed in that, but having said that, we've been working with our clients for the last couple of years. We expect to be able to address any concerns they have with regard to this new entrant and make sure that we continue to have a very vibrant close. And we don't see any material impact on that on our financials from that.","Alex Kramm","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point.","Chris Allen","Morning, everyone. I wanted to dig into actually the new order intake and market tech a little bit. It's obviously a very big number. I wonder if that was concentrate \u2013 if you think color in terms of the concentration in terms of not specific needs was it just one or two deals that drove that? And then just what type of deals they were just so we can think about the revenue realization.","Adena Friedman","Yeah. We had \u2013 it was -- we were very pleased with the number. We've been working on these new contracts for many months. So they just all kind of came into play in the fourth quarter. There are some significant existing clients like we mentioned in terms of the Japan Exchange Group and FINRA. Those are large scale long-term contracts that we were working on to make sure we expand and extend our agreements with those existing clients. Those are significant. The \u2013 as we mentioned the two new banks that came in as well as some of these other \u2013 and some smaller new deals that came into play in the fourth quarter all kind of came to fruition all at the same time.","So we've always said that order intake is quite lumpy. This is a particularly lumpy year, but it is actually positioning us very well into \u2013 in terms of securing our revenue growing our revenue into our existing base as well as signing up some new customers. So I don't \u2013 I mean, there were definitely more names in the fourth quarter than in prior quarters, but some of the bigger names came into play that quarter.","Chris Allen","Thanks. And just \u2013 just on the change request. I believe you mentioned in the last quarter you pulled forward $2 million to $3 million. So I mean just kind of going back to Alex\u2019s question a little bit. Is this just increasing just in overall magnitude? It seems out \u2013 a little bit outsized relative to what we've seen in the past.","Michael Ptasznik","Yeah. There were a couple of other deals that \u2013 specific requests that came through, specific transactions both on the change request and also on some of the software deliveries that were higher this quarter than we typically see in Q4. So we had both last quarter and this quarter that we continue to see the increase in that business. So you're right, there were a couple of other specific situations, where we had some additional requests being done.","Chris Allen","Thanks.","Michael Ptasznik","And since we're just \u2013 I just want to go back to Alex\u2019s question and on the recurring side I just want to make sure it's clear to Alex when I mentioned the $255 million to $260 million that was Q3 to Q4. So, that has continued to progress on the annualized recurring revenue rate. So that's -- going back to last year's $222 million that would include Cinnober, but there as Adena said, the makeup of their business would be very similar. So we are seeing the benefit as the recurring revenue continue to grow in addition to the change request that we were just talking about.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much. Good morning, folks. Maybe just go back on to the ramp-up in market technology. Adena, can you frame how many non-financial clients you have now? I know that was just a handful way back when you were starting this effort and how large that contribution is.","You mentioned the four different elements of market tech as being the fourth. Just want to get a sense of how big that is. And when you think about the new air travel price derivatives, is that something that can be rolled out do you think potentially to many carriers?","And then, as we look at the growth trajectory in this business, it was 12% in the fourth quarter. It's above your 8% to 11% guide. If you combine that with pretty good growth in the other segments, are you looking at a potential of even exceeding once again the 5% to 7% growth for the target for 2020 in recurring revenue?","Adena Friedman","So, there's a lot to unpack there. So let's start with the non-financial markets. We -- I think we're trying to do account in our heads. I would say we're probably around 15 clients today in the non-financials. But that's not an exact number. But that's kind of the range. But I mean of those, at least five to seven of them were new clients that we signed this year. So, it is definitely a growth area for us.","And as I mentioned, we signed new clients in the sports space. We signed new clients in the transportation space, and we signed other -- kind of other new clients along the way that are in non-financial markets. So -- but it's still -- as we mentioned, it's definitely a small but growing area and the TAM keeps expanding there.","In terms of our overall growth rate in market tech we are -- we still believe that the 8% to 11% is the right way to evaluate the business going forward. And we will continue to evaluate that as we do move forward. But we're very pleased to see that the growth characteristics of the business are consistent with that kind of growth rate.","And we want to make sure that we continue to deliver against that which is why we continue to invest in the business. But our -- as I mentioned before, the growth in our investment should be outweighed by the growth of the revenue. So, we should start to be able to demonstrate some margin expansion going into 2020 and 2021.","And you also mentioned overall the non-trading businesses.","Brian Bedell","Yeah.","Adena Friedman","The overall growth rate. That -- we are -- again, that 5% to 7% is what we believe is kind of the right way to look at our longer-term -- mid- to longer-term outlook. And so, we continue to believe that's the right way to evaluate our business.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Hill with Rosenblatt. Your line is now open.","Ken Hill","Great, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to touch on the ESG offering a little bit, I know this has been important for you guys for a long time, probably particularly within your European businesses a little bit more, but I was hoping you kind of flesh out a little bit more about the offering how it kind of differs from some of the competitors, particularly in the exchange base we've seen more recently and how you're sizing about -- how you're thinking about sizing for this category going forward.","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well, it is very much a nascent commercial area. And we have two areas of focus. One is on investable products, so that could either be sustainable bonds, and we have our sustainable bond market in Europe. And we're now -- we've just launched the Sustainable Bond Network in the United States with our European team who's really leading that as well and then any ETFs or ESG-related indexes. So those are kind of what I call investable products. And then the other side is really supporting our corporate clients.","So, we are different than a lot of our peers in that. We are really focusing in on how can we be the right partner to all of these companies now who have just increasing demands from investors on managing and reporting on ESG. It's a very complicated world that's helping out there. There are all these different centers, setters and metrics makers, and the companies really need our support. And so we've chosen to be the right partner to them.","In terms of encouraging them to report on ESG, it's particularly in our European markets, but also giving them tools, advice consulting services to support this growing area. And that has been a really interesting commercial area for us. So I would say you'll hear more about it going into 2020, because we are supplementing our consulting services with some technology offerings as well. But it's very small at this point I just want to say. I think it's a new area for everyone.","Ken Hill","Okay. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alex Blostein","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to touch base on capital priorities as you guys look out into 2020. So I saw you paid down a little bit of commercial paper in the fourth quarter. It feels like the leverage level is, kind of, where you want it to be. So maybe some updated thoughts around the buyback in particular as you guys are looking out in 2020? Thanks.","Michael Ptasznik","Yeah. So thanks for the question. We're going to continue on with the capital plan that we stated. And consistent with that so again look for great opportunities to invest and continue to grow the business number one priority. In addition to that we look to grow the dividend as our earnings and cash flow grow.","And then with respect to the buybacks, we are using the buybacks to offset the dilution that we would see from any of our equity programs. And then at the end of that if there is additional cash available -- from a debt standpoint you're right. We've achieved the debt leverage targets that we're targeting and so we are comfortable maintaining our investment grade status. And so if there's additional cash available after we take all those things into consideration looking at -- if there's nothing specific with -- that we are looking to invest in within the horizon then at some point we'll consider doing additional buybacks beyond that point. But that's really not a quarter-to-quarter thing. That's going to be something that we'll look at over a longer period of time, so very consistent capital filing with the way that we've articulated in the past.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Owen Lau","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Again I want to go back to the Skytra deal. I have never thought of Nasdaq -- Nasdaq can do business with an airplane manufacturer. So Adena you mentioned that Airbus reached out to Nasdaq for this partnership. But was there a competitive bidding process?","Also could you please talk about what other things Nasdaq is doing to increase the chance of inbound costs like this and how Nasdaq increased outreach to identify new markets in new industry? Thank you.","Adena Friedman","Sure. So in terms of the process that would be a question for Airbus not for Nasdaq in terms of how we ended up becoming their partner. But I think in general, we like to make sure that people know about what we're doing with companies like Airbus so that we do get more inbounds. But at the same time, we have actually been sizing up our sales organization in the new market space. It's been one of the areas of investment in market tech.","We continue to make sure that we have the right expertise that we can apply into the industries that -- where we're finding the most interest to think about a market's economy like approach. So whether that's in transportation, insurance in the sports space these are all areas where we've been investing in sales in addition to making sure our technology is relevant.","So we also have been creating modules within our technology where we can showcase our capabilities to these new non-financial markets where they need a little bit more of an education.","And then we're also looking at other partners that we can provide to make it easier and faster to deploy these technologies to the customers. So all of those are things that we're doing to expand and grow that part of the business. We love inbounds but it's very important for us to be able to surface opportunities too. So the sales effort has been definitely a ramp-up for us.","Owen Lau","That's very helpful. A related question is -- I want to go back to slide 19. I'm trying to understand the numbers a little bit better. So you mentioned that the third quarter new order intake was $62 million, 4Q was $204 million, which is like three times higher. But the ARR was, kind of, flat. How should we handicap these numbers? Should we expect the 1Q 2020, or second quarter of 2020 for ARR would be higher? What's the right way to reconcile these two numbers?","Michael Ptasznik","Yeah. So with respect to the new order intake again some of that is temporary -- or not temporary but it's within the quarter that is going to be recognized for some of that. But the ARR a good portion of that $204 million will turn into ARR on an ongoing basis. It depends somewhat on -- with respect to some of the contracts that are recognized in that $204 million with ARR -- renewals of contracts that we already have recognized.","So if we have a client that was already in the ARR and then we are renewing a contract and extending that for let's say another five-year period. Then there could be the -- if there's an increase in the amount that they'll be paying us, then that will have some reflection in the ARR.","So that will be a continuation of it. It's -- but the new contracts for the new clients that's what's going to continue to increase it. And the new order intake is not an annualized number. It is a multi-year.","So that could be a 5-year number the $204 million or depending on the size of the contract. So that reflects the total amount of the order intake for the total contract time, that's being contracted.","Adena Friedman","Yeah. I mean the way that I would look at that, also in terms of ARR, I mean we actually feel like, it's a pretty good progression of ARR from quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter, through 2019.","And Michael is right, that the $204 million the majority of that will turn into either continuation or growth of ARR. But I would say that, it's -- there's a lot of -- there's a lot that goes into the combination of the two numbers.","And we're getting used to giving out ARR. That's a new stat for us. So we'll continue to make sure we're revolving our explanations around it, so that you guys have better understanding of how to interpret that versus the order intake going forward.","Owen Lau","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Sameer Murukutla","Good morning. This is actually Sameer Murukutla on for Michael Carrier. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a question related to the expense guide. And I think you announced the divestment of NFX to EEX I think.","So when is that expected to close? And I guess how much of the benefit are you seeing from that divestment, in the 2020 expense guide? And I guess just with the R&D guide, I think that's up around 20% year-over-year. Can you provide some details on, what's flowing into R&D guidance in 2020?","Adena Friedman","Yeah. So a couple of things the first thing is, the NFX we expect that to continue to migrate over to EEX through the first quarter of 2020. And start to come out of our financials as we go in through the second quarter.","However, it was an R&D initiative. So it has been reflected in our R&D numbers. And so therefore what we're basically saying with the change -- with our R&D numbers are that we are moving the money that we are otherwise spending on NFX into some of these higher growth higher potential opportunities.","And we're really concentrating our R&D, on those things that we think have a very large total market opportunity. And have real growth potential. The reason why the investments in ARR -- I mean in R&D are increasing is because the revenues are also increasing.","So a good example of that would be banks and brokers. That's actually considered an R&D initiative, in terms of building out and supplying our trading solutions to the banks and brokers.","But we have a very significant increase in our clients, so the revenue from that business is going up. But so are the investments in that business to supply -- to support those revenues.","So the -- we're only showing you one side of the ledger, when we're showing you our cost guidance and the R&D spend. But the revenues are also increasing along the line. So the net cost of that program is around the same year-over-year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Chris Harris","Good morning. Thank you. Is strategic M&A still a priority for Nasdaq? Or do you feel like, the focus at least for 2020 will be more centered on your organic growth opportunities?","Adena Friedman","Well, we evaluate acquisitions all the time frankly. So, it's a part of what we look at. And we always -- the way that we think about acquisitions are can they accelerate our ability to achieve our strategy, in a particular segment.","So are we either expanding our client base or expanding our capabilities to support our clients in new ways within a segment, with a particular focus on technology and the data and analytics.","But frankly we also have done -- we did a small acquisition within corporate services last year. And we always look at -- we will look at acquisitions within market services as well so long as it provides the right financial framework.","So, I would say we always look at them. The environment right now is they are pretty pricy. So we are -- we're definitely really focus on, making sure we have real conviction around the financial model, in addition to obviously the strategic benefit before we make a decision to move forward with an M&A initiative.","And that has definitely created a discipline inside of Nasdaq, where we obviously look at a lot. But we have only executed on a few.","Michael Ptasznik","I think if you look at the priorities and strategic ambitions that Adena outlined in her comments with the five that we mentioned earlier, those are organic pursuits that we are engaging in. And if there are opportunities to accelerate that with the M&A, then we will look to do so as long as that obviously meets the strategic and the financial criteria that we're looking at. But those additions are ones that we're pursuing organically.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is now open.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Maybe just a follow-up on a prior question related to this Consolidated Tape proposal. Obviously, it's still really early days. But the SEC seems to want to develop this new governance committee to develop fair and reasonable fees for this new SIP. Do you have any idea what the SEC would view as fair and reasonable? Would it be a certain maximum operating margin or some other metric? And if that language makes its way into the final rule, do you see some risk to this overall SIP revenue pool? Or do you see that even being stable through the transition?","Adena Friedman","So, the first thing I would say is that, these fees in the SIP have always gone through a pretty rigorous regulatory process, ever since the SIP committees were formed many, many moons ago. So it already does have a lot of regulatory oversight and overlay whenever there's a proposal fee change there.","They have not defined what they mean by fair and reasonable. I think that our view is that it will -- the governance of the SIP and the way that it will be structured will help make sure that we have client involvements in those types of decisions, but also recognizing the fact that there is a lot of value that comes from the products that are created.","And the other thing is that, the fees not only just pay for the creation of the product, but also pay for the regulatory oversight that the exchanges have to support a fair market environment. So all of those things are taken into consideration. I don't think the SEC though has clearly defined their ambitions there. And we'll have to see how it goes -- how it moves forward in the coming period.","Kyle Voigt","Understood. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Adena Friedman for any closing remarks.","Adena Friedman","Great. Thank you. In closing, Nasdaq's fourth quarter and full year of 2019 was a solid performance and we are starting off 2020 with strong momentum. Our leadership team remains focused on executing our technology-led strategy to deliver for our stakeholders and I look forward to our continued discussions throughout the year on the progress we aim to make against our strategic priorities. Thank you very much for your time today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"15839":["Nasdaq, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Ed Ditmire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Ed Ditmire","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's first quarter 2019 financial results. On the line are: Adena Friedman, our CEO; Michael Ptasznik, our CFO; Ed Knight, our General Counsel; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A.","The press release and presentation are on our website.

Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Adena.","Adena Friedman","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's first quarter 2019 financial results and business performance. I will also reiterate our 2019 execution priorities that we laid out earlier in the year, discuss the progress points we've achieved in advancing the company's strategic positioning, and lastly, discuss Nasdaq's proposed changes to advance the U.S. equity market structure to create a more effective and more inclusive capital market.","Turning to our results, I'm pleased to report Nasdaq's solid performance for the first quarter of 2019. Our business achievements, organic revenue growth and strong profitability came amidst a challenging first quarter capital markets backdrop, which saw significantly reduced trading activity during the quarter as well as a late start for new listings, driven by the effect of the U.S. government shutdown related to the SEC's registration processes at the beginning of the year.","During last quarterly update in January, we presented the specific areas we'd be focusing our efforts on this year, as we continue to advance our vision and strategy. First, is to enhance our technology presence across the capital markets and beyond, through a diverse client adoption of the Nasdaq financial framework; Second is to drive better client interactions with the capital markets through continued growth and expansion of our trade surveillance, data analytics and integrity solutions across our sell side, buy side and corporate client groups; third is to enhance our leadership position in the core marketplaces in which we operate, as we continue to innovate with new functionality; and lastly, to build meaningfully on our mission driven culture to multiply our opportunities to innovate and grow.","Despite certain volume and listings headwinds, the solid results we delivered in the quarter confirm our renewed strategic focus for the long term, as we strengthen the company through investments in technology and analytics, and deliver continued growth in our non-trading segments.","Turning to specific highlights from the first quarter, our Market Technology segment delivered exceptional organic growth in the first quarter at 17%, following an increase in the size and number of software delivery projects and continued expansion of our SaaS surveillance franchise.","More importantly, as we look forward, the business demonstrated especially strong momentum in terms of new customers, including agreements with The Options Clearing Corporation to replace this legacy clearing system as well as a new deal with Deutsche Bank to operate a U.S. single dealer platform using Nasdaq's Market Technology infrastructure.","Total new order intake during the quarter was 54%, up 20% year-over-year. Our Information Services segment saw strong growth across the Index and investment analytics data products, where we see a large secular opportunity, while Market Data which is in a more mature state deliver steady results.","Growth in Index was spurred by a strong bounce back in AUM levels for licensed exchange traded products after the fourth quarter's market declines, finishing the period up 13% compared to the prior year, while our Investment Data & Analytics business saw continued double digit organic revenue growth contribution by eVestment.","Moving to our foundational businesses let me review Corporate Services first. Despite the slower start for new listing activity, we continue to lead the U.S. market for IPOs, with an 88% win-rate in the first quarter. We welcomed 59 new listings to Nasdaq during the period, including 37 IPOs, led by Lyft, Futu Holdings and New Fortress Energy.","We also welcomed Sanofi, a $107 billion market capitalization pharmaceutical company to our market when it switched its exchange listing from the New York Stock Exchange to Nasdaq during the quarter.","Meanwhile our Nordic markets continue to attract new companies, welcoming 9 new listings up from the first quarter and our European listed issuer count at the period end was up 3% compared to the prior-year period. Additionally, the Nasdaq private market formalized a partnership with iCapital Network during the quarter, to create a secondary marketplace for private funds facilitated through the Nasdaq private markets technology platform. This will offer liquidity solutions to advisors and their high net worth clients utilizing private equity investments.","And lastly, in terms of Corporate Services, we completed the sales of the BWise enterprise governance, risk and compliance software platform to SAI Global, a decision in line with our renewed strategic focus on products and services most critical to the C-suite and Board of public companies in their interactions with the capital markets.","The collective organic revenue growth across our non-trading segments was 9% during the first quarter, which serves as a positive data point that when we create sustainable value for our clients, we can continue to drive accelerated growth for the company and its shareholders.","Finally, our Market Services business delivered $233 million in the quarter, and that's in revenue, a contraction from the prior year period of 7%, driven by an unfavorable FX impact and from the difficult year-over-year industry volume comparisons relative to a particularly active first quarter of 2018 market environment.","Looking past the impact of the volume environment however, I'm pleased that we have maintained continued strong competitive positioning in our market share and capture statistics within the Nasdaq's U.S. and Nordic equity and equity options markets. Additionally, we made steady progress in implementing the significant product and service enhancements we've previously outlined for our smaller Fixed Income and Commodities franchise.","Next, I'd like to update you on our progress in our strategic repositioning to maximize our potential as a technology and analytics provider, investing to sustain and strengthen our core marketplace foundation and freeing up capital from areas that have not proven to be strategic to our client relationships.","Along these three key pillars of our strategic direction, we achieved several milestones during the first quarter. First, in terms of investing to expand the capabilities of our technology and analytics growth platform, we began the Cinnober and Quandl acquisition integrations in the first quarter. Each acquisition is off to a strong start in terms of contributing new strengths and talent to the organization, as well as an enhanced pipeline of client opportunities.","On the organic side, I'm pleased by the significant and diverse partnerships we've initiated in Market Technology, including wins with traditional market infrastructure operators, within our banks and brokers strategy, as well as non-traditional markets.","Meanwhile in Information Services, organically, we continue to enjoy the strengths of our diverse Index franchise as well as our partnership approach with over 1,000 buy side clients in our eVestment business.","Next in terms of investing to sustain and enhance our marketplace and corporate issuer core, we continue to pursue the acquisition of Oslo B\u00f8rs in Norway. As a step in the regulatory approval process, we are pleased to be assessed as fit and proper by the Norwegian FSA as part of the ongoing regulatory review of the competing proposals. We continue working with key regulators and other stakeholders to advance our proposal and expect more clarity on this process in the months to come.","Lastly, we've continued releasing capital from less core areas of our business through the sale of BWise to SAI Capital, and on a smaller scale, the announcement of the sale of our Nordic Fund Market to all funds.","The BWise divestiture was announced and completed during the first quarter and allows us to focus on providing corporate clients with a strategic C-suite and Board solutions they need for investor relations intelligence and governance insights and collaboration. The Nordic Fund Market business was a small part of our broker services business, and we found a terrific strategic buyer that will be better positioned to grow and expand the business.","Turning now to the current regulatory environment, I want to spend a few minutes to review our recently launched total markets blueprint. In the last two years since our Revitalize initiative was published with a focus on improving the attractiveness of the U.S. equity markets as a home for innovative growth companies we've worked with a broad and diverse coalition in Washington, D.C. to turn our proposals into reality.","To date, seven bills have passed the bipartisan support in Congress, and securities regulators have issued 13 rules and announcements to help address the specific proposals that our revitalized blueprint highlighted. Despite these initial achievements, challenges remain for our markets with significant imbalances going unaddressed between larger and smaller participants, which threaten investor choice. As stewards of the markets, we need to ensure regulations match investors' and issuers' needs and as well as advancements in technology.","Our TotalMarkets campaign expands on revitalize to address the need to encourage investors of all sizes to have a positive experience in the U.S. equities market. By having a robust and enthusiastic investor base, our listed companies will enjoy tighter spreads, deeper liquidity and a lower cost of equity capital. While the regulations have been - while the regulators have been focused on misguided proposals to address specific symptoms of the inefficiencies of the market. We are focused on addressing the core structural issues that impede market choice and efficiency.","Specifically, our recommendations focused on creating more market choice and opportunity across three key areas. The first is the bolster liquidity for small publically traded company. Our proposals address shortcomings in the current market structure to ensure the small issuers can continue to rely in the public markets to provide the best possible trading and investing experience for their investors. One part of this proposal is to allow small issuers to choose to concentrate on exchange liquidity at one venue.","Second is to modernize data regulations to better serve long-term retail investors by unlocking even greater wave of choice and opportunity. Examples of change in this areas include modernizing the Vendor Display Rule to allow from more choice of data products by brokers, and addressing arbitrary professional, non-professional data user type classifications that create administrative burdens on the retail brokers, who largely serve the retail client base.","Third is to enhance effectiveness for institutional investors that manage assets for retail investors. Today, they're investing in trading activities hindered by one-size-fits-all regulations that inhibits innovation and increases costs. Our key proposals in this area are an intelligent tick and rebate regime that aligns much better to the investors economic cost of trading rather than the arbitrary pricing caps of the SEC has proposed in its pilot.","Also, we'd like to limit the Order Protection Rule to exchange venues that have gathered a minimum level of market share, but also to allow smaller exchanges that are not subject to the Order Protection Rule to be able to innovate and offer different market models.","And lastly, to offer significant changes to the SIP monopoly, including improving governance, creating a distributed SIP model and consolidating the SIP plans and operators, all with the goal to create more of an industry voice in the SIP monopoly, while also giving clients of the SIP feeds more choice in a more efficient experience.","In summary, we are making deliberate proactive proposals that will increase the benefits of competition and innovation in our markets, while retaining the critical protections that instill the highest level of integrity to the U.S. capital markets.","We've recognized that we are in a period of intense debate over how best to advance our capital markets and we feel incredibly strongly that maximizing the benefits of competition and innovation, the very qualities that helped to establish the U.S. economy's leadership, is a superior approach to calls for increased regulation, government-mandated product design and arbitrary price controls that pick winners and losers amongst market intermediaries without addressing how the industry serves key issuer and investor end-users.","We look forward to continuing our collaboration with regulators and stakeholders. With main Street investors and healthy markets as our focus, significant progress can be made. I encourage you to review our proposals in greater detail by visiting business.nasdaq.com\/totalmarkets.","As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying the first quarter of 2019 produced strong results and margin expansion for Nasdaq, despite some significant declines in the industry volume and new listing headwinds in the period. We continue to be guided by our renewed strategic direction and remain encouraged by early results then enhance our diversified technology presence and increase client adoption for our trade surveillance, data analytics and corporate client solutions.","Simultaneously, we're leveraging our leadership position in the U.S. equities market to offer structural improvements, we believe will modernize markets to benefit issuers and investors, and we look forward to updating you on our progress.","With that, I'll turn it over to Michael to review the financial detail.","Michael Ptasznik","Thank you, Adena. Good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing first quarter revenue performance as shown on Page 3 of the presentation and organic growth on Pages 4 and 15.","The $32 million decrease in reported revenue of $634 million was the net result of organic growth of $22 million, including 9% organic growth in the non-trading segments, and $11 million positive impact from the inclusion of revenues from the acquisitions of Cinnober and Quandl, a $50 million negative impact from the April 2018 divestiture of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses and a $15 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.","I will now review quarterly highlights within each of our operating segments. I'll start with Information Services, which has reflected on Pages 5 and 15, saw a $19 million or an 11% increase in revenue. This was driven by $20 million or 11% organic growth, $11 million, of which, was a result of eVestment's purchase price adjustment on deferred revenues in Q1 2018.","Excluding this adjustment, organic growth would have been $9 million or 5%, primarily due to Index revenues, which were up 8% and continued organic development of Investment Data & Analytics revenues.","Market Technology revenue as shown on Pages 6 and 15, increased $17 million or 28%, including organic growth of $10 million or 17%, and $10 million in revenue for the acquisition of Cinnober, partially offset by $3 million negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. Organic growth during the period primarily reflects an increase in the size and number of software delivery projects as well as continued strength in our SaaS surveillance business.","In the first quarter, the operating income margin for Market Technology was 9% versus 3% in the year-ago quarter. I would note here that the first quarter margin tends to be below the full year margin level in Market Technology. For perspective, the trailing fourth quarter margin was 14%. Longer-term, we do expect margin expansion in 2020 and beyond as we complete the NFF deployment, progress with customer adoption of the more scalable service model and benefit from a more fully integrated Cinnober.","Turning to Corporate Services on Pages 7 and 15, revenue decreased $1 million or 1% due to a $3 million adverse impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. Organic growth increased $2 million or 2% with contribution from both the Listing Services and Corporate Solutions businesses.","Listing Services organic revenue growth was primarily due to increase in annual listing fees from a higher number of listed companies, partially offset by the runoff of previously deferred revenue recognized from listing of additional share fees, which have been incorporated in all-inclusive fee model that was paid in from 2015 to 2018.","Corporate Solutions organic revenue growth was primarily due to increase in revenue from governance solutions formerly known as board and leadership. The Corporate Services operating margin improved to 35% versus 33% in the prior year period.","Market Services net revenues on Pages 8 and 15, saw a $17 million or 7% decrease, excluding a negative $7 million impact from changes in foreign exchange, the organic revenue decline was $10 million or 4% primarily reflecting capital markets headwinds in the form of lower industry trading volumes.","Turning to Pages 9 and 15 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased $31 million to $322 million. The change reflects a $3 million or 1% organic increase more than offset by $22 million decrease for the net impact of the divestiture of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses and the impact of the acquisitions of Cinnober and Quandl as well as a $12 million favorable impact from the changes in foreign exchange rates.","Turning to Slide 10, we are updating our 2019 non-GAAP operating expense guidance range to $1.29 billion to $1.33 billion, primarily to reflect the divestiture of the BWise governance, risk and compliance business and the impact of current foreign exchange rates.","Embedded in the updated 2019 expense guidance is an expected increase in quarterly spend for the remainder of the year. For example, the midpoint of our updated guidance range implies an average of about $330 million per quarter. This expected uptick is driven by both seasonality and certain compensation items, such as annual merit increases and the timing of equity awards, as well as increased spend on various product and operational initiatives.","Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income decreased $1 million in the first quarter of 2019, reflecting the net impact of the divestitures and acquisitions, and changes in foreign exchange rate largely offset by organic growth. On an organic basis, operating income increased $19 million and the non-GAAP operating margin totaled 49%, up 2 percentage points from the prior year period.","Net interest expense was $34 million in the first quarter of 2019, a decrease of $2 million versus the prior year period due to lower debt balances. I would like to know here that the non-GAAP treatment of the OCC related income, a change prompted by the SEC's disapproval of the OCC's 2015 capital plan.","The SEC has suspended customer rebates and dividends to owners and began a phased return of contributed capital, while we expect to continue to recognized income on the OCC investment under the equity method of accounting. We do not currently expect to receive dividends on this income in 2019 or future periods. Our income on this investment may also very significantly compare to prior years. As a result, we will now exclude such income on presenting non-GAAP earnings.","We've recast prior periods for comparative purposes, as discussed in the March 4, 2019 supplement we posted on our Investor Relations website detailing the changes and impact. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was 27%, which is towards the higher end of the original tax guidance range.","For 2019, the non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to be between 26% and 27% with a higher midpoint primarily reflecting the impact of the exclusion of net income related to the OCC. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the first quarter 2019 was $204 million or $1.22 per diluted share compared to $207 million or $1.22 per diluted share in the prior year period.","Turning to capital on Slide 11, debt decreased by $264 million versus Q4 2018, primarily due to a net reduction in short-term borrowings as well as a $30 million decrease in the carrying amount of our Euro bonds caused by changes in FX rates. During the period, we repaid the maturing $500 million floating rate note with commercial paper issuances and cash.","Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period of 2.8 times, down from 3.0 times of the fourth quarter of 2018. In April, we also issued \u20ac600 million denominated 10-year notes with a coupon of 1.75%. The proceeds will be used to refinance $600 million of dollar denominated January 2020 bonds with a coupon of 5.55%. We issued redemption notices for the January 2020 bonds and the redemption will take place in May.","During the first quarter of 2019, the company returned $73 million to shareholders through dividends. And today, we are increasing our quarterly dividend by 7% to $0.47 per share. This increase reflects the continuation of our strong dividend growth story and is in accordance with our dividend policy statement of increasing the dividend as income and cash flow grows over time.","For instance, over the last three years, our dividend increased by a 13% compound annual growth rate, which compares to a compounded annual growth rate in the trailing three year period for non-GAAP net income and free cash flow excluding Section 31 fees of 11% and 15% respectively.","Thank you very much for your time. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Richard Repetto","Yeah, hi, Adena. Hi, Michael. Good morning. So I guess the first question is just on Market Technology, strong results. Could you remind us, Michael, what the headwinds on margin, the seasonality in the first quarter comes from?","Michael Ptasznik","Yeah, so the headwinds on the seasonality really comes across the board overall in the different aspects of the business. So they're just with respect to some of the timing and could be with respect to specific initiatives that they're undertaking. They also had Cinnober in Q1. That's one of the factors that came into play. And as you know, we'll be realizing the synergies through the remainder of the year. And so, those are some of the factors that will have an impact on it.","Richard Repetto","Okay. That's helpful. And then, my related follow-up to Adena, on your - the TotalMarkets whitepaper, so if I had to summarize, at least what I took from it was the one size doesn't fit all for the equity markets and also you're certainly pushing the use of technology in regards to reg reform and even how you monitor markets. But I guess the question is, given the relationship that's sort of developed over the last 18 months, is this - do you think you're making - what's been the reception to your proposal and your recommendations to the regulators that you interact with?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well, I think the first thing to note is the reception from the client. So one of the things we really want to focus on are what are the underlying causes of some of the complexities that happen, that occur in our market today, and are investors and issuers really having a good experience. And I think that that's a mixed answer.","And the reason for the fact that it's not a uniform answer across large and small investors, and large and small issuers, is because of the fact that we have this kind of one-size-fits-all Reg NMS Order Protection Rule environments that exists.","So we actually, before writing total markets and proposing it, we did do a lot of work in talking to clients. And there is not really a uniform view across the industry. They all come with their own views and their own perspective. But the one thing that I think did shine through is this idea of a one-size-fits-all, whether you are a $500 million market cap company or a $500 billion market cap company, that one-size-fits-all model really just doesn't work anymore. And technology, it gives us the opportunity to create market structures and changes that would give everyone the chance to have a good experience in the public market.","So our view is really consistent with the overall theme of the clients. I think that when we've gone back out after writing it and talk to customers directly, I think that they're very pleased with some of the proposals. Obviously, there is some debate around some of their proposals. But that's the whole point of it.","The point is to create a much more healthy and holistic debate, rather than picking a symptom and trying to do experiment on the market and have a bunch of companies be guinea pigs for an experiment, let's actually debate it as a policy matter, let's have a fulsome discussion across the clients and with the regulators, and come to a more comprehensive view as to how the market should be structured. And that's what we're trying to achieve.","In terms of our dialogs with the regulators, we frankly have not yet sat down with them on a comprehensive basis and gone through this proposal. So that's something we intend to do with our regulators, with lawmakers and with our clients in the weeks and months to come.","Richard Repetto","Okay. Great, Adena. Thank you and good luck with the talks with them.","Adena Friedman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Michael Carrier","Hi, thanks and good morning. Maybe just one on the Market Tech business, Adena, you highlighted some of the wins in the quarter. And it seems like on the banker, the dealer side, there is more traction, not this quarter, but over the last few, so just wanted to get an update.","I know when you guys did the strategic overview that was one of the areas that you felt like there was a lot of potential over time. I'm just - where are you maybe on getting traction with some of the clients and how has that opportunity shifted versus like the initial expectations?","Adena Friedman","Sure. I think the first thing is that the surveillance side of the technology business with the banks and brokers continues to go quite well. And that is definitely a driver of growth in this segment. As we've been trying to expand that relationships with the broker dealers into trading technologies, post-trade technologies, risk management technologies, I think that we've been getting some good traction and starting to show that there is progress against that strategy.","But these decisions definitely take a little longer than we originally anticipated to get the clients to get to a final contract. The contracting process can take a while. But the good news is that we continue to see really strong demand from clients. And with each time we sign a customer and we start to work with them, I think other customers start to think, well, gosh, our infrastructure is in some cases old. And in another cases, is this really the best use of our technology team's time to focus on core, I would say core infrastructure technology as opposed to key functionality that differentiates them.","And so, we definitely are having very productive conversations with a lot of banks across the world on this point, but it also takes time for them to come to these decisions. So we hope that we will just continue to make steady progress in getting new clients here.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks. And Michael, just a quick one. On the data analytics, just on the eVestment business, I don't know if you can breakup, but just more curious, how much of the growth is being driven by either clients penetration kind of core growth versus some of that deferred pricing that you're benefiting from this year? Just any context around that.","Michael Ptasznik","Yeah. So the deferred revenue impact in 2018 in Q1 was $11 million, so you can back that out of the growth numbers that are there.","Adena Friedman","But in terms of just general eVestment progress, I think that we continue to see demand for new services that we launched, something called Market Lens towards the end of last year, and we have good pickup there in terms of new functionality and new capabilities we can offer our clients, as well as continued penetration.","And geographically, we continue to make - it's a small part of the business in Asia, but it's definitely something that we're really focused on in terms of growing our presence there and in Europe. But I think that in general, though, it's really continued to work with our customers and find new customers. So work with our existing ones and new functionality and finding new customers around the world.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is now open.","Christopher Allen","Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to ask on - maybe I missed this, on the Market Data, you had noted an adjustment for under usage - underreporting of usage for the [tape plan] [ph]. Just wondering how big of a magnitude that adjustment was.","Michael Ptasznik","Yeah. Within Market Data itself this quarter was - it was a larger than usual change, it was a total of $8 million in Market Data, compared to $6 million last year and $5 million last quarter.","Adena Friedman","So possibly last year first quarter?","Michael Ptasznik","First quarter last year, yeah.","Christopher Allen","Got it. And then just the organic growth in the non-trading segments, you posted 9% this quarter, very strong above kind of the target, that was not adjusted for the eVestment deferred revenue. I mean, is that closer to about 5.5% adjusting for that and maybe the $2 million of Market Data and that kind of a good way to think about what the core run rate is going forward right now?","Michael Ptasznik","Yeah. If you take out both of those items, that would be closer to that number. The eVestment itself again was $11 million, which would bring the non-trading segment growth to about 6%. And so, if you back out the additional 2%, that will get it closer to your number.","Christopher Allen","Got it. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.","Alex Kramm","Yeah. Hey, good morning. Just on the Cinnober acquisition, I think, Adena, you mentioned that your work on integration is going well. Can you just flesh it out a little bit like what have you done in terms of sales integration? What have you done in terms of synergies? Just a little bit more color on where you are in the process and what we start to expect going forward?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Yeah, thanks, Alex. So with Cinnober, we got up to a pretty fast start. So what we did when we first closed is obviously welcomed the employees to Nasdaq, made sure that we're really starting to get to know the employees, understand their organization. And really did a deep dive on their technology and data comparison of their technology stack with our technology stack, what functionality do they have that we don't have, where do they have more modern technology that we could integrate into the Nasdaq Financial Framework, where would we want to maintain some of their technology independently of our group.","And so we've completed that assessment, that initial assessment. And I think that we feel very, very - I mean, really great about the technology that they have, both particularly in their clearing space in the risk management space. And so we continue to look at how we're going to integrate some of their functionality into the Nasdaq Financial Framework, such as the risk management capabilities, the clearing risk management that they have, in addition to maintaining some of their clearing technology, as its own standalone capability, because they have really great clients and some new clients that have come on to the platform.","In terms of some of the trading technologies, I think that's going to be over time as clients look at renewing and moving forward over several years into the future. I think, we will start to work on integrating them more into the trading technologies that Nasdaq has. But those have been some of their early decisions we've made.","Additionally, we've been working with the team very closely to understand how to integrate the teams into Nasdaq, and we've been coming up with a plan around that. And so we're starting to execute on that.","So I think then lastly, the Cinnober team that's based in Stockholm will be moving into our Stockholm offices over the summer, so that we can start to have some savings on the real estate side. So we're definitely off to a good start, but there are synergies that will develop as we go through the remainder of this year and potentially even some going into early next year, just to kind of complete the effort on a cost side.","On the revenue side and on the client pipeline side, they have some - they've had some recent wins in terms of new clients that we're very pleased to work with them on. And then on top of that their pipelines really interesting. And some of it overlaps, but some of it didn't, and so we're really pleased that we can follow-up on some new opportunities and that they've been surfacing over the last several months.","Alex Kramm","All right. Great. And then just very quick follow-up, on Market Data, I mean, I know there's obviously been a lot of debate around equities. And as I see we talked about this over the last couple of years. But just a quick question, I think, you actually did forego some, let's call it, typical price increases that you usually do. Can you just like put a magnitude around there like I think those numbers are small, but how much do you think you have foregone in terms of price increases this year in terms of millions of dollars or something that you think you would have otherwise budgeted from a multiyear perspective, if that makes sense?","Adena Friedman","Yeah, I mean, the first I would say is we don't actually increase price across our products every year in the market data space. We are very selective in how we look at. If we add new functionality or new - create new capabilities or add into the feeds, we will make a decision potentially to increase price at that time. So it's not that every single year we're taking a standard increase like some companies do.","I think that - but in this particular year, we have decided that we're - we haven't made any significant price increases in our U.S. equities market data business, where we've been focusing on growth opportunities is really in expanding the client base there. And we continue to have opportunities here in the U.S. to expand how our proprietary data is used by our clients, in addition to geographic expansion particularly in Asia.","But the price increases have not been a focus for us this year. I would just say, Alex, we don't really have like a standard amount that we hope to make every year on price increases. So we don't really have something that we've intentionally foregone. So I can't answer that last part of your question, but I can say that price increases have not been a focus for us right now, but it's not always something we do every year anyway.","Alex Kramm","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alexander Blostein","Thanks. Hey, good morning, guys. So just a follow-up to Alex's last question, I think I guess more specifically some of the online brokers at Ameritrade, ETRADE spoke to lower Market Data run rates recently. And I'm wondering whether or not you guys have actually lowered any pricing for some of the larger players. And kind of bigger picture, ex the benefit you guys got this quarter from audits, what should you guys expect for kind of the rest of the year run rate for market data? Thanks.","Adena Friedman","Well, we don't give any sort of revenue guidance across our businesses. So I can't answer that last question. I think that in terms of, generally, we have not made any sort of price decrease decisions that are significant in our space. We obviously in the trading side, we're always working with our clients to make sure that we're managing our pricing appropriately to make sure that it's a competitive - it's a very competitive environment, both on the data and the trading side.","So we really work with our clients to figure out how best to manage their experience in our markets and it's dynamic. I would say on the trading side, it's quite dynamic and it's a pretty regular process. On the data side, we've been focused much more on making sure that they can use our data in more expansive ways.","We do have enterprise pricing, particularly for the retail brokers, where they have very large client bases. We'll do enterprise pricing across our market data, so as they scale their businesses, their cost can go up.","Alexander Blostein","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is now open.","Kyle Voigt","Hey, good morning. Maybe just a question on the Oslo B\u00f8rs transaction, I believe you've now taken a direct stake in the exchange. Can you just elaborate on the move? Was that kind of messaging to the Ministry of Finance to show how serious you are about the offer in the transaction?","And then like a follow-up to that, just given the recommendations that were made to the Ministry of Finance for Nasdaq, as well as what we've heard publicly from Euronext, just wondering if you're any more or less confident that the Ministry of Finance imposes a two-thirds rule for ownership of that asset. Thank you.","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well, I think that the share purchase was somewhat opportunistic, because there was a particular holder that was ready to sell and they gave us opportunity to buy it. So I think that has just helped to bolster our proposal and so was an opportunistic decision.","I think that with regard to our efforts there, we continue to feel very strongly that we have the strongest proposal available in terms of the strategic benefit to the Norwegian capital markets to Oslo B\u00f8rs itself, to their clients in particular. And we continue to manage our relationships with the stakeholders there to make sure that they are aware of all the benefits that we can provide to the Norwegian capital markets as part of our bid.","I think that with regard to the finance ministry, they will likely make their decision in the next few weeks, but they have the ability to make the decision around May 15, but they could extend it to June, mid-June. And there, we don't have any sort of inside view as to how they're evaluating it or what they might come to a conclusion on. But we we'll be excited to hear from them when they're ready.","Kyle Voigt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Adena Friedman, CEO, for any further remarks.","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well, in closing, I would like to point out that our first quarter 2019 performance was a good reflection of our diversified business, as well as our ongoing efforts to partner with our clients to deliver superior technology, trading and analytic solutions to them. Our management team and global workforce are energized and focused on delivering results against our strategic direction to re-imagine markets, and to realize the potential of tomorrow. So thank you very much for your time today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. And you may all disconnect.

Later, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ed Ditmire, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Ed Ditmire","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq\u2019s third quarter 2017 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Michael Ptasznik, our CFO; Ed Knight, our General Counsel; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up to Q&A.","The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC regulation FD.","I\u2019d like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations, and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Adena.","Adena Friedman","Thank you, Ed. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report Nasdaq\u2019s strong third quarter 2017 results today. I also want to discuss how we are deliberately evolving the strategic direction of the company, the actions we\u2019ve taken to drive that forward to date and address the regulatory environment and some of the developments there.","The results we delivered during the quarter are indicative of our strong focus and alignment with our clients needs. In particular, we increased our non-GAAP diluted EPS by 12% year-over-year, excluding the $0.04 benefit from changes in the share-based tax accounting.","We generated total net revenue of $607 million and non-GAAP operating income of $290 million, up 4% and 8% respectively year-over-year. We continue to execute well to achieve our 2017 priorities, including improving our competitive position across our businesses, integrating the 2016 acquisitions and delivering on their full promise and commercializing our expertise in emerging technologies and bringing new solutions to the marketplace.","Growth was especially strong in recurring and subscription side of the business, where we generated 76% of our third quarter revenue. First, Information Services saw strong performance with the $150 million in revenue for the quarter with especially strong growth in Index Licensing and Services revenue up 21% year-over-year, a testament to the unique position \u2013 positioning that we established in the Index base, with over 40% of our license AUM and smart beta products.","Market Technology generated revenues of $77 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year and year-to-date, the segment has generated $215 in revenue up 8% year-over-year. We exited Q3 on a strong footing in terms of backlog, new client wins, and fast business trends, all of which we expect to drive future growth. We\u2019re positioning ourselves to further that growth momentum to our investments in Sybenetix and internal development initiatives, most notably our investment in the Nasdaq Financial Framework, our next generation market infrastructure platform.","Under our Market Services segment, Trade Management Services saw strong growth from some of our newer products. In particular a third party connectivity, which contributed to a 9% increase in the quarter year-over-year. The trading side of the business is performing well, despite historic lows and volatility and muted industry volumes. Due to market share gains in the three largest trading revenue categories U.S. options, U.S. equities, and Nordic equities.","This is a visible example of the progress against one of our 2017 execution priorities to improve our competitive position. With another one of our 2017 priorities, our acquisition integration efforts I\u2019m very pleased to say that we have completed the technology integration of the ISE options exchanges onto the INET technology. The team did an outstanding job with a complex integration, which they completed on time and which enabled us to execute on all of our synergy expectations.","There are areas of our business that continue to show slower growth and then we would like, in particular, our Corporate Solutions and our Listing Services businesses. In terms of listings, we are seeing some encouraging business level operating trends. In the Nordics, despite a seasonally slow third quarter, our new listings are still on their way to a record in 2017 with 72 new listings so far this year up 24% year-to-date.","In the U.S., we have had 87 IPOs during the first nine months of 2017, up 32% year-to-date over the comparable period last year, and we increased our IPO win rate to 77% during the third quarter, improving our year-to-date win rate to 60%. In 2018, we\u2019ll enter the final phase of the 2015 pricing changes in listings, when U.S. corporate listing customers, who haven\u2019t already opted in will transition to the bundled annual and listing of additional share fees, which will bring a moderate revenue benefit next year.","In Corporate Solutions, where year-over-year comparisons were flat, we\u2019re taking actions to better position ourselves strategically and leverage the parts of those businesses that played in Nasdaq strength and expertise going forward. I\u2019ll provide more detail around this later in my remarks.","Moving on from the financial metrics, I want to spend a few minutes discussing the long-term opportunities we\u2019re focused on that will continue to position this firm for growth in the quarters and years to come. As I mentioned in our September call, in terms of our strategic planning, we\u2019ve been examining the key trends that will drive change and evolution in our industry with a focus on how we can best serve our clients, as they adapt in response to technology and other industry advancements in the coming years.","We intend to use our capital, talent and other resources to align ourselves with the need of our clients both today and tomorrow. The specific long-term trends that we believe will impact our business are: first, the emergence of a marketplace economy with two sided market mechanisms proliferating far beyond financial markets.","Over the years, using our market infrastructure technology, we have worked with third party clients looking to create auction mechanisms or continuous markets to allow for price discovery for assets outside the scope of the financial markets today.","We believe that this trend to give consumers the power to negotiate price for goods that are easily transferred, coupled with advanced digital payment options will continue to expand. Especially, the Nasdaq Financial Framework offers our existing clients, but also the emerging marketplace economy, a modern architecture that embraces the latest advancements in technology.","Second is the role of the investment banks as critical pillars of the financial system. Our view is that many of the global banks have emerged from the aftermath of the credit crisis in a position of strength. And as they\u2019ve reoriented their own capital allocation priorities, they\u2019ve developed a different attitude towards technology partnerships, where they\u2019re willing to find strategic partners, who are specialized capabilities in areas that they don\u2019t view, where they don\u2019t view the technology as a key competitive differentiator and that can be delivered in a less expensive way than their own internal IT organizations can manage.","They can then focus their internal IT efforts on those areas that provide them specific competitive advantages. And example of that shift has been our ocean initiative, where we seek to serve as the technology partner for banks and managing their internal trading venues. In the third quarter, we have won a second ocean mandate. In this case, to power a Tier 1 global banks foreign exchange trading platform. We continue to have active and encouraging discussions with other banks seeking ways \u2013 to seeking to find ways to optimize their internal operations with our market infrastructure technology.","The third major trend that every industry is facing is the explosion of data, coupled with the advancement of machine intelligence. We have built a successful data franchise of global distribution. And today we have new tools to dissect our data, intercept it with outside information and deliver deeper and more meaningful insights to our clients. Our Analytics Hub is a good example. We\u2019re using machine intelligence to provide investors with robust signals that can help them navigate the financial markets and execute their investment and trading strategies more efficiently.","Similarly for our corporate clients, we\u2019ve just lost IR 360, which mines data in a new way to deliver insights to our IR officers and other executives on their investor base and how they\u2019re interacting with them. And in our SMARTS Surveillance business, we\u2019re creating ever more intelligent alerts and other capabilities that enable more sophisticated means to oversee the activities across markets globally.","The last major trend is the shifting environment and investment management. We\u2019re seeing shifts that go far beyond the active to passive dynamic. For example, the increasing importance on investing in private companies, the growth in quantitative strategies and overall the increased competition that all asset managers are facing despite a rising tide in ever more investable assets entering the markets in the coming years.","We believe that this trend coupled with the third trend of the data explosion creates interesting opportunities to serve the asset management industry with increasingly sophisticated data and analytics, with the aim to empower them to compete more effectively in the shifting environment. We are excited that we have just closed in our acquisition of eVestment. The special fit between eVestment and Nasdaq creates opportunities to build our role as a key differentiated analytics partner in the investment community.","Our interactions with the investment team in the weeks, since announcing the acquisition through to closing this week has only raised our conviction on this fantastic opportunity. These initiatives and others that we have in our Information Services segment pipeline will enable us to continue our sharp focus on delivering more valuable information and intelligence to our clients.","So as we completed our strategic review, we assessed our current assets and capabilities and match them against our areas of strategic focus. In that process, we identified where we have assets that are ready to be applied against our focus areas, where we need to invest to improve our position and where we may have assets that are not part of our future.","Due to that evaluation, we have placed our public relations solutions and digital media services business under strategic review. As we mentioned in our release, when we have material news related to those businesses to share with you we will do so. By retaining and focusing on our IR Intelligence Solutions and board and leadership portals, we will be able to continue to serve as a key partner to our corporate clients as they navigate the global capital markets, and we will maintain the capabilities that are strategic to them in their governance and IR relationships.","The strategic pivot we\u2019ve just begun to implement has a better oriented today to pursue our objectives, but we\u2019re also working to institutionalize some of the process and learning that occur during this long-term strategic analysis. By regularly reviewing as testing and making adjustments when needed to maximize our long-term effectiveness and making this as much a part of the culture as our operating and efficiency discipline will put ourselves in a great position to ensure that we maximize how we can deliver for our clients and our shareholders alike.","Lastly, I want to spend a few minutes on a regulatory environment. Nasdaq\u2019s mission is to use ingenuity, integrity and insights to deliver markets that promote economic growth. And as part of that mission, we want to ensure that the U.S. capital markets are the best and most robust that they can be. To that end, in May, we released a blueprint for revitalizing the U.S. capital market with recommendations that we see as essential for the U.S. routine is preeminence in the global capital market.","As part of our initiative, we\u2019re seeking to gain key \u2013 support from key stakeholders to increase the appeal of public markets for innovative and growing companies. We\u2019ve been encouraged by several actions taken by the new administration in recent months. Specifically, soon after Chairman Clayton was sworn in, he extended the ability to submit confidential filings to all companies not just those with less than $1 billion in annual revenue.","We also applaud Congress for introducing several pieces of legislation in the last several weeks, focused on the public equity markets, including ability to strengthen proxy advisory firm oversight in all of which aim to create more appealing public company experience, while preserving critical investor protection.","And on October 6, the U.S. Treasury published its report recommending various reforms to how to improve the capital markets \u2013 how the capital markets can support economic growth with considerable focus on the U.S. equity markets. There are areas and report, where the U.S. Treasury is in complete alignment with the recommendations in Nasdaq\u2019s blueprint, including reducing corporate disclosure obligations that are principally critically motivated, working to establish more meaningful proxy access thresholds, reviewing oversight of proxy advisory firms and reforming shareholder litigation.","Also in line with Nasdaq\u2019s recommendation was Treasury\u2019s desire to give less liquid issuers more choice on the market structure of their listing exchange. Notably, they support revisions to unless the trading privileges to allow a single exchange to trade a company stock, in order to reconsolidate the company\u2019s liquidity. But they aim to improve market quality and lower their equity cost of capital.","There are other \u2013 also other market structure recommendations, such as increased ATS and payment portal disclosures, which have and continue to have \u2013 which have had and continue to have Nasdaq support. In other areas, such as the Treasury\u2019s recommendations around the SIP data\u2019s role and satisfying best execution requirements and their view on SEC review standards for market data fee filings, we view Treasury\u2019s recommendations and priorities as completely consistent with current law and precedents.","Treasury also recommends the SEC consider them a potential for a multiple consolidators system for the provision of SIP fees. Nasdaq has not opposed such a system as long as it can be demonstrated that will not \u2013 it will not impose new burdens on broker dealers or the exchanges to create such a system, and at a reasonable articulation supporting the economic benefits to investors is made before embarking on the creation of a multiple consolidator role.","In Michael\u2019s remarks, he will discuss some incremental disclosures we\u2019ve made this quarter to bring more transparency to the special area focus for our investors. I would like to summarize my comments by saying that we are very pleased with our continued solid performance across our business, which has been propelled by our focus and achievement against our 2017 execution priorities. We\u2019re excited about the strategic direction that we\u2019re embarking on, which should enable us to focus on the evolving future needs of our clients.","And we\u2019re pleased to see our U.S. regulatory agenda playing out with initial regulatory and political actions aimed to create a better and more inviting public environment for innovative growth companies.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Michael, to review the financial details.","Michael Ptasznik","Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and our comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that\u2019s available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.","Starting with the third quarter revenue performance. As shown on Page 3 of the presentation, and organic growth on pages 4 and 16. The 4%, or $22 million, increase in reported record net revenue of $607 million consisted of organic growth of $15 million with 3% organic growth in the non-trading segments and 1% organic growth in Market Services. And a $7 million favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.","We look now with the highlights within each of the reporting segments. I will start with Information Services, which, as reflected on pages 5 and 16, saw a $13 million, or 9%, increase in revenue, consisting of $12 million, or 9%, organic growth.","Index Licensing and Services revenues were up 21% in the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher assets under management and exchange traded products linked to Nasdaq indexes, with AUM reaching a record $154 billion as of September 30, 2017.","Market Technology revenue, as shown on pages 6 and 16, increased $4 million, or 5%, with organic growth totaling $2 million or 3%. Organic growth totaled 8% on a year-to-date basis, which we point out because organic growth in Market Technology tends to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter more than other segments.","The period and backlog finished at $805 million a record high and an increase of 9% from the prior year quarter. The operating income margin for Market Technology was 21%, down 5 percentage points from 26% in the prior year period, reflecting the impact of investments we are making to upgrade our technology for the next generation Nasdaq Financial Framework, and to enhance and grow our surveillance offering.","Turning to Corporate Services on pages 7 and 16, revenues declined $1 million, or 1%. While listings activity in the Nordic region is robust, revenue growth in the Nordics was offset by lower U.S. listings revenues from the runoff of listing of additional shares or LAS fees due to activity generated in past years. For the Corporate Solutions segment, growth was flat in the quarter. Reflecting the progress we\u2019ve achieved in our synergy targets, the Corporate Services operating margin was 28% versus 26% in the prior year period.","Market Services net revenues, on pages 8 and 16, saw a $6 million, or 3%, increase, equally split between organic growth and the positive impact from changes in foreign exchange. Market Services operating income margin totaled 54% unchanged versus the prior year period.","Turning to pages 9 and 16 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were unchanged at $317, with a $4 million organic expense decrease offset by $4 million unfavorable impact from the changes in foreign exchange rates.","Turning to slide 10, our revised 2017 non-GAAP operating expense guidance is $1.275 billion to $1.29 billion versus $1.26 billion to $1.29 billion previously. The updated guidance largely reflects to closing of our acquisitions of eVestment earlier this week and Sybenetix towards the end of the third quarter.","As this is our typical practice, we established 2018 expense guidance when we report the 4Q 2017 results in late January. But understanding that many of you will be working now to incorporate our acquisitions particularly eVestment into your model, please keep the following in mind.","We\u2019re considering our 2018 expense run rate, in addition to the organic growth rate of core expenses, which in recent full year periods has been 3%. We believe our 2018 expense run rate should also reflect a 6% non-organic increase over 2017, due to the full year impact of the late 2017 acquisitions of eVestment and Sybenetix. The 6% non-organic increase reflects growth in the expense basis of the acquisitions to support the continued organic growth, as well as upfront integration costs including certain retention and incentive programs.","Non-GAAP operating income increased 8% in the third quarter of 2017 and the non-GAAP operating margin totaled 48%, an increase from 46% in the prior year period. Net interest expense was $32 million in the third quarter of 2017, a decrease of $4 million versus the prior year period, primarily due to a lower average debt balance since the 2016 acquisitions.","The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2017 was 31%, in the middle of the 30% to 32% range we provided during the last quarterly call. We continue to expect the 2017 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 30% to 32%.","Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the third quarter of 2017 was $181 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, compared to $154 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, in the prior year period. The adoption of accounting standard ASU 2016-09 added $0.04 to our 3Q 2017 results.","Turning to capital, as shown on Slide 11, debt increased $991 million versus 2Q 2017, primarily due to issuing a $500 million floating rate note during the period in preparation for the closing of eVestment transaction and $48 million increase in euro bonds due to changes in FX rates. This increase was partially offset as we use the portion of the proceeds to temporarily pay down, $340 million of commercial paper.","This resulted in our debt-to-EBITDA ratio ending the period at 3.1 times versus 3.0 times at the end of second quarter of 2017. With eVestment acquisition, we expect our leverage ratio to temporarily increase and then we plan to deleverage a mid-2 times leverage ratio by mid-2019.","Share repurchases in the third quarter totaled $80 million, bringing year-to-date repurchases to $175 million. Together with Dividend payments, we have return $355 million to shareholders through the nine months of 2017, representing 66% of our non-GAAP net income in the period.","Looking forward, while the near-term, our actions in part will reflect our commitment to deleverage towards our mid-2019 commitment to reach a mid-2s gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio, we are looking to optimize the returns to shareholders through continued investment in organic growth initiatives, carefully considered M&A, continuing to grow the dividend as earnings and cash flow increase and buybacks that principally offset the impact of share issuance.","Before I turn the call back over to Adena, we wanted to take this opportunity to provide you with some additional color on our Information Services business and have added some additional disclosure on Slides 12 and 13. First, I\u2019d like to provide some detail on the implications of the eVestment acquisition we closed this week and how its revenues will be reflected in our financials, and later, the temporary impacts of the purchase accounting adjustments for deferred revenue balances.","On Page 12 of the quarterly presentation, we reiterate that eVestment revenues have grown an average of 12% per year over the period from 2013 through the first half of 2017. 2Q 2017 trailing 12-month revenues were $81 million. Due to a write-down of deferred revenue under purchase accounting, revenues related to eVestment are expected to be reduced by approximately $34 million for the 12-month period following the acquisition or $9 million in 4Q 2017, $11 million in 1Q 2018, $8 million in 2Q, $5 million in Q3 and $1 million in 4Q 2018. Revenues in 2019 and beyond will not be affected by the purchase accounting adjustments of deferred revenues.","Secondly, I\u2019d like to follow up Adena\u2019s comments on the regulatory environment and in order to help answer requests from the investment community for more detail on the data business, we\u2019ve included a slide on Page 13 of the earnings deck. We hope this helps investors understand some of the nuance in our Global Information Services business, in particular understanding the portion of our business that comes from the U.S. equity proprietary debt and shared tape data product groups.","This revenue consists of a number of different products that are grouped and for the categories of pro display and nondisplay fees, nonpro fees, license fees as well as the revenues from Tapes A, B and C.","Interestingly, as we have continued to diversify and expand our overall Global Information Services business with particular focus on our index business and nonequities data, over the past 12 months, our U.S. equities debt fees represent approximately 4% of our overall revenue.","As the chart demonstrates, today, most of our Information Services revenues and particularly our growth opportunities are focused on products and services that are not related to U.S. equity market structure. And this will be further diversified enhanced with the inclusion of eVestment starting this quarter.","Thank you for your time, and I\u2019d now like to turn it back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O\u2019Neill. You may begin.","Rich Repetto","Yes, good morning, Adena. Good morning, Michael.","Michael Ptasznik","Good morning.","Adena Friedman","Good morning.","Rich Repetto","And I guess, the question is going to be since you just went through Slide 13, Michael, but on the Market Data, I think it was a combination of Treasury report as well as a new appointment at the SEC. Could you comment, Adena, on any views you might have? Obviously, the positions of the individual that\u2019s appointed ahead of trading in markets were very much, I would say, pro dealer. Could you comment on what you\u2019d expect or \u2013 because I think the investment community is adding these two together, I guess, and what you expect from a person taking that position?","Adena Friedman","Well, I would say very definitively we\u2019ve had a long and productive working relationship with the SEC, and we expect to continue to. I think that since Chairman Clayton came into the role earlier this year, we feel that we have been very aligned in some key areas of concern that we\u2019ve had around the capital markets and making sure that we have a great balance of investor protection with robust and exciting U.S. public capital markets, and we would expect that we will continue to be able to work towards those goals with the Chairman as well as with the staff, and we look forward to working with Brett in his new role in Trading and Markets.","I think, in general, as we mentioned with the Treasury report as well as with the changes there, we feel that the Treasury report is pretty clear in articulating issues around market data that are still very consistent with the SEC and their guidance around the use of SIP data for best as well as the reasonable and fair standard that they applied to our Market Data filings today. So we don\u2019t really see any change that comes from the Treasury report recommendations or from the activities that we\u2019ll have at the SEC in that regard.","Rich Repetto","Thanks, that\u2019s helpful, Adena. And I guess, the last question is more open, but you did outline sort of what you looked in the key areas of growth for strategic planning whether it be the marketplace economy, investments banks, et cetera. But I guess the question is have you been able \u2013 does this \u2013 as you assess the whole strategic pivot, does this incrementally add to the growth rate? Like what do you expect, if you could quantify that in any way, it\u2019d be helpful.","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well, I think that we have been and will continue to be very focused on total shareholder return, and we have as our goal to deliver double-digit total shareholder return and we will continue to have that as our goal and our target. I think that as we \u2013 we are pretty early on in the strategy, but as we execute against that strategy, we will continue to evaluate and assess the growth rate, the long-term growth targets that we provide to you, and if there are opportunities to increase this, we certainly will.","We also want to make sure that we provide you insight into the investments we are making, in particularly in R&D, that are focused on our strategy so that we can provide you an update and measures for you to be able to understand how we\u2019re progressing against those investment areas. And so we will continue to provide \u2013 and probably provide little bit more disclosures in the future just around our R&D activities.","But generally speaking, our goal is to make sure that we can deliver on that double-digit total shareholder return and we hope to be able to do that with increased growth over time as we execute against our strategy.","Rich Repetto","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Chris Harris","Thanks, guys. Two questions on market structure. One, wondering if you guys are supportive of a pilot to examine the impact of reduced access fees? And then related to that, if maker\/taker went away, what do you think would be the impact on your business?","Adena Friedman","So in terms of the access fee pilot, what we\u2019ve discussed and we\u2019ve said in public testimony is that we are willing to work with the SEC on an access fee pilot. We tried to implement \u2013 tried to do it without the SEC involvement a couple of years ago, but the other exchanges didn\u2019t choose to participate in that, so it\u2019s hard to get any sort of meaningful results out of it. But I would say that we are willing to work certainly with the SEC to implement an access fee pilot. We have expressed some real concern around the access fees as these apply to smaller company stock and the need for makers to have proper incentives to post close and be involved in those stocks.","So we are pretty adamant about our concern around that, and so how they construct the pilot, how long they run it, how many stocks are involved, which stocks are involved are going to be very important to working with them on that. But I do believe that there \u2013 it seems like it\u2019s something that they are interested in trying to do and so we will work with them if that\u2019s their decision. In terms of the impact of elimination of access fees, this has been a part of our markets.","It\u2019s part of \u2013 it\u2019s integrated and integral to Reg NMS and so to the extent that there is a review of Reg NMS and all of the market structure components there, that, certainly looking at access fees, could be a part of that over the long run. But elimination of access fees, we don\u2019t really try to predict the impact of that. I think that it is an integral part of our market structure today and it likely will continue to be with the pilot giving us some information as to the impact of that over time.","Chris Harris","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. You may begin.","Jeremy Campbell","Hi, thanks. Just a quick question on your Info Services. Thanks for the incremental disclosure here, I think it\u2019s going to be useful for folks. But just thinking big picture in your entire Info Services complex, but maybe especially in the proprietary U.S. equity stuff that\u2019s under the scrutiny here, how much of the top line growth from the past was from price increases? And with the focus here on this kind of vertical, what do you think the outlook is for price increases going forward on this business?","Adena Friedman","So overall, within our Information Services business, we have given some clarity on that in the past where we say somewhere in the range of 1 to 2 percentage points of growth can come from price increases in general. That does not pertain necessarily specifically to each speed. So we have, as you can tell, a very diversified business. We work very closely with our clients and with industry groups to understand how we\u2019re adding value to this product, how the use of this product are changing and therefore we factor that into any pricing decisions we make.","But that\u2019s a general comment across all of Information Services and we don\u2019t \u2013 and there are many times when we don\u2019t make increases in any particular product. We do it based on maybe changes and enhancements, improvements we made to the products and changes in usage that would warrant a change in price and that\u2019s generally how we run the business.","Jeremy Campbell","Thanks. But would it be fair to say that maybe the \u2013 instead of wiping out this revenue stream like some people were kind of doing, maybe it\u2019s more about the growth rate of this might be slowing versus where it had been in the past given the kind of the U.S. Treasury proposal?","Adena Friedman","I would say \u2013 as we said before, the U.S. Treasury proposal, in our opinion, is completely consistent with current practice and it\u2019s consistent with the current requirements that the SEC places on broker-dealers for their best execution obligations. So we continue to support a mid-single-digit growth rate for the Global Information Services business in the years to come and that includes that the complement of everything we do there and our focus areas on growth in terms of our data analytics, the growth in our index business, our focus on the buy-side and the investment community in addition to all the current products that we support that support the broker-dealer community.","Jeremy Campbell","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Just a follow-up on the expenses and kind of the outlook for next year. So just want to clarify you talked about kind of a 3% core Nasdaq expense growth rate but \u2013 that jives \u2013 or compares to roughly 1% I think you guys are tracking at this year. And then just the 6% number I think you talked about on the combined businesses of eVestment and Sybenetix. That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to be spending on just the kind of core growth of that business going forward versus any synergies or anything that might be coming out?","Michael Ptasznik","Yes. So first of all, with the 3% relative to the 1%, 3% represents the historical growth rate we\u2019ve typically seen for synergies. And so this year, the 1% on a year-to-date basis really does take into account the synergies we have for the four acquisitions and the flow-through of that into this year. So 3% would be a normal organic growth rate over the last few years before the synergies.","With respect to the 6%, that 6% does reflect the combination of the Sybenetix and eVestment, the year-over-year approximate increase due to those acquisitions and what that impact would be. It includes the run rate, the growth that we expect behind those businesses as we said we believe that eVestment will continue to attract growth as well as Sybenetix obviously.","And then additional, as we disclosed here, there are some upfront integration costs from incentive, retention compensation and some other things that we\u2019re going to be spending. When we did the call \u2013 when we announced the eVestment deal, we did talk about how there will be some synergies in the business that will be offset by some additional expenses that we\u2019ll be spending. And so some of that is with respect to the timing. Some of the upfront costs obviously have to occur now and then the synergies will come in a future period.","Dan Fannon","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. You may begin.","Sameer Murukutla","Hey, Good morning, Adena, Michael. This is Sameer Murukutla on for Michael Carrier. I guess I wanted to focus more on the Market Technology segment and I think you highlighted the growth in the SaaS effort. Can you just give us more detail on this initiative? What kind of growth rate you\u2019re seeing? Who you primarily are competing with? And I guess is this really being reflected in the backlog order intake as, I guess, it didn\u2019t move up as much as I expected on a quarter-to-quarter basis?","Adena Friedman","So you\u2019re asking the question across the full segment? I just want to make sure. Okay. Yes, so I think that in terms of the overall growth of Market Tech where we continue to see very strong demand is frankly in existing clients taking on more of our services and some new clients signing up to take our services, particularly in the post-trade area, in the surveillance and risk management areas as well as some new trading clients that we\u2019ve been able to attract this year and then I would say that in our surveillance area.","So the SMARTS surveillance business continues to be a high grower for us. And that \u2013 and all of those pieces are included in order intake, in the order backlog. I think that in the third quarter, it\u2019s \u2013 you do have some vacation periods. It does slow down some of our clients from making decisions, but we have had some really good wins this quarter, most notably having a Tier 1 bank choose us to develop their foreign exchange trading system in addition to some post-trade wins with our clients.","So we are continuing to see very strong demand dynamics within the business. We do believe that the order backlog does reflect the potential for us to continue to show good organic growth in that business, and we continue to have great dialogue with our clients as we roll out the Nasdaq Financial Framework and other new services that will expand what we can do for them.","Michael Ptasznik","And as we mentioned on another call is as more of business continues to convert towards more of a SaaS recurring business, the order backlog number is maybe not as representative as it has been in the past. So we will be revisiting those measures in the future as we try provide you with some additional color or some alternative measures to help see how the growth of the businesses is coming along.","Sameer Murukutla","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Brian Bedell","Hi, great, thanks. Adena, maybe just a little bit more on the regulatory side of things. I mean, you mentioned obviously this sort of relook at Reg NMS. I guess, reasonably, in your view, how long would it take, and it\u2019s always tough to obviously gauge regulators, but how long do you think it would take to run through the pilot programs and the process of gauging how effective the pilots were and actually changing any kind of rules on market structure?","And also same thing on the Market Data set, and I know you know obviously Tom Wittman and Chris Concannon and Tom Farley put a letter together with some concerns on the access fee pilot. So just trying to gauge sort of a timing of how long that whole process might take and to what extent that would impact your business in a much more distant future than the near term?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well, our regulatory process, particularly SEC rule-making is a robust process. It goes through an extensive comment period. It goes through a lot of debates and discussions. And so I can\u2019t predict how long that type of process could take, but in prior experiences, it\u2019s been a multi-year experience to try to look at significant changes in market structure at the SEC. And I \u2013 what I\u2019m pleased about is that it does go through a robust process. They have to go through an economic review. They have to seek comments from the industry. They allow this \u2013 the industry to have a deep dialogue with the staff and with the commission.","And they do this in a way that\u2019s very overt and open to public comment as well, so that everyone kind of understands the process as it unfolds. But it is a long process and for good reason. These are important decisions to make. They are important to our U.S. capital markets and to the way that the system works. They are integrated and integral, so they \u2013 it\u2019s hard to take one part of a system and change it without having consequences to other parts of the system. So it is really important for them to be very careful in considering them. And I think they are.","So my experience has been, over many years of working with the SEC, is then they do take these things very seriously and they go through a very robust process. So I can\u2019t predict specific times, but it generally is a multi-year process.","Brian Bedell","That\u2019s great color. And then maybe on \u2013 back on the strategic review for the Public Relations and Digital Media. Obviously, you\u2019ll announce something when you have something. But if we were to sort of assume that business is sold, given the revenue and operating income metrics, $395 million of revenue, I think it\u2019s about 13% of or so of your nearly $1.5 billion of nontrading revenue, can you give us a sense of the growth rate of that piece of business? And assuming that slower growth, that would sort of automatically enhance your nontrading revenue? And then as you pivot towards investments in some of the faster-growth segments, could we see some upside to that mid-single-digit overall nontrading revenue long-term growth profile?","Adena Friedman","So the PR and the Digital Media businesses have been slow to no growers essentially. They\u2019re not growth areas for us. I think that part of that is because we focus very much on the IR component of those businesses because, of course, that\u2019s our inclination, using those services to interact with the capital markets and manage the public company components of working in the capital markets. I mean, I think that we are finding that we have a better opportunity to use our skills, our expertise and our strategic relationships with our clients to really \u2013 more on the intelligence side, the IR Insight, the advisory business, the board and leadership businesses.","So \u2013 and those are higher-growth businesses as a general matter than the PR and Digital Media businesses. In terms of the pivot, I mean, the goal of our strategic review is to find ways to elevate our growths rate to push ourselves towards the higher-growth businesses. And as we execute against that strategy, as I said earlier, we really do \u2013 we will be looking to assess our growth rates and provide you updated guidance or at least our long-term, medium-term outlook, I think that\u2019s what we call it, in terms of our revenue growth rates as we execute against that strategy.","And to the extent that we have completed the strategic review there and we\u2019ve got eVestment inside our organization, those will be the types of things that will drive us to reassess our growth rates.","Brian Bedell","Okay. So it\u2019s more like a next year type of potential change in that?","Adena Friedman","We are in the middle of execution today, so we\u2019ll see how things go.","Brian Bedell","Okay, okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Alex Blostein","Great. Thanks, good morning everybody. Just a couple of follow-ups around the operating leverage discussion, one kind of a specific question and one broader picture question. I guess, on the specific side, looking at Market Tech, this obviously remains a faster-growth area for Nasdaq. It sounds like you guys are going through near-term investments, but the margins are kind of in the 20%, 21% range for the last couple of quarters. How long do you guys think the elevated investments then will persist? And how should we think about incremental margin expansion opportunities in that particular segment?","And then I guess, the follow-up on a broader side of things, just, Michael, taking kind of your comments around expectations for expenses for next year, obviously too early to be too explicit. But can Nasdaq deliver operating leverage next year, assuming kind of mid-single-digit kind of revenue growth rates that you\u2019ve targeted in the past? Thanks.","Adena Friedman","Well, with regard to Market Tech, I think that we are making some very good investments in the technology. And as a technology business, you always have \u2013 you have to have some investment dollars. I think, yes, that we have to have some concentrated investment in \u2013 with the Nasdaq Financial Framework and some real investment in the SMARTS surveillance business and some of the new capabilities we\u2019re bringing there.","And so I think that, that will continue to have an impact on the expenses of the business in the near-term, as you mentioned. I think the question is can we deliver that into a more scalable business going forward, and that is most certainly the goal. As Michael mentioned, we are moving more of our revenue towards the SaaS model, recurring license model and trying to make it so that we also have a more hosted solutions over time. And we do believe that also will give us more operating leverage in that business.","So we do definitely have opportunities with these investments we\u2019re making to create operating leverage in that business. But it will always be an area that we invest in because there\u2019s always new technologies we can apply and provide for our clients. And so I think that\u2019s a general answer to Market Tech. You want to answer the expense question, Michael?","Michael Ptasznik","Yes, I would say with respect to the \u2013 with respect to whether we\u2019re going to have margin expansion or not, obviously that is the goal over the medium to long-term of the organization, to continue to, as Adena said, drive to double-digit TSR, continue to grow the business, grow the top line at a faster rate than the expenses, which should drive that margin expansion. So on a year-over-year basis, we don\u2019t give margin goals on a year-over-year basis, but that is the goal that we would have as an organization over the medium-term.","There\u2019s a number of things coming into next year like the eVestment, we talked about the impact of eVestment or the revenue impact of the acquisition there, what ends up having strategic review. So there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces with respect to next year and we don\u2019t provide that short-term guidance. But really, the focus is driving TSR and margin expansion over the medium to long-term.","Alex Blostein","Got it. All right, fair enough. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. You may begin.","Vincent Hung","Hi. Just a question on the SIP. So the SIP has seen numerous improvements in recent years, I guess mostly in latency. Given these improvements, did you ever see any impact on your proprietary data business? I\u2019m just trying to understand whether meaningful improvements in the SIP here could lead customers to find that proprietary data is redundant.","Adena Friedman","So the answer is no, we have not seen any impact on the demand for our proprietary data in relation to the improvements we\u2019ve made in the SIP and the latency there. I think that people see them as serving two different needs. So the SIP obviously as a basis for best execution. It\u2019s the foundation for interacting with the capital markets. The Depth fees allow for companies to have a lot of different strategies that they undertake to interact with those capital markets or to give clients just a bit a bigger and bigger picture of the market.","We generate revenues, as you can see, in our Depth fees across a whole range of clients, so you\u2019ve got nonprofessional users that get a chance to see Depth through their online brokers, you\u2019ve got professional institutional users that are using it to really get a sense of where the market is and where it\u2019s going. And then you also have the professional traders who are using it to actually interact and execute strategies in the market. So we have not seen any sort of shift in the demand characteristics as a result of improving the SIP latency.","Vincent Hung","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Herbert with Citi. You may begin.","Ben Herbert","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Adena Friedman","Sure.","Ben Herbert","Just on eVestment, could you provide a little more color on the competitive position and then how that might change or improve kind of plugged into your platform?","Adena Friedman","Well, I would say that eVestment today has a very strong competitive position. Bjorn Sibbern has been \u2013 who leads our Information Services business has been working very closely on the integration planning with the eVestment team. And we continue to be just incredibly impressed with the business, with the client, the interactions they have with their clients, with the level of distribution and penetration they have in the industry and kind of the unique nature of how they bring the information together and the analytics they can revise to every aspect of the investment management community.","So they have a very strong competitive position. I would say that they are relatively unique in how the data that they\u2019ve been collecting, the penetration in the market and the analytics that they generate and we would expect that our synergies with them are that we can probably bring even more advanced analytics to the data that they have. We have our Mutual Fund Quotation Service and we would expect to integrate that and potentially get more penetration of that service to their clients.","We have the potential to create new indices and other data products that are more generally available based on the public data that they collect. And so we just see great opportunity and synergy between the businesses to increase distribution, but also to deepen our relationships with the investment management community.","Ben Herbert","Thanks. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on Sybenetix. That $805 million backlog, would that include any backlog related to Sybenetix.","Adena Friedman","I would say \u2013 what we\u2019ve been saying is that the revenue \u2013 Sybenetix is a small company today. It definitely will include the backlog from Sybenetix going forward, but it doesn\u2019t suddenly create a significant change in backlog upon the closure of the deal.","Ben Herbert","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. You may begin.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, good morning. Just first question on the strong growth in Trade Management services. I know you cited in the slide deck an increase in customer demand for third-party connectivity in colo. We don\u2019t have any underlying stats on how the number of subscribers or users of these products has changed over time. But I\u2019m wondering if you could help us kind of bridge the gap between the higher customer demand that you\u2019re seeing for connectivity with, on the other side, kind of continued consolidation of market makers and high-frequency traders and that consolidating trends you need to accelerate more recently.","Adena Friedman","Well, we are \u2013 I mean, generally speaking, the client base in our TMS business has increased over time. We continue to see new participants actually coming in and asking for connectivity in addition to obviously the acquisitions create kind of a countertrend of that in some regards, but frankly we continue to have active sign-up and new clients coming in to support the TMS business. And it\u2019s basically in terms of also the growth that we\u2019ve gotten from Chi-X and the ISE integrations also have contributed to growth in that business as well.","Kyle Voigt","Okay. And then just as a follow-up on a prior question on the Treasury report and specifically the question related to the SIP, one of the recommendations was to move to a consolidator model to provide alternatives to the SIP. And I know it\u2019s a relatively broad recommendation and not many details were kind of in the recommendation, but just trying to understand that you would envision that model playing out? And how it could potentially impact the SIP data revenue pool for the industry as well as maybe some other products that already \u2013 that you had already compete with the SIP such as Nasdaq Basic.","Adena Friedman","So first of all, the multiple consolidator concept is not a new concept at all. It\u2019s been a concept that the industry has been discussing for a while. The UTP committee has had that as an open-agenda item for a while. So it\u2019s not a new concept. I think that it \u2013 as I said before, we have not objected to the concept of a multiple consolidator model so long as it does not place undue burden on the broker-dealer community or the exchanges to create it.","I think that it is \u2013 just so everyone understands, the SIP itself is its own technology contract. We \u2013 the MAR Market Technology business has a contract with the UTP committee to provide the SIP technology. In terms of having potentially a competing SIP, that\u2019s fine. I mean, that \u2013 the question is who else is going to pay for that? But that is not related to the Market Data revenue itself. The Market Data revenue itself and the pricing of that is done by the UTP committee and that would continue to be the case even if there are multiple SIPs distributing that data.","So I don\u2019t believe that would have an impact on the revenue, it would just create an alternative to the SIP. And I think that there have been discussions on multiple consolidators or just a distributed SIP model and we\u2019ve had, I think, productive dialogue on both of those ideas over time.","Kyle Voigt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may begin.","Alex Kramm","Hey, good morning. Just \u2013 I guess, coming back to that regulation topic that we\u2019ve been debating all day here. I think the bigger reason why we\u2019re having this debate is obviously because broker-dealers, customers are facing a hard time in seeing nontransaction costs in U.S. equities go higher and that doesn\u2019t, obviously, not just include Market Data, but also includes things like connectivity, colocation, port fees, et cetera. So to Kyle\u2019s question just now on the trade management fees, which is, I think, roughly $300 million per year trailing, how much of that is U.S. equities? Is there \u2013 what\u2019s the pricing dynamics there? And are you getting a lot of like questions or headwinds from clients on that part of the business? Because I think it\u2019s included in, I think, the bigger debate, right, so maybe some more color?","Adena Friedman","Yes. I mean, our overall TMS business includes a lot of \u2013 also is a very diversified business and it supports a lot of different asset classes. It also supports our Trader Reporting clearly and other things, so it is a diversified revenue stream itself. We do not separately disclose the components of that revenue stream. I think that generally speaking, the demand for overall just cabinet support, colo, things like that have been steady over time for the U.S. equities markets. We\u2019ve had growth in that business coming from some of the acquisitions, as I mentioned, with Chi-X and ISE and earlier with eSpeed.","So I think that we\u2019re growing by having more things \u2013 more exchanges, more asset classes traded through our data center in addition to having connectivity for equities and I would say a variety of different connectivity choices that we offer to all of our clients across asset classes. So we \u2013 we\u2019re not getting \u2013 I would say this, Alex, it\u2019s a very steady business. We work very productively with our clients. We continue to have actually new customers signing up for certain services in connectivity into equities in addition to other asset classes and it\u2019s a been a nice, strong part of our business.","Alex Kramm","That\u2019s fair enough. And then just very quickly for Michael, did you point out audit fees this quarter? I think in the press release you said it was a driver, but what\u2019s the number this quarter.","Michael Ptasznik","It was $8 million in this quarter. It was $4 million the same quarter a year ago.","Alex Kramm","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy with Raymond James. You may begin.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy","Hey, good morning. I was hoping you could provide an update on the U.S. listings competitive environment, I think both in terms of battling against the established competitor for some of the biggest IPOs and then battling against the new entrants in the spaces offering to waive five years of listing fees.","Adena Friedman","Well, first of all, we are really pleased with how the Listings have developed as we\u2019ve gone through the year. As we mentioned, in the third quarter, we had a 77% win rate. We\u2019ve had some great companies come and access the public markets over the quarter. And we continue to see a really nice strong pipeline of listings as we go through the rest of the year. So it does feel like the overall environment is picking up and we\u2019re \u2013 I think we\u2019re doing well competitively in winning IPOs and having some great companies choose to have Nasdaq as their home.","And so we\u2019re pretty pleased with how the dynamics are developing there. In terms of just overall competition, we compete vigorously for every IPO. We compete vigorously on getting companies to switch from our competitors to Nasdaq and we continue to find success in that area as well. And we respect all competitors and new entrants. We want to make sure that our clients are existing clients and any new clients fully understand the breadth and depth of Nasdaq as a listing exchange partner and the value proposition we offer, and I think we do believe that we have the best value proposition out there. So we\u2019re \u2013 we feel very good about how things are developing right now.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy","Got it, thanks. And then for my follow-up, you touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks, but can you expand on some of the ways that you might give a leverage to your eVestment client relationships to provide more services or products to active asset managers?","Adena Friedman","Well, the \u2013 I would say the core of their business today are asset \u2013 active asset managers in addition to alternatives and over time, some \u2013 more focus on the passive investors as well. But we do want to make sure that we look at how we can leverage the relationships they have there, the platform, the delivery mechanism to bring them more analytics that would help them manage their investment strategies in addition to be \u2013 making them competitive with each other. So I think that we are just at the beginning of our planning stages around that, but that certainly is part of the strategy.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I\u2019m currently showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Adena Friedman for closing remarks.","Adena Friedman","Great. Well, thank you very much. I think that as we look at all of the advancements in the third \u2013 the strong third quarter results, we feel that they have been achieved by advancing our core franchises\u2019 competitive position, coupled with driving growth in our technology, information and analytics businesses. The strategy that we articulated today will continue to gain momentum as we integrate the acquisitions, invest in our future and conclude our strategic reviews. And our refined capital allocation and continued focus on double-digit shareholder return will help ensure that our team and our shareholders remain aligned in the quarters and years ahead. So with that, thank you very much and I look forward to speaking with you all soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thanks for your participation.

[Operator Instructions].","I would now like to hand the call over to your speaker today Mr. Ed Ditmire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.","Ed Ditmire","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's third quarter 2019 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Michael Ptasznik, our CFO; John Zecca, our Chief Legal and Policy Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A.","The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.","I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations, and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I will now turn the call over to Adena.","Adena Friedman","Thank you, Ed. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us.","I\u2019m pleased to report Nasdaq financial results for the third quarter of 2019. Guided by our renewed strategic ambitions, we have been consistently focused on leveraging technological advancements to deliver for our clients, while creating sustainable value for our shareholders. That focus is reflected in today\u2019s strong results where we are seeing significant contributions from across the franchise.","My remarks today will focus on business unit highlights and strategic initiatives from the quarter as well as a brief commentary on the broader macroeconomic environment in which our businesses operate.","The third quarter experience its share of volatility as the world continues to grapple with the potential ramifications of Brexit, the U.S., China, trade negotiations, and more mixed macroeconomic signals.","While the environment present some uncertainties, the performance of the markets continue to reflect a risk on appetite. Among our clients, we see continuing demand for technology, data, and analytics, due to three longer-term trends, including first the competitive forces driving continuous demand for efficiency; second, the regulatory changes requiring more effective monitoring and surveillance, while protecting information and data privacy; and third, continuing pressure on all market participants to identify new alpha generating growth opportunities.","As we progress through the year, we've continued to experience those trends, with a few supporting factors in the third quarter. For instance, the attendance at our Nasdaq Surveillance Conference in Paris last week drew record numbers from a diverse range of attendees and focus specifically on what the future of trade surveillance looks like.","Market Technology order intake was strong during the third quarter through a combination of new customers and contract extensions with existing customers. We also continue to find new demand for our data products from customers coming to market and through geographic expansion outside the United States and the performance of the markets coupled with these general trends, particularly towards passive investment strategies continues to support our expanding Index business with AUM in ETPs benchmarked to Nasdaq\u2019s Proprietary Index products, reaching a new peak as investors continue to put their savings to work in higher return areas of the financial markets.","Examining the impact of the current macroeconomic environment on Nasdaq\u2019s markets related businesses, our core markets in the U.S. and Europe experienced strong share and healthy volumes in the quarter as volatility picked up with the macroeconomic and political backdrop.","Turning to the IPO environment, it remains quite active with Nasdaq\u2019s new issue pipeline standing at healthy levels as we finish 2019 and transition into 2020. We've seen a small number of high profile IPOs decided to postpone listings, while others have seen stock performance in the immediate aftermarket. But we are always quick to remind investors that the success of a company in the public markets is driven by the company's fundamental business and financial performance over time, not by the trading behavior in the first few days and months as a public company.","Additionally, every IPO has its own story. So it is hard to discern trend from a small sample set of specific situations. In fact, we continue to have productive and positive conversations with companies seeking to tap the public markets within the next year. They are however, rightfully increasingly focused on demonstrating to prospective investors the scalability of their business models and their plans to achieve profitability if they are not already profitable upon going public.","With that consideration, they remain enthusiastic about entering the public markets and gaining access to permanent equity capital.","Now moving on to our specific results, the third quarter of 2019 demonstrated how Nasdaq can achieve solid growth, while remaining efficient and disciplined in our execution. This has been a key tenet of our corporate strategy since we announced our strategic repositioning in 2017.","We delivered third quarter 2019 net revenue of $632 million, including 8% organic revenue growth from our non-trading segments. We\u2019re encouraged that our quarterly and year-to-date organic growth rates across our non-trading business segments remained consistent with our medium-term objectives, while the more trading sensitive Market Services business continues producing near multi-year highs.","Our financial achievements in that period were driven by solid growth in our expanded technology and analytics offerings, strong progress on deploying our next-generation market technology solutions, and enhancing our offerings to the private markets as well as maximizing the opportunities that our busy trading and IPO environment provides.","Turning to the segment\u2019s specific highlights from the third quarter. I'm pleased with the progress that we're seeing across all areas of our business. Our Information Services business saw an increase of 11% in revenue during the period. This was due to expanded contribution from our fast growing Investment Data & Analytics businesses, continued strong growth in our index business reflecting a 28% increase in the trading of Futures contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index, and a record $207 billion of ETP assets under management, tracking the Nasdaq indexes and continued growth of clients using our proprietary market data offerings.","During the quarter, we were excited to announce the launch of Nasdaq 100 Futures contracts on the Taiwan Futures Exchange, the first Nasdaq 100 Futures contract listed outside the United States.","We continue to see strong client traction also in our Market Technology segment. We saw revenues increase 24% from the prior-year period due to both January's acquisition of Cinnober as well as organic growth of 9%.","Our new order intake of $62 million included a multi-year contract extension with Bolsa Mexicana de Valores for Market Surveillance, a multi-year extension with the New Zealand Exchange for Trading and Surveillance Solutions, and the addition of a new exchange client in Southeast Asia who plans to adopt our next-generation Nasdaq Financial Framework Market Technology as well as our Surveillance Solution.","Our Corporate Services segment was lifted by another strong quarter of IPO wins, and an increase in subscriptions in our IR Intelligence Unit, where we're seeing multiple engagements around our recently introduced ESG Advisory Services for public companies.","During the period, Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges by welcoming 41 IPOs among 66 total new listings. The new listing highlights include the IPOs of Datadog, Peloton Interactive, and Afya, the latter of which is our third Brazilian listing in the last 12 months as well as the listing transfers of Interactive Brokers Group and Exelon Corporation to Nasdaq. Nasdaq\u2019s European exchanges added eight new listings, including four IPOs during the third quarter, with EQT Partners\u2019 IPO in Sweden becoming one of the largest Nordic offerings ever with a total raise of 12.8 billion Swedish kronor.","These results build on an outstanding year for Nasdaq listings business. In the first nine months, Nasdaq has won 76% of the 181 U.S. IPOs including six of the largest 10 and the IPOs that have come to Nasdaq have raised $27.5 billion in capital.","Also within the Corporate Services segment, we were pleased to acquire during the third quarter the Center for Board Excellence, a privately held provider of corporate governance and compliance solutions for Board of Directors, CEOs, Corporate Secretaries and General Counsels. By combining CBE with our Nasdaq governance solutions business, we aim to establish a leading provider of technology, research insights, and consultative services designed to advance governance excellence and collaboration at organizations role worldwide.","Nasdaq also made some significant strides in the Nasdaq Private Market, announcing during the quarter a partnership with PJT Partners Park Hill division, which is intended to leverage the Nasdaq Private Market to transform and modernize the process for executing private equity fund secondary transactions. We believe this is an exciting and unique used case for our private market center designed to bring greater standardization and efficiency to the secondaries market and appeal to general partners, limited partners and secondaries investors alike.","In Market Services our U.S. and Nordic equity and equity derivatives businesses capitalized on a healthy trading environment with strong market share. We're very pleased that our clients across our U.S. equities and options markets, as well as our Nordic markets are fully engaged with us to utilize our market capabilities to support the trading and investing strategies.","We\u2019re also encouraged to note a continued interest in ESG trading products and services. Just after the close of the third quarter, our European sustainable debt market in Stockholm surpassed 200 listed instruments, while trading in the OMXS30 ESG index future reached 1 million contracts after just one year on the market. These two milestones serve to underscore the Nordic region's leading position within sustainable finance, a position Nasdaq will continue to look to expand upon across our geographic reach in the quarters to come.","As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that the third quarter results served as further evidence that we can deliver on our strategic direction for our clients and our shareholders. We are encouraged by our momentum as we head into the final months of the year.","And with that, I will turn it over to Michael to review the third quarter financial details.","Michael Ptasznik","Thank you very much, Adena, and good morning everyone.","My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior-year period unless otherwise noted.","Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.","I will start by reviewing third quarter revenue performance as shown on Page 3 of the presentation and organic revenue growth on Pages four and 14.","The $32 million increase in reported net revenue of $632 million was a net result of organic growth of $37 million, including 8% organic growth in the non-trading segments. A $2 million net positive impact from acquisitions and divestitures and a $7 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.","I will now review quarterly highlights within each of our reported segments. I'll start with Information Services, which has reflected on pages five and 14 saw a $19 million or 11% increase in revenue. This is driven by $19 million or 11% organic growth, $4 million of which was a result of the Vestment\u2019s purchase price adjustment on deferred revenues in Q3 2018. Excluding this adjustment, organic growth would have been $15 million or 8%. In addition to the growth in index licensing revenue that Adena already mentioned, the increase was also driven by new sales of market data and analytics, as well as higher revenue from unreported data usage.","Market Technology revenue as shown on pages six and 14 increased $16 million, or 24%, including organic growth of $6 million or 9%. Organic growth during the period primarily reflects an increase in SaaS surveillance software revenues, an increase in the size and number of software delivery projects, and higher change requests and advisory revenues.","Turning to Corporate Services on pages seven and 14, revenues increased $3 million or 2%. Organic revenue growth was 3% or $4 million, reflecting an increase in the number of listed companies and higher revenues from our IR Intelligence offerings.","Market Services net revenues on pages eight and 14 saw a $4 million or 2% increase. Excluding the negative $4 million impact from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange, the organic revenue increase was $8 million or 4%. Organic growth during the period primarily reflects an increase in equities derivatives trading revenue, partially offset by declines in FICC.","Turning to pages nine and 14 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $6 million to $317 million. The change reflects an $11 million or 4% organic increase and a $1 million increase from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by $6 million favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. Third quarter 2019 non-GAAP operating expenses came in lower than we expected when we discussed our expense guidance in July due to factors including new hire timelines, which have lengthened incrementally, the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar as well as a modest expense reimbursement received in the quarter and certain other costs that were delayed.","Turning to Slide 10, we are lowering our 2019 non-GAAP operating expense guidance range to $1.285 billion to $1.295 billion, which implies a range of $325 million to $335 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.","The new full-year guidance centers on an organic expense growth level of less than 2%. The anticipated sequential pickup in fourth quarter 2019 expenses is consistent with a 4% average sequential increase we experienced in prior fourth quarter periods. This reflects the impact of both product and other initiative spending, as well as some seasonal pickup of certain expenses such as marketing, compensation, and peak seasonal revenue related costs.","Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased $26 million in the third quarter of 2019. And the non-GAAP operating margin was 50% up two percentage points from the prior year period. The increase in part reflects the benefits from a business model that is becoming more scalable as we evolve. We have strategically pivoted to reorient our product and business portfolio toward more SaaS offerings and continue to make investments in our technology platform that we expect to provide for greater operating leverage. We continue on that journey today. And as part of that, we are initiating a restructuring plan that principally focuses on certain elements of our technology platform, particularly as we execute and accelerate our evolution within our technology and analytics offerings.","Given the inflection point that the company has reached with NFF, certain elements of our legacy marketplace infrastructure and technology product offerings will be retired as we transition and further implement NFF internally and externally. As a result of these actions, the company expects to incur $65 million to $75 million in pre-tax GAAP charges over the next two years, including $30 million recognized in the third quarter.","The charges are related principally to non-cash items such as asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation as well as third-party consulting costs. The impact of restructuring plan will be excluded from our non-GAAP reporting.","Separately in the third quarter of 2019, we recognized a $20 million non-cash provision associated with the industry's Consolidated Audit Trail or CAT initiative. This charge is a consequence of changes to the Consolidated Audit Trail project. In particular, the consortium\u2019s decision to impair the value of technology built by the original vendor who has subsequently been replaced.","Net interest expense was $26 million in the third quarter of 2019, a decrease of $9 million versus the prior period due to lower debt balances and the refinancing of the 5.55% $600 million U.S. denominated bond with a new 1.75% \u20ac600 million Euro bond.","The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 27% and for the full-year 2019, we continue to expect the non-GAAP tax rates to be between 26% and 27%.","Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the third quarter 2019 was $212 million or $1.27 per diluted share compared to $189 million or $1.13 per diluted share in the prior year period.","Turning to capital on Slide 11, debt decreased by $11 million versus Q2 2019, primarily due to an $84 million decrease in the Euro note book value caused by changes in FX rates partially offset by $72 million net borrowing of commercial paper.","Our total debt to EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.6 times, down from 2.7 times after the second quarter of 2019.","During the third quarter of 2019, the company returned $150 million to shareholders through a share repurchase program and paid a common dividend in the aggregate of $78 million. In the first nine months of 2019, the company returned $428 million to shareholders through dividends and\/or share repurchase program. Continuing our commitment to capital return, yesterday our board authorized an additional $500 million for our existing share repurchase program.","Thanks for your time and I'll turn it back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neil. Your line is now open.","Rich Repetto","Yes, good morning, Adena and good morning, Mike. I guess the question is on market technology, you continued to see solid performance there and the ARR went up as well as the pipeline. But I guess the question is that percentage of ARR to the annualized revenue is trickling down. And I\u2019m just trying to understand is that -- I know it's made up a change the difference made up a change fees and other non-recurring revenue. Is that a good thing that the percentage is going down? How should we interpret that?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Thanks Rich and it's great to hear from you. So in terms of the way that we look at ARR and the pipeline that obviously gives you a sense of how well the company is continuing to find new clients and how well we're developing in terms of our recurring revenue streams. But we do -- you will see ebbs and flows of that percentage to overall revenue quarter-by-quarter based on how many shorter term change request types of revenue that we end up bringing in. And in the third quarter, we did have some of that in the third quarter. And so therefore, you might have seen some shifts in the overall kind of composition. But that's going to -- that's going to ebb and flow quarterly, but it should not indicate a trend.","Rich Repetto","Okay. And my semi-related follow-up would be your debt to EBITDA ratios now at sort of the target level. And are you comfortable, I guess with this sort of payout ratio. And what should be the -- I guess the trend of what the dividend buybacks, et cetera, are going for capital return going forward?","Michael Ptasznik","Yes, thanks Rich. So we're going to stick with our capital plan that we've disclosed, which is we obviously going to number one invest in a great opportunities continue to grow the business that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Secondly, we're going -- we have a dividend policy that says that we will grow our dividend, as earnings and cash flow grow over time. Third, we're going to primarily use buybacks to offset any dilution from any equity programs that we have. And then, fourth, we want to maintain our investment grade rating. And so those are the way we think about our capital priorities.","If the cash continues to build up over time, and we -- since we're such a strong cash flow business, then -- and we don't see any good investments or opportunities in the short-term or the foreseeable future, then we will look to return that cash to shareholders. But that's not going to be a quarterly thing. It's going to be something that will evolve over time. And so we'll continue to take a look at the horizon. And if we doesn't look like we have something further out, then we will look to return that cash to shareholders through buyback.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Michael Carrier","Right. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I guess maybe just on the tech plan. You mentioned some of the charges related to migrating to the new platform. I guess, just on the on the positive side when you think over the next few years as this process takes place, what are some of the benefits that you expect to realize over time?","Adena Friedman","Sure, yes. So as Michael mentioned, the restructuring plan is really meant to help us migrate and transition to the new technology both from architect and for our internal market. So I think it's important to recognize that we're really looking at how we can deploy the Nasdaq financial framework across our markets as well as continuing to provide and expand our offerings to our other market tech clients.","And so I think that when we look at the benefits that we can provide to our customers across our own markets, it creates more flexibility in terms of the ability for us to enhance our products over time. It also creates a common technology stack across all of our markets, which we now operate in multiple stacks today within the U.S. versus Europe. It makes it so that we have -- we obviously hope to achieve a more efficient technology organization by having one technology underpinning and one technology architecture that supports those markets and market tech.","And then also from a from the client's perspective, it does allow us to be more nimble in terms of giving them new features, applying, bringing more data and data analytics and potentially algorithmic capabilities into our markets platform. And over time, we also -- this platform, as you know, can be deployed in the cloud. So it gives us the opportunity to start to think about that for our future. I think within market tech, we are already deploying clients in the cloud using the Nasdaq financial framework. And we will be retiring other systems over the next several years as we move some of our clients on -- more and more of our clients on to the next-generation platforms. ","So it's really meant to position ourselves, Mike, to be able to take advantage of the technology that we're bringing to life. And I do think it will create efficiencies, better efficiencies, operational efficiencies in terms of technology build and deployment times better feature function capability and more flexible infrastructure for both us and our clients.","Michael Carrier","Right, that's helpful. And Michael just a real small and just on the data, business revenue seemed a little stronger. I think you mentioned something on audit, but if you wanted to just quantify that.","Michael Ptasznik","Yes, we did have a stronger audit or recovered -- have reported usage this quarter so it was $9 million this quarter.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Michael Ptasznik","It was $4 million in last year, the same period last year and $6 million last quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kwun Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Kwun Lau","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Recently, Adena, you mentioned that the regulators can make the public market more inviting compared to the private markets. I guess, what does it take for us to get there? What is a good way for market participants to encourage the regulators to kind of review the current disclosure requirements for public companies?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well, I think that the foundation of the public market is a disclosure regime. And we do believe that that generally works. So I think the focus that the regulators we've asked regulators to have on these disclosures though is disclosures that are really meant to support an investor's ability to make an informed financial decision. Sometimes there are, frankly politics that come into the mix. And then creep into the disclosure obligations that really aren't meant to be helpful to investors, but helpful to frankly, further certain political ambitions. And so we want to try to make sure that the disclosure regime really stays true to what it's meant to support, which is employee and IM, investor information. ","I think the second thing though, is that there are other elements of the public market that make it so that if you are have ready access to capital in the private market, are you ready to come into the public markets? And the few things that we hear certainly are the issues around the proxy process, the issues around the resubmission thresholds for proxy proposals. The -- I would say the nature of the proxy advisory firms and some conflicts of interest there as well as lack of disclosures that they have around how they manage their recommendations and proxies as well as the litigation regime and other things that come with going -- with selling -- going public.","And so we are working very closely with the regulators. And on the Hill, there's a receptive audience to a lot of what we're proposing, but obviously it's a process. And, we have seen some real action and movement, both in Congress and at the SEC as they're examining these issues and trying to find a balance between making sure you are properly protecting investors, but you're also creating a more inviting environment for companies and we've been very supportive of what they've been doing.","Kwun Lau","That's very helpful. A follow-up question related to market tech. So revenue and organic growth was strong, ARR increased, and operating margin went up to 18% from 10% quarter-over-quarter. How should we think about the margin going forward? With bands around because you will continue to retire at the Sunset O [ph] system and make new investment in Nasdaq financial framework or you can list the whole margin at this level. Thank you.","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well, what we've been saying to investors and we continue to say is, is that we've been in a period of strong investment in the Market Technology business, which over the last couple of years has brought down the margins, we will continue to make investments.","But as we continue also to grow the business and move our clients to a more efficient platform, we do believe that we will be able to start to show some margin improvements in 2020 and 2021. And the idea is though to get ourselves into a more staff orientation in the delivery of our services to our clients and even when we are providing on-prem services, can we be more of a managed service provider to them over time on using the next-gen platforms. Those things, in addition to just being more efficient and being able to deliver services to our clients should allow us to start to show some margin improvement in the coming years.","But we also say that quarter-over-quarter is not really a good way to look at the overall margin to the market tech business, we tend to look at things in periods of years just because there can be various things that impacted quarter\u2019s results. So if we're in a period of heavy implementation for clients that can sometimes bring down the margin in a quarter, but if we also have more shorter-term revenue coming in that could bring up the revenue for the quarter and the margin for the quarter. So it to me it's better for you to look at it year-over-year. And I think we're hoping to be able to demonstrate a trend over in the coming years towards higher margins.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is now open.","Chris Allen","Good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about just the longer-term impact around the tech replatforming moving to context, how they should translate to expense savings over the longer-term. So just wonder if you could maybe provide us any color how the kind of the new platform will compare for technology expense run rate versus kind of the current platform?","Adena Friedman","Well, I think that just the ability for us over the coming years, and it will take time, I do want to say both in terms of moving our own markets onto the platform, we're going to do this in a very measured way, we're going to take time to make sure that we are working with our clients, bringing them onto the platform and then managing it across the multiple markets we have in the United States and Europe.","So it will take time, I think it's important to recognize it. It's been measured in years, not months or quarters. But also so when we\u2019re moving on to a single platform, just the ability for us to operate on a single technology, infrastructure, and architecture should provide us efficiencies. The ability for us to implement changes faster with less effort should provide efficiencies. And over time, we can also look at how we want to manage our infrastructure and how we can create synergies or efficiencies by moving some or all of our capabilities to the cloud in the future. But that's definitely more future oriented.","I think that in terms of the market tech business, we also are able to start to move people to a more common architecture and platform. And that also will provide efficiencies to us, as well as efficiencies to our clients. And if we also then become more of a managed service provider and a SaaS provider of services that is definitely more efficient for our customers, but that also creates revenue opportunities for us as well. So those are the areas that we're focused on in terms of the benefits that this technology platform migration will provide us.","Chris Allen","And just a quick follow-up on the expenses, can you provide the magnitude of the expense reimbursement that was noted and also the color on what the $10 million in mergers strategic initiative, what that is related to? Thank you.","Michael Ptasznik","Sorry, can you just repeat the question.","Adena Friedman","Yes, can you repeat the question we\u2019re just trying to make sure we are going to answer the right question, sorry.","Chris Allen","Yes, in fact in the comments, I believe you noted that there was a positive legal and expense reimbursement this quarter. So I was just wondering what the magnitude was in terms of dollar costs, and then the $10 million mergers strategic initiatives, any color on that specifically related to?","Michael Ptasznik","Yes, sorry Chris. So the expense reimbursement was in $1 million to $2 million range for the quarter and then in the $10 million that's related to the initiatives that we were executing on, which is the sale of the BWise business as well as the acquisition of Cinnober so -- and Quandl. So that's, that's what's included in there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.","Alex Kramm","Hey, good morning. I think quick ones from me, first one on the equities pricing. I think you highlighted volume tiers and strong volumes. But 10% sequential drop is obviously pretty big. So any more color, what exactly is going on there and then also quarter-to-date? Maybe if that net back a little bit or what -- what we should be thinking about as we think about all models going forward?","Adena Friedman","Sure. So I think that within the quarter we did have, we definitely saw the composition of our clients, and therefore the tiers. So it's really, it's a multifactor calculation in terms of looking at overall capture rates. So it has to do with overall volumes, and therefore every firm being more likely to hit tiers. But then also the composition of clients, and who's coming in and leveraging the market and what kind of tiers they are able to achieve.","And so I think and then on top of that the share. So if you have higher sharing, you're getting just more activity in the market, it's likely that people will then will also hit tier. So I think there has been minimal changes to our pricing, but as you know, we are always looking to tweak our pricing to make sure that we are attracting flow into our market but we're also managing our overall client relationships there and but there hasn't been any -- there hasn't been anything dramatic impacting the quarter. And I would say we are always looking to manage that the right way and but we don't have anything specific to discuss in terms of looking at the fourth quarter.","Alex Kramm","Okay, thank you. And then staying within market services, the kind of more recurring line item they are the trading services, trade management services. Now flat year-over-year that was probably a little bit of a negative FX impact but despite all that, obviously no growth and I guess it makes sense with end markets and limited growth in market making firms et cetera. But is there anything coming up that can help that again, I mean new initiatives, new services, maybe something in Europe that that can actually drive some growth again here because this is, I mean, it's a pretty big revenue item for you and we don't talk about it a lot. Thank you.","Adena Friedman","Yes, no it\u2019s a good question. It is a very stable part of our business. But when we look at the ins and outs, I think what we see every month actually is new clients coming in and taking more ports or opening up new capabilities, and then other clients deciding that they're going to dial back on certain things. So it's really kind of a mix underneath it, underneath the total number, where certain customers are spinning up new strategies and other customers are changing their strategies.","So and then we have had some consolidation of firms not so much this year, but we saw more of that last year that's flowing through this year. So it's maintained stability, but it hasn't been a grower for us.","In terms of looking at into the future, I think that we are always working to make sure we provide the right environment for our clients. We want to make sure it's affordable to come in and trade on Nasdaq. So we don't look to make major changes there to make sure that we are creating a very strong, very, very attractive way to come into the market. But at the same time, then getting the revenue impact from higher share as well as from more listed companies coming in et cetera. So it's kind of a means to an end, I would say.","There isn't anything specific, Alex, that we're planning on that I could -- that I can talk about that is -- that would really drive that to a different state to be honest, it's definitely we've considered a low-single-digit grower for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alex Blostein","Hey, good morning, everybody. A question with respect to recent changes by the e-brokers obviously taking commission on equity trading and ETFs to zero. Just curious how you guys think it could impact the ecosystem and then specifically with respect to market data, I know there's always some pressure on that but it feels like right now it's going to become a little bit more pronounced given the half year revenue hole to makeup. So maybe help us size kind of how meaningful market data revenue contribution for you guys from the likes of Ameritrade, E*Trade, Schwab, IBKR? And how should we think about the rest of that revenue pool?","Adena Friedman","So I think that if we look at the broader ecosystem first, I think that it seemed to us that it was interesting to watch how it all played out. But I think that we've gotten a sense that that there were definitely expectations over time that those pieces continue to decline. I think the rise of obviously Robinhood and the level of participation the Robinhood broker has definitely I think created; the people have been preparing or planning for this.","And you've seen that the e-brokers have been diversifying or many of them are diversifying their revenues in recent years, to be able to be prepared for a lower fee environment.","In terms of the impact of the decision to kind of wave that kind of went through. I think that's the whole ecosystem is still evaluating how that will impact things. But when we look at own markets, we get very little direct order flow from retail brokers today; they tend to go through the wholesalers.","I think the payment for order flow regimes are I'm sure will be examined. But at the same time -- at the same time they're doing this, they also have new disclosure obligations on best execution. And that I think, that is going to be a big determinant factor as to how the overall brokers look at managing their order flow going forward, they're likely to want to have more clarity on the definition of Nasdaq because it's a pretty vague definition today.","And but they know that they have this obligation, so that their ability to manage their order flow, they have best experts [ph] on everything. So they hopefully will also see opportunities potentially to bring more flow directly into the market under that and as well as make sure that they continue to spread their flow to make sure they're achieving the best execution. So all of that is going to be an interesting thing to play out. We actually see some opportunities that could come on the back of that.","In terms of the market data side, we work very closely with all of the retail brokers to make sure that they are optimizing their data costs. We have lower costs proprietary products that they can use in many of the circumstances that their clients need market data for. So it's really up until the point of trade they are allowed to use substitutes to the SIP data. And we provide much lower cost products to the consolidated tape, and we have enterprise cap so that they can therefore really leverage that and make sure that they know they don't have an ever escalating costs as they are driving more participation into their systems. And we work very closely with them to make sure that they're balancing the need for the consolidated tape in certain circumstances, but on the choices that they have for proprietary data. So we actually don't see a significant change or anything from this because we already are working with them to try to make sure that they have efficient options and that they're deploying them the right way.","Alex Blostein","Got it. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up question around the restructuring. Michael I think you said $65 million to $75 million in pre-tax GAAP charges over the next couple of years. Can we get the breakdown, what's going to be the write-down versus accelerated depreciation? And then ultimately, how much in incremental CapEx we will be thinking about going forward as you guys build out the new systems?","Michael Ptasznik","Yes, so we don't have the specific breakdown, but the majority of the expense will come through either write-down or accelerated depreciation. So the combination of the two and it's really about when the platforms roll off. And so the $30 million that we saw this quarter, a big chunk of that was the write-down aspect of it and a good portion of the rest will be accelerated depreciation plus another one-time cost that we have as part of the implementation. So that's with respect to that and we don't have any -- doesn't have any material impact on the depreciation run rate that we've seen this quarter. And we'll just for -- when we give the guidance for next year, we'll build into that whatever the impact would be for the depreciation of the investment going forward.","Adena Friedman","And I also say from a CapEx perspective, you\u2019ve seen, you can kind of see how we've been managing CapEx for the last three years as we've been building this platform and will continue to manage our CapEx to make sure that we're being efficient in how we're building it. But that the CapEx does exist today already reflects a lot of the work that we're already -- that's underway, and that will continue.","Michael Ptasznik","There shouldn't be a huge step up in, don't expect a huge step up in the depreciation amortization list because we're transitioning from one system to the other. And that's what some of this is, is the amortization. So we don't have a doubling up of that amortization expense in that period.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Chris Harris","Thanks, good morning. There's been a lot of change in the Corporate Solutions business over the last couple of years. And it's in further movement in that segment this past quarter. Can you remind us just high level, what are the primary businesses left in Corporate Solutions and longer-term what are your expectations for growth?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well, in Corporate Services in general, we have our listings business, and then we have our IR intelligence business, and we have our governance solutions business. And so those are the three key elements of the Corporate Services business unit. And as you can see, we are making sure that we provide the best possible products and services to support companies as they're coming into the public market with their new stakeholder base, which are investors, as well as managing to an increasingly complicated governance structure as a public company. And so those that's why these are kind of strategically aligned with who we are as an exchange but these services are offered to companies all around the world regardless of where they live.","In terms of some of the work we've been doing to shore up and create new services, what we\u2019re really focusing on is how can we advise our clients and provide products and services that help them deal with the changing environment. ESG is a big growing trend within the industry with among investors. So we've been building out a capability really a consultative capability. And we will look at how we can also bring products into that mix to provide more solutions for our clients as they're managing increasing disclosure obligations against ESG.","And then on the governance side, we made a small acquisition this quarter that really adds a lot of advisory and consultative services as well as really good tools to handle things like board surveys, director surveys, things that really help them manage their public company board. And we can then over time look at integrating that into our board portal solution so that it creates a more all-in solution. But we're going to make sure that we manage that in a way that is in a really value additive to our clients. But those are the types of things that we're doing to continue to build out and grow those businesses in connection with our listings business.","Michael Ptasznik","And the overall growth target for that business over the medium-term is 3% to 5%.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Adena, can you just give us a little bit of a refresh on where we stand in the market data regulatory through battle with the SEC and also the XSV pilot and then any thoughts on the timing of when members exchange just to come to market, are you hearing any commentary having any conversations about that eventuality with clients?","Adena Friedman","Sure. Well on the market data and accuracy pilots, just from our process perspective. With the accuracy pilots, there was a hearing a couple weeks of ago now. So it's kind of sitting in the court hands to determine the outcome there. I think we feel confident that we gave very good arguments. So I think us and our exchanges, did a nice job of demonstrating from a procedural perspective why we believe this pilot requires more review and evaluation by the SEC, and we'll see how that -- how the court -- what the court decides on that.","In terms of market data. We're just now in the process of starting to put together some of the briefs that the court will then consider in the first half of next year. And so that's a process that is still ongoing. So that's just from a process perspective.","I would say from a point of view perspective. We on the market data side, we continue to provide more and more disclosures to our clients and to everyone around how our market data revenue is defined, how it's changed over the years, what's driven improvements and increases in our market data revenues. And as we did put out a very comprehensive what we call MythBusters piece that shows that revenue increases over the last 10 years in our market data business, only 2.4% of our overall revenue increases CAGR has come from price changes, whereas the rest of the growth has come from new customers and new products and then further penetration in our existing clients.","And we break that out in a lot of detail in this piece. And then we also provide other facts and figures that really helps support the fact that we are, we believe very, very focused on delivering great value to our clients at a reasonable price. And I think our actions have been -- our actions have been consistent with that. And so we will continue to provide that type of information to clients, so that they can make a more informed decision as to how they look at us as a provider of market data to them.","And then lastly, on NYMEX, we don't have any more information than you do. So we are here running our business, we will be prepared for any competition that comes along. And that's the way we operate here.","Brian Bedell","That makes sense. So it sounds like predict the market data and accuracy that you are talking about, still talking about the distant future from any kind of implementation of anything, if that. So, still nothing really impacting even 2020 at this stage from?","Adena Friedman","Yes, it\u2019s hard to know. I mean, I think that we have on the accuracy pilot, we've made our case and we'll see how it goes. And we may get a decision before the end of this year. And then there would be whatever is decided then would just flow through the next part of the process, which will take some time.","On the market data, I think it's still months away before we kind of understand our kind of our case in the court.","Brian Bedell","Great. And then Michael just on the market tech revenue side, I know your fourth quarter is always seasonally strong for that business. If you could just I know give us an insight of whether we think that's going to continue to be the case for this fourth quarter, and you mentioned the Southeast Asian, when is -- when do you expect the revenue to come in from that client, and just a quick progress update on non-financial clients. And it's been a big, long-term growth initiative.","Michael Ptasznik","Yes, so I'll start with the first one, I'll let Adena talk a bit -- first two and then I'll let Adena talk a bit about the financial markets. So on the quarter, so we would expect to see typical seasonality, I will say that we did. Normally we see an increase in change request in the fourth quarter due to timing of budgets, et cetera. We did see some of that comes through in the third quarter this year. It's hard to quantify that amount in totality.","But I would say that there was, say $2 million to $3 million of additional revenue that we would have seen -- that we saw in the third quarter that you typically would have expected to see in the fourth quarter. So that did happen this year.","And then on the Southeast Asia, I don't think it will have any material impact specifically that one client. I just wanted to flow through. And so it will just be, just think about that with the rest of the modeling that you do, and then Adena on the new markets?","Adena Friedman","Yes, and I would just say on any new client now, we start to recognize revenue as soon as we start building for them and start deploying, and so with that particular client, to the extent that it's going to be a cloud-based service, it's going to be structured more as a subscription service. And it will be -- it will start to be at a charge that once we start work with them, just kind of how their revenue recognition works.","And on new markets, I think that we continue to be very optimistic around how we can deploy our technology outside the traditional capital markets. And we have had some recent news in terms of some areas, some opportunities for us in the betting space. We continue to engage very well with clients in other industries that we just don't have anything specific this quarter to disclose. But we definitely are seeing behind the scenes a lot of good activity as people are starting to think about how to use two sided markets as a means to support pricing and to bring their clients into the decision making around pricing. And it's been a really interesting and I would say very encouraging start to that initiative.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is now open.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Adena, you've done a good job of getting to kind of shift earnings mix of the company and building out this analytics business, divesting some of the non-core slower growth assets. Just when you're looking at the collection of assets at Nasdaq today, do you still think there's opportunity to accelerate the strategic pivot further through divesting additional assets? Or was that something that's already been reviewed and executed upon when you first announced that pivot two years ago?","Adena Friedman","Sure, well, we actually do a review every year now just to understand the overall composition of our business, where we're continuing to make the right investments in these businesses, what maybe non-core going forward, which may have been core in the past. And so I would just say that it is a continuous process today.","We don't have anything specific to discuss here. But I think that you should assume that we're always understanding and evaluating how we\u2019re developing the businesses and how we can make sure we're providing the right value to our clients. And if we don't feel like we can provide the right value to our clients, then we should look at how we -- whether or not we should continue to own that business and I think BWise is actually a good example of that. So we made that decision and we executed that here in this year because of the fact that, it's a great product and it's a great service to our clients, but the space was changing. It's a pretty small asset in the enterprise risk management space in a space that was consolidating. So we either needed to really kind of decide to lean in and invest more in the business and potentially make other further acquisitions there, or find a new home for where they could have it as part of a roll-up strategy and provide better, better ongoing service to the clients.","And we made the latter decision because just we decided it was not core to who we are, wasn't core to our corporate relationships. And we wanted to make sure that we were prioritizing our investment in areas that we see more growth prospects for us, notably the Nasdaq Financial Framework, Market Tech, and our data business. And therefore, that's why we made that decision. So that's the kind of thing we do, but we're not going to do that every quarter, every period but we will consistently look at our portfolio over time.","Kyle Voigt","Okay, thank you. And then just a clarification question on the retiring of some of those marketplace infrastructure offering. Could you just provide some more details as to how that works operationally, with your market tech clients that may be utilizing that technology today, are those clients forced to migrate to the Nasdaq Financial Framework? And then just from a timing standpoint, could you kind of help frame in that market technology business when you'd expect a kind of majority of those market tech clients to be kind of migrated onto Nasdaq Financial Framework in a technology infrastructure?","Adena Friedman","Sure. So we do not we're not in the business of forcing clients, we really do. We take a very customer friendly approach to this. We do walk in as they have contract renewals and they're thinking about making changes or upgrades to their market, we walk through and talk to them about what their choices are. And we then allow them to make their own decisions. And we give them a range of choices. So they can understand that they could stay on certain platforms for a period of time, there may be some periods well into the future where we really do start to try to be, I would say more prescriptive but right now what we're saying is, there's a huge opportunity for you to enhance your capabilities to provide better data management inside your organization to get potentially over time to a lighter footprint, as your markets continue to evolve and to future proof your market.","And on the back of that, we have found that I think 50% of new sales to has been onto the Nasdaq financial framework, but not all of them. And so we're still evolving our capabilities. And with that evolution, we think that we'll be able to increase that number over time. But this is something that you should assume happens in slow motion. And we said that from the very beginning, it will take many years for us to work with our clients to move them more towards the unified solution, and we will be patient around it, so that we manage our client relations along the way.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.","Alex Kramm","Hey, I think my follow-up just got answered. But just very quickly on a separate topic, then can you just very briefly talk about the relationship with PJT in the secondary, I guess for the equity stake market, you mentioned briefly, but maybe just run through the revenue model and how we should be thinking about the TAM, I think this is probably a very long-term opportunity. But just how you\u2019re thinking about it financially?","Adena Friedman","Sure. So yes, we are actually really excited about that partnership. And it does provide a true near-term revenue opportunity for the Nasdaq private market based on the partnership agreement we signed. So, it will allow PJT is today the largest provider of what we call GP lead secondary. So when a general partner decides to manage a secondary transaction, one of their funds, they tend to use brokers to help facilitate that and PJT or Park Hill is the largest among these GP sponsored brokers. And so we are working with them, they're finding that they are actually hitting a wall in terms of their ability to facilitate these deals just based on the manual processes involved and the length of time it takes to facilitate the secondaries.","And so they see us as actually an enabler for them to be able to handle more volume, more capabilities. And when we look at how many GP led sponsored secondaries that occurred in private equity last year, I think it was in the range of $40 billion. Yes, so it's probably in the range of $30 billion to $40 billion changed hands in the context of GP sponsored secondaries. The overall secondaries market last year in private equity was $80 billion so that includes those LP led and GP led secondaries.","And I think that, so we definitely see this is actually as a large total market opportunity for us. We are already working with them on an initial program. We've been working very closely to integrate our technology with them. And so we do think that we will be able to provide some immediate benefit to them and to their clients in 2020. So very excited about it.","Alex Kramm","Okay. And then actually, my original follow-up very briefly, I apologize if you mentioned it. But in terms of the transition to NFF, it sounds like some of your existing clients are definitely doing the transition. How -- do you have any numbers? Maybe you\u2019ve mentioned this, like how many of your clients have not transitioned? And maybe what kind of economics, you've been picking up both on the revenue and on the margin side, if they have transitioned I know it's probably a small sample so far, but any color would be great. Sorry if you answered this already.","Adena Friedman","Yes, we haven't provided any disclosures on differences in margins and revenues yet, I think that that's something we will take back and think about. I think that in terms of overall client migrations among our existing clients, it's still a pretty small number, but actually, it's been really interesting. So some of our larger clients are moving towards that platform, so they might take it for instance the Australian Stock Exchange is looking at deploying components of the Nasdaq Financial Framework into the next-gen trading system. And so some of our larger clients are understanding where the benefits come from. We have several new clients that have signed up for us to provide clearing services in the context of that, we are actually building out and deploying our next-gen clearing solution on to NFF and then delivering it to them.","So that but that is something we're in the process of building and deploying, so that won't be, these are longer-term projects. And they take -- generally take 18 months to two years to complete. So we have some significant size clients moving on to the platform, and then the new clients, so certainly the new bedding client, we mentioned last quarter, as well as the client we mentioned in Southeast Asia. They're just natively going on to the Nasdaq Financial Framework as new customers. So we don't -- we have not yet provided like stats and details and we'll take that back as a feedback from you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Mike, just a question on expenses, R&D expenses continue to track lower this year. Can you talk about what initiatives that are coming in lower than expected? And then I apologize if you gave this, but have you given kind of the initial framework to think about 2020 expenses, and what how we should think about growth into next year?","Michael Ptasznik","Sure. So on the initiatives, we continue to invest in all the initiatives that we have on the programs, I think, going back to my earlier remarks, some of that is really just a matter of hiring and bringing in the bodies in order to build out those initiatives is taking a little bit longer than we originally had anticipated, which is what's causing the reductions and there's not one specific initiative and where there's been a cut back on.","I would say, if anything, we're very excited about the opportunities there and there's more initiatives that are coming in the door. We look to want to continue to invest within that what we call our Nasdaq next R&D bucket. And so it\u2019s premature for us to be giving any sort of forward guidance for next year at this point in time. Again we've been around that 3% mark and of our total revenue, and we will continue to look at how much R&D, we want to continue to invest in the business. It is an important driver of our long-term growth, we believe and as I said, we're excited about a number of the different initiatives that we have across the organization. But we'll be providing much more color in our next quarter\u2019s results. So stay tuned.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Adena Friedman for any closing remarks.","Adena Friedman","Thank you. Well, in closing, we are very encouraged by our third quarter results and how it underscores our ability to execute on our new strategic direction. We will remain focused on delivering results against our 2019 priorities as we finish out the year. So thank you very much for your time today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

I'd like to start by just refreshing everybody's memory with respect to third quarter 2011. That was a quarter where external geopolitical events created higher volatility and volume in the markets. Compared to the third quarter 2011, the third quarter 2012 in both the U.S. and Nordic equity businesses had volume down over 30%.","In that context, our non-GAAP EPS of $0.62 is outstanding. It represents a 7% decline when we had 30% decline in equity volume. When we look at our performance, this strong performance, a major contributor was the high proportion of subscription and recurring revenues that is existent in our business models. That percent is now at 71% of total revenues and these revenues actually grew 2% year-over-year in this tough environment. Now when see $0.62, and again, in the context of the volumes we see in the marketplace, the question we frequently receive from analysts and investors is, \"In the face of this continuing pressure in equities, how do we continue to perform at such a high level?\"","As previously mentioned, recurring revenue is a major factor, but more important is the many innovative actions taken by our business leaders and colleagues that individually are not typically large enough to be noticed in the context of a quarterly report, but collectively, over time, serve to reinvigorate and reinvent our business model.","I would like to highlight several of these innovative, dynamic actions. I'll start first with N2Ex. This is our U.K. operation, which has 3 separate routes to the power market: a continuous 24\/7 market, a business aid clearing platform for over-the-counter trades and a daily auction for day-ahead power.","We are now the reference point for the underlying spot price. We bring the magic of price discovery to the U.K. power marketplace. Becoming the place where the reference price is determined is a definable asset that we will monetize increasingly over time. Our efforts continue to gain traction, and we are actually outperforming internal expectations by a factor of 2. We have cleared twice the spot terawatt hours than we expected as we put our 2012 budget together.","Building upon our success in the spot market, we're investing in a derivatives business for gas and power futures based upon the N2Ex day-ahead indices. To incent this marketplace, we have initiated a futures fee holiday to help make sure we have a very busy futures market, U.K. futures market, going into 2013 when the fees will be reset to normal levels. While it's early days to this market, I would also like to note that the derivatives market is 5x the size of the spot market and certainly gives us substantial room to grow.","Moving on, we're certainly delighted with the launch of BX Options. This is our newest options exchange and we have already attracted over 40 customers. In a relatively short period of time, we have gained about 1 percentage share of U.S. options market and the operation is profitable. I would note that we were able to launch this options exchange with a relatively small investment, without any additional hires and utilizing our current infrastructure. This is just the type of initiative we are seeking to fund through our GIFT internal investment program. We expect BX Options to demonstrate strong, continued growth and to be a solid contributor to our performance in 2013 and beyond.","Our Global Index Group continues to demonstrate strong performance with revenues of $14 million, up $1 million or 8% compared to the prior year. I'm very pleased to report that we've made excellent progress in the plan we outlined for this business at our Investor Day last spring. After 18 months in development, we're excited to be launching our Global Equity Family on our INET-based global index calculator during the fourth quarter. Our team has been highly focused on this effort, and we are confident that we have developed an index methodology that broadly meets the needs of our customers.","Now finally, I'd like to comment on Vanguard's recent announcement to switch many of its funds from MSCI to FTSE. This will result in a significant cost savings for its customers. We applaud Vanguard for the move, and we recognize this begins a new era for ETF providers and an era we recognized when we started development of our global index calculator 18 months ago. We've had initial success with it, and clearly, we think that the new world will play to our strengths as an efficient, scalable indexer. Our INET calculator, combined with our newly graduated Index Weightings & Components, another -- a GIFT initiative by the way, and our transparent rule-based methodologies position us to competitively to address the needs of this new market opportunity.","I'd like to now highlight some of the growth we're seeing in Corporate Solutions. Our strategy has proven successful as it has allowed us to grow, while at the same time expanding the addressable market for issuer services. Directors Desk has increased the number of clients to 729, up 48% in just the past 12 months. The positive impact of our launch of our INET iPad application, coupled with continued core product acceptance, drove a 67% increase in revenues compared to the prior year quarter. We're also proud to be participating in the new Windows 8 surface launch, and our product will be available upon shipment of that product.","I'm also happy to report that GlobeNewswire benefit from reseller agreements, as well as new client acquisitions and had continued successful results from our newly formed inside sales team. We drove press release volumes up 22% year-on-year. Corporate Intelligence had a great quarter. It is built for the busy investor relations professional. It integrates all key elements that, that person has to be involved with. It manages their day-to-day activity. We also launched Mobile Corporate Intelligence, so investor relationship professionals can access intelligence anytime anywhere.","Moving on, our Glide Technology business, which we acquired late last year, continues to perform. We saw the number of new clients increase by 55% from the second to the third quarter and also saw a substantial ramp in sales. Two NASDAQ OMX Corporate Solution clients have been awarded gold and silver in the best online news category -- newsroom category at Europe's prestigious Digital Impact Awards. After being named finalist in September, Honda U.K. was awarded gold and Heathrow Airport was awarded silver for demonstrating best practice examples of digital stakeholder communications.","Moving on to our Market Data products, where we continue to see good progress with our U.S. proprietary data, up $5 million or 15% year-over-year, benefiting from new product introductions including FPGA and Ultra-Feed. Our NASDAQ Basic initiatives continue to make remarkable progress, and we are now on-track to exit the year with over 90,000 subscriptions, up from 19,000 at the start of the year. We expect a combination of our targeted pricing initiatives and new products to drive growth as we move through 2013.","Moving on to Access and Broker Services, revenues were $66 million, up 2% compared to the prior year. We continue to see increased demand for connectivity, in particular, our recently launched 40G product. Looking to the future, the growth driver for this business will be product and services that reduce the cost of doing business for our customers, the broker\/dealers and market participants. In that regard, during the quarter, we announced the partnership with Amazon web services for the delivery of cloud computing for the financial industry, which we're calling FinQloud.","Amazon will bring their best-in-class cloud platform, and NASDAQ will bring regulatory, market knowledge and encryption capabilities to this platform launch. Together, we will be able to reduce financial services firms' storage costs by up to 80% by giving them access to a cloud data storage solution. Brokers have a tremendous amount of data they need to store for many years and to have easily accessible -- and have to have it easily accessible for regulators. Working with Amazon, we'll be able to help financial firms meet their recordkeeping requirements.","We are the first exchange also to propose to offer wireless technology to deliver market data. Pending regulatory approval, this will allow all market participants to utilize NASDAQ OMX next-generation wireless networking solutions in a regulated environment. Firms will no longer need to set their own microwave network throughout third-party and proprietary data feeds. This is another example of a way we are helping our customers reduce their infrastructure cost.","FinQloud and Wireless were recently announced, so we expect these products to start contributing as we move into fiscal 2013. As you can see, our Access Services new product pipeline remains full, and you'll continue to see us introduce innovative new offerings as we move forward.","Moving on to Market Technology. This business delivers technology and services to marketplaces, brokers and regulators throughout the world. Third quarter revenues were $47 million, up $1 million year-over-year and up $2 million on a constant currency basis. We continue to be on track for a record year of new business wins and order intake. In the first 9 months of 2012, we achieved an order intake of $163 million compared to $97 million in the prior year. Truly remarkable. We feel good about the pipeline of orders that we're competing for in this market. Our backlog now stands at $523 million.","In September, Japannext went live with X-stream INET, and during the third quarter, we had a number of notable contract wins. The New Zealand Stock Exchange signed with both X-stream and SMARTS, the Columbia Exchange extended their X-stream INET support contract for 5 years and the Bermuda Stock Exchange signed an upgrade to X-stream INET. Also during the quarter, our SMARTS risk management system continued to be in demand from both regulators and brokers. The Financial Services Authority, the regulator for the U.K., signed up for a SMARTS subscription, positioning us very favorably in this market. Our SMARTS broker generated solid order intake in the third quarter with global deals signed with Newedge and Nomura.","Moving on to our Listings business. We had a very good quarter in the U.S. for IPO activity. We had 17 IPOs. In addition to listing one of world's leading travel online search engines, Kayak software, and specialty retailer five Below, we also welcomed 3 leading restaurant groups, Bloomin' Brands, Chuys, and Del Frisco\u2019s. Year-to-date, the IPO market is tracking slightly behind last year, 109 companies versus 121. And so far this year, we've attracted 53% of the companies that have chosen to go public. This number excludes spinoffs. And obviously, these numbers look better when you look at the proceeds raised by IPOs in 2012.","We're also, during the quarter, delighted to welcome Kraft and its spinoff, Mondelez, to the NASDAQ stock market at the start of the month. This was particularly gratifying for us as it represents the largest public company switch ever made. And we continue to experience a record year for switches to NASDAQ, testimony to the strength and attractiveness of our business model. And part of that was our Corporate Solutions business revenues of $24 million in the third quarter, up $7 million compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis.","Moving finally to the Transaction business. In total, these volume-based trading and clearing businesses comprised 29% of total net revenues. In U.S. cash equities net revenues were $29 million, down from the $43 million in the third quarter of '11. Last year's volumes, as I said, were driven substantially higher than normal by the European debt crisis and the uncertainty related to the U.S. debt ceiling. U.S. average daily volume declined from $8.8 billion last year to a 5-year low of $6 billion during the third quarter. In Europe, our cash equity revenues declined by $6 million year-over-year to $18 million.","I would like to highlight our U.S. Derivatives business, where our team has been really executing on all cylinders. During the third quarter of 2012, we took over 2 percentage points of market share and improved revenue capture at the same time compared to the prior year period. Our U.S. Derivatives market revenue of $44 million were flat to the second quarter and down versus a very difficult comparison at third quarter 2011. As I discussed earlier, we are seeing good progress with our BX Options.","Now what I'd like to say is, during this call, I mentioned a fair number of initiatives that have been launched over the past several years. These have resulted in products that did not exist 3 years ago. They are now contributing to our strong performance. While it's interesting to discuss and debate, and we do it frequently here, which of these products will be more important to us in the future, whether it be N2Ex, BX Options, the Index Weighting & Components, Directors Desk, GlobeNewswire, Glide, FPGA, Ultra-Feed, Access Services, 40G, Microwave Services, our FinQloud services, our Wireless Market Data or SMARTS Broker, to name a few, discussing and debating which one is more important, is really not the main point. The main point is that here at NASDAQ OMX, we have the talent and the culture to carefully evolve and redefine and to succeed in both good times and the times that are not so good. And we certainly saw that in evidence in this quarter. So I thank you for your time, and we'll now turn it over to Lee.","Lee Shavel","Thanks, Bob. The following comments will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available at our website at ir.nasdaqomx.com.","Starting with revenues. Net exchange revenues came in at $409 million compared to $436 million in the third quarter of 2011. Our subscription and recurring revenues, about 71% of total revenues, increased by $5 million to $290 million, while our trading revenues, which now represent about 29% of our total business, saw a decline of $32 million or down 21% year-over-year.","On an organic basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions, our net exchange revenues declined by about 6% compared to the prior year. In the face of over 30% declines in equity volumes and approximately 20% declines in derivatives volumes globally, these results demonstrate that our overall revenues are substantially less variable than market trading volumes.","The overall trading volume environment remains challenging, as seen in trading activity in October so far averaging about 6 billion shares of average daily volume in the fourth quarter to date. We believe that the near-term impediments to volume include weak capital flows into risk asset funds, driven by investor caution in the face of both political uncertainty and global economic risk, and relatively strong market performance through this year discouraging more aggressive behavior through year-end. The longer-term trends, however, continue to show promise as economic growth, unemployment, housing prices and consumer confidence have all demonstrated clear momentum. We believe, in particular, that rising consumer confidence will drive not only improved consumer spending, but also increased appetite for risk assets, particularly as individual investors begin to appreciate the inherent risk of high fixed income exposure in a recovering economic scenario.","In addition, we also believe a recovering market scenario will produce stronger flows into actively managed equity mutual funds. In our subscription-based revenues, we saw a growth year-over-year in Access Services, Market Data, Global Listing and Market Technology, reflecting the strong underlying business trends that Bob described. We now anticipate Market Technology revenues of approximately $47 million for the fourth quarter of 2012, which implies full-year revenues of approximately $183 million.","On the expense side, third quarter 2012 non-GAAP operating expenses were $228 million, down $1 million compared to the second quarter of 2012 and down $4 million compared to the third quarter of last year. We continue to make good progress with our cost-reduction plan. Our current view is that we continue to expect cost savings, on a constant currency basis, of $25 million in 2012 and anticipate that we will exit the year on target for annualized run rate cost savings of $50 million by the end of 2012. This cost guidance does not include the restructuring charges associated with the cost-reduction plan, currently estimated to be $43 million, and it does not include the impact of our proposed voluntary accommodation program and special legal expenses.","The estimated restructuring charge increase of $7 million from the prior guidance of $35 million reflects accelerated cost savings from early retirement programs and additional identified real estate savings.","As a result of our progress on the cost-reduction plan, on Slide 13, you can see that for 2012, we are reducing our core expense guidance from $870 million to $890 million, down to $865 million to $873 million. To highlight the progress we've made over the year, our original core expense guidance at the start of the year was $905 million to $925 million. Adding the expected expenses from our recent acquisitions of BWise and NOS Clearing of $25 million to $26 million for the year and reducing new initiatives spending to $32 million to $36 million, we expect 2012 total operating expenses to be in the range of $922 million to $935 million.","Our non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter of 2012 was $181 million, down $23 million compared to prior year results. Exchange rates impacted us unfavorably on a non-GAAP basis by $3 million. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 44%, down from 47% in the prior year period, primarily as the result of lower revenues in our higher-margin Transaction businesses, offset by improving margins in both Corporate Solutions and Market Technology businesses.","Net interest expense was $22 million in the third quarter of 2012, a decrease of $5 million from the third quarter of 2011 due to the refinancing of our credit facility in 2011 and the repurchase of $335 million of our 2.5% convertible notes and debt paydown.","The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 34%. The increase in the tax rate for the quarter is a direct result of our updated projection for 2012 earnings, in which a greater percentage of earnings are now derived from the U.S. As you are probably aware, the U.S. has a higher tax rate versus other jurisdictions. As a result, we are increasing our expectations for our 2012 effective tax range to 34% to 35%, up from our previous guidance range of 32% to 34%.","Our non-GAAP net income was $105 million or $0.62 per share compared to $121 million or $0.67 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2011. The $0.05 decrease reflects negative impacts of $0.06 operationally, $0.02 for recent acquisitions, a $0.02 negative impact from FX and $0.01 negative impact for the increased tax rate, offset by an increase of $0.06 for the benefits of our refinancing and share repurchases.","Moving on to the balance sheet. On Slide 16, we are showing our debt structure and debt maturities. We extended our debt maturities when we refinanced in 2011, so now the first sizable maturity will be in 2015. Our relatively low leverage, strong cash flow generation and spaced debt maturities give the company considerable latitude for our ongoing capital deployment initiatives. In the first 9 months of 2012, we have generated cash flow from operations of $356 million. Deducting capital expenditures of $63 million results in free cash flow of slightly below $293 million.","On Slide 17, we show our track record of cash flow generation and cash flow usage since 2009. As you can see, NASDAQ OMX has generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow, excluding Section 31 fees, from 2009 to the third quarter of this year. We've used that cash flow to repurchase approximately $1.1 billion of our outstanding stock. This equates to 51.3 million shares at an average price of $21.90, and a reduction of our share base by 24% in this time period. For 2012 year-to-date, capital returns through dividends and share repurchases represent 71% of our free cash flow, excluding Section 31 fees. We have refinanced and restructured our debt with a reduction of almost $529 million, and we have invested over $305 million net of dispositions acquiring a variety of strategic assets.","Including BWise, NOS Clearing, FTEN, SMARTS, Glide Technologies and the business of RapiData, we believe that these bolt-in acquisitions allow us to broaden our existing business and enhance our ability to grow profitability. Finally, we paid our second quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share in September. This quarterly dividend represents a yield of 2.2% at the current valuation.","To illustrate the power of our capital return policy, take a look at what we've accomplished in the last year. Our total share repurchases sum to $325 million, plus another $43 million in dividends totals to $368 million in capital returned to shareholders. To put this in perspective, our total equity value at the current stock price is $4.1 billion, so we've returned 9% of this value in the period. As always, the underpinning of our capital deployment strategy is a robust return on invested capital framework. We continue to see attractive value-creating opportunities for internal investment and acquisitions. As always, all potential uses of cash are screened to ensure they have strong returns on invested capital, and we allocate our capital to the highest yielding opportunities.","Thanks for your attention. And I will now turn it back over to John.","John Sweeney","Thanks. Operator, we'll now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Roger Freeman of Barclays Capital.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just, I guess, with the updated cost guidance and some of the initiatives spending coming down, can you just kind of walk through -- is this a function of you just bringing -- trying to bring costs down in a tough environment or is this a way to refine ROIC, an outcome of that in terms of future expected returns on some of those investments?","Lee Shavel","Sure, Roger. I'd say it's fundamentally our focus on reducing our expense base in this current environment. And so as we outlined in the first quarter when we introduced the cost-reduction plan, we had specific targets for each of our businesses, and this reflects a very focused effort in achieving those. We are actually ahead of the target that we've set, as you can see, in terms of the quantum of reduction in our overall expense guidance. I think that -- we certainly believe that there are some benefits in terms of our return on invested capital efforts, but I don't think that's a primary driver in the cost reductions that you see here.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I may have missed this, did you give an update on the Facebook settlement proposal? Do you still expect to hear back on that by the end of the year?","Robert Greifeld","I would say this, Roger, one, obviously, it's under the SEC's control. There is a checkpoint at the end of October. But to the extent the SEC requires more time, then we would agree to that. So I'm not here to predict what they might do, but end of the year is a reasonable guess.","Lee Shavel","I want to make it clear, [indiscernible] this is not a settlement proposal. It's a voluntary plan by NASDAQ.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Sorry for mischaracterizing. Lastly, the acquisition revenues in the quarter from BWise and NOS, do you have those? I thought Corporate Solutions would've been a bit higher with that.","Robert Greifeld","Yes, we don't have those broken out at this point, Roger.","Operator","Our next question is from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess the first question, Lee, I think follow on, on expenses. If you back out from the yearly guidance what you did in the first 3 quarters, I mean, you still see a pretty big uptick in 4Q, on the low end at $7 million. So I guess, I'm just trying to see what's in the run rate and why the big uptick.","Lee Shavel","Sure. And, Rich, it's a very fair question. A couple of things: One thing, I think the more significant driver in that is anticipated increases in our new initiative spending. As you know, we have a portfolio of investments that each have different spending projections. We do anticipate an increase in the fourth quarter, as we ramp up some of those initiatives. And then the second element is going into the fourth quarter, we always try to provide some flexibility for an improving environment. Now so far in October, with average daily volumes still at the $6 billion level, that seems less likely. But given the election and other potential drivers of volatility, we have some upside there reflecting higher activity.","Robert Greifeld","But it sounds like there's opportunities to beat that number.","Lee Shavel","I think that would be a fair conclusion, Bob.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","But -- secondly, the sale of IDCG closed, I guess, in the quarter. And I think you've said in the past, it freed up whether it's $75 million to $80 million of capital. Just are we holding this against how you characterize the accommodation plan? What are the uses of this freed-up capital? How are you looking at that?","Lee Shavel","Sure, Rich, and it was -- from a net standpoint, we ended up netting about $68 million of cash from the IDCG transaction. And you can see in our year-to-date cash flow presentation in the Investor Presentation how we've allocated that. And I think that, that cash flow, along with the cash flow that was freed up through the implementation of our default plan, have gone into funding not only the share repurchase and dividends, but also the recent acquisitions of NOS. And also it continues to give us flexibility and could in part serve to fund the accommodation program, which is not going to be -- have a substantial financial impact on us.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Understood, okay. And then very lastly, Bob, on the regulatory front, this seems like the beating drum, at least you hear a lot more talk on the regulation of high-frequency trading and the -- sort of the looking at colocation and the Market Data feed. So I'm just trying to get how you view the risk, regulatory risk as we close out the year on these topics.","Robert Greifeld","Good question, Rich, and obviously, something we pay close attention to. And I think when you see high-frequency floating around as a term in the media, it's hard to actually know exactly what people are talking about. So obviously, it's not a defined legal term. But I would say this, we, in our mind, when we look at what's happening in Europe and what's talked about in the U.S., we zero in on a definition of high-frequency which have the following attributes: One is the trading is done on a proprietary basis. Two, it utilizes low-latency technology in a data center of a market center. The traders tend to have no inventory, tend to be flat at the end of each trading day. They have a short average order life, under 1 second, and a high order-to-trade ratio above 100. And they are not designated market makers with market maker obligations. Now when we take that definition and compare it to our equity business on a global basis, not just the U.S. but U.S. and Europe, inclusive of colocation fees, that represents in and around $50 million worth of revenue to NASDAQ OMX. So clearly, it's a customer base we care about. We have a fundamental belief that they add liquidity to the market, but to the extent there are rule sets that affected high-frequency trading by 10% or 15% or 20%, it's clearly not material to us. But I would say that what we're seeing, which I think will be good for the overall equity market, is high-frequency trading saying we want to step up into an obligated market-making world. And that is what we need in the equity marketplace. So if you look at the equity marketplace today in their very actively traded stocks, the market has never been better. Deep liquidity, very narrow spreads. But as you walk down the market cap curve, you see that our spreads get wider and liquidity gets less.","So we have a large number or too large of a number of public companies that really do not have adequate market-making support, adequate, constant liquidity. So certainly, it's going to be our effort and others to take out of this high-frequency debate a positive outcome where these participants become market makers, become obligated and provide higher levels of support to the lower end of the marketplace. So we see this as opportunity. We see it actually happening as we're speaking today, but it's also important to define clearly what we mean by high-frequency trading and understand what it is in the context of, one, our overall operation and, two, the operation of the equity marketplace.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","It seems like you were very well-prepared for that question.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Allen of Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to touch on the slide, investments in new initiatives. The revenues and expenses forecasts have both came in a little bit from last quarter. I'm just wondering if you could give us some color in terms of what's changed since last quarter. And the fourth quarter spending implies a pretty big ramp-up. Just, what specific areas is the spending going to be concentrated in?","Lee Shavel","So thanks, Chris, focusing on that. There are a couple changes, and particularly, if you look at prior quarters. First of all, in terms of the overall revenue, that reflects the -- an adjustment for lower volumes that we're anticipating in some of our initiatives. So revenues have come down slightly in that regard. The other thing that you may be confusing is that, over the last quarter, you saw a drop in the revenue from the initiatives that are characterized as in development. That doesn't reflect a dramatic drop in those revenues, but actually, it's a movement of those from in development to deployed. And I want to spend a little time talking about this. We had 4 of our initiatives, one being the BX Options initiative, which Bob talked about at length, which has been very -- a very successful launch for us; our SMARTS Broker initiative, where we invested money in expanding our sales effort around that product; our inside sales effort on GlobeNewswire, as well as in our Index business, our Index Weightings & Components initiative; all of those have achieved, in our view, stability. They are now considered deployed initiatives. And so we've moved that revenue from the in-development into deployed, which reflects that drop in the in-development. And then if you look at the overall revenues, that has come down slightly as a result of our estimates of volumes and how that impacts some of our new initiatives. The continuing expense growth is going to be tied to a number of our initiatives. You've heard Bob talk about our NLX initiative. That will be a significant component of the expense growth that you'll see in 2012 in the new initiative, as well as a number of other ones, such as our Virtual Data Room and Marketplace For Hire, which we continue to be very optimistic about. So those are the types of things that are contributing to that growth in expense.","Robert Greifeld","A couple of comments. One, with respect to the 4, they graduated. They get certificates and everything. So those are successful. They've shown, demonstrated run rate profitability for 2 quarters, and they leave the GIFT program. So you see that going. And as Lee mentions, NLX will have increased funding requirements as we go into the fourth quarter. But it's important to recognize the way we're running the GIFT program is it has a very tight, short interval scheduling. People have to hit the milestones. So to the extent that NLX does not hit certain milestones, then we won't do the funding for it. If it does, it will. And that goes for all the initiatives. And obviously, we're becoming increasingly successful at this, and it's definitely a -- contributed to this strong quarter.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, I guess just turning back to capital a little bit. Looking forward in terms of priority of capital deployment, do you guys see opportunities for some of the small bolt-on acquisitions you've done in the past? Or is it more looking at it kind of the current share price and weighing that against the opportunity set?","Robert Greifeld","Well as we mentioned, we have to look at things holistically. With respect to the bolt-in acquisitions, it's something that we look at. As I've said publicly before, probably during the course of the year, we look at something coming up to 100 different opportunities. We have to see a perfect storm for us to actually pull a trigger. And it's episodic. So you just don't know when you're going to do a transaction. You can't plan for it. But to the extent we can do transactions as we've done with these bolt-ins, that obviously, are us investing in our future and us positioning ourselves primarily in markets, where we see growth opportunities, we'll do it. And the last acquisition we did was BWise, and we stand by the concept that within 5 years, every audit committee will require management to have a global risk control capability in place. We put the best-of-breed with respect to capability, classical small software company with great product and limited distribution and name recognition, and we solved those 2 problems for them quite quickly. So those are the kind of things we really love to do.","Operator","Our next question is from Howard Chen of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Since you hosted this call last quarter, we've had a few more market structure issues, including those at Knight Capital and the Knight -- and the Kraft transfer. I realize those are 2 very different situations, but if you add in the flash crash and the issues around the Facebook IPO, I just get the question a lot from investors, \"Why do you think these events seem to be happening more often? Does something more material need to change with the U.S. cash equities structure?\" And I was just hoping you could weigh in on all that.","Robert Greifeld","Sure, I'll say a couple things and Eric is here, if he wants to add to it. But one is Kraft, the system worked the way it was supposed to. Circuit breakers were not so much triggered in that one but they were there and worked -- but we were happy with what happened there. Certainly, we believe having circuit breakers apply from 9:30 or limit up, limit down apply right at 9:30 would be a very good evolution of the market. There's been tremendous industry discussion with respect to kill switches. We think that's a good evolution of the market that we have to see. And so I think the improvements of the market are not difficult to discern. And I think there's a clear path to get us there. But I also have to highlight that, as much as you hear about how the market doesn't work, it is remarkable how well it does perform. I mean, we process literally billions of shares per day across a diverse range of execution venues and a diverse range of customers and the system works. Eric, you want to add to that?","Eric W. Noll","Yes, I think, Howard, one of the things that we're really aiming for here is to help develop the confidence and explanation about market structure for investors. And so we'll be spending a lot of time, as Bob mentioned, working on things like kill switches, looking on -- working on other protections for the marketplace to bring additional stability to the marketplace to prevent events from spiraling out of control. I think we'd be remiss to say that we can stop events from happening. I think the key that we're going to focus on is how do we limit the damage and how do we -- how do we build confidence in the market structure going forward.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just to follow up, there's some renewed rumbling across the industry around options dividend trades. You remain the dominant player in that business, apparently, even more so after some others will exit. So I was just hoping for your outlook for that business and that dividend strategy, trade strategy, in particular.","Eric W. Noll","Howard, this is Eric again. I think I'd said a couple things about it. One is I would say that there are not really any regulatory rumblings about this trade. This is a trade that has existed and a trading strategy that has existed for decades. I think there is some -- there are some users and some market participants who don't like the trade or don't want to finance the trade. Those, of course, are legitimate business decisions by those firms. There are, of course, other users and demand for the product out there, and we continue to support it as a functionality. They are legitimate trades. They do take risk, and they exist in the marketplace. So while they're not huge revenue drivers for us, we do think it's part of the service offering we offer to our customers.","Robert Greifeld","The other thing I need to say is you have to take our role in context here. As an exchange, we have equal access provisions. We want all commerce to come to the market. And with respect to a trade, there tends to be a winner and a loser. And it's our job to just provide a proper forum that meets the regulatory requirements. So clearly, we have a number of different types of trading activity in the marketplace that would have controversy, that will have supporters and detractors. This would be one of them, but it's just one out of many. And it's something we wrestle with on a daily basis. And we clearly have a philosophy that we have to keep within the 4 walls of the regulatory structures and obviously not come close to any lines. But given what the regulatory system provides us, it's our job to make sure that we have the venue to welcome all comers.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just a final quick one. What were the $4 million in special legal expenses you called out this quarter, Lee?","Lee Shavel","It's associated with the Facebook litigation.","Operator","Our next question is from Niamh Alexander of KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","The index business, I too paid attention to when Vanguard made their switch. And I guess it was hard not to see the impact on some of the index provider's stock. But this is a business you've been working on for quite some time, you'd mentioned it earlier. But is there -- is there any kind of anecdotal or any evidence you can give us that's suggesting some early wins there in that business?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I would say this. One is our product is coming out in the fourth quarter. And, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it was 18 months of development. Do I wish I'd started it 6 months sooner? Yes. But we did start it 18 months ago. It is ready in the fourth quarter. We're excited about it. The industry is keenly aware of it and, obviously, anxiously awaiting the ability to test and back test against that. And one of the things that got us to decide to fund this effort several years ago was that, 2 years ago, we did have an iShares fund switch. It was an S&P semiconductor index, which switched over to the NASDAQ OMX PHLX semiconductor. So that was kind of when the lightbulb went off 2 years ago. We saw, okay, this was real, it was doable. And we took ourselves from what I would say is a NASDAQ focus, limited-purpose index provider, said we're embarking on the technology to make ourselves a global player across multiple asset classes. So it's coming out, it's ready. The timing looks very good. We're obviously very excited about it.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then the MiFID II, I mean, it's making slow progress in Europe, but the first round of kind of voting on -- it seems to me like more of the potentially negative factors for aspects of the business like high-frequency trading and time of clearing to the trading, they seem to get watered down the nod. What was your impression? What was your -- what were your thoughts post the first round of the vote on the impact -- potential impact on the business?","Robert Greifeld","Well the first thing, and you hit on it, as an American, you just really have to calibrate your thought process in that it's a step in a long process and it has -- definitely, you can be assured the final form will not look like interim form at this stage. So we put that. Second thing is we say that there were a lot of good things in the regulation for exchanges. And with respect to the O of T [ph]  Status, we're very happy. On the other side of the table, with respect to obviously high-frequency trading, it's something that we certainly need to work on with the regulators there, but I do highlight the fact that when you get into the definitions that they're talking about, they're not mirroring exactly as I described it in my answer to Rich, but they're not that far off. You do have to put it in the proper context. It's not that big a piece of our business.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, Bob, just on that definition you provided earlier, which is very specific and helpful, but that's your definition. Is that something the regulators are also working to and kind of if -- because right now, there's no specific proposal out there in the U.S. that I could see from the SEC to limit high-frequency trading. But you've kind of provided this group. Is that something that you've been kind of working on with the regulators?","Robert Greifeld","It's something -- well, one is we take what we hear from the regulators, obviously voice our opinion. So I think in many ways, the regulators' definition is not as restrictive as ours, but we'll see. The 100:1, I think in Europe, they're talking more like 200:1 order-to-trade ratio, so we picked the 100:1. We don't know what the final number will be. And average order life under a second, again, that's a fairly expansive definition. It's not 500 milliseconds, if we have that at a full second. And we also include anybody who's in our data center and being done on a proprietary basis. So it's our definition. People will have different definitions, who will come up with different answers. But when you put the terms out there as we're defining it, it's hard, I think, for people not to say that you're very close to what people would see as what is a high-frequency trader.","Eric W. Noll","Niamh, I think one of the things that's going to be important here is I think this is going to be less about the definition of who's a high-frequency trader and what behaviors or what market structure impact are of concern here. So I think the focus is going to be less about defining who is a high-frequency trader and what is high-frequency trader, but what is the behavior in the marketplace that we're looking to mitigate. So while I think the definition is important to talk about, I think the larger issue is really going to be about what are we trying to ameliorate in the marketplace.","Robert Greifeld","And what we have to do is make this positive by saying, \"Okay\" -- and this ties back to Eric's point of behavior. Let's just say, \"What do we want to make better in the marketplace?\" And what we want to have better in the marketplace is continuous liquidity, especially in the less actively traded stocks. And in our conversations with current people who kind of fit this definition of high-frequency trading, they seem very willing to step into that role. So I have the ability to make this a pure win, have a better market structure coming out of it, have obligated market makers more involved in our marketplace, and that's the job that we have. So it's not so much that we want to be in a regulatory showdown with respect to finite definitions of what is HFT, but let's make this a positive dynamic, let's get make more market-making support in this marketplace.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So I guess, just trying to understand what's next, because you've made the progress in the definition. Is there something that, there is exchange roles in the hopper that we should be looking towards? Or is it something from the SEC that we should be looking towards?","Robert Greifeld","Well I think maybe both. I mean, obviously, we want to be creative in our response, and the question is what market structures can we put in place that will help. And something we think about, nothing that's ready for publication, but something we spend time with. And I will also say that, I think, the focus in the U.S., as you saw from the panel discussion that Anna Ewing went to is more about kill switches and recognition that there always will be problems in the marketplace, nothing will ever be perfect, but how do you put in a protection layer around that. So there is, at this point in time, a little bit of difference in terms of the discussion in Europe versus the U.S. Europe is more about, \"Let's make sure we have more protections in place.\" And then U.S. is more about that, and Europe is obviously going through the long and seems eternal MiFID II discussions.","Operator","Our next question is from Gaston Ceron of MorningStar Security.","Gaston  F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Bob, just wondering if you could talk about the macro environment again just for a little bit. I would just like to know if you could give a little additional color beyond what you've already said on what you're hearing these days from your corporate clients, people like CEOs, CFOs, on their expectations about raising capital and, based frankly, on the overall confidence in the economy as we kind of go through the end of the year here.","Robert Greifeld","Yes, that's a good question. Obviously, the election is something that people focus on in the U.S. as if it will be a -- some kind of signal event. I'm not sure I agree with that. But I would say that, with respect to corporate America, the ability to get a package that would get us onto some sort of fiscal stability, something that would look like Simpson-Bowles with some spending cuts and revenue increase is what you hear from CEOs and CFOs. So I think -- what I'm happy to say is, I think you'll see a lot of focus on that in Congress after the election, independent of who is -- wins the presidency. So that being said, in terms of conversations you have with respect to U.S.-based CEOs and the business model, it is what I would call cautiously optimistic. I think you see some decline in some performance by different firms this quarter versus prior quarters. But overall, people believe we're not that far away from having a strong economy, and some help from the policymakers would be most appreciated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So the first question on margins, and just kind of a broader outlook, I guess. When you look into 2013, there's still, I guess, about $25 million that is not in the run rate that will benefit the margins. But when you look at growth rates in different businesses that you guys have right now, and assuming volumes will kind of stay where they are, off of the 44-ish percent margin level right now, where do you guys see that going?","Lee Shavel","Well, I'd say, I guess, a couple things. And first, Alex, the $25 million that you're referring to is what?","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The savings that you guys are not -- that are not in the run rate yet that will be in the run rate full year next year.","Lee Shavel","Got it, yes. So I think when you look across the businesses, I think we expect in the non-transactional businesses, that our margins will be stable to improving. I think that when you look at Market Data, we can expect that margin to continue to be stable; Access Services, similarly stable to improving. And in our Corporate Solutions business and in Market Technology, as I indicated earlier, both of those businesses have shown improvements year-over-year in margins, and we expect that to continue into 2013. And in Index Services, also a very high-margin business, we expect that to continue to be stable to improving. When you move to the Transaction businesses, obviously the margin outcome is going to be driven by what your volume expectations are. And so if our volumes remain where they are, then we think that our margins will be stable to improving as we realize the benefits of our cost-savings effort. But with increasing volumes, the incremental margin on all of those businesses is substantial and accretive to the margins. So what I would say to summarize is, non-transactional businesses, I think we see very solid trends in margin on each of those. And I think if you share our view that going into 2013 there are more reasons to believe that volume should be stronger than weaker, then we would anticipate improving margins in those businesses as well, benefiting our overall corporate margin.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Helpful. And then, Bob, I want to focus for a second on Market Tech. Clearly, pipelines are really good. You guys continue to win business there. But if you look at the revenue trends, I guess last quarter, the run rate x FX is around $49 million, it went down slightly to $47 million this quarter. It sounds like you guys expect $47 million next quarter. What's taking, I guess, a little longer to realize some of this new business?","Robert Greifeld","Well I think what you see is short-term revenue has not had a positive last 3 to 6 months, and that is what we call CRs, which is customer request for minor changes. And unlike our license part of the business, which is the bigger dollar amount, this is immediately recognized. So that kind of is the at-the-moment heartbeat. So if that slows down a little bit, you feel it in the given quarter. So we see that. But I'd also say that with respect to what we presented at the Analyst Day, on a currency-neutral basis, we think we'll get to the low end of the forecast we gave you for 2013. So, all in all in the environment, we're very pleased.","Lee Shavel","And Alex, it's Lee. I just want to add one thing. Talking about the businesses, that's one element. The other thing that I think you need to factor in is that we've made the deliberate decision with our new initiative program to be spending on projects that will generate revenue over time. Those, in combination with our acquisitions, are going to, in the near term, have a negative impact on margin. But obviously, that's driven by our confidence in our ability to generate profitability and good returns on capital in those businesses. So as you think about it from a corporate level, obviously, it's a blend of both of those elements.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then the last one, just speaking of capital. Can you guys talk a little bit about, I guess, the process and timing of you potentially changing the dividend policy or I guess the overall mix of the payout. And I know you just introduced dividend only 1 quarter ago. But how would the timing work if you were to choose something else?","Lee Shavel","Sure, Alex. Our view is that we initiated the dividend after the first quarter. I think it would be our policy to review that dividend level on an annual basis. So I think that we'll go through a similar process that we did at the end of the first quarter of this year to evaluate where the dividend is, what we see as our relative return on capital opportunities between share repurchases, internal investment, acquisitions and an increase -- to increase dividend. So that would be the timing. I would also say that when we initiated the dividend, it was with a view that certainly when you make that decision, you're making a longer-term decision in terms of capital allocation. And we certainly recognize that companies that have shown an ability to increase their dividend over time have been rewarded by investors. And certainly, that's our objective.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Bedell of ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the recurring revenue streams. Obviously, you've done a very good job in building the capacity as you grow revenues organically. But just curious as how you view those efforts versus what's a fairly flat sequential environment in most of the recurring fee areas. And you gave guidance on the technology, obviously. But if you could talk a little bit about maybe the Corporate Solutions area, some of the proprietary Market Data and the Access and Broker Service fees, just sort of the near-term outlook for the fourth quarter, whether you think that's going to continue to be relatively flat. And as we move into '13, do you think the initiatives that you're working on will improve the revenue streams in that area? And also if there are any onetime items in the third quarter in that area.","Robert Greifeld","Yes, I would say, in the medium to long term, you'll see the recurring revenue increase as a percent of our overall revenue. And you see, as I listed a number of the initiatives that we're involved with, many of them have that as their predominant business model. And obviously, you mentioned Corporate Solutions, that is in that realm. And to the extent that our internal developments within Corporate Solutions, and our acquisitions such as Glide and BWise continue to grow that, obviously, will increase the share there. On the Market Data side, which is by definition a recurring revenue business, we're incredibly proud of the progress we've made with Basic. Basic is not a large moneymaker for us now as we transition customers from the shared plan. It is profitable, but we expect that profitability to increase quite dramatically by this time next year. So we're well positioned, we're delivering superior value to the customers on a recurring revenue basis. And as Data is -- Data and Index business are an increased focus for us at the corporate level and the management level, that is again going to contribute to our increasing recurring revenue.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And since it is more of a 2013 story, I guess the fourth quarter you would expect these revenue streams to be roughly flat with the third quarter?","Robert Greifeld","I would say roughly would be the answer.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then the way you talked about the -- you gave us a very good outlook on the stable to improving margins across many of the businesses. As you come into 2013, does that -- I guess from an overall perspective, does that imply a slowdown in your investment spend for new initiatives? Or would you overlay the investment spend on that and say that would be sort of a negative to the margins?\"","Lee Shavel","Yes, as I tried to address in my follow-up comment to Alex's question, that the spending in the new initiatives is not slowing down. We continue to look at opportunities. I will say that we do subject what's brought to us to pretty rigorous tests. And one, in terms of return on capital, but as Bob indicated, also to clear deadlines in order to continue to fund them. And so we may have projects that we just decide aren't meeting the hurdles and so that comes out. But overall, those new initiatives and some of our recent acquisitions are, in the near term, going to be a reduction to our overall corporate margin beyond the trends that I describe in each of the individual business lines.","Robert Greifeld","It's important to recognize that the new initiatives, the GIFT council has to have an entirely different dynamic than the core business. We run this core business in a very lean and effective way, and we have to look at that. And you see we made progress again polishing the diamond in 2012. The new initiative dynamic is, is this a solid business plan? What are the chances of us being successful? What advantages do we bring to the marketplace? And we definitely operate with the philosophy that we want to be effective first and then worry about efficiency second. So core business efficiency is what we're focused on. New initiatives, it's about effectiveness. And from that point of view, it has a different budget dynamic. And to the extent we have a great concept that should be funded that represents us leveraging some core capabilities to our advantage in the marketplace, then we clearly have the balance sheet, we have the cash flow to support that effort, and it runs independent of normal budget discipline.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then I would assume if the revenue environment does improve in 2013, especially on the Transaction side, you would feel more capacity to invest in growth initiatives? Or would you...","Robert Greifeld","No, no, I'm saying the opposite. I'm saying the growth initiatives that we have, if it's a real opportunity, independent of how the core business is doing, we'll make the proper decision. Right? We have the cash flow, we have the balance sheet to do that. All right? So the fact that we're living through tough volume times today, definitely forces the business running the Transaction business to make sure that they're running that thing as lean as they possibly can, but that's a different dynamic than how do you fund the new business initiative. The new business initiative says, \"Okay, what is our opportunity set? What unique capabilities do we bring to the marketplace? What sustainable advantage do we have in coming to that marketplace?\" And assuming we have the balance sheet and the cash flow, then we'll look to fund it. And as Lee referenced, and as we've gotten very good at, these things that are funded have to meet some tight schedules and meet deadlines. And to the extent they don't, then the funding will quickly dry up.","Lee Shavel","Brian, I would say maybe I think there's an element that in an improving environment, then in potential returns, I think the opportunities increase the attractiveness of it. So that may be a driver of continued spending here.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great, got it. That's very clear. And just lastly, on the legal expenses, do you expect those to recur in the fourth quarter and potentially into 2013 a little bit?","Lee Shavel","Yes.","Robert Greifeld","Yes.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Bob Greifeld for closing remarks.","Robert Greifeld","Good. As I said during my prepared comments, we have a number of different initiatives that are each individually contributing to our success. We don't have any game changers that we say, \"Okay. This is it. This is that.\" It's a collective effort. And as I highlighted, to me, the important point as you think about NASDAQ OMX, is we have carefully built the culture over the last number of years to make sure that regardless of the economic deck of cards that we're handed, that we can succeed. We have done that in this quarter. We're proud of our progress. Obviously, we wish that equity volumes were not down by 30%. We do have a belief that the equity market will rebound and it will come, as you see, in a close correlation to economic growth, GDP growth in the particular region where we serve, so we're optimistic about that over the medium to long term. But we're going to execute in a very careful way, leveraging our position in different marketplaces. So proud of the quarter, we appreciate your time and look forward to talking to you as the rest of the year unfolds. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

It's now my pleasure to turn the time over to John Sweeney, Vice President of Investor Relations for NASDAQ OMX. Sir, the floor is yours.","John Sweeney","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ's OMX's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Results. On the line are Bob Greifeld, our CEO; Lee Shavel, CFO; Ed Knight, General Counsel, and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A. The press release and the presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations on SEC Regulation FD.","I'd like to remind you of certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I'll now turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on this call to discuss NASDAQ OMX's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Results. I am pleased to note that we're doing the call from Stockholm, where we are celebrating the 150th anniversary of the Stockholm Stock Exchange and joining with me here is Hans-Ole Jochumsen, the Head of the European business, and obviously, other members of the management team.","When we look back at 2012 for NASDAQ, one word comes to mind: resiliency. In a year that was challenging for everyone, where we encountered market challenges, weak demand, political turmoil and even hurricanes, we never stopped executing on our business plan. The results we announced earlier this morning clearly demonstrate not only the resiliency, but the diversity and the strength of our business model. Let me start by giving you of a few key highlights of our fourth quarter, then I want to talk a little about how we got there.","Fourth quarter non-GAAP revenues of $419 million was the highest of 2012. Recurring and subscription revenues accounted for 71% of total fourth quarter revenues, tied for the highest level in NASDAQ OMX's history. We delivered non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.64, tied for the second highest quarterly performance in the firm's history. We finished the year with an exit run rate of $50 million in annualized expense savings, which I'll talk more about later.","While we're pleased with these results, given the difficult times, by no means are we satisfied. We have yet to demonstrate the full earnings power of this franchise. One of the drivers that has made our model so successful over the past few years is the diversity of our business. Corporate Solutions led the way, an effort we undertook 6 years ago and built from the round up. Corporate Solutions revenues were $31 million in the fourth quarter, up an impressive 55% compared to a $20 million in the fourth quarter of last year, with strong 25% year-on-year revenue growth from our core products and services.","Our success in diversifying our business model was also driven by our ability to create adjacent opportunities in our core business areas, many of which are non-transaction based and rooted in innovative technologies and software. Let me be clear, however, we love our Transaction businesses. We are leaders and execute exceptionally well in these areas. However, that love has never stopped us from looking for ways to: one, diversify our revenue portfolio; two, better serve our customers; and three, pursue adjacent growth opportunities.","These opportunities have included a suite of solutions that cover the entire trading life cycle to our members. We continue to benefit, as we bring innovative data products and market system software and services to meet the needs of our customers and power their businesses throughout the world. We grew Access Services revenue 7% in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and the Global Index Group increased by 8%. We continue to see good traction for our SMARTS Broker surveillance and risk management tools. We continue to make progress in our Market Technology business, which had exceptionally strong performance in the fourth quarter, delivering new business wins totaling $95 million.","We were also pleased to close our first acquisition, the Global Index Group, in the fourth quarter, a leading player in dividend indexing. In contrast to most domestic equity mutual funds, which have experienced outflows over the past 3 years, inflows into equity income funds or dividend-focused funds have increased in that same time period, a factor that we believe bodes well for the future growth of this business. With this acquisition, the Global Index Group is one of the largest provider of dividend-themed indexes and further enhances our custom index offering capabilities.","Our U.S. options business grew revenue 10% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, driven by increased revenue capture and expanding market share. In addition, so far this year, the signs for our transaction-based businesses are encouraging.","On the operating front, in 2012, we continued our disciplined approach to expense control with the cost reduction program we announced in February of last year. We ended the year tracking ahead of our $25 million savings target, and exited 2012 with an annualized run rate cost savings of $50 million.","In addition to expense control, we have an extremely disciplined capital allocation program. When we deploy capital in an acquisition, we always apply strategic rigor before we do any deal. As I've said before on this call, any transaction must make strategic sense, in some way must also level the mother ship and be accretive to our shareholders within a year.","Share repurchases, dividend payments and acquisitions are all vital elements of our capital allocation strategy. In 2012, we generated nearly $600 million in cash flow from operations and we returned $270 million -- $275 million, actually, to shareholders through our share repurchase program, and an additional $65 million through dividend.","Through our GIFT council, we continue to invest in and bring new and innovative products and services to market. In 2012, we generated approximately $134 million in revenue, based on the investments we have made in new initiatives over the past 4 years. Three great examples over our successful GIFT initiatives are BX Options, our insight sales force for Corporate Solutions, and our Index Weighting and Component product sets.","Now as I've alluded to previously, the management team here is firmly focused on the opportunities across different sectors. We have driven growth and created scale across many of our businesses that are now providing operational visibility into these areas. We recently have made several noteworthy moves with this goal in mind. A few weeks ago, we announced the combination of our Market Technology business and our Corporate Solutions business to create a leading technology and software business, now called Global Technology Solutions.","One of the drivers for this combination was the announcement of the acquisition of the IR, PR and Multimedia Solutions businesses of Thomson Reuters. As I mentioned before, we have long admired the Thomson Reuters model, and now, through this acquisition, we will accelerate our strategy and create one of the premier suites of products and services for public and private companies. We will bring the assets, talent and technology together to deliver a strong customer-centric value proposition to over 7,000 new clients in over 60 countries, truly an amazing opportunity.","The transaction is currently under review by regulators and we expect it to close in the first half of this year. Once completed, it is expected to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months, excluding transaction-related costs, and is expected to generate attractive returns on capital. We believe that technology and the continued innovation of industry-leading products and services will differentiate NASDAQ OMX. Our Global Technology Solutions business would be one of the larger players in this space, and similar in profile to companies such as ACI Worldwide, Fidessa, Pfizer, and Fidelity National Information Services.","As part of this effort, we also announced a new Chief Information Officer who will be joining our firm, Brad Peterson. Last year, we took several key steps to improve our technology and enhance the way we bring products and services to market. We said one of the things we wanted to accomplish was to appoint a dedicated CIO. Brad brings significant experience and leadership skills to NASDAQ OMX, and his diverse background includes successful technology leadership roles at Charles Schwab, eBay and Epoch Partners. We are lucky to have him, and he will be the point person for all technology efforts across NASDAQ OMX.","Just this week, we also announced the combination of our Global Index and Global Data Products businesses. Data Products and the Global Index Group both have high margins and saw a positive year-over-year growth in 2012. Bringing these 2 businesses together makes perfect strategic sense for us, as they are rooted in technology and in the delivery and distribution of data, things we do exceptionally well.","Global Information Services, as we refer to the combined unit, will represent approximately 20% of NASDAQ OMX's total annual revenues and will have similar profile to companies such as MSCI, McGraw-Hill and Factset. This combination puts us in a great spot to capitalize on the work that has been done in both these areas and create new products and solutions for our customers, which really span virtually every corner of the financial services industry. The result of this diversified approach demonstrate that our strategy is working. Recurring and subscription-based revenue now accounts for 71% of our total revenue and reached $297 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. That is up $9 million from the previous year. It is truly a remarkable evolution of our business. Once we close the Thomson deal, we expect the recurring and subscription revenues will approach 75% of our total revenues.","In closing, I have summarized what we consider to be the highlights of our strategy and a few examples of the successful execution of that strategy in 2012. Now, I'd like to discuss, in an overview fashion, our outlook for 2013.","We believe that the year ahead will be positive for our business as the global economy continues to recover. We expect that our aggressive steps in meeting our cost, revenue and technology objectives over the last 3 years will enable us to benefit from improving economic conditions in 2013. We will continue to look for opportunities to further diversify our business with enhanced product offerings and possible acquisitions that complement our existing businesses.","So far, the market environment has been encouraging in 2013. In the U.S., in January, we are seeing positive, multi-week equity inflows from retail investors for the first time in over 1 year. In addition, the last 3 reported weeks from Lipper, showed positive inflows into the U.S. equity mutual funds. We don't know if this trend will continue, but certainly, these are the most encouraging signs we've seen for U.S. equity volumes in many years. Still, our outlook will remain cautiously optimistic and we are planning for flat to relatively modest growth in volumes.","Now with respect to our industry, we see that the market structure -- that market structure will continue to define and shape the discussion of the day. For NASDAQ OMX's role, we will continue to find leadership and innovation and market structure to benefit investors, not just so that markets remain stable in times of stress, but more importantly, so the markets can continue to fulfill their original purpose and intent.","In 2012, NASDAQ overcame many of the internal and external challenges that were thrown our way, a credit to everyone on this team. At the end of the day, the challenges we faced in 2012 have made us a better company. As we move forward, we will continue to redefine and reshape our business and create even greater value for our customers, shareholders and stakeholders.","And with that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Shavel","Thanks, Bob. The following comments will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaqomx.com.","I'll start by reviewing our fourth quarter revenue performance. Net exchange revenues came in at $419 million compared to $420 million in the prior year. Subscription and recurring revenue, representing 71% of total revenues, continue to show growth over the third quarter and the prior year quarter. And I'd like to highlight some of the areas in this revenue category where we saw particular strength.","Access and Broker Services fourth quarter revenues increased by 7% over the year to $65 million. While we are starting to see some signs that customers are delaying their infrastructure spending, which has reduced the level of growth for our colocation and connectivity revenues, we continue to see encouraging momentum and positive outlook our for previously announced FinQloud and Microwave initiatives, where we've had a positive customer response and expect revenues starting in the second quarter of 2013.","Corporate Solutions revenue increased 55% with 25% year-over-year organic revenue growth, with solid new business wins for BWise. And in Market Technology, we saw exceptionally strong order intake, rounding out a record year for new business wins. We anticipate first quarter 2013 Market Technology revenues of $44 million.","Transaction revenues, which represent 29% of total, declined by $10 million or 8% year-over-year to $122 million. This was an improvement compared to the third quarter when our Transaction revenues declined 21% over the prior year quarter. We saw a substantial improvement in our U.S. options business, which had double-digit revenue growth versus the prior year through improvements in market share and revenue capture despite lower volumes over that year-over-year period. This represents the first time in 5 quarters that one of our Transaction businesses increased on a year-over-year basis.","U.S. equity volumes, as Bob mentioned, showed some signs of improvement in the fourth quarter and continue to modestly improve in January. We saw some positive trends, in particular, for equity mutual fund inflows in the first weeks of January. While the low volatility environment with higher rates of internalization have contributed to our lower U.S. equity market share, we did see our U.S. equity capture rate increase 8% year-over-year in the fourth quarter.","On the expense side, we continue to show solid expense growth with non -- I'm sorry, expense control, with non-GAAP operating expenses of $233 million in the fourth quarter, flat compared to the prior year. These results reflected incremental expenses from acquisitions and gift spending of $20 million, offset by a decline in core expenses, driven by our cost reduction plan.","Moving onto our 2013 expense guidance, as outlined on Slide 13, we start our 2013 core expense guidance of $850 million to $870 million, which is in line with our 2012 actual core expenses of $855 million. And I would note that we do anticipate an increase of expenses in the core due to the successful graduation of 4 of our GIFT initiatives that will be moving from GIFT spending into our core spending, as well as through some structural increases within our core expense base.","This chart clearly demonstrates how effective our cost reduction efforts were in 2012. Please remember that our initial guidance for 2012 was $915 million to $935 million for core expenses, substantially higher than our 2012 actual results. At current rates, we forecast foreign currency to increase 2013 expenses by approximately $10 million. Our 2013 cost guidance factors in $50 million of expenses related to the acquisitions we made in 2012 -- BWise, NOS and the Indxis business, reflecting the full year expense base for those combined acquisitions. And so this establishes our core expense base of $910 million to $930 million for 2013.","In 2013, we expect to invest $50 million to $60 million in spending on new initiatives as we ramp up our initiatives at NLX and other internal GIFT projects. So our 2013 non-GAAP operating expense guidance sums to a range of $960 million to $990 million.","Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2012 was $186 million, down $1 million compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 44%, down slightly from 45% in the prior year, primarily as the result of lower revenues in our higher-margin Transaction businesses. Net interest expense was $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, a decrease of $1 million versus the prior year. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 35% and 34% for the full year. We anticipate that the tax rate may increase in 2013 due to the potential loss of tax deductions resulting from changes in tax laws in certain jurisdictions. The impact of such tax law changes has not yet been determined. And as a result, we expect an effective tax rate in the range of 34% to 37% in 2013. We understand that this is a wide range with the lower end, or 34%, signifying no change in the current tax laws, and the higher end, or 37%, reflecting an adverse change. We will continue to monitor the status of tax legislation and update our guidance as we get more clarity on the situation.","Non-GAAP net income was $108 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to $113 million or $0.63 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011. The $0.01 increase in our EPS reflects a positive operational gain of $0.04 per share and a $0.04 benefit from our share repurchase activity, partially offset by a $0.03 reduction due to the increased fourth quarter 2012 effective tax rate, a $0.02 reduction due to the ramp up of our acquisitions and $0.02 reduction due to the funding of our gift initiatives.","Moving on to the balance sheet. On Slide 16, we're showing our debt structure and our debt maturities. Our relatively low leverage, strong cash flow generation and spaced debt maturities give the company considerable latitude for our ongoing capital development initiatives. In 2012, NASDAQ OMX generated cash flow from operations of $594 million. Capital expenditures were $87 million in 2012, which is equivalent to approximately 5% of our net revenues. As some of our analysts have recently pointed out, this level of capital expenditure is at the lower end of the range for exchanges.","Deducting capital expenditures of $87 million from our 2012 operating cash flow, results in the free cash flow of $507 million. This relatively high level of free cash flow generation means that NASDAQ OMX is currently valued at an 11% free cash flow yield at the current market cap, substantial discount compared to other U.S. exchange companies which trade in the 7% to 9% free cash flow yield range.","On Slide 17, we show a track record of cash flow generation and cash flow utilization since 2009. As you can see, NASDAQ has generated roughly $2 billion in free cash flow in the last 4 years. We have used that free cash flow to repurchase approximately $1.2 billion of our outstanding common stock. This equates to 53.4 million shares at an average price of $21.97, a reduction of our share base by 26% in this time period. Between 2009 and 2012, Capital Returns from dividends and share repurchases represent 63% of our free cash flow, excluding Section 31 fees.","We have refinanced and restructured our debt with a net repayment of debt of $540 million, and we have invested $320 million, net of dispositions, in acquiring a variety of assets including BWise, NOS Clearing, the Indxis business of Mergent, SMARTS, FTEN, Glide and the business of RapiData. These bolt-in acquisitions have allowed us to broaden our existing business and enhance our ability to grow profitably.","Finally, we paid our third quarter dividend of $0.13 per share in December. This quarterly dividend represents a yield of about 2% at our current valuation. The underpinning of our capital deployment strategy is a robust return on invested capital framework. We continue to see attractive value-creating opportunities for internal investment and acquisitions. And as always, all potential uses of cash are screened to ensure that they have strong returns on invested capital for our shareholders, and we allocate our capital to the highest yielding investments.","Thanks for your time, and I will now turn it back over to John.","John Sweeney","Thank you very much. And operator, we'll now take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bob, on the operating backup, you noted the recent improvement in flows, but as a...","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Ditmire with Macquarie.","Edward Ditmire - Macquarie Research","Whether or not transaction revenues rebound in 2013 and mitigate the trend towards higher recurring revenues, NASDAQ's building this steady, rival, predictable revenues at a steady clip, and it seems to be building a higher capacity to support more dividends. I know NASDAQ finds great opportunities for money to work, for acquisitions, buybacks, et cetera. But can you give us more color on the appetite on your part for a higher dividend payout ratio? And\/or what kind of times would be right to consider things like that?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I would start by saying, one, it's certainly something that we consider. We obviously are, I think, comfortable with the dividend payout today as the best allocation of our capital. But it's something that we and the board revisit on a regular basis.","Edward Ditmire - Macquarie Research","Can I have one follow-up? I wanted to ask you, is there any update on the Jefferies lawsuit related to IDCG?","Robert Greifeld","Sure. Mr. Knight's on the phone. If you could handle that, Ed?","Edward S. Knight","Yes. After a full arbitration hearing for 3 retired federal judges, and a hearing that lasted well over a week, briefing that went on for the year before, NASDAQ OMX prevailed on all claims and Jefferies was not awarded a penny in damages. We vigorously defended this matter and are very pleased with the outcome.","Robert Greifeld","And obviously, well-served by Mr. Knight and, I think, the truth revealed itself through the course of the litigation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bob, on the operating backdrop, you noted the recent improvement in flows, but as we've seen those flows, as you said, those inflows, into the equity markets, higher asset levels and that improvement in client risk appetite, we still seem pretty tepid overall volumes. I mean, what do you attribute that disconnect to?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I think you got -- have to give it time. Right now, we're talking about 3 weeks of inflows and you'd have to reasonably expect that P&M's need to consider what to do with that money and how to invest it. So I think it's, one, it's too early to say that inflows will continue, and it's certainly too early to say what will happen to those inflows with respect to equity volumes. But it is a good thing. It is hard to construe January is being a bad thing, and I would say that we're running ahead of our internal budgetary numbers right now through the month of January.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Understood. Thanks, Bob. And then my follow-up, you've been a really active participant in industry consolidation in the past, and with 2 of your larger peers coming together, I was hoping for your view on ICE NYSE or your next combination, how you think it impacts the competitive landscape and your M&A priorities, as these deals historically have come in bunches in the past?","Robert Greifeld","That's a great question. What's interesting is, we've digested the ICE NYSE acquisition, I think we, the management team and the board, really gained a sense of comfort with respect to the strategy that we have executed over the last number of years, and the positioning we have in the relative markets that we compete in today. And as I've said before, we compete aggressively with NYSE today, we expect that to continue post the acquisition. So we don't see that changing. We don't compete with ICE today and we don't see that changing either. So I think it validates our strategy. We've been able to, obviously, diversify, to do well -- not as well as we'd like, but still very well in respect of the times we lived in. And we're certainly levered to do incredibly well to the extent the economy gets that much better.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess the first question is, strong results in the Corporate Solutions, and I was just wondering, Lee, whether you could -- you did mention BWise, but the $7 million uptick, just quarter-to-quarter, could you sort of dissect that a little bit more? And is that the run rate? Do you think it's sustainable going through 2013?","Lee Shavel","Well, I'd say that, clearly, we saw strong results from BWise. But I also don't want overshadow the fact that we also saw strength, continued strength, in our Directors Desk product, as well as in our PR Newswire business. So I'd say that across the board, we just saw overall stronger corporate activity. We do anticipate that BWise will continue to ramp up, they had a strong end to the year. And we also continue to be optimistic for growth in the Glide product. So I -- in terms of looking forward, I don't want to set a particular expectation, but I think we just anticipate continued growth across the board in our Corporate Solutions business.","Robert Greifeld","Yes. Rich, I think we felt well positioned prior to the Thomson acquisition, and I think we'll be incredibly well positioned post the acquisition. We have invested in spaces that have some core organic growth opportunities in front of them and we intend to execute the plan.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it. And then -- on the expense side, for Lee or Bob. I'm just trying to understand, the spending that you have on Slide 13, the investment spending, the new initiatives as well as the acquisitions. And then trying to understand, I guess, Slide 15, like, how much revenue -- like, should we just take the $100 million to $110 million? What's in the revenue offsets right now? Is that -- I didn't totally understand the slides on 15 -- is that -- is there revenue offsets already in the run rate, too?","Lee Shavel","Well, I think what you see on Page 15 -- if you're looking at the 2013, is that we are anticipating $12 million of revenue from our current new initiatives that have been funded and will be continue to be funded through 2013. So that's what the -- where the revenue is coming from. Obviously, there's the larger amount of revenue which reflects all of the projects that we have invested in over this past 5-year timeframe. So that's the revenue. Rich, I don't know, is there another dimension as it ties to the $50 million to $60 million of expected investment in new initiatives that you were going at?","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Well, I was just trying to see whether we should just model that in without any revenue offsets there. But I think we can do more on a follow-up offline. But I do have one last question I want to ask Bob.","Robert Greifeld","Go ahead.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So, Bob, this is a little bit -- was asked prior. But with -- you talked about shaping and defining the market structure. I think investors are sitting here and, from a regulatory perspective, they're sort of mixed. They see headwinds, they see tailwinds. And you get Jeff Sprick, a friend of yours, coming out and say, he wants to strengthen the equity market structure. So I guess the question is, what are the things you can do that would be briefly but could be positive and help the U.S. publicly traded exchanges? And then, what are the -- what do you see as risk from a regulatory standpoint?","Robert Greifeld","Well, one is, I welcome Jeff to these calls, I assume he's listening in, and we certainly welcome him to the fight to change U.S. equity market structure. I do believe he'll bring a different dimension to the discussion. Obviously, with deep experience in other markets, and I think that will be helpful. When we look at our plans for 2013, we include basically 0 positive and\/or negative regulatory change into those plans. So from that point of view, we don't think there'll be any moves to -- in 2013, to speak to the increasing darkness in the market, nor do we see a transaction tax coming into the markets in '13. We certainly believe that the commission needs to step up to the market structure and address the increasing darkness of the market. And certainly, as we've said before, a large number of stocks is now over 50%, and I think that doesn't help anybody. So while we'll spend time and effort on those discussions, we don't expect -- we're not planning for that to have any impact in '13. And it if it does, we'll be pleasantly surprised.","Operator","Our next question comes on the line of Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess, back on equities. I know it is a smaller part of your transaction businesses, by far, now. But your market share is dipping a little bit. I mean, here we are in January, it's only 3 weeks in, but we're below 18% as it's tracking there. I mean, is that a level that you're comfortable with? Or given that you're such a big listing venue, I'm just trying to understand your level of comfort with market share, does it matter less? I mean, I know it's you and NYX primarily losing to internalization at the market structure, but help me understand what's a good level for you? Where you're comfortable with? You've been very successful with just moving away from price wars into kind of offering different order types, but has that played out? And now, with kind of the algo offering kind of off the table, help me think about what you can do to bring up that share and if you want to.","Robert Greifeld","Yes. Great question. I'd say, one is we're not at our level of comfort with respect to market share. So we certainly, in prior calls, talked about the fact that we were not going to optimalize just for market share, and we look at the capture and the overall health of the business. But our feeling right now is that our market share is not where it wants to be, and we do have, under Eric's leadership, a number of different plans that will be rolling out that I think will address that. And we did have some encouragement in the last week or so from our latest series of moves. So we're focused on it, we believe there is clearly opportunities within the current commission structure to offer more differentiation in how we approach our customers, and it's our job to maximize that opportunity, and we're focused on it. And in no way, shape does that focus mean that we're talking about getting into a compression capture game, we just think it's matter of proper differentiation. So we are focused.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Thanks, Bob. And then on the capital, just now you kind of gotten to know Thomson a little bit better, I assume you've kind of gotten past the labor agreements you needed to get to for the definitive merger agreement. But are you still thinking that this doesn't change your capital return policy, with respect to maybe potential for dividend increase? And then, thinking about maybe capacity of $50 million to $75 million for share repurchases per quarter?","Lee Shavel","Yes. An -- just to reiterate what we've said before, we don't believe that the Thomson acquisition changes our capital return strategy in any way.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So still potential for the $50 million to $75 million a quarter?","Lee Shavel","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Heinz from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just in light of the French transaction tax and then the potential for some of the individual E.U. members to go ahead with a sort of broader transaction tax. Do you think there's a possibility that, that pushes volume in certain markets into your [indiscernible] businesses where it doesn't look like those markets will be subject to any type of surcharges?","Robert Greifeld","Great question. So one, implicit in your point is that, that we don't see any possibility of a transaction tax in Sweden. In that the government has strongly spoken against it. And the kind of been there, done that back in the '80s and it did not work. Whether or not that represents opportunities for us on a pan-European basis, we can't say at this point. I'm looking at Hans-Ole for some answer -- answering this question. But certainly, something that we're spending time thinking about. It's a possible opportunity, but we're not sure if it's a definitive one at this point.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just with respect to U.S. equity regulation. We have a new SEC chair coming into place here this year. I'm just wondering, how you kind of view the two-sided risk, I guess, between -- perhaps a broader crackdown on HFT, this could be detrimental to our business versus a -- sort of a shift away from internalization and dark [indiscernible] which could potentially benefit your business, how do you kind of view these potential offsets between those 2 pieces of regulation?","Robert Greifeld","Yes. So I would say, one, in 2013, with respect to our planning, we have neither positive nor negative impacts from regulatory changes. That being said, if we were to give percentages on one thing happening versus the other. I think there's a growing and broadening base of participants who recognize that the increasing darkness of the market represents a problem. And so I would be more optimistic that in the fullness of time, we're able to make some changes on that. And I certainly believe, with respect to transaction taxes, that it's not something that we've heard mentioned for a long period of time in the States.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then, the HFT piece?","Robert Greifeld","Well, that kind of kind of goes a little bit hand-in-hand with the transaction tax. We don't see any movement with respect to transaction tax or HFT at this point in time. But clearly, not here to speak for the commission and they have to go through their own set of deliberations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow-up on a couple of things. I guess when I look across the business, look at the Access Services business, look at the Market Tech business, and I guess where you got into a slight decline quarter-to-quarter in the Technology business. But when you look across the street, it feels like 2013 is still going to be a year for the rationalization across the seel side [ph] community, maybe to some extent the buy side [ph] community. When you think about these businesses for you guys, how do you feel about, I guess, the growth prospects in those 3 buckets for 2013?","Robert Greifeld","This is Bob. I would say, one, our general attitude to each and every one of our businesses, without exception, is markedly more positive than 2012. And if you recollect in this call a year ago, we gave a fairly somber update. So that's a good thing. We also recognize that's against a low bar with respect to what our expectations were for '12. But it's good that it's better. And as I've said previously, January, for our businesses, has tracked better than we planned. Beyond that, it's hard for us to make predictions for the whole year.","Lee Shavel","And I would -- I'd attack it this way. First, when look at Access Services, as we indicated, there -- and some more of our traditional hardware businesses, clearly, there has been an impact as some of the firms, some of our clients have been reducing their overall technology footprint. Now some of that has created opportunity for us to sell some of our 40-gig connectivity products in place of the 1-gig and 5-gig products. And so, that's an opportunity. In addition, opportunities to sell them, technology that allows them to improve their efficiency, as we're doing with our FinQloud initiative, as well as risk management products, are also driving growth for us across that business. And beyond that, Microwave initiative is similarly -- is something that we see strong appetite for -- that is going to be generating revenues for us very quickly. So on that side of the business, we do some -- face some pressures on the traditional side, but we're seeing good appetite in growth, in particular around cost-driven technologies. As I mentioned, in Corporate Solutions, another key technology business for us, there we're seeing, across the board as I mentioned, good appetite for the Directors Desk product, increase in the number of news releases that are flowing through our newswire businesses, as well as clearly strong appetite for our BWise Enterprise Risk Management software. And then finally, in Market Technology, we have come through a period where we had some customers that did delay some of their spending. But as you saw in the fourth quarter, we've had the strongest order intake that we've seen in quite a while. And I think we continue to be optimistic that there is a shift in mentality. Our clients are feeling somewhat more comfortable in making the investments that they need to over the next years, as we see this market environment improving.","Robert Greifeld","So in listening to Lee talk here, it really is remarkable, because the terms and the names that he's using today really did not exist in our vocabulary 3 years ago. So we have built a culture here to recognize that how we have made our money in the past will not be how we make it in the future. This is obviously fundamental in these times where you're fundamentally facing headwinds on a consistent basis. And we build the culture, we delivered results, as you see this quarter, as a direct consequence of that. Now to the extent that the macro environment gets better, we're clearly leveraged to do that much better. But we know that we have to do new and different things. A year ago, we didn't think about Microwave, we didn't think about 40G as a service, we didn't own products such as BWise. So this organization is evolving really on a constant and consistent basis. And that's been the key to our success and will continue to be the key to our success.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. Lots of good color there. But -- so we -- just to make sure I understand. On the Market Tech, the quarter-over-quarter decline, is it just a timing issue? So going from $48 million to $44 million in the first quarter? And as you said, the backlog is pretty strong, so should we think about the ramp up in the backlog...","Robert Greifeld","The backlog was more than strong. I mean, in the fourth quarter, we took in what, was it $95 million in new orders?","Lee Shavel","Yes.","Robert Greifeld","So Market Tech, independent of the given quarter, had truly a phenomenal year. And we certainly topped it off with the $95 million in the fourth quarter.","Lee Shavel","Yes. There always are going to be, from quarter-to-quarter, delays. These are sometimes large projects with chunky revenues that are dependent upon the actual delivery of those projects, which can be subject to delays. So it may, from a timing standpoint, have an impact quarter-to-quarter. But what we focus on is building the backlog and just continuing to try to bring as much of that revenue through the product. I think what we're most confident about is that the backlog has continued to show strong growth. And we're not really seriously concerned about that sequential quarter results here. This is a business we look at for the long term.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Very helpful. And then my second question is on capital. Obviously, it's a high-class problem to have for you guys. But Lee, I think in the past, you talked about targeting sort of like an S&P 500 like dividend yield, which I guess was shaking out around 2. I guess, right now, maybe you guys are a little bit below that. Without, I guess, giving us too much guidance on this, but do you guys ever think of a sort of metric that you think from a dividend payout perspective or dividend yield perspective that we can think about with respect to further dividend increases?","Lee Shavel","Alex, we look at all of these metrics. And it really is looking at -- our yield relative to the S&P 500, the payout ratios, but most importantly -- sorry to reemphasize this, but we really look at what do we think the returns on our capital are going to be between our various options of investing in the business, in looking at acquisitions or returning it to shareholders. And when we make the decision on capital management and when we discussed that with the board, we look at all of those metrics to try to guide our decisions here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You laid out for us last quarter that, I guess, in your estimation about $50 million of your annual revenues are impacted by high-frequency trading, specifically from transaction revenue and colo. I was just hoping you might be able to broaden kind of the scope of your revenue estimate a bit for us? If we take into account like market data, which is a large chunk of your operating profit, could you give us an idea for what that figure might look like?","Robert Greifeld","Yes. I recollect that number was inclusive of all aspects of our relationship with the defined high-frequency firms, the high frequency trading as we defined it last quarter.","Lee Shavel","That's correct, it did include market data.","Robert Greifeld","Yes, it was the entire customer relationship.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","That's helpful. And then you guys had cited NLX as one of kind of key investments you'll be making in 2013. And I was just wondering, now that NYSE is clearing arrangements kind of in place with ICE, if you could talk about how that might impact your strategy and prospects? Because as I recall, one of your selling points was that Liffe's clearinghouse would be untested and NLX provide an opportunity to remain at LCH. But not sure that, that argument kind of applies now that you've got the proven clearinghouse with ICE?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, I agree. Clearly, the customers in London were giving very little credibility to Liffe's ability to leave LCH in that timeframe. Now Jeff and the ICE team bring more credibility to that, and obviously have demonstrated confidence of that in the past. So that's an aspect of it. But I would still say that the value proposition remains constant in that we will be clearing through LCH. The customer set is there, desires to stay there. And to the extent that we can provide a trading platform that has relative advantage and, first and foremost, is proven and trusted in a given timeframe, I think that will work out well for us. So we are investing in that. We have committed to that, and we're excited about the prospects.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And just one final one for me. The Global Index Calculator service, I know you guys mentioned that in the last call, and I think it was set to launch in the fourth quarter. So I just wanted to get an update on the progress there and maybe your expectations for potential impact to your index revenue line from that in 2013?","Robert Greifeld","Wonderful. We're always happy to have a question on one of our high-margin growing businesses. And one of the final drivers to bring us to the point where we decided with data and the index business together is that we did successfully launched the product in December of 2012. We obviously have many more things we want to do with the product, but it's a major launch to have the Global Index capability available to us. The customer reaction has been very strong. This is a long sales cycle, they want to back test the data, they want to work with our data, and that engagement has been very strong. Now, one of the wisdoms of putting it together with our market data business is distribution in our data world is obviously very strong and also global. And for that to be really integrated indirectly from both the product development point of view and a distribution point of view will give us strong advantage in the market. So we are spending a lot of time, effort on this. As I said in my opening comments, this is a high-margin business, there is a tremendous amount of growth opportunity in it. There is an established order that is a very high-cost environment. We have the ability to disrupt, in a number of different ways, not just on cost, but also in terms of capability and flexibility, in terms of how our indexes are constructed, and still maintain very high-margin. So we're excited about it. We obviously want to focus on it, from both the investor point of view and a management point of view, and one of the key reasons why we have made it a separate and discrete reportable segment going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just want to focus a little bit, again, on the expense guidance, because we're getting an inordinate amount of questions from investors on it, even though your track record on the expense side has always been healthy. I guess what I wanted to talk about is, if you guys can just give some color. When you look at FX and the acquisitions, FX it's kind of clear that it will be a positive net benefit if FX trends hold, given the later slide. Just on the acquisitions side, the impact of BWise, NOS and the Indxis acquisition, maybe if you can give some color just in terms of how accretive those acquisitions are, how the profit margin within those business compare to overall NASDAQ right now?","Lee Shavel","Well, on the acquisitions, I would just -- I'd say, we can't break out any individual acquisition. All of these -- we believe that all of these acquisitions are going to be accretive transactions for us within a year of their acquisition. From a margin standpoint, I don't say that BWise is a software-oriented business, it's inherently a lower-margin business than our Transaction businesses.","Robert Greifeld","Our goal there would need to get that to 20%, 25% margin range, and it's not there today.","Lee Shavel","NOS is a clearinghouse, it's a higher margin business, that's where we've got great operating leverage. We're going to be leveraging not only our operational efficiency, but frankly, also our capital efficiency with NOS to generate a very attractive margin, consistent with our transactional businesses. And with Mergent, this -- in the index business, a great margin business as our existing index businesses. So we certainly think, additive to the margin overall. But I think it's important to understand the different characteristics of these businesses, particularly some of the software business versus some of our more transactional elements.","Robert Greifeld","And I'll just add for you and any investors who are asking, we have a philosophy here that the quest for efficiency is really eternal, and it's something we work on, on a constant and consistent basis. As you saw in 2012, we initiated a formal program, but lacking a formal program is something we look at, and just to ensure everybody that this organization will always run lean and as efficient as possible. And the numbers you have here will be something that we always look to improve upon.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just on the new initiative spending, which is $50 million to $60 million of the guidance for next year, can you just remind us in terms of how you think about the pay off there, the flexibility if the investments are not panning out to cut back on expenses? Maybe the timeline to think about a positive impact to the bottom line?","Robert Greifeld","Well, it's complete flexibility. And what we have set up with our GIFT council is really something ultimately worthy of the top venture capital firms we know in the valley with respect to how we track milestones and how we make fill-or-kill decisions based upon progress towards those milestones. So we certainly would hope that we have the opportunity to spend every 1 of those dollars because all of the initiatives are progressing and doing well. That tends not to be reality. And you saw in 2012, we did underspend on that and that we made the proper decision with respect to IDCG and into entering into a mutually beneficial contract with LCH. And we also had a couple of other less-noteworthy, but other initiatives that did not make it through the process. So it's something that we look at, but we certainly want to go into the year with the ability to fund everything that's valid, that has the ability to grow the franchise. And I'll just say that in my prepared comments, if you recollect, that we had what was $143 million, $134 million, I'm not sure which -- what it was, with respect to revenue in the fourth quarter from initiatives that we'd started in the last several years.","Lee Shavel","And let me just add to that, Chris, and try to give you some sense of the expected timing of payout in levels of payout. This portfolio of acquisition, it has a range of potential investment horizons where we expect them to be profitable and to be generating adequate returns on capital. I would say they tend to bulk towards the shorter time frame of generally within 2 years, some of them are longer, 3- to 5-year investments that we're prepared to make. But generally, what we're looking to do is to put capital into projects that we can leverage our existing infrastructure and generate a quick and attractive return on. But we are prepared, when we think the opportunity is substantial, to make investments that require a slightly longer payout. And what I would tell is that we require, depending upon the project, clear returns that are well in excess of our cost of capital and reflecting the risk of these enterprises.","Robert Greifeld","And for the record, it was $134 million of revenue.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the Corporate Solutions business, there's a bunch of different businesses within that. I mean, how long term are the contracts or arrangements with customers in terms of thinking about how sticky the business is moving forward?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I would say this, I don't think of the stickiness based upon contracts. They certainly vary in range from short term to long term. I look at the stickiness with respect to how integrated is it into the operation of the business that we serve. And as we evaluate these products to build or to buy, that's the key determinant. How sticky is it, how dependent do the companies get on it, get -- to be reliant on these products and services. So as you look across the portfolio products we have, there obviously is some range to them. But they tend to range towards the clearly sticky part of the equation. And the vast majority of the products are not nice-to-have products, but need-to-have products. So we feel very good about it.","Operator","And with that, that does conclude our time for questions. I like to turn the program back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Robert Greifeld","I'll just wrap up by repeating, very briefly, what I said during the call. The fourth quarter was a very strong quarter, 2012 was very strong quarter. As against the backdrop of difficult economic times, it clearly has revealed the diversity of our business model and really within our core that we have evolved and changed our products over time. We are pleased with our progress, we're pleased with our strategic positioning, and certainly look forward to continuing to execute upon this plan. We have the team in place on a global basis to allow us to do that. It's a highly motivated, highly professional team, and we will continue to deliver to our investors. So we thank you for your time today.","Operator","Thank you, presenters. Again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. Attendees, you may log off at this time."],"15526":["The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.

(Operator Instructions) I would now turn the call over to your host, Ed Ditmire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Edward Ditmire","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ's third quarter 2014 earnings results. On the line are Bob Greifeld, our CEO; Lee Shavel, CFO; Ed Knight, General Counsel; Co-Presidents, Adena Friedman and Hans-Ole Jochumsen; and other members of the management team.","After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.","I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations, and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.","I now will turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ's third quarter 2014 results. We are pleased to deliver to our shareholders record-tying $0.72 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and continued strong non-GAAP EPS growth of 9% year-on-year. Year-to-date, our non-GAAP EPS growth is a very strong 11%.","Total net revenue for the quarter was $497 million and our operating margins rose to a very healthy 43%, the highest since the first quarter 2013. We delivered these results against the backdrop of what I would characterize as a more traditional summer, with more seasonality than we have experienced over the past few years, which certainly impacted the topline.","During the quarter, we continued to be vigilant on our expense structure. We achieved an impressive 6% organic year-on-year reduction in non-GAAP cost and we lowered our 2014 expense forecast for the second time this year, which Lee will discuss in more detail in a few minutes.","That being said, the management team here in this room is by no means content with our performance for the quarter. Looking forward, there are a number of developments and instill confidence in our ability to capitalize on the substantial growth opportunities in front of us.","First, we remain on track to again deliver an exceptional full year performance in 2014. Year-to-date, organic growth is up 4% overall and 5% in our non-transaction based businesses alone and our non-GAAP EPS is up 11%.","The fourth quarter has started with excellent momentum. U.S. equities and option volumes are up about 30% month-to-date in October compared to October 2013 levels, and on-the-run U.S. treasury volumes are up over twice that rate. Just recently eSpeed saw an all-time record volume of $210 billion in principal traded on October 15.","Our competitive position across the businesses is extremely strong. In the third quarter 2014, equity market share across our U.S. equity markets rose 1% year-on-year, while our European equity market share rose an impressive 5% year-on-year. Our U.S. options offerings continues to be the market share leader, and we are on our way to being the leading venue for share and equity exchange-traded product options for the fifth straight year.","Our share of U.S. IPOs was 62% in the quarter and 61% year-to-date in a very busy IPO environment. Globally, over 281 companies listed on our markets through the first three quarter of 2014, including 167 IPOs, including significant names such as JD.com, TrueCar and GoPro.","Lastly, we are seeing encouraging signs of operational progress in our acquisitions of eSpeed and the Thomson Reuters Corporate Solutions business, and in new growth initiatives such as NLX and our NASDAQ Private Market. This list is by no means all-inclusive, but provides a solid foundation for our confidence and our ability to continue to execute and deliver for our shareholders in the quarters to come.","Now, I'd like to go into a little more detail about some of the opportunities we see taking shape across this great organization. In our Market Services business, we continue to focus on making incremental progress in capturing market share, and in particular developing new product enhancements.","Market volumes are off to a strong start, as I mentioned, in the fourth quarter. I think it's so important to highlight the work we have been doing across our platforms to enhance features and functionalities for our customers, which will further enable us to take great advantage of increasing volumes.","With respect to eSpeed, we continue to make steady progress on the strategy to improve and enhanced our product offerings. At the end of the second quarter, we completed our technology upgrade to the platform and data center migration. This important step allowed us to move forward with expanding our product menu.","Our first product expansion, an electronic TBill offering has been gaining traction and trading volumes are averaging over $4 billion per day in notional value with a single-day high over $10 billion. We have hosted transactions from 23 clients to date, with a strong representation of the dealer community and have seen a number of individual transactions of over $1 billion in size. This has certainly exceeded our initial expectations.","We have additional products in our pipeline that we've been working closely with our customers to develop. We feel these offerings will continue to add value to the platform and position us for additional growth opportunities in the fixed income space.","Now, moving on to our Technology Solution segment, we see equally promising progress and developments here as well. Let me highlight a few. The acquisition of Thomson Reuters IR, PR and Multimedia businesses represented a great leap forward in our strategic direction.","We have access to great people, technology and global distribution channels. We are in the process of leveraging these assets to take this business and this space really to a whole new level capability. We continue to integrate our acquired and legacy corporate solutions businesses, while simultaneously developing both the next generation of products and developing and deploying a new common order management and billing system.","The integrated enhanced product set, powered by our next-gen IR desktop, will unlock significant cost synergies, as we eliminate overlapping and redundant product families. But also importantly accelerate demand and revenue growth, as it is a more compelling offering that better connects and leverages the entire breadth of the IR product suite. We have invested a lot of time and energy in this next-gen platform in getting it right, and we are excited about what it will offer to our customers.","In fact, we see this as a core driver in accelerating our cross-selling opportunities. We've been on the road previewing the new next-gen platform to our customers, and so far the response has been extremely positive. Customer interest is building and delivering a positive impact on our sales and retention efforts, well ahead of its planned 2015 introduction.","We have also seen marked improvements in our billing and collection process, as this new system is deployed, and we are in the process of moving legacy NASDAQ Corporate Solution products onto the same system. All these initiatives are moving this business in the right direction. The team is focused on enhancing the quality of our offerings and our commitment to our customers. These actions will position this business for growth in the months to come.","On the other side of Technology Solutions, our Market Technology business continues to be one of the core differentiators for this firm. Nobody on the planet has the depth of expertise or product offering that NASDAQ does in this space. During the quarter, our leading position in technology expertise continued to resonate in the marketplace. Our U.S. swap execution facility, trueEX, not ours, but our customer trueEX agreed to use our SMARTS Integrity product, positioning NASDAQ as a compelling offering in the sector.","In the Nordics, the Folksam Insurance agreed to implement our GRC suite BWise. And in the Middle East, Bahrain Bourse launched our X-stream trading platform. The global regulatory environment is slowing moving in our favor, encouraging our customers to take advantage of the full spectrum of our offerings.","Another area that has been incredibly strong for us this year is listings. In fact, NASDAQ continued to lead all U.S. exchanges for IPOs in the third quarter. We welcomed 76 new listings in the quarter, with 41 of those being IPOs. With a 61% win rate through the first three quarters of 2014 and over 167 IPOs in the U.S. and Europe, we continue to capitalize on the robustness of the new issue market and enhance the value we offer to the companies that list here.","During the quarter, we welcomed a variety of companies from energy to consumer to retail. Our market had many new entrance; highlighting a few; TerraForm Power, VWR Corporation, El Pollo Loco Holdings and Office Depot, a $2.7 billion market cap company that switched to NASDAQ from our competitor.","The number of new listings through the end of the quarter is up 46% year-on-year. And in terms of the pipeline, applications are up almost 65% compared to the same period a year ago. While we take pride in competing at the highest level for new listings and potential switches, we also have been thinking strategically about how to capitalize in growth opportunities in this space, while serving the needs of our clients.","To this end, we have focused a considerable amount of time on the needs of private companies with our NPM, NASDAQ Private Market offering. Several new private companies have joined and are completing shareholder liquidity programs through NASDAQ Private Market, including Tangoe and Energi.","NPM also launches ExACT equity product during the quarter, an integrated stock plan administration and capitalization table tracking solutions, which complements the services currently offered by NASDAQ Private Market. As private companies mature, their cap tables become more complex and time consuming to manage.","ExACT equity allows NPM to provide a robust solution that also officially integrates with capital markets activities on the NPM platform. There are approximately 40 companies using ExACT equities product today, and we continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making in serving these companies and this important segment to the market.","Moving on to our Information Services segment, we continue to be encouraged by our Index Licensing and Service business, which has continued to diversify it's product offerings with 11 new ETP launches during the quarter. At the end of the third quarter, NASDAQ licensed 156 exchange traded products globally, which together had over $96 billion in AUM. We certainly see this business as one of the core pockets of opportunity for us in the quarters to come.","Now, in addition to the steps we are taking to strengthen our core business and take advantage of growth opportunities, we have also been focused on a leadership structure that will continue to position us to drive our business forward. Earlier in the year, we announced the creation of the co-President roles to lead the transaction and non-transaction businesses, and the appointments of Hans-Ole and Adena to lead them.","We have always had the fundamental belief, that there is a compounding value of consistency in how we run the organization. With after 11 years and the evolution of our business from a single U.S. exchange to a global diversified business, the time was right for the evolution of our management structure.","More recently, the leadership appointments we announced in our Listing Services and Technology Solution segments are clearly designed to make sure we are aligned with the strategic opportunities in front of us, as we further broaden and deepen our client relationships. We are fortunate to have Nelson and Lars, two long-time NASDAQ executives ready and willing to step into the new leadership roles in Listings and Market Technology.","Bruce Aust, now our Vice Chairman will have a special focus in San Francisco, and in particular in developing the NASDAQ Entrepreneurial Center to be the leading venue for the development of thought and action leadership on entrepreneurial studies.","I also want to take a moment to congratulate John Jacobs, EVP of Information Services, who will be retiring from this role at the end of the year after 30 years of outstanding leadership and contribution to this organization. We would not be the company we are today without John's leadership drive and intelligence through the years. He will continue on as a Strategic Advisor for us in 2015.","In closing, during a seasonally slow period, we focused on delivering for our shareholders, and I'm pleased that our efficiency paved the way for us to deliver a strong bottomline result. There are certainly plenty of encouraging signs that demonstrate the resiliency of our model and the continued growth and expansion of this franchise in the periods to come.","Whether it's October's pick up in trading volume or more importantly the operational progress on our value-creation opportunities, I have every confidence that this management team and our colleagues will continue to deliver and execute for our customers and our shareholders.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee, who will go on in more detail on the numbers.","Lee Shavel","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. The following comments will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaqomx.com.","Overall, our financial performance this quarter can be described as stable operating revenues, pressured by some environmental challenges, such as an adverse foreign exchange environment and some temporary business issues such as the quarterly drop in audit revenues, and the step down of the ELX contract, offset by growth in our Listings business, index and Market Technology, as well as a significant reduction in our overall expense base year-over-year.","I will start by reviewing our third quarter revenue performance relative to the prior-year quarter, as shown on Page 3 of the presentation. Net revenues declined 2% or $9 million to $497 million. Contributing to this decrease was a 1% or $5 million decrease in subscription and recurring revenue, due largely to lower data audit collections of approximately $8 million, pricing actions designed to offset loss subsidies for certain corporate solutions customers, and changes in foreign exchange, offset by $7 million of revenue growth in listings, indexes, and Market Technology.","Subscription and recurring revenue represented 74% of total revenues. Transaction-driven revenues fell 3% or $4 million, due mainly to the changes in foreign exchange, which represented $2 million of the $4 million decline, as well as $2 million in scheduled reductions in eSpeed technology license revenue, as previously discussed. On an organic basis, assuming constant currency and excluding acquisitions, total company net revenues declined 1%.","And if we move to Page 4 in the presentation, we show how that organic growth breaks down between the non-transactional, Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Services segments, and the volume-sensitive Market Services segment.","On the bottom of this page, we reiterate our views on the medium-term organic growth outlook for the non-transactional segments. I'll reiterate what I've said in the past that these views were meant to reflect multi-year cross cycle periods, and actual growth in shorter periods can be above or below these ranges. And I would also note that in connection with our annual periods as reflected and our year-to-date period for 2014, our performance remains consistent with this guidance.","I am now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted.","In Information Services on Page 5, we saw a 3% or $3 million decline with operating margin down slightly to 72% from 74%. Market data had a 7% or $7 million decline in revenues due largely to an $8 million decline in audit collections compared to the third quarter of 2013 period. This along with some impact from foreign exchange more than offset other increases such as revenue growth from NASDAQ Basic.","In Index Licensing and Services grew revenues 22%, due principally to the growth in assets under management, and exchange traded products licensed to NASDAQ indices, which rose 22% to $96 billion at the end of the quarter. Technology Solutions, as shown on Page 6, saw a 2% or $2 million decline, and the operating margin rose 7 points to 13%.","Corporate Solutions revenue fell 4% or $3 million year-over-year reflecting our extension of certain subsidies to legacy Thomson Reuters Corporate Solutions customers, which reduced revenue by $3 million per quarter in 2014. Elsewhere in Corporate Solutions, we saw offsetting positives and negatives.","Organic growth was material in press releases and the Directors Desk governance products where we saw a 21% increase in published press releases and 16% growth in Directors Desk users. However, Investor Relations products also faced intense competition as we continued our migration to new product and billing platforms. We remain confident that as this process is completed and more clients are exposed to our next-gen platform, as Bob described, we will resume revenue growth. To this end, we have already seen important head-to-head competitive wins and improved retention.","As I said last quarter, current period revenue run rates reflect the fact that the changes we're making, while essential to supporting growth in the long term have a temporary negative impact, something we would expect to fade as we move into and through 2015 when more and more of the enhancements and transitions will be completed and synergies realized.","Market Technology revenues grew 2% or $1 million, a bit below the recent trend, as most of the growth at BWise and SMARTS was offset by foreign exchange headwinds. The backlog at $621 million remains 6% above the same period last year and order intake was $28 million for the period.","Consistent with what we've said in the past, we continue to expect year-over-year improvement in Technology Solutions segment margins in 2014, expect ongoing margin improvement in 2015, and continue to work towards the 20% margin target by the end of 2015.","Market Services on Page 7 saw a 3% or $6 million decline in revenues, due mainly to foreign exchange and the impact of the scheduled reduction in revenues from a technology license customer at eSpeed. Operating margin rose to 46% from 43% in the prior-year period.","Net derivatives trading and clearing fell 7%. European revenues were down slightly due to foreign exchange, while net U.S. derivatives were down due mainly to lower average capture. While our capture in the third quarter of '14 was steady from the recent periods, the prior-year period had experienced a recent high-end pricing. These decreases were partially offset by higher industry volumes.","Net cash equities trading revenues rose 13% as we saw market share higher in both U.S and Europe, and a material rise in U.S. capture overcoming some modest foreign exchange headwinds affecting the European revenues.","Net fixed income trading revenues fell $5 million from the prior year with about $2 million in decline due to the scheduled reduction of revenues associated with the technology license customer and the remainder driven mostly by lower average capture. In Access & Broker Services, revenues fell $2 million or 3% to $63 million in part due to foreign exchange impact.","Listing Services on Page 8 saw a 4% or $2 million increase in revenues due to an increased issuer base and more new issue activity on the U.S. side, while foreign exchange impact meaningfully offset a higher market capitalization of issuers on the European side. Operating margin of 42% was up 3 percentage points from the prior year.","And I'd note U.S. IPO wins in the quarter increased to 41 from 38 in the prior-year period; five companies' switched listings to NASDAQ in the quarter, while two departed; the U.S. issuer base has 6% more companies at the end of the quarter compared to the prior-year period. And in the Nordic market, new issue activity has been strong as well. And at the end of the third quarter, the number and capitalization of listed companies rose 3% and 11%, respectively versus the prior-year period.","Turning to Pages 10 and 11 to review the income statement and expenses, non-GAPP operating expenses decreased by $20 million or 7% from the prior year, due largely to declines in compensation and contract services expense. Partially, this reflects changes relating to our tracking of annual performance goals, as our outlook for 2014 activity levels moderated somewhat during the period. But it also reflects the impact of changes we made in spending plans during the second quarter as we've described. Organic expenses fell 6% this quarter assuming constant currency versus the prior-year period.","If you turn to Page 12, in light of the somewhat lower than expected third quarter expense result, we have lowered our full-year expense guidance. Our updated 2014 expense guidance decreased to $1,205 million to $1,225 from the $1,220 million to $1,250 million previously.","While year-over-year comparisons are somewhat challenging, given the two material second quarter 2013 acquisitions. If we take the second half 2013 expense run rate and annualize it as a best available post acquisition baseline, our updated 2014 expense guidance reflects a roughly 1% to 3% decline versus this second half 2013 annualized baseline.","Non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter of 2014 was $213 million, up 5% from the prior-year period. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 43%, up 3 percentage points from the prior-year period.","Net interest expense was $28 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $2 million versus prior year, due to the deleveraging we did from a recent peak debt levels at the second quarter '13 closings of eSpeed and Thomson Reuters IR, PR and Multimedia businesses. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 32.4%, and we continue to expect the full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to come in within our 33% to 35% effective tax guidance range.","Non-GAAP net income was $125 million or $0.72 per diluted share compared to $113 million or $0.66 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2013, matching our quarterly record. The $0.06 increase in our EPS reflected a $0.05 improvement in our core operating profitability and $0.01 was added from non-operating impacts, primarily from the lower tax rate, but offset by higher fully diluted share count as well as an increase due to lower interest expense.","Moving on to the balance sheet, if you would please turn to Slide 13, our gross debt to EBITDA leverage fell to 2.4x from 2.5x last quarter, due mainly to a decrease in the book value of foreign denominated debt as well as an increase in our EBITDA, and does not reflect any incremental paydown of debt in the quarter.","We repurchased 27 million of stock in the third quarter and 35 million more thus far in October, bringing our repurchases since resuming our buyback program in the second quarter of this year to $156 million. Reflecting this activity, we continue to believe share repurchases generate attractive returns for our shareholders, and we will continue to be opportunistic and aggressive when we attracting buying opportunities. As always, we continue to put capital to work, where it generates the highest returns for our shareholders.","Thank you very much for your time. And I'll now turn it back over to Ed.","Edward Ditmire","Thank you. Operator, can you please open the line to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","I guess my first question is on the expenses, Lee. So if you look at your guidance, and we took the first half and then subtracted the previous guidance, and you would have expected somewhere, even if you're at the low end, close to $300 million, if you use the midpoint $306 million and you are significantly below that. I know FX must have played some role. So you significantly beat.","I'm just trying to see whether that was something that was occurring during the quarter or towards the end of the quarter? And then, if you look at the guidance going forward, now that you have three quarters, it's the same thing you're implying at the low end, close to $300 million in 4Q and at the midpoint $308 million, which seems very high from the $284 million this quarter.","Lee Shavel","So I guess, Richard, look, just looking for guidance in terms of the drivers this quarter.","Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","Well, I guess, why was it down so much $284 million in 3Q? And then why would it go back up to $308 million?","Lee Shavel","Sure. So the simple answer, Rich, is that, in the third quarter the biggest component of our expenses is compensation. And we are constantly evaluating where we are relative to our overall goals within the business.","And in the third quarter, as you saw, our revenues were down on an absolute basis and that influences our performance goals, and we effectively had to reduce our overall expectations for our compensation. That had the biggest impact on the overall expense level. That's obviously something going into the beginning of the quarter, when we set our expense guidance. We don't have perfect insight into. And so over that quarter that's the primary influence.","There was also an impact of foreign exchange, which also reduced the dollar value of our foreign expenses, due to a decline in the dollar, SEK rate. And then we also had what I would describe as some sequential year changes, particularly related to some retirement in pension liabilities that were approximately $4 million associated with that.","So if that's what contributed to I think a particularly strong reduction in this year-over-year period, we obviously can't anticipate fully in the fourth quarter what the performance would be, because obviously the volumes are stronger, so we may see higher expenses as a result of a more volatile operating environment.","Robert Greifeld","And also just to add one thing, in the fourth quarter you traditionally see our marketing expenses are high. So we have some seasonality to expenses as we look at the fourth quarter.","Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","And then my one follow-up, Bob and Lee, is you made some significant progress in the operating margin of Technology Solutions. And I'm just trying to see, it looks like expenses went down, again I'm sure there's an FX impact by more than 10% quarter-to-quarter, the implied expenses, if you look at the margin.","So I'm just trying to see, of the $35 million in synergies that you guided to, how much is in there already, because if you look at the implied it will be $14 million down just quarter-to-quarter. Even if you took these expenses against last quarter's revenue, you get to an 18% margin. So anyway, the short question is, how far are we in that $35 million? And is the 113 implied expenses a good run rate?","Lee Shavel","So, Rich, a couple of things. One, as it relates to the operating margin for the Technology Solution sector, I would caution you, it's obviously a good increase from where we were a year ago. But it does reflect some of the compensation reductions that I just described in the earlier answer.","And we also had a reversal of some bad debt charges that we had taken earlier in the year that it proven to be not necessary. And so that 13% level is, I would not describe as a normalized level. I think that we will probably view that more in the high single-digits levels, still representing an improvement on a year-over-year basis.","And in terms of the $35 million in synergies, as we've described we're still engaged in migrating the platforms. We're still in the investment phase. And I think we have realized some portion of those savings, but I would say that we still have a significant portion to achieve, once we fully migrate it on to the other platforms. But remain very confident that we'll be able to achieve that on the timeline we described.","Robert Greifeld","So, Rich, I would say that the business is focused right now on effectiveness and we are obviously taking some efficiency drives. But we're doing a lot of investments in certainly the next-gen product, which I referred to in my comments. And this next-gen is not just for IR, but it's really across the whole product suite that we have. We obviously have to make investments in kind of the infrastructure support.","So we're pleased with the efficiency we achieved so far, but that has not been our primary goal. Right now our primary goal is to make sure this organization is effective and competitive, and really can take great opportunities with the changing product sets that we'll be delivering.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kenneth Hill with Barclays.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays","I wanted to start with some of the pricing changes you guys had in Corporate Solutions, the compensate for the loss of the subsidies. Is that fully in the run rate at this point, because we've seen those revenues kind of tick lower within the Corporate Solutions? Just want to see what the outlook is there?","Lee Shavel","Yes, Ken. They are fully in the run rate and amount to approximately $3 million a quarter. That's the revenue impact.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays","Next one here, on the listings, and so you guys had some really strong IPO trends in the quarter and you mentioned NASDAQ Private Market had some nice developments here as well. But your overall listings revenue within the U.S. is kind of flat. I know that's down quarter-over-quarter, just given some of the FX impacts. But how should we think about that here over fourth quarter and even into '15, given the IPO environment right now?","Robert Greifeld","Well, certainly, the Listings business is I think, you and most people on the call know, but I'll repeat anyway. We recognize the revenue, the initial listing fee, over six years. So that's a muted impact up and down.","Lee Shavel","And I just wanted to point out that we actually had -- $2 million of growth came in the U.S. listing fees year-over-year. And the European listing fees were flat over that period. So I think counter to your perception that we actually had 5% growth in U.S. listing fees.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays","So I was just looking quarter-over-quarter for that?","Edward Knight","Yes. Quarter-over-quarter it was flat, and then it was down sequentially $1 million in the European listing fees.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays","So outlook is just taking a little bit more time, as you guys mentioned what the amortization of those fees overtime?","Lee Shavel","That's right. Exactly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Bob, if you can just talk a little bit more about the NLX strategy, where we stand on that, the current drag to current results, and how you're thinking about that coming into yearend and in 2015? Maybe just comment on market share and whether there is any thought about reviewing, continuing with that program into 2015?","Robert Greifeld","We're certainly pleased with the progress of NLX. You see market share in the teens in Euribor. And just in the last week or two, you saw the Schatz market share go up into mid-to-high single-digits. So we're pleased with that point. And I'd also say that NLX has now achieved a certain level of creditability, where you see significant new players wanting to become involved with the effort. So good execution in the quarter, we continue to work away. We understand progress in this kind of new initiative is not linear, but so far so good.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","And how about the earnings drag for the quarter on the market payments -- the payments to market makers?","Lee Shavel","It was stable to the prior period and for the prior-year period, Brian, so no change in that level.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","And then just, my follow-up would be just on eSpeed. Can you talk a little bit more about the revenue growth outlook there, and coming to 2015, both on your view on market-driven volumes and then also the product development, the new products that you've launched and have in the pipeline in terms of the cross-sell ability to those, and to your user base over the next, say, 12 months?","Robert Greifeld","So I'll add a third dimension to your question. So, one, with respect to market share, we're not pleased with our progress there. We continue to work very hard at it. And I think our engagements with our customers are reaching new introductive levels. So I think we'll see progress in that.","With respect to volumes, we got teased by a good week and one great day. This week it's back to where it kind of was. So we see the power of the franchise in rates move. We certainly are expecting good things. But we really can't control that. We watch it everyday, but we can't control it.","On the new product side, we're certainly, I think executing very well. As I mentioned during our prepared remark, the bills product has gone very well. Our next product introduction is coming right around Thanksgiving, with full rollout come the first of the year, and we're excited about that. So we have a fairly robust pipeline of products. We want to stage them, and make sure each and every one of the rollouts is as successfully executed as the bills was.","So market share, we've got some work to do. Volume were teased, but nothing that seems to be staying with us. And third, the product introduction has been well done so far.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","So first question just on the share count. So you guys bought back through October a little over 3 million shares, but I guess if we look at the total share count, it hasn't move all that much recently. Can you give us a sense of what the creep-in from, either it's eSpeed or just kind of like the regular comp related share issuance? Just to kind of get a better sense on over the next 12 months or so, what kind of the gross issuance or the gross creep-up in the share count should be?","Lee Shavel","Alex, the annual share issuance associated with eSpeed is approximately 1 million shares each year. And then from a compensation standpoint, it's generally between 2 million to 3 million shares each year.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","And then my second one is, I was hoping to get your thoughts on the SEC's recent decision to hold a hearing on SIFMA's complaint about pricing and market data, which I guess they agreed to do in early '15. So just from, I guess from a time line perspective, was hoping to hear, how do you expect this to play out, and what your response is expected to be?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I would led Ed answer part of this question, but first I would say, market data has been a debated topic in this industry now for decades really, when you think back on it. So this is a latest piece of a continuing saga, and we certainly don't see it have any impact in terms of our businesses. Ed you want to comment?","Edward Knight","Yes. Very much consistent with what you said, Bob. We believe this claim is without merit. I would point out through the years, as Bob has alluded to, with the New York Stock Exchange we have rebuffed these challenges, including a direct suit that SIFMA brought against the SEC that they lost. And I think the record is very strong that we have a wide suite of competitively priced data products that in many cases results in customers saving money across the board. I think that record is very strong.","Robert Greifeld","Yes, what Ed is referring to is NASDAQ Basic, really, it has the ability and it's been, I guess, the most successful data product in our industry in quite some time, and it does reduce our customers cost anywhere from 40% to 60%. So we're proud of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","First, on options market share. There's been a decline this quarter, I was hoping, you could just share some color on what's going on there, and maybe talk about the trade-off between share and revenue capture?","Robert Greifeld","A good question. Something we obviously deal with all the time in our transaction businesses. So we did see some decline in share, but it was certainly not directly correlated to revenue. And that the share we lost was from volume that was most attractively priced there. So I think we're doing a very good job of optimizing those two dimensions, and we pay attention to it all the time.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","And then just going back to NLX, as we head towards the ESMA rulemaking process in December, I was hoping you could share some color on what you're hearing from both our customers and regulators, as everybody lobbies each other?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I would say this, the NLX effort is not predicated on any ESMA rules. I mean, we're trying to leverage the horizontal clearing capability that LCH brings to the marketplace. So we're not trying to essentially gain access to a vertical monopoly at this point in time. So NLX has a clear path. I would say clearly the lobbing is very intensive with respect to how ESMA would play out. I mean, the current set of ESMA rules, as they're currently constituted I think is very favorable for NASDAQ OMX. We are definitely proponents of the horizontal clearing model and we support that. Hans-Ole, would you like to add anything?","Hans-Ole Jochumsen","I think you were precise.","Robert Greifeld","Trying to be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets","So just going back to the Thompson Reuters business, you referred to some pricing you're offering to promote client relationships and I wasn't sure if that was related to the subsidy issue or if this is something completely separate, more related to the competitive pressure that you mentioned in the Investor Relations product. So just wanted to get a little bit of more detail on kind of what's being offered, why you think it's necessary on that piece.","Lee Shavel","Certainly, Jillian. To be perfectly clear what we were referring to was, our continuation extension of the subsidy that had been previously offered by the competitor. We believe that both from a relationship standpoint as well as due to associated revenue from those clients that is non-subsidized, as well as what we see the opportunity of continuing to extend those relationships, it was absolutely the right economic decision for us to continue those subsidies and that's precisely what we're referring to.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets","So there's nothing else, it's just that $3 million that you already disclosed?","Lee Shavel","That's correct.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets","And then on the regulatory front, we're getting close to having the SEC's proposed Tick Size Pilot with at least one of their test groups embedded trade-at provisions. And I was just interested to get your thoughts on, like how much we should be reading into this? Do you get the sense that the regulators and the industry are kind of trying to test out a trade-up. But if test group three's data successful, it could be expanded to the broader market or do you think this has always been and will always be something that, in the regulator's mind, is kind of relegated to less liquid stocks and not a industry-wide type of solution?","Robert Greifeld","Well, the first thing I'd say is when you look at the broad sweep of regulation across the globe, there is a strong trend line towards some trade at type or trade at equivalent type of rule and that's applying to most developed market. So I would certainly predict that in the fullness of time here in the U.S., you're going to see an evolution of the market structure rules, hopefully aided and informed by the results of the Tick Pilot.","But I'd also say that here at NASDAQ OMX, we're focusing on the world that exists today and making sure that we can compete and better serve our customers. And if you've been following our daily midpoint liquidity, product and services has been growing in popularity and that's allowing our customers to get price improvements mostly in the dark, but it is price improvement in the context of the rule sets of an exchange, so we're proud about that.","So when you think about where we're going to go, we certainly will be a strong advocate for market structure changes. I think we'll improve our market, but we're also going to be quite pragmatic about making sure we do things today that work within the construct of the current rule set.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Mike Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","First, just on the revenues, if I look at the sequential change, it looks like there's -- if we exclude the transactions, given the seasonality, and then also the $8 million in audit, it looks like sequentially it's down maybe 3%, and maybe the FX impacted that as well, so maybe 2%.","I guess I'm just trying to understand, when I think about like what's seasonally soft, so whether it's the tech business, if you had a little bit of seasonality this quarter, Corporate Solutions, just anything to try to get a sense on going into the fourth quarter, can you see some rebound? Because it just seemed like across the segments there was a little bit of softness, versus something like you pointed out, whether it's audit or in corporate solutions, that pricing change; just wanted to see if there was anything else that you would point out as more seasonality versus just core?","Robert Greifeld","So Lee, why don't you answer that and let Adena fill in some of the blanks.","Lee Shavel","Sure. So Mike, I would say that from a Market Services standpoint, I think we generally lower levels of overall activity reflecting some of that softness that Bob described that's kind more of a traditional slowdown. Beyond that we obviously had a strong Listing business due to the continued strong IPO market and we had a mix in the Technology Solutions business, some areas of growth in the press release, in the governance products as well as some weakness on the Investor Relations products.","I think, you generally would see a slower activity in the third quarter from some of those event-driven businesses like the PR business as well as the Multimedia businesses, and so I think, that probably had an overall contribution to some of the lower revenues in the third quarter.","And in market data, there really isn't a lot of seasonality in that business. And with regard to Market Technology, there typically our strongest quarter is the fourth quarter; the third quarter does tend to be a little bit on the slower side. So those are the elements of seasonality that I think we saw in the business in the third quarter. And I'll hand it over to Adena for any additional color on that.","Adena Friedman","Sure. Just a couple of additional details. With regard to the Market Technology business, in the third quarter we tend to find that our clients request and execute fewer minor enhancements to their systems that we tend to work with them on, so our minor -- what we call our client request revenue tends to be lower in the third quarter, just based on vacations and other things happening among our client base.","And then with regard to the Corporate Solutions, as you mentioned, Lee, also in relation to the fact that over the summer, it tends to be a slower period for a lot of corporate clients, that means that they request fewer multimedia events, they request fewer things where we provide service and get paid on more of a one-time basis as opposed to the recurring revenue streams for most of our products there.","Mike Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just on the buybacks, just given the authorization and given the pace that we saw in the quarter and in October, I guess any change in the outlook there, just given where the debt level is? What the maturities are going forward in the cash flow, or is it going to be more of the same kind of ongoing and then opportunistic?","Robert Greifeld","The answer is no change in our strategy. And I think, the point that I want to emphasize is that, as I've said a couple of times, we want to be opportunistic on the share repurchases. As you saw in the second quarter with the impact of the Flash Boys, we were very aggressive in that quarter.","In the third quarter, I think you saw a pretty steady trend upwards in the stock price. There weren't a lot of pull backs for us to be aggressive opportunistically. And then clearly in October, as we've disclosed given some of the downdraft in the global markets, we saw an opportunity to be more aggressive.","So overall, we continue to remain committed to this as a significant means of returning capital shareholders. We continue to believe, that at these valuations, there are very good returns on capital for it, but we also want people to understand, we're going to be opportunistic quarter-to-quarter and so that will create some variances. But overall, the share repurchase authorization is emblematic of our continued commitment to do that when the opportunities exist.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo","Just want to follow-up on that question and answer regarding the revenues. So you guys give us the year-on-year growth rate, which negates the impact of seasonality. And if we look at that growth rate you're down 1% year-on-year excluding FX. You guys talked about some discrete items this quarter, if we back those out, so the negative impact from data and the pricing changes in Corporate Solutions, what would your year-on-year organic growth rate would have been in the quarter?","Robert Greifeld","Excluding the market data, which I think is the big impact, for this year-over-year period, we would be looking at 2% organic growth on a year-over-year basis. And I think that reflects some of the seasonality, and meaning that I think that this recognize it's a year-over-year comparison, that we feel, as though that it was a slower summer this year relative to last year that is contributing to some extent, but again, its one quarter. If you look at our year-to-date performance for the non-transactional businesses, we still are within the guidance range that we have, that we've set.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo","And follow-up question on the IR, PR business. If everything goes right there and you guys start firing on all cylinders with your next generation offering, what kind of revenue growth do you guys think you can do there? I know you've got, I think a mid-single digit revenue target for that whole segment, but I'm wondering specifically for the Thomson business.","Robert Greifeld","Yes. We haven't disclosed that. I would say, obviously, we're focused on making sure the product is good as they can be. The market itself is quite large, but certainly we would aspire to have a double-digit growth rate in that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington - JPMorgan","First on pricing, I believe, NASDAQ raised prices on listings, and other exchanges have raised prices selectively both in trading and non-trading businesses. Maybe how do you think about pricing power based on the competitive nature of your businesses? And is pricing a relevant component of revenue growth, as we look out over the next two years to three years?","Robert Greifeld","One, I would say it will certainly be a component of our revenue growth and we really look at how are we delivering value to our customers, and then are we being properly compensated for that value. So the listing business, we have spent a lot of time and effort growing the suite of product and services we offer to our issuers, and we had not raised prices for quite sometimes that was more than fair. And I think the uptake from our customers is representative of their view of that. And we do have the grand opening of our new market site coming up in the next two weeks, so we're excited about that. So there is pricing capability, but we do it based upon how are we delivering value to customers.","Ken Worthington - JPMorgan","And then, what other areas do you think are most conducive to price increases, like just very broadly. I don't need specifics, but what other areas?","Robert Greifeld","Well, when you innovate and you're doing something that your competitors cannot do or will not be able to do for quite some time, then obviously you have more pricing power. So when you look at how we're investing in our future, and we're doing a number of things I classify that are blue ocean, where there is not a strong competition, and we're going to spaces where people don't exist. Today, that has the ability to have strong pricing power and strong margins. And you had even the seasonal slowdown a strong margin in the third quarter. So we expect that to continue and hopefully improve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - KBW","And on the Technology Solutions business, and you gave a lot of color there, and we appreciate it. It sounds like you're probably ahead of plan maybe on migrating some of the Investor Relations business as well as the Information Services. But just looking near-term for the fourth quarter, given the seasonality you pointed to in the third quarter and with some issues there for the Technology Solutions. Is there anything in the fourth quarter this year that it's just that it should be weaker than the fourth quarter last year, because there was a huge gap between third and fourth quarter last year and there is some seasonality that benefits the fourth quarter? Is there anything that would change that this year?","Robert Greifeld","Nothing that I'm aware of. Lee or Adena?","Adena Friedman","I think that in the fourth quarter of last year we did have some significant new business coming into the Market Technology business. And in terms of the fourth quarter of this year, there are certainly some opportunities there, but we don't have any like major new clients coming online with a full solution in the fourth quarter of this year. But otherwise, no, there is nothing else.","Niamh Alexander - KBW","So just because the new clients came on last year, Adena, would they have kind of given a unusual bump maybe to the fourth quarter last year?","Adena Friedman","We had significant kind of enhancement revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. We always have seasonality to that. I think the fourth quarter of last year was particularly strong. But otherwise I think that we will find that generally business is usual across on both the parts of the business.","Niamh Alexander - KBW","And if I could go back to the options and maybe Bob or Tom, if you're around. We've kind of lived through in the equities in the past. We have a non-public competitor that's starting to gain some traction or some more attraction, and to really kind of go aggressive on the pricing. And they're already significantly lower than you, but they're taking a bit of share.","So help me think about your philosophy and your latitude, and your interest to kind of maintain the market share levels, and your capacity to kind of -- not necessarily get down to where their pricing is, but to take some more pricing hits along the way. It seems like it's a pretty profitable business for you guys too, so you can take a bit of hit on the pricing to maintain the market share, how do you feel about that?","Robert Greifeld","Well, first I would say is the context is somewhat different between equities and equity option. So the market structure in equity options is different. There is internalization within the exchange itself, and all option trades really have to be traded on exchange. And in that internalization or allocation process, there is relative competitive advantages that are somewhat price insensitive. So we recognize that as a context, but clearly it's a competitive world in the options marketplace.","You correctly identify there will be some non-public rational competitors. We've been in this movie before. I think we have a well-trained management with Hans-Ole and Tom, and the rest of the folks who will know how to play the game of chess and the optimization between profitability and market share.","Now, as I've said previously, it's something we think about on a regular and consistent basis, and we definitely look for the proper balance. And I think based upon some of the share we won at the cash rate -- the share we lost and the cash rate we're receiving for that, I think it was the proper decisions.","Operator","Our final question comes from Neil Stratton with Citi.","Neil Stratton - Citi","I just wanted to ask a question about NASDAQ Private Market. How do you think the revenue opportunity could progress overtime? And sort of, part B, when you think inflection there would be some more material to the topline?","Robert Greifeld","So, one, I would say, the basic model for NPM is that a company that's on NPM should generate 2x the revenue then we get from a similarly situated company that's on the public market. And that's in consideration of the nature of trading that will exist on NPM and how it will be conducted. And obviously, the services we'll offer to these private companies that are not always germane to a public company.","So that clearly will be material to us overtime, as these product and services grow and the companies grow. So right now, we're obviously focusing on getting our experience in running liquidity programs for these companies and also developing our product with cap table management, because that is really probably the first thing they are interested in is to maintain control of their shareholder registry. And in addition to running a direct service we can offer that through our liquidity programs there.","So in terms of when this will be meaningful, we haven't clearly articulated that. But I think the thing to watch is how many companies we have and capture per that level of company relative to public market. And I think they'll be surprised at the comparisons we can bring forward in the quarters to come.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back to Bob Greifeld, CEO, for closing remarks.","Robert Greifeld","Well, thank you everybody for your time today. As we said, we had a seasonally slow quarter, aggressive expense management. Also you saw again the diversity of our business model, where three quarters of the revenue is recurring, resulting in any difficult quarter record-tying earnings.","Fourth quarter has started at a lot stronger pace. We do hope that it continues. But regardless to that, we continue to execute upon our chosen business pathways here. And as I said previously and in the remarks, we see more opportunities in front of us right now for growth in this institution that we have seen really since I have been here. So we're excited about what we've accomplished in third quarter, look to do even better in the quarters to come. And I thank you for your time.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect. And everyone have a great day."],"15349":["Nasdaq OMX Group (NASDAQ:NDAQ) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 25, 2012  8:00 AM ET","Executives","John Sweeney - ","Robert Greifeld - Chief Executive Officer, Staff Director, Member of Executive Committee and Member of Finance Committee","Lee Shavel - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategy","Analysts","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Richard H.

Please go ahead.","John Sweeney","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ OMX's First Quarter 2012 Earning Results. Joining me today are Bob Greifeld, our Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Shavel, our Chief Financial Officer; Ed Knight, our General Counsel, joins us as well. ","Following our prepared remarks, we'll open up the line to Q&A. You can access the result, press release and the presentation on NASDAQ OMX's investor website, nasdaqomx.com. We intend to use our website as a means of disclosing material nonpublic information and for complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD. And these disclosures will be included under the Events and Presentations section of the site. ","Now before I turn the call over to Bob, I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this prepared presentation and during the subsequent Q&A period may relate to future events and expectations, and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The actual results may differ materially from those projected in those forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and other periodic reports filed with the SEC. ","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Greifeld","Thank you, John, and thanks -- thank you, everybody, for joining us on this call this morning. I would first like to thank Vince, who has done an excellent job for us in Investor Relations for NASDAQ OMX over the past 6 years. Vince is assuming increased responsibility in our market data group, where I'm sure he will continue his success driving that business. So thank you, Vince. ","We're also, obviously, pleased to have John Sweeney join us today. He's our new VP of Investor Relations, and I'm sure all of you will enjoy getting to know John. I'll begin by spending a few minutes highlighting our results and then update you on our plans going forward. Lee will then walk you through the detailed financials. ","For the first quarter, our net exchange revenues were $411 million compared to $413 million in the prior year, up 1% when you exclude the impact of currency changes. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, the same level as the prior year quarter and also equaling our fourth best performance ever. This solid performance concerning the weak U.S. trading environment reflects the benefit of the diverse non-transaction driven businesses that we've built over the past several years. And that now represents over 2\/3 of our net exchange revenues. ","In short, while our combined net cash equity trading and derivatives revenues were down $15 million from the prior year quarter due to volumes, revenues from our other businesses were up $13 million continuing to grow across the board. ","Net exchange revenues in our volume-based trading and clearing businesses of $127 million declined compared to the prior quarter as a result of the challenging volume environment. In the U.S., derivatives trading clearing -- once again, we had a leading market share. However, revenues were down $6 million versus the prior year. Please remember that U.S. equity trading and derivatives revenue increased an impressive 45% year-on-year in the first quarter 2011, so we faced a very difficult comparison this quarter. ","Our European derivatives revenues were flat compared to the prior year if you do not consider the impact of currency. U.K. energy continues to perform well on both the NASDAQ OMX Commodities and N2Ex platforms. Total cleared volumes reached 36 terawatt hours during the first quarter of 2012, an almost fourfold increase compared to the same quarter last year and up 65% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. ","In the U.S. cash equity markets, we continue to experience a low trading environment with only 6.83 billion shares of average daily volume this quarter. This is down from almost 8 billion shares in the first quarter of last year and is the lowest level we've seen in the last 4.5 years. NASDAQ OMX had a 21.3% share of total U.S. matched volume, up from 19.2% in the first quarter of 2011. ","U.S. cash equity revenue capture was lower in the quarter, driven by higher volumes in our ISP volume incentive program. ISP is designed to attract retail and institutional order flows and rewards firms that exceed certain liquidity provision and execution requirements. We are optimizing pricing for the ISP program, so we expect our capture will improve as we move through the second quarter. ","Our European cash equity revenues of $23 million were flat again without considering currency compared to the prior year quarter. Keep in mind that volumes can be volatile, and it only takes one good month to have a reasonable year. We had one good month in 2011 and a good 6 weeks in 2010. With the continued uncertainty in Europe and around the world, budgetary discussions in the U.S. and the upcoming election, we believe trading volumes have, at least, some bias to the upside. ","Now looking at our non-trading portfolio of businesses, these revenues accounted for $284 million in the quarter, more than 2\/3 of total revenues, and these revenues increased by 5% year-over-year. I think it's important to note that each of these individual businesses: Access Services, Market Data, Broker Services, Issuer Services and Market Technology all saw positive year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2012. ","Issuer Services were up 1% to $90 million. Global Listing Services revenue were down slightly compared to last year as the number of listed companies continues to decline due to mergers and acquisitions and the weak IPO market we've experienced over the past few years. However, we do see positive signs here, and I am happy to say that our current IPO backlog is robust. This quarter, we signed 46 new listings, including 22 initial public offerings. ","On the regulatory front, we are encouraged to see that the Job Act's passed and believe this is a positive sign. Congress certainly understands the importance of helping new companies gain access to public financing. ","In the first quarter of 2012, we welcome several switches from other exchanges, including Blue Chip, Texas Instruments and Analog Devices. Texas Instruments began trading on NASDAQ in January. Earlier this week, they also became part of the NASDAQ-100 Index. We are certainly delighted to welcome Facebook to our family of listed companies. We're proud of our heritage of attracting technology companies. And today, over 73% of U.S.-listed technology companies have chosen to list with NASDAQ, with an impressive list of tech companies that includes Apple, Google, Intel, Microsoft and eBay. ","Our Corporate Solutions business continues to grow, up 11% from the prior year quarter. In particular, the Directors Desk iPad application continues its success, and we've increased from 1,400 users at the end of the first quarter of last year to over 4,300 users today. Directors Desk represents how effectively we've been able to leverage our distribution of an exceptional product to our Issuer Services clients, in addition to NYSE listed and private companies. ","In addition, our recent acquisition of Glide Technology has been well received by our clients looking to upgrade their social media and public relations capabilities. Also in Issuer Services, I'd like to highlight the continued success of the Global Index Group where license revenue again increased this time by another $1 million to $14 million in the quarter. This is a high-margin business where we've had good growth and foresee continued growth. Most importantly, our new INET-based index calculator, has just gone into production, giving us the ability to continue to innovate and develop new indices and products for both our licensing and proprietary data revenue streams. I think we have the opportunity to be the change agent in this space, and we can be competitive in the index market and an attractive price point with a very good margin. ","Access Services revenue increased 8% over the first quarter 2011 due to increased demand. During the quarter, we continued to expand our business to broker-dealer relationships around the globe. They are adapting to changing business needs and certainly evolving regulatory environments. Our acquisition of FTEN has substantially expanded our dialogue with broker-dealers on risk issues. And we are excited about the growth opportunities that are available to us in this sector. ","In Market Data, our business performed exceptionally well. Despite the weakness in the financial industry and continued low volumes, we saw a growth of 7% year-over-year. The success of our new products and our ability to maximize the value of our existing offerings drove the increase. ","In Market Technology, our revenues were up 5% from the prior year. Our order pipeline is solid, and we've just signed a significant 5-year extension to our contract with the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. In addition, we continue to win deals for our SMARTS Broker compliance business. We launched 4 new markets in the SMARTS Broker solution, and we signed 20 new subscriptions. In addition, China Merchants Securities selected the SMARTS Broker platform to monitor their traders and client trades. We are pleased with the growth of these businesses, and we continue to confidently invest in new product and services through our GIP, our initiative -- new initiative funding program. We have a strong pipeline of projects that are in various stages of accomplishment and implementation. And we continue to aggressively monitor these projects. ","We also continue to evaluate bolt-in acquisitions that will fit strategically, allowing us to lever our existing resources and capabilities and meet our increasing and capital return targets. ","As we look towards the balance of 2012, there are a few signs the market is improving. Our business is performing and our earnings power in the current environment is testament to our solid execution over the past years. Nevertheless, if volumes continue to be weak, we will continue to focus on the things that we can control, most importantly costs. We have introduced a cost reduction program to maintain our commitment to cost leadership. We expect the cost reduction plan to deliver actual cost savings of $25 million in 2012 and expect to achieve an annualized run rate of cost savings of $50 million by the end of 2012. And this will be achieved through a combination of technology savings, facility savings, other infrastructure costs and headcount. Our cost reduction program ensures that we will have the correct business infrastructure in place, should the weak current business trends continue. And it positions us well for when our businesses return to its normal growth. ","In our press release, we also announced that we have signed a nonbinding agreement regarding LCH.Clearnet Group proposed acquisition of IDCG. Upon closing of the transaction, we'll become a shareholder of LCH.Clearnet Group. This shareholding will be a core asset of NASDAQ OMX. This deal will free up capital for us and strengthen our relationship with LCH and their owners. We are strong believers in the horizontal clearing model that LCH represents. ","Also today, I'm pleased to announce that we are acquiring the Norwegian-based clearinghouse NOS Clearing ASA. It is a clearinghouse primarily for freight, seafood derivatives and electricity certificates. This acquisition will allow NASDAQ OMX to move forward with the global ambitions within the energy and commodities area as a good example of how we can leverage on our technology and confidence. ","On a topic of a great interest to many of you, I'm sure you've all noted that we announced today the declaration of our very first cash dividend of $0.13 per share. We're very pleased to take this step as a continuing demonstration of our commitment to return capital to shareholders and to optimize our returns on capital. The dividend will be part of our capital return strategy in conjunction with continued share repurchases under our ongoing program. Lee will describe our strategy in greater detail in his remarks. ","It is important to note that our capital return strategy is built on a continued strong and stable cash flows, even in this challenging market environment. On Slide 4, you can see that we have excellent free cash flow over the past 5 years, increasing our annual free cash flow by a compounded annual growth rate of 50%. This impressive growth was the direct result of our strategy to invest in new organic growth initiatives, make sound acquisition decisions and manage our capital efficiently. ","What's very interesting is back in 2007, was the last time we saw our volumes, U.S. equity volumes, this low. And they were at 6.49 billion. Back in 2007 with equity volumes at 6.49 billion, we achieved $0.38 a share. Last quarter at 6.8 billion, we did 61. Obviously, the execution of our plan has resulted in a diversification of our business and a broadening of our product offering, and as you can see, a solid track record of growing our free cash flow. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Shavel","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Our GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2012 was $85 million or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to $104 million or $0.57 per diluted share in the prior year period. ","Non-GAAP expenses for the quarter included a $12 million impairment charge on our equity investment in EMCF, a $9 million restructuring charge, primarily related to workforce reductions and $2 million for merger and strategic initiatives expense. ","Excluding these costs, our non-GAAP net income was $108 million or $0.61 per diluted share, essentially consistent with our results of $110 million or $0.61 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at irr.nasdaqomx.com. ","Starting with revenues, net exchange revenues came in at $411 million compared to $413 million in the first quarter of 2011. As Bob described, each of our businesses that are not industry trading volume driven, including Access Services, Market Data, Broker Services, Issuer Services and Market Tech achieved revenue growth, increasing in aggregate by $13 million in the first quarter from the prior year. This increase was offset by weak industry trading volumes, which generated a drop in revenues of $15 million from our U.S. cash equity and U.S. derivative trading and clearing businesses. This outcome reflects the success of our strategy over the past several years of developing diverse businesses that are not volume driven and contribute earnings growth. ","Looking in greater detail at our trading revenues, which represent less than 1\/3 of our total revenues, total net derivative trading and clearing revenues were $74 million in the first quarter, down $6 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. The year-over-year decline was the result of 8% lower industry trading volumes in U.S. options and a slightly lower market share in the U.S. derivative market. ","Total net cash equity trading revenues were $53 million in the first quarter of 2012, down $9 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. The decline was driven primarily by 14% lower industry trading volume in the U.S. and lower U.S. equity trading revenue capture, partially offset by an 11% increase in market share from 19.2% in the first quarter of 2011 to 21.3% in the first quarter of 2012. ","Revenue capture was reduced by a higher proportion of volume from our ISP program, designed to reward market participants for higher-quality liquidity and order flow. We don't anticipate further declines in revenue capture in the coming quarters. While it remains early in the second quarter, U.S. option volumes have shown some improvement, but U.S. equity volumes remain weak. So I think it's fair to say that our current volume trends have continued into the second quarter. ","Moving on to our other businesses, which account for over 2\/3 of our revenues. Issuer Services revenues were $90 million in the quarter, up $1 million compared to the first quarter of 2011 as increased Corporate Solutions and higher Global Index Group revenues more than offset lower Global Listing Services revenues. ","Total Market Data revenues of $87 million reflect a $6 million or 7% increase compared to the year ago quarter due to the increased tape plan revenues and increased sales of U.S. proprietary Market Data products.  Access Service revenues of $57 million were up $4 million or 8% year-over-year, driven by continued growth of fixed protocol and colocation revenues and a positive pricing impact. ","Market Technology revenues of $45 million increased $2 million or 5% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Our pipeline of new deals was strong in the quarter, and we are forecasting revenues of $44 million to $46 million in the second quarter of 2012. ","Now turning to expenses. On Slide 9, you can see that our total non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $229 million, representing an increase of $8 million when compared to the first quarter of 2011. The increase was driven by higher professional and contract services for technology and legal services, higher occupancy costs from a buildout of our colocation facilities, increased compensation expense and increased marketing and advertising expense. ","On Slide 10, you can see that for 2012, factoring in the impact of our cost reduction plan, we now expect core operating expenses to be in the range of $880 million to $900 million. Please note that our updated guidance also includes the impact of a Corporate Solutions revenue reclassification, which reduces expenses by $10 million and a reduction in 2012 expenses of $25 million, resulting from our cost reduction plan. Our target for annualized run rate cost savings to be achieved by the end of 2012 is $50 million. This cost guidance does not include the restructuring charge associated with the cost reduction plan estimated to be $30 million. Additionally, this cost guidance reflects our current level of revenues. If market conditions improve, we'll adjust our guidance accordingly. ","We expect to continue to invest in promising new initiatives, which generate growth and good returns on capital. Consequently, we continue to expect to spend $40 million to $50 million on new initiatives in 2012. We expect second quarter new initiative spending to be $5 million to $10 million higher than the first quarter of -- level of $6 million due to project timing. ","Funding new initiatives has always provided organic growth opportunities for NASDAQ OMX and has enabled us to provide consistent revenue growth in excess of costs as illustrated on Slide 12 of our presentation. We continue to track the individual performance and returns on each of these investments and are committed to terminating projects that don't meet our return expectations. ","Continuing down the income statement. Our non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2012 was $182 million, down $10 million over prior year results. Operating margin came in at 44%, down from 46% in the prior year period, reflecting higher expenses as described above and reduced U.S. cash equity trading and U.S. derivatives trading and clearing revenues that resulted from the lower trading volumes. Obviously, this also reflects a shift in our business mix from the higher-margin transaction businesses to our other businesses. ","Net interest expense was $22 million in the first quarter of 2012, a decrease of $8 million from the first quarter of 2011 due to refinancing of our credit facility in 2011, the repurchase of $335 million of the 2.5% convertible notes and continued debt pay downs. ","Finally, on the income statement, the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 33%. We expect the tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 34% in 2012. ","Moving on to the balance sheet on Slide 13. With the implementation of our new Nordic clearinghouse clearing structure and member-sponsored default fund at NASDAQ OMX Nordic Clearing in the first quarter of 2012, we significantly changed the nature and extent of the risk loss in the event of a member default in our clearing operations. Since the full risk of loss will now be shared among clearing members, we no longer report the fair value of derivative positions and the contract value of resale and repurchase agreements in our balance sheet. ","Consequently, both total assets and total liabilities have dropped by $5 billion from December 31, 2011. In addition, and as a result of member capital contributions, NASDAQ OMX released $83 million in clearing capital, with an additional $30 million to be released in the second quarter. ","In terms of capital utilization in the first quarter of 2012, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of our outstanding common stock at an average price of $26.32 [ph] for $50 million in aggregate value, and we reduced debt by $110 million, enhancing our financial flexibility for the future. ","At March 31, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of $525 million and total debt of $2 billion, resulting in net debt of $1.5 billion. This compares to net debt of $1.6 billion at December 31, 2011. Total debt-to-EBITDA is 2.3x as of March 31, 2012, and net debt-to-EBITDA is 1.7x. ","Now on Page 15, I would like to spend a little time discussing how NASDAQ OMX has grown cash flow and how we have put that to use over the past few years. As you can see on the chart, NASDAQ OMX has generated nearly $1.7 billion in cash flow from operations over the past 3 years. Capital expenditures have totaled $189 million for that period, leaving us with $1.5 billion free cash flow for the 3-year period. And we've put that cash flow to good use in 3 areas primarily. ","Capital return. We've allocated the largest amount of that cash flow to shareholders through repurchases of approximately $900 million of our outstanding common stock or 41 million shares at an average price of $21.50 in this time period. These repurchases have collectively reduced our share base by almost 20% in the last 2 years alone, and we think this represents an excellent return of capital to our shareholders. ","Secondly, repayment of debt. Over these 3 years, we have refinanced and restructured our debt with a reduction of almost $400 million. And finally, acquisitions. In these 3 years, we have invested over $225 million acquiring a variety of attractive assets, including FTEN, SMARTS, Glide Technologies, Nord Pool and RapiData. We believe that these bolt-in acquisitions allow us to broaden our existing business and enhance our ability to grow over time. ","Now turning to Slide 16, I'm going to outline our current capital deployment strategy. NASDAQ OMX generates between $100 million and $125 million in non-GAAP earnings each quarter. We invest about $15 million to $20 million of this in capital expenditures, leaving about $85 million to $105 million in available capital. Part of this available capital will be used to fund our cash dividend, about $23 million a quarter. This reflects the 13% quarterly dividend, equivalent to an approximate 2% yield at the current stock price. We also plan to use -- utilize about $25 million of this for small and medium scale M&A and for internal new growth initiatives through our GIP program.","Finally, after the dividend, M&A and growth initiatives, we have approximately $37 million to $57 million in deployable capital for a range of uses, including share repurchases, deleveraging, additional M&A opportunities that meet our return hurdles or other corporate uses. Supporting all of these decisions on our capital deployment is a robust return on invested capital discipline. We continue to see attractive value-creating opportunities for internal investment and acquisitions, but we must be convinced they will deliver an adequate return on capital. ","Thank you for your attention, and I will now turn it back over to John.","John Sweeney","Thanks very much, operator. We'll now take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe just starting on the dividend real quick. I think go -- leading up to it, I think you sent mixed signals in terms of like the size and how you think about them. So maybe you can just talk a little bit more about how you arrived at this dividend yield or this payout ratio? And maybe a little bit of how you think this can grow over time and what we should look for in terms of how we should grow the dividend, I guess, over the next few years?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I would say this, Alex. One is we'd want you to focus on the fact that we have released the -- announced the dividend today. And we're certainly not going to speak about how it might grow over time. I think Lee did an excellent job taking you through our cash flow in a given quarter and how we think about that. And Lee, why don't you just touch on that again?","Lee Shavel","Sure. The thing I would emphasize is that we first established the dividend with an analysis of our cash flow and making certain that clearly, we have the ability to support this. We also believe that the level that we initiated this at is an attractive yield and comparable to our other exchange competitors as well as the S&P 500, certainly within the range of those other players. But fundamentally, we believe that this is a level that we can support, and that we're very pleased to establish this level.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. And then just maybe staying on the capital side, not to get too detailed here, but obviously, I see the deployable capital of $37 million to $57 million a quarter, which certainly allows for healthy continued buyback. Maybe I missed this, but with the capital that was just released from the clearinghouse, and I think IDCG will probably release another $75 million or so, maybe you can refresh us on that? If that transaction goes through, can you just tell us what you would do with that excess capital? I guess buybacks would be the most logical route here.","Lee Shavel","Yes, the -- you're correct. I think our -- we expect with IDCG, as we've said in the past, that, that will release approximately $75 million in addition to the Nordic clearinghouse. Now certainly, utilization of that capital, if we see opportunities to invest that internally and are generating and regenerating, what we believe, are going to be good returns on that, that will be the first priority. But in the absence of any expectation of an investment opportunity, then we would expect to utilize that for share repurchases going forward, as we've indicated in the past. Where we released capital within the business, if we don't have a good alternative use for that, then we'll be returning that to shareholders.","Robert Greifeld","Our board has authorized $300 million share repurchase, and it's obviously our intention to carry through on that.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just like a very quick one. Section 31 Fees in the quarter, I don't think you actually disclose those anymore. Can you just give us that number and maybe put it back in the release going forward?","Lee Shavel","I think you'll see this number in the 10-Q. Our Section 31 Fees for the first quarter of 2012 were $71 million in comparison to the first quarter of 2011 of $73 million. So that disclosure will be -- will continue to be in the Q.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander of KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Can I touch on the options business because that is the biggest of your transaction businesses? And we've seen some competitors get pretty aggressive with price reductions effort. I think you've made some changes in March. Help me think about the pricing going forward because your pricing's held up pretty well relative to where we might have expected. Should we -- and you'd mentioned in equities, you don't expect it to come down this quarter, but help me think about options.","Robert Greifeld","Well, one with options, and we covered a little bit on the last quarter. But I think the team has executed very well. You saw some increase in share quarter-on-quarter, and we have a number of different plans in place. And I think our ability to maintain our capture rate is pretty strong.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So we shouldn't necessarily expect you to follow with kind of fairly significant price cuts?","Robert Greifeld","No, I think we have more clever ways to approach it. The other thing I would say is with respect to the ISP program in the equity world, it certainly was more successful than we anticipated in the first quarter, which has obviously some good elements to it. It certainly improved, I think, the attractiveness of our venue. But we will be tweaking the pricing on that program and some other things in May, which we are very confident will have a positive impact on our capture rate.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then if I can go back to the capital, and thank you for the disclosure for kindly laying out the flexibility, help with the buybacks and the deals. And philosophically, do -- are you more inclined to kind of long-term look towards kind of growing the dividend that you're giving yourself this level to kind of want to grow the dividend in the future versus kind of laying it out there and think is the level we're at and we kind of need all that other flexibility. Is the kind of level of debt somehow limiting the dividend right now?","Robert Greifeld","No, Niamh, one is I would say that we have announced a dividend. We've thought about it for a long period of time. And when you saw the dividend program, it's easy, but you have to think about it in the context of your future. So I think it's well-thought out at the board level, at the management level. And I think the way Lee described the quarter and how we break down our cash flow in the quarter to the extent that those numbers increase as a business is successful over time. I think you could draw your rational conclusions from there. So certainly, as we achieve greater financial success, we would certainly look to the allocation of that additional capital in, I'd say, a fair way.","Lee Shavel","And I would just add one thing to that. Niamh, I know everyone naturally is focused on the dividend today, but I want to make certain that everyone understands that it's merely part of our broader capital return strategy. And that our plan to continue share repurchases as a component of that as we allocate what we think is a pretty substantial amount of our excess capital generated back to shareholders through both channels is important to understand beyond just the specific dividend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First question is on the $50 million in cost reductions and $25 million realized this year. Can you help us with what areas that will come out of? Is there any revenue impact to that as well?","Robert Greifeld","No. First point, no revenue impact to us. We're certainly just doing a bottoms-up analysis of how we can become more efficient. As we've said through the years, the quest for efficiency really never ends. We're putting a little more emphasis on it now based upon our given set of circumstances. But each and every area of our expense base will be subject to greater efficiencies. So it's hard to focus on any one. I highlighted 3 or 4 in my prepared comments. But Rich, we're not going to leave a stone unturned is what I would say.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then on Market Technology, and this is on Slide 8 specifically. I see the pipeline grew nicely. But if you look at the total order value and how it's -- you put in how it's bucketed per year, it looks like it got pushed out where more value is in the later years, actually 2012, down a bit. Is that -- will that impact the actual Market Technology revenues in 2012?","Robert Greifeld","No. I mean, 2012 is shaping up to be a very good year for Market Tech. It hit the wires today that we just signed a deal with Nigeria, and the Swiss Exchange also just went live with a new platform, so they're enjoying some strong trend lines. And I think over the long term, Rich, we certainly expect to have Market Tech continue to grow through some of our broker-based offerings, meaning basically SMARTS and FTEN and the extension of products we're going to build from those acquisitions.","Lee Shavel","And Rich, I would also just point out that the increase -- that the $114 million in 2012 is an increase from the prior quarter. So obviously, we're expecting continued growth in 2012.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I had -- well, from the last earnings press, I had $141 million in 2012, but it could be my error. Anyway, last question, on LCH.Clearnet. So this -- I know we talked. You were looking for sort of resolution last quarter. And can you give us a feel for the timeframe, I guess, because even the timeframe of where this capital might come into play and be freed up because the transaction is still, I guess, not fully consummated.","Robert Greifeld","Yes. No, it's definitely not fully consummated. I think conservatively, you would see us be able to free up the capital probably early in the third quarter, in early summer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen of Evercore Partners.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First on the expense savings plan, the $25 million in 2012, was anything in the first quarter run rate? And is any potential savings from IDCG baked into the expense savings plan?","Robert Greifeld","The answer is I think no on both counts.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I'm not sure if I missed it. Did you guys provide a breakdown of the European derivative business by asset class?","Robert Greifeld","No, not by asset class.","Lee Shavel","We'll follow up with you on that after the call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen of Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bob, can you just elaborate on what you mean when you say LCH is a core asset and what your long-term aspirations for that asset going forward will be?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I meant that we'll be a shareholder, and we don't have intentions obviously to sell the shares by that statement. And in my prepared comments, I talked about support for the horizontal clearing model, so we think there's opportunities to work with LCH to lever that approach into different asset classes.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then Lee, on last quarter's call, you noted some of the $40 million to $50 million of new investment spending wasn't earmarked yet, and you're going through that process. Could you just give an update of where that is and where some of that has been allocated to?","Lee Shavel","Sure. I can't, Howard, mention specific projects, but they were clearly -- we were identifying our targeted level for 2012 that anticipated a pipeline of projects that were being presented to us internally. I think since that last call, there has been -- there've been probably 2 projects, 2 additional projects that we've reviewed that probably account for $3 million to $5 million in incremental expense. And as I've pointed out in my comments, you'll see an increase in the new initiative spending in the second quarter of $5 million to $10 million, up from the first quarter level. And that reflects both some additional projects as well as a phasing-in of projects that have previously been improved, but you simply had increasing investment requirements as we build them out here.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then just final one for me, on the Technology business, Bob, in a weaker volume environment, does that necessarily -- like does that accelerate or delay conversations that -- with other exchanges to kind of outsource or seek technology solutions?","Robert Greifeld","I would say the exchange business, exchange Market Technology business is relatively immune to short-term volume trends in the marketplace. You could see it at the spot level with respect to what we call CRs, customer request, because obviously that's of the moment. But we have not seen that at this point in time. And the Technology business is going very strong. As I said, the Nigerian deal, which just went public today. We have another signing that we can't announce yet, but it's coming. We have TOCOM last quarter, and then obviously, the Swiss Exchange went live. So we're doing quite well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier of Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Maybe one question on the expenses, the color's helpful. But when you look at your cost structure and you look at the percent that's variable, like where does that stand now? And just if we continue to be in a weak environment or it even gets weaker, you just want to kind of gauge what portion of the cost structure or the expense base is --you have the ability to reduce versus the fixed side?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I mean that's, I think, a timeframe-dependent question. So we operate on the concept that all fixed costs are variable over time, so we can make some medium-range plans that can take the cost bases down quite dramatically. I think your question is in the short term, what can you do? And certainly, the number that we've put out there, the $50 million, I think is a very reasonable and achievable target for us. And I would take that as the way to look at the cost basis in the short term. To the extent the volumes were going to be 5 billion shares for a long period of time and basically a similar decline in Europe, then we can take other changes, other steps. It will just take longer to implement.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one other one on the capital side. So in that excess capital that you have each quarter, you have multiple options in terms of what to do with that. But just give us an update on the target capital structure, just so when we look at what debt's coming due over the next 1, 2 years, we at least have an idea on, if you're going to be paying that down versus if you're comfortable kind of where the debt level is. And so most of the priorities are going to geared towards either M&A investment, buybacks or the dividend over time.","Robert Greifeld","Sure. We are very comfortable with where we are from a debt standpoint with the total leverage at 2.3x. And I would say that we're prioritizing  \tthe capital generated towards the, as we said before, the high -- where we think we can generate the highest returns. If those returns are in the business or through mergers and acquisitions, that's going to be the top priority. Secondly, in the absence of that, share repurchases would be the next alternative. And I don't think we have any defined plans to reduce our debt levels from this point. From a debt maturity standpoint, we continue to -- it will be very comfortable given that we refinanced our debt in the third and the fourth quarters with some of the changes that we've made. We don't have any significant near-term maturities. Our next significant maturity is for our convertible notes in 2013 of $89 million. Beyond that, it's really just our $400 million maturity in 2015. So we're not anticipating any near-term pressure to refinance any of those maturities.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And Bob, just on the volume environment. So I think we all kind of look around and try to figure out if this is like the new norm or a variety of issues out there that are weighing on activity levels. So just, I guess, any insight that you have. And then probably more importantly, just given the percent that's off exchange more recently and part of that's due to the volatility, but anything there that can bring more not only back to NASDAQ, but to New York to the competitors, but just more in the lit markets?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, 2 very good questions. One, with respect to the macro view of volume, we obviously try to find the one data point, which will point the way to us. And that's obviously not available, but we do study, as I think we've covered previously, the net inflows into the loan-only funds. And certainly, that has been in a downward trend line for multiple years. And to the extent that, that reverses -- then it will have a positive impact on the overall volume. And we certainly keenly recognize that when you have natural flow in the market, that it has a dramatic ripple effect on the volume. It just is somewhat of a feeding frenzy. So we watch that very closely. And then stepping back from that, we pay attention to consumer confidence as a clear correlation between consumer confidence and inflows into the equity marketplace. So if I have to give you 2 data points, that was -- those would be them. Neither one of them are particularly positive at this point in time, and we deal with that reality. Now in terms of volume, you have short-term spikes based upon volatility, which we've seen in the last 2 years. And so that tends not to be sustainable over time. So the first 2 factors identified can give you a sustainable volume environment, the volatility tends to be episodic. We tend to enjoy those episodes so we certainly can't plan for, but hope for something like that happens somewhere in 2012. And I think it's a reasonable assumption. With respect to the increasing darkness in the market, one is it's important to recognize we think there's a proper role for dark bulls in the market. We understand that lit markets can't do everything all the time for everybody. We also understand the lit markets are the place of price formation. And to the extent that there's going to be dark trading, it should deliver some incremental value to the markets since it's not contributing to the common good of price discovery. And the 2 metrics we look towards is basically size, and price would be a proper delineation of that. So we think lit markets are good overall. We're certainly here, defenders of lit markets. And we have common cause with the other exchanges on that.","Lee Shavel","Bob, before we move to next question, I wanted to come back and clarify the answer that we gave to Rich Repetto regarding the backlog. Rich, the -- our previous report in the fourth quarter of '11 for the order backlog of $141 million, that includes 12 months of 2012. The drop, $214 million, is because that reflects only 9 months of the year, so it's not a full-year-to-full-year comparison. We continue to believe that the increases in the order in the backlog are positive for 2012 as we indicated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So question on expenses here. I just want to maybe reconcile a few things that we've been talking about. So it sounded like in the prepared commentary that the expenses may come back up, assuming a better environment. And I'm just kind of curious if there's really no revenue impact from these cost reductions, why aren't they permanent? Why they're variable in nature? I wonder if you can kind of help me out with that.","Lee Shavel","Well first of all, the comment that we made on the expense guidance is that we are bringing our expense guidance for 2012 down, obviously driven by the expected reductions that we will achieve in 2012. And it also reflects our current expectations for the -- for where we are from a revenue standpoint, assuming that there's no change in revenues. Now obviously, to the extent that the market environment improves and revenues increase, then we do have a variable component to our expense levels that may increase. And so we're merely making the point that if the market conditions change, then we'll adjust guidance accordingly. But make no mistake, we are looking at our current cost infrastructure. We are making very specific reductions in our infrastructure to achieve these hard dollar levels of cost savings that we will -- it will certainly be difficult to move back up. But there are components in our expense structure that are more variable, specifically incentive compensation tied to our performance that will increase in an improving market environment.","Robert Greifeld","But I do want to make clear that when we speak to the $50 million, that's a permanent reduction. That is us doing more with less of an expense base.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's it. And then I guess the second question here on the listings business, congrats on the Facebook IPO. I mean, that's obviously a great win for you guys. But it seems like NYSE has also had some recent successes in technology, and even though it's really only 2 competitors out there, it seems like the competition for new listings is pretty intense. Have you guys seen any pricing pressure as a result of you and NYSE kind of going at it here in the tech IPOs, or has that been really not the primary driver of competitive advantage?","Robert Greifeld","Well, I would say that the competition has been intense for a long period of time. I think it's been intense since the day I walked in here back in 2003. And I do remember the Google bake-off was equally intense. But that being said, we've had tremendous success in the technology franchise. And our ability to have companies switch to NASDAQ in the technology space is unparalleled. So we had Texas Instruments, as I said, they're just joining the NASDAQ-100 and ADI. So Texas Instruments, I think, was $35 billion and ADI was $11 billion. So it's as intense as it has ever been. We expect it to continue to be. And with respect to pricing, as I think people know, our top rate is just $100,000. And theirs is at $500,000 so we're certainly not feeling any pricing pressure to reduce that.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then with the problem that BATS had, obviously, they're going to be out of the listings business at least for a while. Is the technical glitch they had, is that unique to BATS or is that something that could potentially happen to NASDAQ? And what can you guys do to make sure that, that really doesn't happen on your system?","Robert Greifeld","Yes. Well, I would say that BATS never really got started in the listings business and it's hard to build that franchise. And we certainly have direct experience with what BATS had to accomplish when we did the BRUT and INET acquisitions. And we had to take SuperMontage on those 2 platforms and put it together. We chose INET, and the big gap from functionality is that SuperMontage as a listing venue always had the ability to run an auction to open and close the market. And INET did not have that and our team had to build it. They obviously built it successfully and not what we've done forward from there. We are a technology-based businesses. We have to engineer our technologies as best as we can, but certainly, we're sympathetic to what BATS went through. We recognize that the business is hard, and we certainly have excelled at it. We have a wonderful team. And certainly, our experience over the last 9 years shows you how good that team is. But we're not overconfident. We recognize that when you've got to engineer and be very careful about how you release product to the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Can you refresh us on the current P&L impact of IDCG assuming today then if we -- so we can kind of model it post the transaction does close?","Robert Greifeld","So as I said before, IDCG basically was around $0.01 per quarter. Use that as a round number. So after that closes, we'd have that sort of positive impact.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just to clarify an earlier comment about the capital coming out of the Nordic clearinghouse, is that something that will be then moved back to the U.S. for the potential capital allocation that you guys have outlined? Or is that something that will stay over in Europe?","Lee Shavel","At this point, our expectation is that, that will stay in Europe. Obviously, there are repatriation costs that are imposed if we bring that back to the U.S. We are, on a regular basis, able to bring some amount of capital, but our current expectations are that, that amount will remain in Europe.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Is there specific projects or potential M&A opportunities that are being outlined or that you have kind of, as a backlog, for that capital or will that just be used over time?","Lee Shavel","We do expect that, that capital will be utilized in a variety of internal and potential acquisition projects within Europe on a small scale.","Robert Greifeld","And it's interesting, our last 2 acquisitions have been in Europe. NOS that we announced today and Glide earlier in the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller of BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Now that the member default fund in the Nordics has been completed, I think, kind of based on what you said in the past, it sets the stage for you to make progress on your plan to become more of a Pan-European clearinghouse. So I just want to get an update on that. What the next step is in that plan and kind of what road marks we should be looking to?","Robert Greifeld","Yes, that's a great question. So when you look at the Nordic clearinghouse, this is what the last step to make it, I think, operating subject to European norms and really the norms of all clearinghouses on a global basis. And when you see what's transpiring in the derivatives world, in particular, the over-the-counter world, we have a version of that, that is transpiring in the Nordics. And now, we're ideally positioned to take advantage of that, whether that be in repos or interest rate swaps centered around our Nordic-based currencies. So I would say that's the short-term thing. We've been investing in that for the last year or so. And I think we're in a very good position to monetize that as we get to the end of 2012 going into 2013.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then I saw that you announced plans to launch a third options exchange. I just want to see if you have any thoughts on what your angle's going to be there, just in terms of pricing or market structure to differentiate it?","Robert Greifeld","Well, the first thing I'd say is when you look at our initiatives, the ones that have the greatest certainty, with respect to providing a somewhat immediate return and increased profitability is the use of additional licenses here. So we obviously have 2 very successful options markets today. And within BX, you've seen what we've done in the equity side, and that's been more of a pricing play. So I think you'll see a combination of average, both pricing and market structure in BX options. And we're highly confident it's going to have a similar success as our other use of licenses has had.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bob Greifeld for any closing remarks.","Robert Greifeld","All right, great. Thank you. The one thing I do want to say, with respect to the acquisition we announced today, it will be immediately accretive to our shareholders. As you look at the details of the acquisition, the purchase price was somewhat less than the cash on the balance sheet. So combining that with our existing energy and commodities franchise will provide a quick and substantial return to our shareholders, so we feel good about that. ","And then I'll just close on the comment again that we have been on the long march to diversify these businesses while making sure we focus on our core. This has been, I think, most evidenced in this quarter. $0.61 is our fourth best performance ever, and we did that against a very low volume environment. The last time we saw a volume environment like this, we made $0.38, so clearly a testament to the team here in terms of the work they've done over the years. And that work has also resulted in tremendous cash flow generation, which Lee touched on quite well. That cash flow generation allows us to confidently announce this dividend today and also to reaffirm our commitment to the share buyback program. So NASDAQ OMX is in great financial shape, strategically positioned, and we certainly look forward to the quarters to come. So thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day."]}}
